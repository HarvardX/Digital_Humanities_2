chrestomathia being a collection of papers explanatory of the design of an institution proposed to be set on foot under the name of the chrestomathic day school or chrestomathic school for the extension of the new system of instruction to the higher branches of learning for the use of the middling and higher ranks in life by jeremy bentham first published in      ii introduction by the editor mr bentham was one of the first to recognise the extraordinary improvement in the method of instruction developed by mr lancaster and modified and extended by dr bell the account of the results attending its application to the acquisition of language given by several eminent teachers from their own actual trial of it and more especially the statements of dr russel then headmaster of the charterhouse school and of mr pillans and mr gray masters of the high school of edinburgh appendix no   and   pp    and   —made a strong impression on mr benthams mind if it were true as stated by dr russel that since he had introduced into the charterhouse school books prepared on the simple principle of the madras system no boy had ever passed a sentence of which he was ignorant nor been flogged on the ground of his learning if it were true as stated by mr gray that since he had introduced this system into his school his whole class had gained a more extensive knowledge of the latin language than he had ever known on any former occasion that not a single boy had failed that it had enabled him entirely to abolish corporal punishment that it had animated his whole school with one spirit making them all advance in the intellectual career with the like ardour and though not with equal success without a single failure and that mr lancaster had put into his hands an instrument which had enabled him to realize his fondest visions in his most sanguine mood—if such results were obtained by the application of this instrument to the acquisition of latin and greek what said mr bentham may not be expected from its application to the whole field of knowledge are there not several branches to which it might be applied with still greater advantage than to language and is there one which does not afford the promise of at least equal success mr bentham thought that these questions must be answered in the affirmative and the great interest which he naturally took in this subject was strengthened by the desire expressed by some friends of his among whom were several statesmen and men of wealth that the experiment should be tried that a day school should be opened for the children of the middle and higher classes in which the principles of the new method should be applied not only to the teaching of language but of all the other branches of instruction which are ordinarily included in the curriculum of the highest schools with his usual ardour mr bentham immediately proposed that the schoolhouse should be erected in his own garden and that he himself should take a chief part in the superintendance of the school at the same time his opulent friends agreed to supply the requisite funds but these arrangements having been determined on mr bentham now saw that the most difficult part of the undertaking still remained to be accomplished it was necessary to bring out the principles of the new method more distinctly than had yet been done and to shape them into so many instruments each capable of being applied by ordinary hands to its specific use it was equally necessary to review the whole field of knowledge in order to ascertain to what branches of instruction these instruments might be applied with the greatest promise of success and to what if any their application should not be attempted the accomplishment of such a project was well calculated to call forth all the energies of mr benthams mind and he immediately applied himself to the work in the meantime this new school and the devotion of mr bentham to the development of the plan of it became matter of conversation among the philosophers statesmen and friends to education of the day the determination which had been come to to exclude theology from the curriculum of instruction on the ground that its inclusion would be pregnant with exclusion was also very generally discussed alarm was taken at the rumour of this omission and clerical influence was brought to bear upon the minds of some of the more opulent persons who had encouraged the project with the ultimate result of causing them to abandon it however he might regret the loss of support which had been so readily and confidently assured to him mr bentham was not on that account to be turned aside from his purpose he resolutely persevered in the completion of his part of the compact and hence although there is no school in the garden of queen square place yet we have the chrestomathia whatever other useful purposes may result from the intellectual labour which has been spent upon the production of these papers it will be found that they are capable of affording special and invaluable assistance to two different classes of persons first to him who is desirous of developing and strengthening his own intellectual faculties and of rendering his iii mind capable of making some progress in the field of original thought and invention and of extending the domain of science such a person should give his days and nights to the study of the instrument described in appendix p  0 —    and further illustrated in the work on logic p     et seq and to actual practice with it there is no intellectual gymnasium from exercise in which a powerful mind will derive so great an accession of strength secondly to him who is desirous of improving the character of elementary schoolbooks in the first number of the westminster review in an elaborate article written nearly twenty years ago on the chrestomathia after an attempt to show that for perfect instruction in all the physical sciences as well as in geometry algebra and language nothing is requisite but elementary books adapted to the new system the writer asks whether it be too much to hope that there are men of science whose benevolence will induce them to undertake a labour which humble as it may appear can be performed only by a philosophical mind which has thoroughly mastered the art and science to be taught can any scholar be more nobly employed than in writing such a book on language or any natural moral or political philosopher than in disclosing to the youthful understanding in the most lucid order and in the plainest terms the profound which are always the simple principles of his respective science since mr bentham wrote the perception in the public mind has become more clear and strong of the folly of consuming more than threefourths of the invaluable time appropriated to education in scraping together as milton expresses it so much miserable greek and latin by persons of the middle classes to whom it is of no manner of use to whose pursuits it bears no kind of relation who after all acquire it so imperfectly as to derive no pleasure from the future cultivation of it who invariably neglect it as soon as they are released from the authority of school and in the lapse of a few years allow every trace of it to be obliterated from the memory not only is it now generally admitted that the subjectmatter of instruction for these classes should consist of the physical sciences as well as of language but it is moreover beginning to be perceived that some advantages would result to the community from opening the book of knowledge to the very lowest of the people that everything which it is desirable to teach even the masses is not comprehended in the facts that there is a devil a hell a socalled heaven a sunday and a church but that there are things worthy of their attention connected with the objects of this present world—the properties and relations of the air they breathe the soil they cultivate the plants they rear the animals they tend the materials they work upon in their different trades and manufactures—the instruments with which they work—the machinery by which a child is able to produce more than many men and a single man to generate combine control and direct a physical power superior to that of a thousand horses there is a growing conviction that the communication of knowledge of this kind to the working classes would make them better and happier men and that the possession of such knowledge by these classes would be attended with no injury whatever to any other class the want of elementary books is therefore becoming every day more urgent nothing has yet been done to supply them and yet here in the chrestomathia there is a mine from which any competent hand might dig the material and fashion the instrument the comprehensiveness of the view taken by one and the same mind of every subject included in such a work as the chrestomathia cannot be expected to be equal nor were all the subjects treated of by mr bentham left by him in a state which he regarded as complete the papers which relate to geometry and algebra in particular appeared to require revision and the editor thought it right to place them for that purpose in the hands of a universally acknowledged master of these sciences after a careful examination of these manuscripts by this gentleman they were returned to the editor with the following observation—that although much has been done in relation to these subjects on many of the points treated of by mr bentham since the time at which he wrote or so shortly before it that he could not know of it and though his views of first principles were unmatured by the consideration of their highest results yet the publication of these papers without alteration or omission is still desirable as exhibiting many useful and several original trains of thought and offering many suggestions of which though some are imperfect and others obsolete the greater number may furnish matter for reflection even to those who have made the exact sciences more their special study than did mr bentham several passages in this work will appear obscure and a few perhaps unintelligible owing to the occurrence in the manuscript of some words so illegible that those best acquainted with mr benthams handwriting have been unable to decypher them the only liberty taken with the manuscript has been that of supplying in these comparatively few cases the best conjectural word that could be imagined it has been deemed a duty to publish these papers in the state in which mr bentham left them it being no part of the office of an editor to intermeddle with the thoughts and expressions of the author southwood smith london may          first preface to the first edition from the determination to employ the requisite mental labour in addition to the requisite pecuniary means in the endeavour to apply the newly invented system of instruction to the ulterior branches of useful learning followed the necessity of framing a scheme of instruction for the school in which it was proposed that the experiment should be made from the necessity of framing this scheme followed the necessity of making a selection among the various branches of learning—artandsciencelearning as well as languagelearning included from the necessity of making this selection followed the necessity of taking a comprehensive—howsoever slight and unavoidably hasty—survey of the whole field in the course of this survey several ideas presented themselves of which some had for some forty or fortyfive years been lying dormant others were brought into existence by the occasion and which appearing to afford a promise of being in some degree capable of being rendered subservient to the present design were—after inquiry among books and men—supposed to have in them more or less of novelty as well as use introduced though necessarily in a very abridged form into the present collection of papers they will it is hoped be productive of one effect—nor will it be deemed an irrelevant one—viz the contributing to produce—in the breasts of the persons concerned whethe in the character of parents and guardians or in the character of contributors to the fund necessary for the institution of the proposed experimental course the assurance that on the part of the proposed conductors howsoever it may be in regard to ability neither zeal nor industry are wanting and that having undertaken for the applying to this in some respects superior purpose according to the best of their ability the powers of the newly invented and so universally approved intellectual machine—their eyes their hearts and their hands will continue open to every suggestion that shall afford a prospect of being in any way contributory to so universally desirable an effect in regard to such part of table ii as regards the principles of the new instruction system though of the matter itself no part worth mentioning belongs to the author of the other parts nor to any person other than those benefactors of mankind whose title to it stands acknowledged by a perpetual chain of references—yet in respect of the arrangement which is altogether new and the compression which is studiously close—such is the convenience which it is hoped will be found derivable from the summary which though for an ulterior and somewhat different purpose is here given of it that—even were this the only use of that summary—the labour here expended though upon a soil already so rich would not it is hoped be regarded as having been altogether unprofitably bestowed second preface to the first edition in the table of contents to wit in that part of it which regards the appendix the number of articles mentioned will be observed to be ten of these no more than four can at the present conjuncture be delivered they have however been all of them written at least once over and the fifth which is longer than all the following ones put together is completed for the press and wants not much of being all printed the rest to fit them for the press want nothing but to be revised how long or how short soever may be the portion of time still requisite for giving completion to the work the purpose for which it was written admitted not ulterior delay in the publication of such part of it as was in readiness with   reference to the main purpose it may however without any very material misconception be considered as complete in what is now made public will be found everything that can be considered as essential to the development of the plan of instruction what remains is little more than what seemed necessary to give expression to a few ideas of the authors own relative to the subjects which will be found mentioned ideas so far as he knows peculiar to himself and which had presented themselves as affording a hope of their giving in different ways more or less additional facility to the accomplishment of the useful purposes in view time enough for their taking their chance for helping to recommend the plan to the notice of such persons to whom in the hope of obtaining their pecuniary assistance the plan will come to be submitted it has not been possible for him to get it in readiness but from the general intimation given of the topics in the table of contents may be seen what is in view and from the first preface together with what has just been said in this second what progress has been made in it whatsoever assistance it may be found capable of contributing towards the accomplishment of the general object thus much the reader may be assured of viz that if life and faculties continue everything that has thus been announced will be before the public in a few months and long enough before the course of instruction can have placed any of its scholars in a condition to reap any benefit that may be found derivable from it of this appendix no i is occupied by a paper there styled chrestomathic proposal in concert with the publicspirited men with whom the idea of the enterprise had originated it was drawn up at a time when it was thought that by the circulation of that paper such a conception of the plan might be afforded as might be sufficient for the obtaining such assistance as either from pecuniary contributions or from additional managing hands should be found requisite after the paper was printed in the form and in the place in which it will be seen intervening incidents and ulterior considerations having suggested various particulars as being requisite—some to be added others to be substituted—the task of drawing up a paper for this purpose was undertaken by other hands it will be seen however that the plan of instruction referred to being exactly the same what difference there is turns upon no other point than some of those which relate to the plan of management and even of these matters as contained in the more recent paper in question several will it is believed be found to receive more or less of explanation from the anterior paper which as above will be seen reprinted in these pages on the length of the interval—which between the printing of the preface and the sending to the press this supplement to it has elapsed—the author though he has the satisfaction of thinking the commencement of the enterprise has not been retarded by it cannot on his own account reflect without regret nor altogether without shame under this pressure his good fortune has however as will presently be seen brought to him a consolation superior to everything to which his hopes could have raised themselves the delay in question has had for its source the paper which in the contents of the appendix to this tract will be seen distinguished by no v iv and to which at the top of each page for a running title the words on nomenclature and classification or on the construction of encyclopedical trees—had been destined but came too late to be employed of the number of sections which it contains all but the   th had been completed for the press and all down to the   th exclusive been delivered from the press—when from a recent publication a passage of which what follows is a reprint was put into the authors hands in it the reader will observe—and from an official hand of the first celebrity—a certificate of difficulty indeed of something more than difficulty applied to the very work of which in and by this same   th section the execution has been attempted it will be found in volume i of the appendix to the new edition termed on the cover the  th and  th of the edinburgh encyclopedia britannica date on the cover december      it commences at the very commencement of the preface which has for its title preface to the first dissertation containing some critical remarks on the discourse prefixed to the french encyclopedie when i ventured says mr stewart to undertake the task of contributing a preliminary dissertation to these supplemental volumes of the encyclopædia britannica my original intention was after the example of dalembert to have begun with a general survey of the various departments of human knowledge the outline of such a survey sketched by the comprehensive genius of bacon together with the corrections and improvements suggested by his illustrious disciple would i thought have rendered it comparatively easy to adapt their intellectual map to the present advanced state of the sciences while the unrivalled authority which their united work has long maintained in the republic of letters would i flattered myself have softened those criticisms which might be expected to be incurred by any similar attempt of a more modern hand on a closer examination however of their labours i found myself under the necessity of abandoning this design doubts immediately occurred to me with respect to their logical views and soon terminated in a conviction that these views are radically and essentially erroneous instead therefore of endeavouring to give additional currency to speculations which i conceived to be fundamentally unsound   i resolved to avail myself of the present opportunity to point out their most important defects—defects which i am nevertheless very ready to acknowledge it is much more easy to remark than to supply the critical strictures which in the course of this discussion i shall have occasion to offer on my predecessors will at the same time account for my forbearing to substitute a new map of my own instead of that to which the names of bacon and dalembert have lent so great and so wellmerited a celebrity and may perhaps suggest a doubt whether the period be yet arrived for hazarding again with any reasonable prospect of success a repetition of their bold experiment for the length to which these strictures are likely to extend the only apology i have to offer is the peculiar importance of the questions to which they relate and the high authority of the writers whose opinions i presume to controvert in the abovementioned no v iv the experiment thus spoken of will be seen hazarded and to help to show the demand for it a critique on the map for which bacon found materials and dalembert the graphical form precedes it a critique penned by one in whose eyes the most passionate admiration conceived in early youth afforded not a reason for suppressing any of the observations of an opposite tendency which on a close examination have presented themselves to maturer age by an odd coincidence each without the knowledge of the other the emeritus professor and the author of these pages will be seen occupied in exactly the same task the one quitted it the other persevered in it whether both or one alone—and which did right the reader will have to judge for an experiment from which no suffering can ensue unless it be to the anima vilis by which it is made no apology can be necessary having neither time nor eyes for the reading of anything but what is of practical necessity the above passage contains everything which the author will have read in the book from which it is quoted before the number in question is received from the press to some readers—not to speak of instruction—it may perhaps be matter of amusement to see in what coincident and in what different points of view a field so vast in its extent has been presenting itself to two mutually distant pair of eyes—and in what different manners it has accordingly been laboured in by two mutually distant pair of hands to the author of these pages in the present state of things from any such comparison time for the instruction being past nothing better than embarrassment could have been the practical result for the departed philosophers had already called forth from his pen a load already but too heavy for many a readers patience on casting upon the ensuing pages a concluding glance the eye of the author cannot but sympathize with that of the reader in being struck with the singularity of a work which from the running titles to the pages appears to consist of nothing but notes had the whole together—text and notes—been printed in the ordinarily folded or book form this singularity would have been avoided but in the view taken of the matter by the author it being impossible to form any tolerably adequate judgment on or even conception of the whole without the means of carrying the eye with unlimited velocity over every part of the field—and thus at pleasure ringing the changes upon the different orders in which the several parts were capable of being surveyed and confronted—hence the presenting them all together upon one and the same plane—or in one word tablewise—became in his view a matter of necessity but the matter of the text being thus treated tablewise to print it over again in the ordinary form would it seemed have been making an unnecessary addition to the bulk of the work hence it is that while the notes alone are printed bookwise the text to which these notes make reference and without which there can be little expectation of its being intelligible must be looked for in the two first of the tables which will accompany this work—and which out of a larger number are the only ones that will accompany this first part of it hence it happens that on pain of not extracting any ideas from the characters over which he casts his eye the reader will find the trouble of spreading open the tables as he would so many maps a necessary one even this trouble slightly as it may be felt under the stimulus of any strongly exciting interest will—as is but too well known to the author from observation not to speak of experience—be but too apt to have the effect of an instrument of exclusion on those minds of which there are so many of which the views extend not beyond the amusement of the moment but as above whatsoever may be the risk attached to the singularity thus hazarded it has

exercises  0 notetaking the principal and most immediate use of this exercise is to serve as a test of intellection as per no   especially in so far as the nature of the subject admits not the application of the sort of organic test therein described but in it is included a certain species of composition and thereby a certain degree of invention it is therefore among the highest species of exercise a task for the due and effectual performance of which the maturest state of the minds for which the course of instruction here in question is designed will probably be found requisite correspondent didactic operations prescription and direction of this same exercise and inspection of the notes which are the result of it to one or other of these exercises mathetic and probative or both in one every possible mode of instruction applicable to intellectual instruction in general will it is supposed be found reducible and if it be true as supposed that there is not one of them which is not—and that with the full benefit of the bell instruction system—applicable to all the several branches of that learning enumerated in the course of this work the applicability of that system with a degree of advantage equal to what has been so universally experienced in the lower order of schools to those several branches when taught in the proposed chrestomathic school will it is hoped be found to be placed out of the reach of doubt    parsing in the exercise called parsing two distinguishable operations are supposed to be commonly included viz   indication of the grammatical relations which the component words of each sentence bear to another   indication of the grammatical rules by which the custom of the language in those particulars is expressed and conformity to that custom accordingly prescribed canoniphantic from a greek word signifying a rule and another signifying indication correspondent didactic operation prescription and direction of this same exercise and if performed in writing inspection of the result this same description applies to the several didactic operations corresponding to the several exercises herein aftermentioned    single translation this exercise wears a different character and is productive of different effects according as the vernacular language is or is not one of the two languages and if yes according as the foreign language in question is translated from or translated into    double or reciprocal translation this exercise wears a different character according to the diversifications mentioned in the case of single translation and according as literal conformity on the one or the other side or on both is or is not exacted    clarks exercise advantages attached to this exercise in comparison with translation into or composition in the foreign language with the help of a dictionary   saving of the time necessary to the finding out of the word   saving of the time naturally and frequently consumed in inaction or irrelevant reading in the course of the search   saving of the perplexity attendant on the choice between the several words presented by the dictionary a choice to which for a long time the pupil continues irremediably incompetent    metre restoring a verse being chosen by the master and the words thrown out of their order in such sort that they no longer constitute a verse this exercise consists in restoring them to their order to which purpose some acquaintance with the nature of the sort of verse and the rules of prosody    i e versification in general is necessary this exercise operates therefore as a test—not only of remembrance—but of intellection with regard to those rules    prosodial nonsignificant in schools this is called making nonsense verses accident will every now and then give to the nonsense the appearance of ludicrous sense to this exercise the metre restoring exercise may serve as an introduction it affords a certainty of success and saves the time that would otherwise be to be employed in the search of words by the shortness of the time requisite it would be in a particular degree well adapted to the present system see no    shortlesson principle whether it has anywhere been employed cannot here be stated the idea of it was suggested by that of clarks exercise    purelymetrical translation in this case the translation is into metre and may be performed from other metre or from prose the exercise being purely metrical the language is the same on both sides one of the westminster school exercises used to be—taking an epigram of martial or an ode of horace and translating it into some other of the species of verse to be found in the same books its objects are—  familiarizing the learner with the metre into which he translates   giving him a command of words in the language ii notes to the principles   scholarteacher principle the principle which consists in employing as teachers to the rest some of the most advanced and in other respects most capable among the scholars themselves—maximizing the use and application made of this principle i e giving to it the utmost extent capable of being given to it with advantage—raising it to a maximum in this maximization consists the only peculiarity and correspondent utility of this part of the system—advantages gained i saving in money every professional teacher would need to be paid no such scholarteacher needs to be or is paid ii saving in time under the inspection of one professional general master the whole number of scholars may be cast into as many classes as there are different branches of instruction and different degrees of proficiency in each each such class under the direction of its scholarteacher the instruction of all these classes going on at the same time iii increase in relative optitude   for securing the attention of a grown person in the character of teacher to such business especially in the case of those lowest branches which form the occupation of children but just emerged from infancy the nature of the case scarce admits of any other generally applying motive than fear viz the fear of losing the situation i e the provision annexed to it in it he can find neither instruction amusement nor except that fear any other cause of interest his attention is perpetually called off by such other ideas whatsoever they may be in which for the moment it happens to him to take an interest in the breast of the scholarteacher the honour and power attached to the function cannot fail of operating in the character of a reward of a reward the operativeness and sufficiency of which has been proved by an ample and uninterrupted body of experience instead of being so completely stale as in the other case the subject contemplated in this new point of view is not yet become so familiar as to have lost altogether the sort of interest which particularly in a juvenile mind is attached to novelty—especially coupled as it is with the situation of judge presiding on the occasion of the contest produced by the application of the placecapturing principle no  0   by his age and situation the juvenile and completely subject teacher is to a certainty and constancy rendered more tractable than a grownup undermaster can ever be reasonably expected to be on each point the grownup teacher is liable to have an opinion of his own and with it a will of his own contrary to that of his superior and employer to which will at any rate during the absence or inattention of such his principal it is in his power to give effect to the juvenile and subject scholarteacher this can never happen the    professional underteacher be his negligence or perversity what it may cannot be subjected to any other punishment than that of dismissal a punishment by the infliction of which it will frequently happen that the judge would be no less a sufferer than the delinquent iv by teaching others the scholar is at the same time teaching himself imprinting more and more deeply into his own mind whatsoever ideas he has received into it in the character of a learner taking of them at the same time a somewhat new and more commanding view tinged as they are with an enlivening colour by the associated ideas of reputation and of that power which has been the fruit of it the application of this principle is therefore not a makeshift occasionally employed as under the old system for want of a sufficient supply of grownup underteachers but an essential feature operating to the complete and purposed exclusion of all such naturally reluctant and untractable subordinates but the faculty of giving to this principle any such extension to advantage depends in no inconsiderable degree on several other parts of the system viz on the simplicity and thence on the shortness of the lessons as per no    on the extent to which the practices of repetition and responsion in terminis exercises no   and   can be applied to advantage and thereupon to the extent to which in the character of a test of intellection as per no    and    their checks viz the organic species of exercise and the notetaking exercise can be employed and in so far as responsion in purport is either extracted or received the allowance given to eventual appeal as per no    from the decisions of the juvenile underteacher to the master—the supreme and universal judge   contiguous proficiency principle on this sort of contiguity depends as hath just been seen no small part of the advantage which the case of the scholarteacher has over that of the grownup teacher but the higher advanced in the line of proficiency the scholarteacher is above his pupils the nearer does his situation approach to that of grownup teacher honour less power less gratifying instruction and amusement if any less and less at the same time what may not unfrequently happen especially in the case of the lowest classes is that at an age at which in respect of proficiency in learning he is ripe for the office the scholar is not so as yet in respect of the faculty of discretion or that of judicature so far as in respect of these latter qualifications a deficiency has place so far a departure from the contiguous proficiency principle may be found necessary   scholartutor principle the scholarteacher delivers the directions to the whole number of pupils in a class at once he presides over the probative and in particular over the recitative and responsive exercises nos   and   performed by all together under the spur of the placecapturing principle no  0—exercises by the performance of which the several lessons are said by the scholartutor assistance is in case of need afforded to some one other scholar attached to him for this purpose in the character of a private pupil during the several portions of time allotted for the getting of the respective lessons the local station of the scholarteacher is consequently a distinguished and solitary one that of the scholartutor is a social one just by the side of his pupil the less the degree of general capacity on the part of the pupil the greater is the degree of the like capacity needful on the part of the occasional assistant on this principle it is that the operation of pairing is performed suppose in one class eleven scholars and to each a different degree of capacity for this purpose ascribed he who has eleven degrees is paired with him who has but one he who has ten degrees with him who has two he who has six degrees remaining single   scholarmonitor principle of this office—an office of indispensable necessity in all large schools upon the ordinary plan—little or no need will probably be found on the plan of architectural construction prescribed by the panopticon principle no   by which every human object in the whole building is kept throughout within the reach of the headmasters eye masters timesaving principle the managing master is but one to the number of the scholarmasters there are no limits but what experienced convenience dictates whatsoever can be equally well done by any one or more of them his time would be very ill employed in doing or endeavouring to do general inspection and direction is the business which must be done by him and cannot be done by any one else whatsoever time is by him employed on any other business the danger is lest it be taken from that which is necessary to the performance of his peculiar business as above   regular visitation principle the operation of this sort of tribunal is an advantage which a school instituted and supported by contributions possesses in comparison with an ordinary school by the schools carried on under the superintendence of the society called the national society it may in general be expected to be possessed in a degree more or less considerable according to local circumstances by the chrestomathic school it may reasonably be expected to be possessed in a still superior degree the superiority of which will be proportioned to the ulterior interest possessed by the conductors in this case in addition to that possessed by the superintendants in that other case but the means which the visiters be they who they may have for the execution of their trust to advantage and with effect depend almost altogether upon the principles nos             respecting    evidence the good effects producible by the judgment which on each occasion they pronounce and the arrangements which they make in relation to what is to be done are completely dependent upon the knowledge which they possess upon the information which they have received concerning what has been done   punishment minimizing principle   reward economizing principle two intimately connected principles both of them of cardinal importance may be seen in the idea and practice of setting up these results in the character of ends or objects to be aimed at these together with the several maximizing principles nos                                and the several promissory principles nos        0       may be considered as so many branches of that allpervading principle so peculiar to this system by which perfection on every point the idea of it having been conceived is represented as capable of being and therefore as being what ought to be obtained to give effect to these two principles is the object and effect of the four others which in this same division follow them facility of delinquency inapplicability of reward uncertainty of the forthcomingness of evidence and thence of the application of whatever of punishment or reward may be intended to be administered—as those several quantities increase so does the quantity i e the intensity or duration of the punishment necessitated in proportion as any of these quantities decrease so if nothing be wrong in the system of judicature may the quantity of punishment denounced and applied always understood that punishment is no punishment unless supposing it inflicted the suffering produced by it is in the eyes of the person under temptation greater than the enjoyment expected from the offence by the application made of the inspection principle no   and the scholartutor principle no   the facility of delinquency is in all its shapes nearly done away by the short lesson principle no    the pain of labour and thence the pleasure afforded by delinquency in the shape of idleness is minimized by the placecapturing principle no  0 reward to the welldoer is rendered so far a constant accompaniment of the gentle punishment brought on the offender by the offence by the principles respecting evidence nos             operating in conjunction with the inspection principle all uncertainty respecting evidence is done away as to reward but for the apparent paradoxicality and antisentimentality instead of economizing minimizing would in this case as in the case of punishment have been inserted for perfectly free donations excepted never can the matter of reward be obtained to pour into one bosom but at the expense of suffering however remote and disguised inflicted upon others neither in power in dignities in honours—no nor even in simple reputation will any exception be found to this rule therefore it is that in a government though tyranny may exist without profusion profusion cannot exist without correspondent tyranny   inspection principle in the bellinstruction system in general in virtue of the scholarteacher c principles nos       and the masters time saving principle no   with or without locomotion on the part of the master this object it may be reasonably supposed is nearly accomplished though in so far as concerns inspection by the master the degree will naturally be less and less in proportion as the schoolroom is more ample and by that means drawn out into length by the panopticon principle of construction security in this respect is maximized and rendered entire viz partly by minimizing the distance between the situation of the remotest scholar and that of the masters eye partly by giving to the floor or floors that inclination which to a certain degree prevents remoter objects from being eclipsed by nearer ones partly by enabling the master to see without being seen whereby to those who at the moment are unseen by him it cannot be known that they are in this case in the chrestomathic school this plan of construction is of course to be employed  0 placecapturing principle on the occasion of the saying of a lesson whatever it be the scholars by whom that same lesson has been got are placed or are kept standing or sitting in one line straight or curved as is found most convenient with an understanding that he whose place is at one end of the line is considered no matter on what account as occupying at the time the post of greatest honour the one whose place is next to his the post next in honour and so on the highest scholar as above begins to say the lesson in case of an error the next highest on giving indication of it takes in pursuance of an instantaneous adjudication the first place which the sayer of the lesson is in punishment for such his delinquency adjudged to lose failing the next the next but one and so on to the lowest by this means the intellectual exercise be it what it may is like most of those corporal exercises in which youth are wont to occupy themselves for mere amusement converted into a game punishment attaching instantaneously upon demerit and by the same operation reward upon merit and in both cases without further trouble or expense in any shape    appeal providing principle viz from scholarmaster in any one of these his three characters publicteacher privatetutor and monitor for this appeal the principal and indeed almost sole demand will be found to be that which is capable of being constituted by the application of the placecapturing principle no  0 especially where on the occasion of the probative exercise to which it    is applied either no fixt verbal standard of reference as per no    is employed or where this sort of standard being employed literal conformity to it is not exacted the greater the latitude allowed to performance the greater the room for error and suspicion of error in whatsoever judgment may happen to have been passed upon it    scholar jury principle advantages   the master stands hereby preserved in a great degree if not altogether from the suspicion of partiality and tyranny   by the necessary solemnities by which the application of the punishment is thus preceded the attention of the scholar is more firmly fixt upon it and the idea of it rendered the more impressive   the scholars are at this early age initiated in the exercise of the functions of judicature as well as in the knowledge of what belongs to justice while the love of it instils itself into their breasts   the tendency so natural amongst persons of any age subject to coercion to unite in a sort of standing conspiracy against those by whom they are kept under that pressure is counteracted and diminished    progress registration principle    comparative proficiency principle every lesson being taken from some determinate book the designation of every exercise is performed and perpetuated by reference made to that part of the book which has been the subject of it on each day of the lessons which on that day have by the several classes been got and said together with the organic exercises no    if any which have been performed the designation is given by entries made in the aggregate register and at the same time the name of each scholar present or absent belonging to each class together with the rank which as the result of the placecapturing contest no  0 of that day or the last on which he was present has remained to him in his class the comparative proficiency register contains a distinct head for each scholar it exhibits for any portion of time the class he has belonged to and thence as above the lessons which in that class he has got and said and the organic exercises which he has performed and the rank which putting all the days together he has occupied in such his class thus his account is formed by copying from the aggregate register and summing up the numbers expressive of the rank which he has been found occupying on the several days included in the term the less the sum the higher of course his rank taking the whole of the term together if for a certain length of time he is at or near the top of the class it will be a sign that he is quite or nearly ripe for removal to a higher class and in the meantime that he is to a certain degree qualified for lending assistance upon occasion in the character of prirate tutor as per no   to a classfellow whose degree of proficiency as indicated by the same document is in a correspondent degree inferior to his own and in like manner in proportion as the sum is large the correspondent and opposite indication is afforded thus it is that this register forms the basis of the application made of the scholartutor principle no   as well as of the appositeclassification principle no  0    delinquency registration principle    delation exacting principle by the aggregate progress register no    so far as concerns such transgressions as are of a purely literary cast the balance formed by the sum of the several acts of transgression compared with that of the correspondent manifestations of merit stands recorded and upon this plan of instruction and construction as per no   seldom indeed in any other than a literary shape can delinquency find entrance by a person in whose eyes an offence which he feels himself under the temptation of committing is sure to be immediately followed by a punishment the sufferance of which is sure to be greater than the enjoyment from the offence the offence will not be committed in an edifice in which nothing can be done that is not at the same time certainly by an under master and probably by the head master seen while doing scarcely will any forbidden act be committed punishment eventual punishment must notwithstanding be appointed otherwise mere sport and wantonness would as well as idleness suffice for the production of offences but in such a state of things a punishment of the slightest kind and degree imaginable will it is evident suffice the bare assurance that his name will in the character of that of a delinquent be made to stand upon the face of a durable and more or less extensively published register may in the instance of almost any human being old or young as experience in confirmation of theory testifies be depended upon as being in such a situation of itself a sufficient punishment at the same time for appearance sake bodily uneasiness in this or that slight shape may stand appointed and with the less scruple on account of the moral certainty of its being seldom if ever about to be inflicted as to the universal delation principle under dr bells system every scholar especially if acting in the character of teacher tutor or monitor is responsible i e punishable for every instance of delinquency of which it having been committed in his view or otherwise within his knowledge he has omitted to give information to the master and where the heaviest punishment that can be the result of such information is but as a feather such therefore will this obligation be light as under that system it cannot but be even where the scene is an ordinary schoolroom—in a schoolroom in which as per no   everything is no sooner done than seen it will be still lighter    proficiency promising principle performance it may here seem is everything promise of itself promise without performance  0 nothing true if without performance but it is the nature of promise to operate as a security for performance hence the laying it down as a rule that no scholar shall be considered as incapable of imbibing the instruction which is administered is itself a most important principle it operates as an engagement upon all concerned true it is that if without blame on the part of the engager the fulfilment of the engagement were liable to be defeated or even if by reason of blame on his part it were to a certain degree of frequency likely to be defeated the engagement ought not to be administered but that under the bellinstruction system such fulfilment is in every instance in the masters power—is a truth indicated by theory and confirmed by experience by this principle such perfection is pointed out as a producible and therefore exigible result so far as concerns the already established lower stages of instruction it stands confirmed by every publication which the subject has produced of its extension to those higher stages which are included in the great grammar schools proof will be found in the letters of mr pillans and mr grey mentioned or inserted in the chrestomathoscopia or its appendix in the remaining principles belonging to this division nos from    to  0 may be seen the several means immediately operating towards so desirable an end    nonconception presuming principle by this principle as brought to view in the works of dr bell reference is made to a practice which among masters is so natural and is said to be so common—viz to keep repeating on each occasion their instructions instead of taking the earliest opportunity for ascertaining whether by the pupil in question these instructions have been comprehended but under the bellinstruction system and in particular under the extended application here proposed to be made of it—  in the first place the matter of instruction being throughout determinate and in print the demand for such intermediate discourse on the part of the master will hardly have place—  in the next place no discourse in the form of instruction being admitted but that the most efficient tests of intellection as per nos  0       such as the nature of the case admits of are provided and applied to it—the danger of transgression and the consequent demand for application will in the instance of this rule be proportionably inconsiderable and   the greater the number of the scholars learning under the direction of one headmaster the fuller the assurance that by the perception of impracticability under the warning given by this principle he will be kept from the attempt    perfect performance exacting principle in this may be seen one of the necessary means without which the engagement taken in virtue of no    cannot be fulfilled it will itself be seen to have for its true principal and most immediate supporters the short lesson principle no    and the apposite classification principle no  0 by the short lesson principle provision is made that the earliest i e the least difficult lessons shall be so easy that the dullest capacity cannot fail of comprehending them or the slowest fail of learning sooner or later to perform them i e to get them within the allotted length of time by that probative species of exercise the uniform application of which is prescribed by nos    and    under the influence of the placecapturing principle no  0 it will by means of the indication afforded by the progress and comparative proficiency registration principles nos    and    be seen how soon under the spur of the placecapturing principle no  0 the scholar is become sufficiently perfect in his performance and till he is so perfect be his age what it will he will in virtue of the apposite classification principle be kept in that same class without advancement to a higher continuing to be thus taught until he has learnt  0 gradual progression principle the use of this principle is to operate as a sort of memento and thence—in the first place on the part of the planners of the system of exercises in the next place on the part of the masters by whom they are to be applied and carried into effect—to render the transition—from an exercise easier and lower in species or degree to the next succeeding exercise—as gradual and as it were as insensible as possible of the degree of regard paid to this principle—of this as of every other material circumstance—information will be given to visiters as well as masters by the progress register no    supposing the rule transgressed the wider and more frequent the instances of transgression the more manifest will they be rendered viz in the first place to the scholarteacher by means of the numerous transgressions manifested under the placecapturing principle no  0 on the saying of the lesson—in the next place to the visiters as well as to the master by means of the sudden downfall of one or more of the scholars whose rank had till this time been among the most advanced    adequate recapitulation principle in so far as the substance of any antecedent lesson is forgotten especially when the remembrance of an antecedent is necessary to the intellection of a subsequent lesson the time employed in subsequent ones will have been expended with little fruit and progress and proficiency will be more apparent than real as it stands here the use of the principle is—to serve as a memento the application of it must depend partly on the nature of the branch of learning in question partly on the nature of the exercise in this view the most favourable state of things is that which has place in so far as between what has gone    before and what comes after the connexion is so intimate that a subsequent lesson cannot be said or got but in proportion as an antecedent lesson is remembered for its antagonist and necessary check this memento has that which is conveyed by a succeeding principle—viz the needless commoration excluding principle no       placecapturing probative exercise maximizing principle and    literal conformity maximizing principle on the constancy of the application made of the correspondent probative exercise by which a lesson is said depends all the use derivable from any mathetic exercise by which that same lesson is supposed to be got on the effect produced by the exciting and invigorating influence of the placecapturing process no  0 depends in a prodigious degree the effect of every probative exercise in the greater number of schools of the higher class no use at all is made nor indeed for want of a sufficient number of scholars in a class can be made of the placecapturing process no  0 in no one school is the use of it maximized in the chrestomathic school it will be maximized but it is only in so far as it is performed with reference to a verbal standard—and that prescribed in terminis—literal conformity to that standard being at the same time exacted—that the process can be employed to the best advantage in this case the only danger is absence of adequate intellection but against this danger provision is here made by the organic exercise principle no    and the notetaking principle no    in so far as application is made of the literal conformity principle the function of scholarmaster is capable of being exercised by any scholar to whom the verbal standard employed on the occasion is legible hence the more extended the application made of this literal conformity principle the greater the extent to which the scholarmaster principle no   is applicable with the most unquestionable advantage mr lancaster seems to have been the first if not the only person to whom this advantage has presented itself in so strong and clear a point of view applied to arithmetical exercises the text of the verbal standard is by him styled the key lanc improvements p       organic intellection test principle for the importance of maximization in this case see no    while delineating the objects of the several sciences with their concomitant and correspondent arts the pupil at the same time makes proof of the proficiency he has attained in the science and improves himself in the imitative art    notetaking principle by this exercise no art except that of writing being practised no such composite proficiency is produced as in the case last mentioned but in the character of a test of intellection it is not only applicable to an extent to which in respect to the magnitude of the field of instruction there are no limits but wheresoever applied it stands free from those limitations which apply to the graphic art even in the application to the mechanical part of the art of writing it is not without its use being though frequently at the expense of beauty conducive to despatch being of so purely intellectual a nature—a species of extempore composition—it is among the highest and consequently latest exercises which under such a system as the present can with propriety be exacted    selfservice principle this principle is in its nature the same with the organic exercise principle no    but in its application extended to those operations which though themselves not belonging to the art in question yet being subservient and accessary preliminaries to the exercise of it have been in use to be performed by hands other than those of the scholars themselves examples—in the case of writing mending the pen ruling the paper in the case of drawing adjusting the pencil and other instruments employed in ordinary schools to save the trouble of teaching these subservient operations are frequently performed by the master or his adult assistants in the bellinstruction system a point is made of including them in the system of instruction and causing them to be learnt and performed by the scholars for themselves but the expense produced by spoilage during the teaching is a counterconsideration which must not be neglected here instruction and pecuniary economy are at variance and some how or other a compromise will be to be made    task description principle this principle may be considered as a particular application and exemplication of the one just mentioned those given under that former head belong to the class of manual this to that of vocal exercises by the practice of thus proclaiming on the occasion of each fresh lesson according to a prescribed rule a description of the lesson last said and of the lesson about to be got one or both reference being had to their respective places in the book from which they are both taken the scholar learns to fix his conceptions of the objects with which he has to do and to give clearness to the ideas which he abstracts from them    tabular exhibition principle the allcomprehensive object is to maximize the quantity of useful instruction imbibed in this receptacle during the allotted time towards the accomplishment of this object by the aggregate of the several exercises mathetic and probative taken together everything is endeavoured to be done which can be done every portion of time to be occupied which can be occupied by the performance of prescribed exercises remain however some fragments of time for the occupation of which no prescribed exercises can serve these are in the case of all the scholars the moments intervening between the entrance of each scholar and the commencement    of the process of instruction and the moments intervening in like manner between conclusion and departure and in the case of the quickest conceptions the moments intervening between the time actually employed in the getting of each lesson and the end of the whole length of time allotted to the getting of it of the sum of all these moments is constituted the quantity of free time during this time the business is so to order matters as to afford the best chance at least that in the instance of each scholar this portion of free time shall spontaneously be filled up by some occupation that shall be conducive to the universal end for this purpose the principle prescribes the following rule— rule—whatever part of the interior of the building is exposed to the view of the scholars keep it covered with the matter of instruction in some shape or other viz in the shape of verbal didactic discourse in print or graphical imitations or in some instances the things themselves at the very earliest stage biographical charts historical charts and maps will in this way be coming into use even at this stage tabular views of the fields of some of the branches of learning exhibiting their principal divisions—botany and zoology in particular—may with advantage be kept in view provided always that every occasion be taken for illustrating the verbal description by graphical imitations    distraction preventing principle neither in respect of the quantity of regulated time nor in respect of the quantity of free time as above will this design of useful occupation be carried into effect any farther than all other sensible objects such as if admitted would afford to the moment a more attractive and thence a distractive occupation stand excluded for this purpose the principle affords the following architectural rule—by height or otherwise so order the windows that so far as such exclusion can be made consistent with the admission of a sufficiency of light no object exterior to the building shall be visible in any part of it occupied by the scholars to this rule attention seems to have been not unfrequently paid in the construction of schoolrooms  0 apposite classification principle if the class in which the scholar is placed is not high enough for his attainments his advancement is not so rapid as it might be and in this shape in this instance perfection fails of being attained if too high for his attainments the case is much worse whatever be the subsequent and more advanced train of instruction to his possession of which this or that article of antecedent instruction which he has failed of possessing himself of is necessary all this is so much lost to him in respect of all this he is by this prematurity of advancement condemned to remain in ignorance of the aggregate progress and comparative proficiency registration principle nos    and    one good effect is as hath been seen the furnishing in so far as the evidence so afforded is looked at and applied to the purpose the most complete security against the opposite but widely unequal mischiefs just described in an ordinary school the number of the classes being generally fixed and the boundary lines between class and class also fixed being determined by the nature of the exercises removal from a higher to a lower class is regarded as a serious disgrace thence as a tremendous punishment and consequently not employed but under the notion of serious and obstinate delinquency after a certain length of stay nonadvancement is considered nearly in the same light fit or unfit having learnt everything or having learnt nothing sooner or later every scholar is accordingly advanced this same bad effect—will it not therefore have place under the new system no because under this system the hold which each scholar has upon the class which but for the removal he belongs to is from first to last understood to be as loose as the hold which under the operation of the placecapturing principle no  0 he has upon the place which for the same moment he occupies in the class moreover a scholar belongs to as many classes at the same time as there are different branches in which he receives instruction put back in one he may at the same time be advanced in another and at any rate the idea of degradation—utter and complete degradation—is not produced by his being put back in any number of those branches short of the whole    short lesson principle the longer the lesson is the longer must be the time allowed—allowed to all—for getting it and the less strong the assurance that it will be gotten by that time as in a fleet the pace of the slowest vessel so in a class the pace of the dullest scholar is necessarily the pace of the whole if the lesson be of such a length that upon calculation an hour is in that way requisite for the getting it here is a whole hour which by any number of the scholars may be consumed in idleness and that before the deficiency is discovered if the length be no more than ten minutes and this under the bell instruction system is the maximum thus much shorter is the maximum of idleness for that time not that under the sense of the at any rate so nearly approaching moment for saying the lesson—and that under the spur of the placecapturing principle no  0—a yoke mate in the character either of scholar tutor or scholar tutors pupil being all the time at the scholars side—any such roluntary inaction ever does or can take place but between the conclusion of the time allotted to all alike for the getting of a lesson and the time which by the quickest minds is actually found needful for the getting it there will aways see tabular exhibition principle no    be an interval not occupied in any exercise and    upon reflection it will be found that the magnitude of the sum of these unoccupied intervals will naturally be not directly but inversely as that of the number of the lessons the shorter the lesson is the easier it will be to ascertain and thence to retrench any superfluity in the quantity of the time which may in the first instance have been allotted to it    simultaneous action principle for the use of the promise see no    during the performance of the probative exercise i e during the saying of the lesson under the operation of the placecapturing principle no  0 the simultaneity is the necessary effect of the exercise while some one is employed in saying his part of his lesson all the rest of the class are employed in watching him for the purpose of making their advantage of his transgression    uninterrupted action principle during the whole of the schooltime the scholars are all of them employed either in simply mathetic in simply probative or in organic i e matheticoprobative exercises—in getting lessons saying lessons or in drawing or writing the subjects of lessons in passing from one such exercise to another no interval worth mentioning need or will take place the organic exercise will be performed and the transition from one exercise to another effected under direction given by words of command as no    or visible signals no       word of command principle    visible signal principle the application of words of command to school instruction appears to have been the invention and that a highly useful one of mr lancaster bernard p     as saving noise the visible sort of signal in so far as applicable is manifestly preferable it is only however by audible and not by visible signs that in such a situation perception and attention can always be made sure of    needless repetition prohibiting principle being obstructive of despatch the imperfection thus designated belongs to this place in the character of a memento the principle may serve as an antagonist to and check upon the recapitulation principle no       memoriter metre principle in affording assistance to the memory the use of metre—whether according to the nature of the language with or without rhyme—is pointed out by theory and amply confirmed by experience no reason can be assigned why this assistance should be refused to any branch of learning the cause why as yet it has been confined to languagelearning and principally if not exclusively to the dead languages is—that on the revival of literature instruction being nearly confined to those at that time most instructive languages the ingenious men who for the use of nonadult and nonselfdirecting minds afforded their assistance to languagelearning were not in a situation to carry it any farther but according to the persuasion by which the present plan has been governed there exists not that branch of useful intellectual learning which may not with full as good effect as languagelearning be administered to the juvenile mind long before its arrival at the selfdirecting state    employment varying principle in proportion as exercises are varied each affords relief and operates as a sort of recreation or play with relation to every other in the bell instruction system confined as in its application to art and science it has hitherto been within such narrow limits the indication of the advantage attached to such a diversification might require to be held up to view in the way of memento under any such extension as the one here proposed it will take place of course    distinct intonation principle  0 syllabic lection principle    unreiterated spelling principle    stammering—repetition prohibiting principle the names here ventured to be assigned to these several principles

those of his followers no demand for it has been left by balbutient is meant a species of stammering every such disorderly repetition being considered as a transgression is of course punished as such and thus presently corrected under the spur of the placecapturing principle no  0    psammographic from two greek words one of which signifies sand the other writing or belonging to writing the advantage attached to the use of sand consists not merely in its cheapness but also in the facility with which characters may be traced in it at an age too early for the use either of pen or pencil add the superior magnitude which may conveniently be given to the characters and the alacrity produced by the comparative freedom which it affords to the feeble and as yet untaught hand see bernard p   0 the principles if such they may be called belonging to this division dr bell distinguishes from the rest by the less imposing name of practices inferior to all the other principles in one sense of the word extent viz as designative of the number of the branches of instruction to which they are applicable they are in relation to some of those principles superior in a still more important sense of that same word viz as designative of the number of the persons to whom the benefit of that instruction is capable of being imparted the use of the word principle is to serve as a common appellative and thence as a common bond of connexion for every efficient cause by the operation of which it is supposed that the accomplishment of the common end—the communication    of useful intellectual instruction—may be promoted with the word exercise it is here connected by exhibiting in the character of a principle the intention to employ or bring to view as capable of being with advantage employed as a means to that common end this or that species of exercise so many species of exercise so many principles over and above those which have no such immediate application to exercises as to the operations to which as above the common name of practices has been attached by dr bell they seem to consist of certain improved modes of performing the sorts of exercises by the performance of which the arts of pronunciation reading and writing are acquired if this be so as many of these modes as are distinguishable from each other so many correspondent articles may in this way be added to the catalogue of principles—intellectualinstruction serving principles in relation to several particular branches of art and science several such principles chiefly consisting in the suggestion of as many exercises besides those of which intimation is given in the course of this table have at different times presented themselves to the author and among them some the expected utility of which has received confirmation from private trials but the time it seemed was not yet arrived in which they could with propriety be added to and as it were put upon a level with the contents of a whole system of principles the utility of which has received such ample confirmation from experience appendix no i chrestomathic proposal being a proposal for erecting by subscription and carrying on by the name of the chrestomathic school a dayschool for the extension of the new system to the higher branches of instruction and ranks in life i occasion of this address the matchless excellence as well as novelty of the new instruction system is a matter too universally recognised to need mention in any other way than that of simple allusion of its applicability to the higher not to say the highest branches of intellectual instruction the fullest persuasion is over and over again expressed in the works of its illustrious inventor whose anticipations have in every point received such ample and undisputed confirmation from experience in common with so many others the proposed conductors or superintendents undermentioned had for a long time been entertaining the wish not unaccompanied with the expectation of seeing in some mode or other and by some means or other so desirable an extension carried into effect meaning of course on the ordinary terms and by professional hands and that too in respect of the extent of the field of instruction upon such a scale as would be suited to the efficiency of the novum organum now placed within the reach of human industry and the amplitude of the prospect opened by it to the public view upon a more attentive consideration it appeared however to several of them that for a first experiment of this kind more requisites were necessary than could naturally be looked for in any single hand or even in any number of hands uniting together upon any such ordinary ground and of this conception the result has been an association entered into by them for this purpose ii proposed conductors—who not to speak of probity and pecuniary responsibility—qualities of which though both are so indisputably requisite yet neither can in such a case as the present be spoken of as appropriate a commanding acquaintance with the whole field of that intellectual instruction the communication of which is the object of this design a detailed acquaintance with the several distinguishable component elements and sources of public welfare the great and universal end to which all art all science all language is or ought to be directed husbandry manufactures trades money and in particular with the practical details of trade as carried on in that vast metropolis from which almost exclusively the destined partakers of the proposed benefit can for some time be expected all these various endowments will at first view present themselves if not as being in every instance indispensably necessary at any rate as being eminently desirable all these endowments in common with the whole public in the most essential instances and with an ample portion of it in every other instance the members of the association the proposed conductors had the satisfaction of seeing united in their whole body a satisfaction which upon inquiry or without need of inquiry an ample share will be received by every individual who either in the character of proposed patron of the institution or parent or guardian of a child to which the benefit of it is proposed feels any interest in the design the person by whom without the communicated    desire of any one of them and without the privity of any more than one this paper has been drawn up and sent to the press has not nor can have the honour of being of the number he may therefore with the less difficulty and reserve speak of the title which on this occasion and to this purpose they will every one of them be found to possess to the requisite public confidence iii primary requisite a schoolhouse proposed to be built by subscription in the nature of the case the first requisite on which everything depends and in the nonexistence of which the chief cause of retardation may be found is a schoolhouse an appropriate schoolhouse and that in its dimensions of an amplitude suited to that magnitude of scale on which not only in respect to cheapness and extent but in respect of efficiency the new instruction system so essentially depends for the attainment of this requisite a pecuniary advance and that to no inconsiderable amount was obviously necessary and for this purpose the proposed conductors all presently agreed to become contributors in such proportions as should be suited to their respective circumstances and convenience at the time of the commencement of the expense an agreement which was the more readily entered into by reason of the assurance they all saw reason to entertain that whatever should be there bestowed would be no more than an advance of which the reimbursement which was all that by any of them has ever been looked for or will be accepted might not unreasonably be depended upon on condition of a few years patience it is for the completion of the sum requisite for this purpose that the present proposal is put into circulation iv proposed field and plan of instruction this proposal has for its accompaniment a collection of papers drawn up by a friend to the proposed institution who though declining to take any part in the management has in this manner as well as by his contributions manifested his desire to see it carried into effect these papers have for their general title chrestomathiá and for their design the giving a view of the field and means of instruction proposed for the proposed chrestomathic dayschool partly for the sake of compression partly for the accommodation of any persons who may be disposed to look into it with attention the main body of this sketch is comprised in two synoptic tables digested into the form of text and notes in table i the matter is arranged under the following general heads viz advantages from learning as such as well as from learning in the particular shapes here in question stages of instruction grounds of priority in relation to the branches herein included and grounds of omission in relation to branches not included in table ii under the two following viz i principles constitutive of the new instruction system considered as applicable to the several ulterior branches of art and sciencelearning languagelearning included ii exercises by the performance of which such learning is obtained or obtainable in the instance of these principles by means of the simultaneousness of the view which as above is given of them the connexions and dependencies of the several parts of the admirable whole will it is hoped be the more readily observed and correctly and completely comprehended on these considerations in the instance of this last mentioned table this happening to be the first of the two that was completed the whole matter notes as well as text was in the first instance brought together and compressed into one side of a single sheet and in this form copies to a considerable number have been printed off observations however having been made that while by the unavoidable closeness added to the smallness of the type it could not but have been rendered afflictive to many an eye it was by its still unavoidable bulk rendered in no inconsiderable degree unwieldy and formidable another impression has since been printed off in which the text alone is in the tabularform the accompanying notes being in the ordinary bookform and in this manner alone—viz text in the tabular notes in the bookform—has table i been printed to the principal matter as contained in these two tables other papers are added in the form of an appendix the contents have for their object partly a statement of some of the promises of ulterior success which are already known to have been furnished by experience—partly a view of some ideas which to the hope of utility are supposed to add in some degree the character of novelty and which such as they are the present design has been the means of calling forth v site for schoolhouse secured a requisite the procurement of which might naturally have presented still greater difficulty than any that is expected to attach upon the raising of the comparatively moderate sum necessary for the expense was a spot of ground sufficiently adapted in respect of situation as well as extent to the purpose of serving as a site for the erection but this difficulty they have the satisfaction of declaring to be already removed vi females proposed to be received—why their wish being as above to give to so great a benefit and that in every direction the utmost extension in their power the female    sex could not fail of being comprehended in their views in the whole of the proposed field of instruction as marked out in the abovementioned paper scarcely will there be found a spot which in itself custom apart will not be in respect of the information presented by it alike useful to both sexes some parts and more especially those which concern domestic economy and the care of health as applied to the more delicate sex and to both sexes at the time of life during which they are almost exclusively subject to its care will even be found more useful to females than to males by an experienced as well as eminently intelligent disciple of dr bells it is mentioned as a wellknown fact that girls are more docile and attentive than boys and that accordingly in that part of their schooltime which remains after subtraction of that which is applied to occupations appropriated to their sex the degree of proficiency which at the end of the year they have attained is not inferior to that which in the whole of that same schooltime has within that same period been attained by the boys in the case of the middling classes to whatsoever other branches of instruction the labour of female children be applied needlework will certainly not be regarded as one that can be omitted and though for the practice of this art there would remain several hours of the fourandtwenty yet what may naturally be expected is a general wish to see some portion of the schooltime allotted to such works dancing music—by these fascinating words are presented two accomplishments the possession of which will by all that belong to the higher classes be regarded as indispensable and by many of those that belong to the middling as being if not indispensable at the least desirable for neither of these it is evident can any place be found in the proposed school for uniting its benefits with those accomplishments there remain therefore but two expedients viz the deferring of the accomplishments either to a later hour or a later age vii number proposed to be built for under the national institution the number built for in the westminster free school is observed to be  000 viz for males  00 for females  00 the same total viz a thousand is in case of a sufficiency of funds the number here proposed to build for in case of a deficiency the number built for must of course be proportionably reduced as to expense £ 000 they observe to be stated as the expense of that building furniture as well as lodging for master and for mistress included that same sum it is presumed may be made to serve equally well for the here proposed schoolhouse according to the indications afforded by experience the above number of  00 is understood to be generally regarded as the greatest number that in one and the same schoolroom can be taught under the constant inspection of one and the same master but on the plan on which it is here proposed to build it will be evident that whatsoever be the dimensions of the apartment in which that number can be sufficiently inspected by one person several such apartments containing each of them as much room as in that case will in this case be inspectable by one and the same person and that in a manner still more perfect than in that other case moreover in this same place though no part of the room allotted to females will unless at some special time or by special recorded order and for special reason be open to the view of any person stationed in the part allotted to males yet by means of a slight alteration any redundancy in the quantity of room allotted to either sex may be applied to the supply of any deficiency which in consequence of an increase beyond the calculated demand may be found to have place in the quantity originally provided for the other considering that in the case of the westminster free school a thousand was in the judgment of the national society as large a number as it was advisable to build for and this although the class of scholars in view composed so much larger a portion of the juvenile population than that from which any scholars could be looked for to the proposed dayschool a conclusion which may be liable to be drawn is that in and for the here proposed school no number so large or nearly so large as the above can reasonably be expected but in the case of that free school free as it was and is limits were set to the probable number of scholars by several circumstances none of which will in the present instance be found to have place on the part of the parents insensibility to the advantages of intellectual instruction inattention to the future and lasting welfare of their children inability to spare the time necessary to the conducting of the children for the first part of the time to and from the school especially in the case of those whose abodes are in a considerable degree distant from it in the present instance to obviate as far as may be the latter difficulty an expedient which the proposed conductors have in view is to comprise in one sitting the whole quantity of the school time and by that means reduce to its minimum the time and attendance consumed in the passage between school and home in the westminster free school the total quantity of school time—in the season of longest light six hours in the season of shortest light five—is divided into two portions with an interval of one hour between the two in    private schools however instances are not wanting in which without any interval the children are kept under instruction for so long a time as six hours to so great a length the proposed conductors are somewhat afraid to stretch it but to such a length as five hours they expect not to find any conclusive objection one circumstance they look to as a source though not of immediate yet in case of success of eventual increase to the population of the proposed school against any such undertaking as that of a boarding school to be carried on or commenced under their own management or even superintendence their determination is decided but in case of success a result which they cannot regard as by any means an improbable one is that parents situated at too great a distance to admit of their sending their children from their own residences may for the purpose of taking benefit of the instruction there and there only to be obtained find for their children in the residence of some relative or other particular friend or even of some person who may be disposed to afford the accommodation on the ordinary commercial terms a residence sufficiently near to the schoolhouse to admit of their receiving the instruction which it affords on this plan it is that to the great public schools scholars are sent from the remotest parts of the three kingdoms and should it appear that in the proposed new school useful instruction in much greater variety as well as quantity is to be had than in any of those old established ones and that too in much less time and by every scholar without exception instead of by no more than a portion more or less considerable of the whole number they see not why in the present instance an equal if not superior afflux may not sooner or later be expected a circle of about two miles radius having the site of the school for its centre is the space from the whole of which on condition of keeping the length of schooltime undivided they regard themselves as entitled to look for scholars and that without any change made for this purpose in their place of residence viii ages looked for at entrance and departure fourteen is the age at or before which they hope to see their intended course completed by the scholars in general in all its branches and this too upon the supposition that seven and no earlier is the earliest age at which children will be sent to take the benefit of it fourteen that being the age at which it is common for apprenticeships to commence for though no such views are entertained as that of confining the benefit to such children as their parents may have destined to apprenticeships yet it would be altogether repugnant to their wishes if any child so destined should on any account find himself excluded from it the seven years reckoning from seven to fourteen is the length of time within which as above they expect to see the aggregate course completed and as a ground for that expectation one of their endeavours has been to collect from the various education and intellectualinstruction establishments in which instruction on any of the proposed subjects of the proposed scheme of instruction is administered public schools universities hospitals public institutionrooms and private lecturerooms not excluded—an account of the number of hours actually occupied in each and this to the end that the sum of the times so expended in all of them together may be compared with the sum of the times capable of being allotted to the same subjects in the proposed school and though of the information desired on this ground the whole has not as yet been obtained yet enough has been obtained to enable them and with the requisite degree of confidence considering the experienced force of the new instrument with which they will have to work to speak of the above proposed length of time as being fully sufficient viz for the aggregate of all the courses according to the plan exhibited in the accompanying sketch matters being at the same time as far as may be so arranged that at several different stages the scholar may take his departure without leaving his instruction imperfect in relation to any subject in which he has begun to receive it when seven years was thus looked to as the probable duration of the aggregate course the occupation had however for its basis the supposition that at that age in the situations in life in question scholars might in general be found already in a sufficient degree instructed in those branches to which in the free schools at present established the new instruction system is applied but consistently with that principle of universal comprehension which they could not but adopt no child whose parents being desirous of obtaining for it a share in the benefit were able and willing to pay for it at the necessary price could by the conditions of the undertaking be excluded by this consideration it is that they have been led to the persuasion which they entertain of the necessity of comprising in their plan those arts of primary necessity and continual and universal application viz reading and writing and common arithmetic which are comprehended in the new instruction system in so far as already brought into practice to this determination an ample confirmation has been observed to be afforded by the observation made and repeatedly brought to view by dr bell himself and which is no more than upon an attentive consideration of the case might from the first have been previously expected viz that in any of those arts an imperfect degree of proficiency obtained by instruction administered in the ordinary mode operate rather as an obstacle than as a help    to an useful foundation for instruction administered in this incomparably more advantageous mode learning in the improved mode having to an undefinable degree for its necessary preliminary the unlearning what has been learnt in the other ordinary and ordinarily imperfect mode of one rule the necessity is by the bare mention of it rendered indisputable and that is not to admit or continue to receive any child who whether on account of immaturity of age or on any other is so circumstanced as to require in the schoolroom more care and attendance than the quantity of each which is at the command of the establishment can supply as on so many other occasions so on this a rule which while it thus bears on the face of it its own reason and thereby its own explanation is applicable with equal propriety to every individual case included in it they cannot but regard as preferable to any rule in which by means of fixt and inflexible quantities invariable provision is in the procrustes style made for indefinitely varied exigencies in the barrington school at durham at an age as early as three years the new instruction system as is to be seen in the instructive and interesting account for which the public is indebted to sir thomas bernard has been found applicable with advantage and if at an age still earlier any child should be offered to the reading and writing form of the chrestomathic school there seems no reason why it should be rejected on any other ground than that of an exclusion put upon it by the irrational rule just mentioned ix this but an experiment—expected sources of continuance and extension the proposed undertaking being but an experiment the period which the proposed conductors look to as that of the completion of the experiment is the time at which the whole of the proposed field of instruction as marked out in the chrestomathia shall have been travelled over by the whole number of such of the scholars as have gone through the aggregate course at that time if not earlier the expectation of the proposed conductors is that such of them as are then alive will have the satisfaction of beholding a number of fit persons willing and in every respect well qualified each of them by himself to take the whole of the business out of their hands well may it be—and this was the very consideration by which the association was produced—well may it be that at present any such undertaking is too great considerably too great for any single individual accordingly the engaging in no inconsiderable number as well as variety a set of masters for the administering of the instruction in the several branches is among the measures the necessity of which is in full view but at the period here in question scholars by dozens and by scores may not unreasonably be expected to have learnt in the chrestomathic school all the things whatsoever that will have there been taught viewing the matter at large whatsoever it be that a large number of persons have themselves learnt supposing it well learnt some proportion or other of the number will by that same time be not altogether unqualified to teach but at the period in question under the new instruction system the scholars—no inconsiderable proportion of them—not only may reasonably be expected to be qualified to teach what they have learnt but during a length of time more or less considerable antecedent to that of their departure from the school will actually have been employed in this same allcomprehensive work at this time if in point of legal maturity of age as well as in all other points any one of them should be found competent to such an undertaking so much the better but even if in respect of those requisites the school should not happen to afford any individual who was at that time competent yet if so it were that in point of intellectual maturity as well as appropriate proficiency any one such scholar should be found sufficient the temporary legal deficiency might as under the care of the already established societies find an adequate supply in the assistance of some trustworthy friend x terms of contribution c for the erection fitting up and furnishing of the schoolhouse with the necessary outbuildings and other outworks the following are the terms and conditions on which the contributions of wellwishers are solicited—   contributions to be in shares of £ 0 each   by any person any number of such shares may be subscribed for several such shares are subscribed for by each of the above proposed conductors   for every such share interest at the rate of   per cent shall eventually be allowed as per article      of the money received as per article   after defraying charges as per article   together with house expenses and pay to master mistress and paid teachers the whole surplus except such as shall be deemed necessary to be kept in hand for the contingencies of the year shall in the first month of every year be invested in government securities to serve as a sinking fund for the reimbursing to subscribers in equal proportions the money respectively advanced by them such reimbursements to be made each time by instalments of  0 per cent so soon as the aggregate of the money so applicable shall have risen to that amount   any sum of less amount than a share will if offered be thankfully received but whether by itself or added to the amount of a whole share on no such additional sum will    it be understood to be expected that interest or unless required at the time of the advance made reimbursement money shall be paid   upon the amount of their respective contributions the proposed conductors of the institution reserve to themselves in the shape of interest and reimbursement money the same advantages as and no other than those which as per articles   and   are promised to all other contributors   of the schoolmoney to be required the exact amount cannot as yet be fixed four pounds is at present looked to as a minimum eight as a maximum the amount must of course be different according as in the terms of the undertaking the expense of slates pens books ink paper maps charts and other implements of instruction together with the hire of such as need not or cannot be purchased is or is not included in general parents would it is presumed be desirous of seeing themselves at a certainty in regard to this and every other expense   with or without subscribing for shares another mode in which encouragement may be afforded is—by an engagement to send to the school for and during a specified length of time in the event of its being opened one or more scholars in this way with or without sending a child of his own any person of opulence may by engaging for the child of another confer at one and the same time a public and a private benefit at one and the same expense   to afford to contributors and eventually to parents and guardians the assurance that the undertaking will not be hastily abandoned—for the term of the first three years to be computed from the time when the parents or guardians of any number of scholars not less than fifty shall have signed an engagement to pay at such rate as shall at that time have been fixed for and during such time as shall have been fixed for the schooling of their respective children the proposed conductors engage jointly and severally to carry on the proposed school and in case of loss to charge themselves with such loss  0 for this purpose so soon as the schoolhouse with the appurtenances shall be in readiness for the reception of scholars notice of such readiness will be given by advertisements in the london daily papers a space will be provided in which without interruption to the business subscribers and parents of scholars being recognised as such by recollection of their persons or by transferable tickets which will be given for that purpose will have a perfect view of the whole business of the school as it is going on if from any persons at large any admissionmoney be accepted the amount will be no more than may be judged necessary to keep out noisomeness and mischievous wantonness and will be applied to the use of the institution as above article      of all moneys received and the disposition made of them accounts will be published yearly or oftener and at any rate within the first week of each year in some one or more of the london daily papers appendix—no ii successful application of the new system to languagelearning in the case of the great school called the high school edinburgh as reported in a letter to mr fox from james pillans esq rector of that school from the report of the british and foreign school society anno      p    you will not expect that i should detail the difficulties i encountered in establishing and applying the monitorial system to the business of my class nor the steps by which i have been rising up to the present moment from one degree of efficiency to another to do so would extend my letter to an immoderate length and though it might be interesting and not unimproving to a person engaged in the same occupation it would be a fitter subject for vivâ voce communication with him since i entered on my office scarce a week has passed without suggesting some improvement in my arrangements all tending to one point viz to stimulate and employ to purpose the various faculties of two hundred boys differing widely both in acquirement and capacity to insure attention by excitements at once strong and honourable and to exclude that languor and listlessness arising partly from want of motive and partly from the physical misery of being so long in a sitting posture which most of us may remember to have been the great sources of the unhappiness we experienced at school the branches of knowledge taught in my class the boys of which are in general somewhere between twelve and fourteen years old are latin greek and ancient mixed with a little modern geography the greek and geography are happy innovations of my predecessor for the school by its foundation is entirely for latin and dr adams introduction of elementary greek in      was violently opposed by no less a man than dr robertson the historian i mention this circumstance because it will account for the unreasonably  0 small proportion of time given to these two important objects in the latin class which meets at nine every morning consisting of very nearly two hundred boys the general business of the day subject to variation according to the period of the season and progress of the pupils is as follows—a portion of a latin poet from thirtyfive to fortyfive lines of virgil horace c and a nearly equal portion of livy cicero or sallust are to be parsed and translated a portion of dr adams grammar alternating daily with his antiquities is examined upon these lessons have been all prescribed that is the last word mentioned but no assistance given the day before the order of business is this immediately after prayers at nine the whole class forms into twenty divisions under their respective monitors in the great hall and the cicero and horace lessons are construed by the nine boys of each division the duty of the monitor being   to take care that every boy shall construe a portion of the new lesson   to see that his division understand the syntax and construction of the passage   to take care that the right meaning be always given to the passage in all its parts and   to mark on a slip of paper the names of the boys who fail in saying the grammar lesson is also said to the monitors the boys of each division on the other hand are instructed to note any false interpretation which the monitor may allow to pass and reserve it for an appeal afterwards when this construing and saying have been got through the signal for removing into the classroom being given the divisions which have hitherto been arranged in the recesses of the windows of a large hall move in regular and rapid order up stairs and take their seats in the general class where whatever is said is addressed to all the boys i then proceed to ask if there be any appeals i e if there be any boys who think they can prove that the monitor has allowed an erroneous translation to pass uncorrected in the division from four to a dozen boys generally rise in succession and if they make good their point they take place each in his division of those who have not observed the blunder and the monitor himself loses a place this system binds both monitor and pupil to careful preparation at home the former from the fear of detection and exposure by a boy far below him in the class the latter both by the infallible certainty of his being called on to say and reported if he fail and by the honourable desire of rising in the class and proving that he knew the lesson better than the monitor further advantage of the liberty of appeal is that it generally brings forward into discussion the difficult passages for it is these of course that are appealed upon and they being settled beforehand a more perfect understanding of the lesson is secured and the necessity of saying it over very frequently is avoided sometimes i vary this mode by making the monitors themselves i e the twenty highest boys construe one or both lessons each to his own division who are all on the alert to detect a blunder with a view of making an appeal whether the monitor or division is to construe is always a secret till the moment before they begin when i give out from the pulpit the order of business after the appeals are concluded the lessons are construed to me by boys whom i call at random generally by some of those who have failed below stairs these i know from the bills or slips of paper which by this time are collected from each monitor strung on a wire and subjected to my inspection in this translation questions are put by the master on points of geography history antiquities derivations of words and niceties of construction and expression and a freer and more elegant version is required every opportunity is also taken suggested by the classical passages to give useful information and to insinuate moral and religious instruction this with the examination on adams antiquities which i always reserve for the general business occupies the remaining time till eleven when there is an interval of an hour and is resumed from twelve till a quarter or twenty minutes past one when the divisions form to construe the lessons again with this difference that instead of a literal a free translation is expected and all the information and illustrations which have been given in the course of the day are expected now to be forthcoming at the question of the monitor and the places depend upon their aptitude in answering the written exercises of which there are generally two per week are of various kinds chiefly translations from latin into english and from english into latin which are also examined and corrected by the monitor who makes his remarks and adds his initials that he may be responsible the best and worst are shown up and places determined accordingly the exercises for the higher parts of the class are latin verses occasionally english verses analyses or abridgments of what authors they have read in the class in english and in latin c and these are shown up to the master directly and corrected by him select passages of the classics are said by heart on saturdays to the monitors in the first instance that every boy may be called on and they report the failures in the business of the division the monitor has the power of putting a boy up or down according to the figure he makes always subject to an appeal from his decision to the master if the boy thinks himself aggrieved the greek class according to the arrangement i found in the school met only three hours aweek i have lately contrived to assemble it an hour every day except saturday the business here is more elementary consisting of accurate saying by heart of a    portion of greek grammar and minute parsing of a short lesson in dalzels analecta minora the more advanced part of the class read homer and xenophon in order to remedy the inconvenience of having so short a time for greek it is proposed as a voluntary exercise to the higher boys to read and show up every second monday what are called private studies that is if a boy after preparing all the lessons thoroughly finds he has still some leisure time he employs it in reading homer without a translation making out what he can and what he cannot marking as difficulties to be resolved on the day appointed he mentions the number of lines he is ready to be examined on and states his difficulties for solution which is given either by the master or by some of his schoolfellows who have conquered them in this way and with no other stimulus but having the number of lines read by each publicly mentioned and obtaining an hours play there are boys now in the class who are in the habit of showing up from nine hundred to twelve hundred lines within the fortnight the greek class consists of about one hundred and fortyfive and the lessons are said here too by divisions the greek monitors generally remain for twenty minutes at eleven and it being then ascertained that they are masters of the lesson they hear and report on their divisions from two till half after two when the lessons are heard up stairs and the monitors dismissed sometimes a little before three as a reward the geography class meets on tuesdays and thursdays at two oclock the course of instruction in this branch is  st to give some illustrations of the general facts with regard to the solar system then to go over pretty rapidly the geography of the four quarters taking merely the outlines and lastly to descend to minute and particular descriptions of the countries bordering on the mediterranean from gibraltar by france italy greece shores of the baltic asia minor c back to the straits then the british islands ancient and modern geography are united a sketch or outline of each country is drawn by the master on a black board with white chalk the mountains are represented in green and the rivers in blue in this state the board is first presented to the pupils and the master with a rod explains the physical features of the country points out and names the leading ranges of mountains and the rivers that fall from them the board as yet presenting so little detail the eye and the mind through the eye readily takes in and retains the information at this stage also the length breadth longitude latitude and boundaries are fixed the next lesson presents the towns drawn thus ‡‡ in pink chalk which are to be found on the rivers already learned descending from the source to the mouth these towns are demonstrated by the master in the same way care being taken to mention at the time some striking facts respecting the situation inhabitants history or neighbourhood of each which may be associated with its name and position on the board having thus made out a sort of skeleton or framework of the country by presenting in striking relief without those details which confound the eye in maps the great physical features the next object is to mark out in dotted lines the artificial divisions and when these are well fixed the remaining towns of importance whose position is not indicated by rivers are referred to the province or shire and associated again with those already known the situations of great battles are pointed out by a cross in red chalk the object being to make a strong impression on the eye and to set the imagination and conception to work the chalks being of different colours is a circumstance not to be despised when the boarddraught is thus completed maps are directed to be so constructed as to be as nearly as possible copies of it that is all the positions c accurately laid down but no names given the drawer of the map must be quite au fait in naming every place in his own sketch and if it be thought deserving of that honour it is mounted on thick pasteboard and hung up in view of his schoolfellows he is employed too as monitor to teach the geography of his own map to other boys who have either done worse maps or none at all and thus in many ways the information he has got is riveted in his memory the book used for the geography class is dr adams summary but as from its size and multifarious contents it is better adapted for reference than committing to memory i have printed for the use of the class a few pages of outlines containing a mere list of names arranged on the plan i have explained and this being in their hands serves to recall the information conveyed appendix—no iii successful application of the new system of instruction to languagelearning in the case of one of the classes of the high school edinburgh as reported in a letter from mr james gray master of the class to edward wakefield esq   th dec      the following details will i fear be found uninteresting but their results are so important that i trust you will excuse a little dulness while i endeavour to develop the plans of tuition lately adopted by some of the masters of the high school edinburgh it will be unnecessary to state that the practices alluded to are founded on the system of mr lancaster modelled according to the circumstances of our seminary the essential part    of that gentlemans discovery is i apprehend that by which the more advanced or cleverer boys are employed in teaching or in assisting in their tasks their inferiors in years or in knowledge and this principle is acted upon here in its fullest extent many misconceptions have gone abroad in regard to this celebrated plan which it is of vital interest to have removed   the first and most pernicious of these is that it is only applicable where great numbers of the lower classes of children are to be taught by the same master gratis or at a low rate   another is that where schools have been previously established either by law as the parochial schools of scotland or on a foundation changes are not only unnecessary but might be dangerous it is besides unfortunate that many schoolmasters seem to consider the lancasterian system as an innovation which they ought to regard with a jealous eye till these prejudices are eradicated from the minds of parents and teachers the advantages derived from the plan will be partial and inconsiderable in my opinion many more beneficial consequences will result to the interests of education from introducing it into the schools already existing than from establishing new ones for it is not to be dissembled that evils have long existed that admit of no other cure i shall take as short a view as possible of the practices in common use contrasting them with the new i ground my remarks on a full and impartial experiment and in making them to you i have no other view but the interests of the youth of my country for many years past these have been the subject of my nightly dreams and my daily meditations to them i have more than once sacrificed my health and even risked my life and nothing shall deter me from speaking the truth suppose a class to consist of a hundred boys which i shall take as the average number though in our school it is under the truth in the old way one boy was called upon to repeat a small portion of the lesson to whom all the rest were understood to be listening thus we proceeded till every boy in the class or as many as could be overtaken were examined and this plan would have answered well enough had it been possible to fix the mind of every individual upon the same subject at the same moment but such is the volatility of the youthful mind that i have ever found this impracticable you may confine the body to a seat you may perhaps fix the eye to a book but you can never be certain that it is not an unconscious gaze and it is not unlikely that while the boy ought to be mentally construing his lesson his imagination is chasing a butterfly or robbing a birds nest on this system i have experienced two unavoidable evils   the one is that the upper boys who gain a knowledge of the lesson soon after they enter the schoolroom cannot be kept still while the master is employed in teaching the under boys and as example is contagious the restlessness soon becomes universal   the other is that while the upper boys are construing the under ones are generally trifling and when the lesson comes round to them are totally ignorant of it they not unfrequently calculate upon the chance of escaping altogether from the impossibility there is for any one man thoroughly to examine a hundred boys in two hours for we never continue longer in school at any one time and next meeting brings a new task thus both the upper and the under boys are injured the one do not gain all the profit which they might from a more judicious management the other make little or no progress and from the habitual neglect of their duty contract a dislike both to their tasks and their teachers in many cases it would be well if the evil ended here for there is reason to fear that the hours that ought to be employed in the acquisition of useful knowledge will be spent in habits dangerous to virtue that indolence will shed its mildews over the blossoms of early talent which may wither never to bloom again or that the man will have to struggle hard to supply the deficiencies of the boy i am far from saying that the evil is universal according to the present system many boys spring forward in the pursuit of knowledge with an alacrity and success that is quite astonishing but if of an hundred boys twenty fail in the object for which they are sent to the school any scheme that might ensure their success ought to be eagerly embraced this may be done effectually on the new system by which i have been enabled so to arrange my class that every boy is employed every minute of the time he is in school either in the acquisition or communication of knowledge the fifteen highest boys are monitors the first thing to be done after the meeting of the class is to see that they have their lessons distinctly when this is ascertained the whole class goes into divisions in this way fifteen times as much work can be done in the same space and i can say with confidence fifteen times better from this contrivance instead of the languor and restlessness that too frequently prevails all is activity and energy more noise indeed is heard but the sounds are sweet for they are the sounds of labour every one studies because by the exertion of his talents he finds himself equal to every task and ignorance is more shameful where the account is to be rendered to one of his own years than to a man it seems indeed that boys are better qualified to teach boys than men they enter more readily into their feelings they are more sensible of the difficulties which they themselves have just mastered and will adopt more simple and familiar modes of illustration nor have i ever had cause to suspect the diligence or fidelity of a monitor to attain this station is an object of rising ambition to the whole class and where any one has risen to it he    is too much afraid of losing it to risk the disgrace by his own misconduct i have never once found it necessary to degrade a monitor for inattention to his division to this there is a double check an appeal is open to the division against the monitor as well as to him against the division and when every boy has gone over the whole not a portion of the lesson i examine a number of them promiscuously and the lessons are said with so much more promptitude and accuracy than in the old way that i am frequently enabled to examine as many as if no time had been spent in divisions at all thus i have united the advantages of both methods by this means every boy in the class besides the benefit accruing from saying over the whole of every lesson till he has satisfied his monitor is separately examined by me two or three times aday the superiority of this mode over the other is incalculable as it tends to store the mind with useful knowledge to infuse a love of learning to form habits of industry and to render the whole economy of a school delightful both to scholars and master of my present class that has been conducted on this plan all have gained a more extensive knowledge of the latin language than i have known on any former occasion and not a single boy has failed this till now i did not think possible for many years it had been a subject of melancholy reflection to me why so many boys failed in acquiring a competent knowledge of classical learning while they succeeded in everything else this objection to our classical schools may now be easily obviated i do not say that every boy will be equally successful nature has made strong and marked distinctions in the extent of capacity but i will venture to assert that every one may be made to turn his talents to the best account one of the most important of the objects of a good education is to inspire a literary taste and i know no way in which this can be done so effectually what deters many boys from the prosecution of ancient learning is its difficulty by aid of the lancasterian system asperities may be smoothed the boy may be gently led over the threshold of the temple and when he is once introduced he cannot fail to be charmed by its beauties i have never indeed known a young man who pursued learning that did not love it this bias to literature is of more value than all the knowledge he earns from school it is the shield of the young mind against the ruinous inroads of vice in a school so regulated it is impossible for any boy to spend his time idly he must exert himself he readily does what he finds he cannot escape and what may have been irksome at first soon becomes pleasant he is happy from a consciousness of doing his duty and habits are formed that will be useful through life to the master the task of superintending such a school is delightful he is merely the helmsman that steers the bark under perpetual sunshine while every man on board is at his duty corporal punishments are abolished this practice is equally degrading to the scholar who suffers and to the master who inflicts punishment and i firmly believe has done more mischief to our classical schools than all other causes whatever the boy soon considers the man whom he sees in the daily use of the torture as a tyrant and his greatest enemy and all his ingenuity will be exerted in inventing the means of retaliation a great objection to this mode of discipline is that from its very nature the master applies to it with reluctance and for one fault that is punished twenty escape thus the hope of impunity begets disorder which when it comes to a certain height in its turn brings punishment on the new method the boys are kept in constant good humour and no irritation is ever excited in the mind of the master there exists between them only a reciprocity of kindness and docility to animate a whole school with one spirit to make them advance in the intellectual career with the same march of mind to stimulate them to exertion by the enlivening power of emulation to exalt them in their own opinion has always been my object in the discharge of my public duties and mr lancaster has put into my hands an instrument by which i have been enabled to realize my fondest visions in my most sanguine mood this is a testimony that i think due and i cannot withhold it i have the honour to be dear sir yours faithfully james gray appendix—no iv essay on nomenclature and classification nomenclature of the main branches of art and science—its imperfections—with proposed remedies systematic table prefixed by dalembert to the french encyclopedia—its imperfections—specimen of a new one section i plan of this essay deplorable it surely is and to a first view at least not less extraordinary that for some of the most extensive and most frequently mentioned divisions of the field of art and science even at so advanced a stage as that to which the human mind has already reached in its travels on that field no tolerably expressive denominations should be to be found in the appropriate part of language of language—meaning of course the one which is here made use of and which will    not be denied to be one of the best cultivated languages which the present time affords nor in this particular will the present state of any other language be found it is believed much more favourable that this unaptness has really place in the language that real and practical inconveniences are among the actual results of it and that although not perhaps completely susceptible it is however not altogether unsusceptible of a remedy such are the positions which it is the object of the following pages to present to view but on the part of the intellectual subject or object in question—viz the nomenclature of the aggregate body of the arts and sciences in other words the system of encyclopedical nomenclature—this unaptness in what does it consist—answer in this viz that the nomenclature in question is not either in the degree in which it is desirable that it should be or in the degree in which it is capable of being made to be subservient to those useful purposes to which an instrument of this sort is capable of being rendered subservient in respect of any such useful purposes to what immediate cause will any such failure on the part of the subject in question be to be attributed—answer to its being deficient in respect of one or more of those properties which ere it can be in a complete degree rendered subservient to those same useful purposes it is necessary that it should possess in so far as in any degree it fails of being possessed of those same properties and thereby of being capable of being rendered subservient to those same purposes it will be found chargeable with certain correspondent imperfections or points of imperfection to these several imperfections if in the correspondent purposes there be anything capable of entitling them to any such appellation as that of useful it cannot but be desirable that correspondent remedies should be applied what then are they respectively those purposes those properties those imperfections and if any such there be those remedies to find such answers as can be found for this string of connected questions is the object of the ensuing pages to a disquisition of this sort inserted in such a work as the present one very obvious objection presents itself this is—that it is too abstract and abstruse too logical too metaphysical or by whatever other epithet for the purpose of condemnation it may happen to it to be designated—too abstruse for the generality of readers even of those by whom a course of education of the literary cast carried on upon any of the customary plans has been completed for this objection however an answer—which it is hoped will be found neither in point of fact incorrect nor in point of argument irrelevant—is in equal readiness at the conclusion of the chrestomathic course it will not be too abstruse for the comprehension of a chrestomathic scholar what is there in it that even to these striplings should render it too abstruse is it the nature of the subject those parts excepted which respectively regard general ontology and pneumatology—subjects which for reasons already intimated it has been found necessary to forbear including in the course—no one of all the subjects touched upon in it can be pointed out which will not have been rendered altogether familiar to their view is it then the language from which for giving expression to some of the leading ideas words have been borrowed not to speak of its being the language constantly and universally drawn upon for such purposes long before the scholars are arrived at this concluding stage this same language will in their eyes have been stripped of all its terrors of those appellatives for which custom has concurred with abstract convenience in resorting to a dead and foreign language the interpretation will here be found all along subjoined and in this very interpretation may the scholars long before the conclusion of the course have found matter for one of their exercises true it is that as there has so often been occasion to observe a hard word—a word belonging to a family of words of which no other member is as yet known constitutes in every field over which it hangs a dark spot a spot to which no eye among those in which it excites the notion which that word is employed to express can turn itself without giving entrance to sentiments of humiliation and disgust but at the time in question to the eye of a chrestomathic scholar in no part of the whole expanse of the field occupied by this sketch will there be any such thing as a dark spot to the original darkness light will in every instance have been made to succeed such is the objection and such the answer here however if not before comes another question of such an exhibition where is the use but to a question of this sort in the present instance at least the answer will obtain a much better chance for being satisfactory if postponed till after the thing itself has been brought to view concerning which it is asked what is the use of it section ii purposes to which a denomination given to a branch of art and science may be applied—viz ordinary and systematic properties desirable in it with a view to these purposes ordinary and systematic applied to the purpose which in the giving a denomination to a branch of art and science has been in view these adjuncts will it is supposed be found tolerably explanatory of themselves ordinary purpose the presenting to view the contents of the particular branch which it denominates systematic the purpose which is in    view where the denomination in question is one of a number of denominations brought together in such manner as to exhibit to view certain relations which the several branches so denominated and thereby their respective contents bear to each other relations for example of agreement and diversity or relations of dependence accordingly for the designation of the purpose just described by the name of the ordinary purpose the term nonsystematic might with equal propriety be employed from the purposes to the accomplishment of which it is directed follow the properties which it is desirable it should possess i on the part of the denomination in question for both the abovementioned purposes the two following properties may be stated as requisite   of the contents of the branch of art and sicence which it denominates it should present to view—to the view of as many persons as possible—a conception as clear correct and complete as by and in the compass of a single denomination can be afforded   by this means in relation to every less extensive branch of art and science that can be proposed it should obviate the question—whether within the compass of the more extensive such less extensive branch is or is not included it should obviate this question—i e in case of doubt it should furnish the means of removing it or what is better prevent the rise of any such doubts ii for the systematic purpose the following is an additional property which presents itself as requisite it should i e the denomination should be so constructed as in and by its conjunction with other denominations to display upon occasion and that in as clear correct and complete a manner as possible the several relations which it bears to the several other branches of art and science included in the same system the relations viz in respect of identity of properties on the part of the respectively contained particulars on the one hand and diversity of such properties on the other that so in the instance of every branch of art and science comprehended in the system it may to the greatest extent possible be apparent in what particulars they respectively agree with and in what they differ from each other† by these means and by these alone—on these terms and on these alone—is any conception that has been framed delivered received or entertained of the whole system of arts and sciences the whole encyclopædical system as it is called capable of being rendered a clear correct and complete one thus and in this way is shown not only identity in so far as identity but diversity in so far as diversity has place in this way therefore is performed in regard to each branch of art and science that and more than that which is performed by algebra in regard to numbers the wonders exhibited by that mysterious art by what means is it that they are wrought only by showing in each individual    instance the identity which has place as between the import conveyed at the outset by those extraordinary signs which as the instrument of its discoveries it employs and some one or other of the always manifest imports conveyed by those ordinary signs of which common arithmetic makes use by the mutual lights which these words are thus made to reflect upon the import of each other—by this means is and by this means alone can be conveyed in relation to the subject which they are employed to bring to view the maximum of information the greatest quantity of information capable of being brought to view in and by the number of words thus employed the maximum of information in the minimum of space section iii imperfections incident to a denomination of this sort viz   unexpressiveness   misexpressiveness correspondent to the properties which it is desirable that a denomination attached to any branch of art and science should possess are the imperfections of which it is susceptible an imperfection will be imputable to it in so far as by failing to possess any one or more of the abovementioned properties it fails of being applicable with advantage to one or more of the abovementioned purposes imperfections exhibited by this or that one of the several denominations considered by itself imperfections exhibited by the whole assemblage of them taken together considered as a whole—to one or other of these heads will all such imperfections it is believed be found referable unexpressiveness and misexpressiveness—to one or other of these two heads it is believed will be found referable all such imperfections of which any such denomination taken singly and considered by itself will be found susceptible the purposes to which it is desirable that a denomination of the sort in question should be capable of being made subservient have just been brought to view in so far as it simply fails of being subservient to those purposes it is unexpressive simply unexpressive of the name employed for the designation of any branch of art and science the design and use is to convey a conception as correct and complete as by so narrow an instrument can be conveyed of the nature and to that end thereby of the subject or subjectmatter of that same art and science and this in such sort as when and as often as in relation to any subject that happens to be proposed a question shall arise whether it does or does not belong to the branch in question to suggest a true and clear answer either on the affirmative or on the negative side if instead of simply failing to convey any such instructive conception it does indeed present a conception but that conception altogether foreign to the subject and thereby in so far as it is actually entertained erroneous and delusive then it is that instead of being negatively and simply unexpressive it is positively misexpressive be the subject in its own nature what it may—and on the other hand the name applied to it what any one will—true it is that in the course of time the name how completely unexpressive so ever and even misexpressive will become expressive to this observation no denial or so much as doubt can be opposed and hence it is that by names in the highest degree not merely unexpressive but misexpressive the functions of names are performed the purposes which are in view in the use of names to a certain degree answered if the misexpressive name in question be a name by which when first brought to a mans view the branch of art and science in question is presented—much more if it be the only name by which it is ever presented to him—on this supposition a question it must be confessed altogether natural is of this supposed original misexpressiveness what if any is the inconvenience at first mention continues the argument true it is that the conception it presented was by the supposition an erroneous one but moreover by another part of the supposition the conception which has at the long run come to be conveyed by it conveyed to the very person in question is a correct one for by this name it is that whatsoever conception he has cause to entertain of the subject has been conveyed to him and in point of fact by names originally as unexpressive as can easily be imagined have conceptions no less correct than those which have been conveyed by the most expressive names actually as it will be easy to show been conveyed plausible as it is to the objection opposed by this question an answer which it is believed will be found no less plain and clear than decisive and satisfactory presents itself   in the first place by the supposition a length of time there is during which instead of the subject of which it is desirable that it should convey the conception the subject which it actually presents is a different one so long as this state of things continues every proposition in the composition of which the misexpressive name in question has a place is a selfcontradictory one so long then as this selfcontradictoriness and the confusion of which it is essentially productive continues so long the inconvenience nor is it an inconsiderable one continues to be felt and it is only after a lapse of time more or less considerable that the new conception having at length in a manner    wormed out the original one the inconvenience ceases to be felt   in the next place of the sort of name in question another use it has been already observed is to obviate doubts in relation to the extent of the field belonging to the branch of art and science in question i e whether such or such a less extensive district in whatsoever manner designated especially if it be a newly discovered or newly distinguished district be included in it in this case by what rule or mark shall the answer be guided and determined by the name considered in itself i e considered in its original import merely no true light but instead of it a false light is afforded and as to the light afforded by mere usage by the supposition no light of this sort hath as yet begun to show itself attached to the use made of misexpressive names here then are two inconveniences two distinguishable and undeniable inconveniences which will be found to have place in so far as for the designation of any of the leading branches of art and science any such improper and unfortunately chosen denominations continue to be employed natural history natural philosophy—it will presently be seen in how flagrant a degree both these denominations both of them names by which two main branches of art and science are wont to be designated names in constant and almost universal use are misexpressive by this imperfection if any credit be to be given either to experience or to report the amount of the inconvenience produced is by no means inconsiderable great is the length of time during which it is not without extreme difficulty nor till after great perplexity that in the mind of the beginner especially if he be a very young beginner the connexion between the misexpressive general name and any of the particular matters meant to be designated by it viz the subordinate branches included under it or any of the subjects appertaining respectively to those branches can be formed so likewise as to the other inconveniences to this likewise the like observation will be found applying with equal truth this or that less extensive branch is it to natural philosophy that it belongs or to any and what other more extensive head no criterion no source of guidance being to be found in the name itself—viz in its original import—mere accident determines but in the instance of different persons the determinations made by accident are different accordingly that less extensive branch chemistry for example which in the view and language of some persons is a branch of natural philosophy in the view and language of other persons is not a branch of it thus it is that the boundaries of the main compartments being indistinct the conception entertained of the whole field of art and science is in the instance of every mind more or less inadequate and either indeterminate or erroneous thus much as to the imperfections incident to the denomination of any branch of art and science considered by itself now as to such imperfections as do not apply but to the case where the whole multitude of them or a considerable part of that multitude are collected together and considered together in the character of an aggregate as often as they are thus considered in conjunction and with reference to one another the purpose for which they are thus considered may be termed a scientific or encyclopedical purpose and with reference to this extraordinary purpose all others may be distinguished by the appellation of ordinary in so far as it is to an encyclopedical purpose that these several objects the several branches of art and science are considered it is for the purpose of obtaining and communicating a view as clear correct and complete as possible of the whole field of thought and action and therein of the whole field of art and science and to this purpose a view of the several characters i e characteristic circumstances by which the several component branches of that ideal whole are on the one hand assimilated to on the other hand distinguished from each other learners and teachers shall we say or teachers and learners for on the occasion of the mention now to be made of them it seems not altogether easy to say which of these two correspondent classes should be put foremost be this as it may to the situation of both these two correspondent and contrasted classes it is that in the framing of a sketch for the purpose in question in a word for the framing of an encyclopedical sketch the attention of the operator should be directed as far as any separation can in practice be made it is by the situation of learners that the principal demand for attention is presented for all teachers must in the first place have been learners nor at any subsequent period can teachers exist without learners whereas learners may exist and in so far as individuals are selftaught do exist without teachers and where both classes have place together and at the same time remain distinct from one another the class of learners may and naturally will be much more numerous than the class of teachers nor will the class of persons to whom in the character of learners an apposite and expressive system of encyclopedical nomenclature may be of use be found to be so narrow as might at first sight be imagined to any one whose subsequent pursuits were destined to be confined within the limits of ever so narrow a branch of the field if not the whole various other parts of such a system will be found of which a conception more or less detailed will not be found to be altogether useless of no one part can a mans conception fail of being the stronger and the clearer    the stronger and clearer his conception is of such or such other parts which by means of those properties whereby they are respectively assimilated to it and contrasted with it contribute to reflect light upon it and by this means place it in the clearer point of view to this class to speak more particularly will be seen to belong all those persons by whom the benefit of the proposed system or course of chrestomathic education will have been partaken of with few if any exceptions initiated as they will be in every useful branch of art and science—strange would be the inconsistency were any such determination taken as that of forbearing to present to their view those relations of mutual agreement and distinction by means of which these several branches receive each of them light from and reflect it upon every other for it is thus and thus alone that the mind can be endowed with and rendered conscious of that animating vigour by means of which it feels itself able with an assurance of success and mastery to enter and operate with effect upon any and every part of it towards which the course of its pursuits may at any time happen to be directed but on the proposed plan along with the class of learners will be augmented the class of teachers and that in a much larger proportion than any which till of late has been in view for in the instance of every one of the branches of science thus taught so it is that by a very considerable proportion of the class of learners the function of teachers will even before their own term of learning is in respect of that same branch fully expired be taken in hand and exercised so that to the extent of this large portion of the whole number of learners the only line of separation between the two classes is that which will have been drawn by the hand of time of the imperfections of which a system of nomenclature for the various branches of art and science may be seen to be susceptible when considered with a view to none but the ordinary purposes as above explained a conception may presently be formed and has accordingly been already endeavoured to be conveyed but of the imperfections of which the like system may be seen to be susceptible when considered with reference to encyclopedical purposes as above explained—no conception can be formed till a conception has been formed of the particular form which it is necessary a system of this sort should be made to wear in order to possess—and that in the highest possible degree of perfection—those properties a general intimation of which has just been given viz that in which in relation to each branch are brought to view the circumstances in respect of which it agrees with and those in respect of which it disagrees with every other of a system of this sort will here be given a general idea and that followed by an exemplification which though particular will be a very extensive one—not embracing merely but outstretching the whole of the proposed field of chrestomathic education but in the meantime that the nature and existence of the demand for a reform of some sort in the nomenclature employed upon the subject may be the more distinctly perceptible—an exemplification will be given of its inaptitude even with reference to the purposes above distinguished by the name of ordinary purposes—viz in the instance of those names which are in most frequent use section iv inaptness of the appellatives natural history natural philosophy and mathematics   the branch of art and science for the designation of which the compound appellation natural history is as yet the only one in use is that which has for its subject matter in general including bodies of all sorts considered in respect of those modifications which are found exemplified by it before any operation has been performed upon it by human art under the direction of human science or in other words if for familiaritys sake notwithstanding the unapt floridness of the expression it should be deemed advisable to employ as usual the name of the wellknown fictitious personage nature in the condition in which it has been found placed by the hands of nature—uncontrolled and unassisted nature of these bodies—i e of matter in all such of its forms with which we have in any way or degree any acquaintance—the aggregate is composed in the first place of our earth in the next place of all the other bodies of which our world is composed of our earth in the first place no others being of any importance to us otherwise than with reference to that in which we live and move and have our being of this earth of ours the matter is either in the form of matter altogether lifeless matter endowed with life but without feeling or matter endowed with life and feeling both in and by the several appellatives mineralogy botany and zoology all of them singleworded—all of them in familiar use—the primary divisions of the branch of art and science here in question are aptly enough expressed and if for the designation of that remaining branch of the art and science in question which has for its subject the remainder of those modifications of matter with which we have any acquaintance the term uranology as above† or even the term astronomy be employed—in either case to the nomenclature thus bestowed    upon these primary branches of the stock of art and science in question no considerable objection presents itself as opposable not so in the case of the whole aggregate of which these are the divisions of the two words—the first an adjective the other a substantive—of which the compound appellation natural history is formed—it found at the time of its formation the substantive history already appropriated to the designation of a branch of learning having for its subject those states of persons and things of all sorts and those events of all sorts that have been known or supposed to have had place in times past present time either being altogether excluded or its history being but as it were a point in comparison with the time of history which it closes adding the word natural say natural history the result is that for the import designated by this appellative antecedently to the establishment of that usage from which it has received an import so widely different we have this viz the natural account of those states of persons and things and so forth and of those events and so forth which had place in times past now with what propriety to any one of the abovementioned so aptly denominated divisions of the branch of art and science itself thus unaptly denominated—with what propriety to mineralogy to botany to zoology—can the term natural history consideration had of its original and proper import as thus developed be applied ii the branch of art and science for the designation of which the compound appellation natural philosophy is in use is that which has for its subject matter in general considered in respect of such modifications as it has been made or may be expected to be made to undergo by human art under the guidance of human science with the addition perhaps of such properties as by means of changes made in it by the application of that same mental instrument have been discovered to have been already belonging to it taken by itself philosophy is the love of wisdom adding the word natural say natural philosophy and for the import designated by this appellation antecedently to the arbitrary usage established in this case as in that other—we have this viz the natural love of wisdom that either in the study of mechanics or in that of chemistry or in the study of any of those particular branches of art and science which are formed by the application of these general and theoretical branches to the various practical ones to which they are subservient is there any want of capacity to afford gratification to an affection so laudable as that of the love of wisdom—is not here by any means meant to be asserted or so much as insinuated but not to speak of oratory poetry or any of the fine arts—in the study of the art and science of legislation or in the study of the art and science of which private morals is the subject is there any less room for the manifestation of the love of wisdom or of wisdom itself than in the study of machines or in that of the various methods of compounding decompounding and recompounding the matter of which stones plants and animals are respectively composed iii the branch of art and science for the designation of which the term mathematics is in use is that which has for its subject quantity in general considered with or without relation to form or figure quantity in general that is to say as well matter as void space they being considered respectively in relation to quantity with or without relation to figure void space—that is space considered as void or rather without consideration had of its contents for as to any determinate portion of space determined by determinate boundaries—and within those boundaries not containing any the least particle of matter whatsoever—an example of any such object would not it is believed be very easy to find taken in its original import mathematics denotes anything that is learnt or considered as capable of being learnt it therefore is—or at least in that its original import was capable of being with no less propriety employed in the designation of any one of those existing or those about to exist branches of art and science comprehended or not in the most comprehensive and copious encyclopedia—than in the designation of the particular branch to which by long and learned usage it has thus in these later times become appropriated—of the art of legislation or the art of pushpin no less than of geometry and algebra upon all the abovementioned three denominations will not only the imperfection of inexpressiveness but in the instance of the two first of them that of misexpressiveness be found chargeable running on in perpetual contradiction to the original import a false account of the subject is the account which the two appellations natural philosophy and mathematics are both of them continually giving of it but though in all these instances the proposition involved in the appellative is equally false yet the falsehood so involved is not in all these instances equally pregnant with practical inconvenience in the instance of mathematics no very considerable practical inconvenience seems observable to such persons as are altogether unacquainted with the primary general import of the word it conveys not any import at variance with that which in the instance in question it has acquired from particular usage and even to the eyes of persons acquainted with such its primary import that general import  0 has to such a degree been covered as it were and by degrees even pushed aside by the particular import attached to it by particular usage as to be scarcely ever in use to present itself in the case of natural philosophy the inconvenient effects of unexpressiveness coupled as it is with misexpressiveness have manifested themselves in a manner much more conspicuous and incontestable to the same branch of art and science to which some attach the name of natural philosophy others attach the name of experimental philosophy in the present instance both these terms being as above misapplied are they—in the modern import of the former of them—are they or are they not synonymous with each other in relation to the subject to which they respectively apply no intimation being given by either of these appellatives—this being the case to a question to the above effect who shall undertake to furnish an answer—thus much being pretty clear viz that for no such answer are any data afforded by the primary import of either of these appellatives astronomy—though properly speaking it should in part be considered as referable to natural history viz in so far as it consists in simple observations unaccompanied with those observations and calculations which as in the case of chronological geography and uranological chronology are applicable and actually applied to practical use seems commonly to be considered as referable to natural philosophy and to that alone be it so but is it then referable to experimental philosophy the light that issues from them yes but the stars themselves are they like the starfish named from them are they taken can they be taken for the subjects of experiment chemistry this branch of art and science does it or does it not belong to the domain of natural philosophy yes say some for under that appellation they include it no say others for under that appellation they do not include it belonging or not belonging to natural philosophy does it not at any rate belong to experimental philosophy in the whole of chemistry not to say any more taken from beginning to end is not there full as much of experiment as in any part of mechanics once more does it or does it not belong to natural philosophy on any such ground as that of reason and analogy the question is manifestly unanswerable and any dispute produced by it interminable why because while one of these names—viz natural philosophy is not only unexpressive but misexpressive the other chemistry is also unexpressive by chemistry—an arabian word of which the origin has always been covered by a cloud—no intimation whatever either of the subjectmatter of the sort of operator or of the nature of any operations performed is afforded by some institutionalists chemistry as above observed is not considered as included in natural philosophy why because before chemistry had begun to find teachers before any more than a few scattered fragments of the art and science could be so much as said to have existence natural philosophy had for a long time been in use to be taught therefore when chemistry came to be taught this new branch was considered as a branch of art or science wholly distinct and independent not included in that old one section v cause or origin of this inaptitude of the thus extensively prevailing inadequacy should the source be asked for it may be found it is believed at no great depth beneath the surface it may be descried in the difference between the respective extents of the several divisions of the field of art and science—i e of the respective masses of their contents—in the state in which they now present themselves to view as compared with the extents respectively possessed by them when for the first time the degree of cultivation which they had respectively received suggested the convenience of employing a certain name for the purpose of binding together in the mind such of their contents with which at that time an acquaintance more or less correct and extensive had been formed in each instance numerous insulated and dispersed must have been the particular observations and experiments made before it occurred to any one to give to the aggregate assemblage of them a common name of any kind and thus to bind together the contents of that aggregate by one common tie even when this instrument of connexion and elucidation came at length to be employed it would at first be either altogether uncharacteristic of the objects which it served to designate or if amongst them there were any at all to which it bore any such natural relation the number of them would in comparison with the number of those to which it bore not any such relation be very small take for instance that branch of art and science which still bears the name of electricity of the word electricity the root or basis is a greek word which signifies amber had it been from the latin that the word had been derived it would have been amberism why electricity or amberism only because of such a multitude of sorts of substances as that by which at present upon the subjecting them to the same sort of operation viz rubbing the same appearances viz the causing light bodies first to move towards them and then to recede from them are exhibited amber happened to be the first in which the existence of this property was observed even magnetism though to the purpose of    calling to view by means of its original signification the phenomena for the designation of which it has now for a long time been employed—though to this purpose it is so much less inadequate than electricity has had its original boundaries far outstretched by observations made at various later dates by the import originally attached to it the intimation given is that the properties of which it takes cognizance belong exclusively to the naturally existing mineral termed in greek and latin magnes and in english the loadstone since those days the same properties have however been found to be capable of being given to iron—a simple metallic substance which is but one of two or more ingredients of which the loadstone is composed—and to belong naturally to nickel another metallic substance which with the exception of this property and those that are common to all metals has not been found to have anything in common with either of those two other substances in the instance of these two branches of art and science—both of them included in the domain so unexpressively denominated by the compound appellative natural philosophy—we have two names which however imperfectly are still in a certain degree characteristic and expressive designative of a portion though not of the whole of the contents of the branch of art and science which they are respectively employed to denominate in the instance of galvanism the sign is altogether uncharacteristic with relation to every one of the objects which it is employed to signify by an italian of the name of galvani within the memory of multitudes now living observation was made of certain phenomena in which no analogy to any other class of phenomena was for some time discovered no other object to which they could be said to bear any particular relation being known—at the same time that the person by whose sagacity and ingenuity they had been in part observed and in part discovered being known—it was from him they took their name the phenomena observed or discovered by galvani and presently for shortness galvanism was the name given to them by the natural philosophers of that day this imperfection is not peculiar to the physical branch of art and science—in a large proportion it is shared with it by the ethical from like causes proceed everywhere like effects hence in the field of government the multitude of offices by the names of which not any the slightest intimation is conveyed of the nature of the operations performed by the possessors section vi course to be taken for framing the most perfect and instructive system of encyclopedical nomenclature that the nature of the case admits of the nature of the subjects themselves and the nature of the words or terms employed in giving to the aggregate mass of them in all its diversifications a system of nomenclature and by means of such nomenclature a set of divisions and thereby a scheme of distribution and arrangement—on these two circumstances it is believed will the aptitude of the work with reference to its purposes be found to depend i as to the subject for the particular purpose here in question it is only in so far as concerns its primary and most extensive divisions that an acquaintance with it will be found to be very material with its details no other acquaintance will be found necessary than that by the want of which a man might be led into misconceptions concerning the general nature of the compartments and divisions in which they are comprehended viz in such sort as by means of some illchosen appellative to ascribe to this or that one of the contents this or that property of which in reality it is not possessed in the choice made of the words will be found to be included two intimately connected indeed but perfectly distinguishable particulars viz in the first place the choice of such appellatives—singleworded and manyworded together—as by the extent respectively belonging to them shall be suited to the purpose of giving expression to all such divisions or parts of the subject or aggregate as at each step in the progress of the division shall be proposed to be marked out in the next place the tongue or language of which choice shall have been made for the furnishing the assortment of words required for the supply of that demand   as to the extent covered by the respective appellatives it will in the ensuing sketch at least for all but the last step taken in the course be such as when they are arranged one after another in appropriate order will be seen to give to the mode or scheme of division marked out by them the character of an exhaustive one and that in respect of the number of the parts produced by each act of ideal division of the aggregate considered for that purpose as a divisible whole—the sort of scheme which has been styled sometimes from the greek dichotomous sometimes from the latin bifurcate literally rendered in english by the word twopronged as applied to a fork for as will be seen it is in and by this mode and this alone that all the purposes which on this occasion are of a nature to afford a practical use can be accomplished as to the considerations by which the choice made in    favour of this mode was produced a view of them will presently be given but that they may be the more clearly apprehended it has been deemed advisable to bring to view in the first instance an exemplification of the sort of work to which they will have to make reference small it is true is the number of steps to which accompanied with a correspondent system of nomenclature this transcendently instructive and useful scheme of division can consistently with any net balance on the side of advantage be pursued the number of words being so great and not only the labour necessary to the forming of such a system but even the labour of following it up when made being such as after a comparatively small number of steps taken in this career to threaten to become intolerable but against the carrying it on to whatever length it is capable of being followed up to with clear advantage every impracticability that may be found to attach upon an ulterior pursuit of it will not be found to oppose any reasonable objection and a task for which neither the mind of the writer nor the mind of the reader may be ripe at one period may find both minds sufficiently prepared for it at a more advanced point in the line of time as to the language the greek presents itself as being upon the whole beyond comparison the best adapted to this purpose and this so clearly as to be the only one which on this occasion there can be any use in holding up to view reason and custom—reason in this instance the parent of custom—join in the affording of this assurance of all known languages the greek is assuredly in its structure the most plastic and most manageable to such a purpose as the present upon a scale of any extent it is the only language which it has been customary for men to draw upon for this purpose customary not only in the english language but in the language of every other nation forming a part of the european system or in a word as to this purpose may be said for shortness and without any very material injustice in the language of every wellinstructed nation upon earth of the sort of work proposed to be executed the subject has already been brought to view and its limits marked out it is hoped with that degree of precision which the nature of the case admits of viz of the whole field of thought and action that part which constitutes the field of art and science the field itself or what comes to the same thing both expressions being necessarily figurative names of fictitious entities the aggregate of its contents† of the division to be made of this field or what comes to the same thing the distribution to be made of its contents where shall we look for the source—the primary source by the choice of which the choice of all ulterior sources should any such be added will naturally be influenced at least if not determined where but in the different natures of different parts of this field—of different portions of its contents—in a word in the nature of the subject—the common subject of all these branches of art and science—and in the different natures of the several different parts of that subject on which these several branches have to operate so far as it is from this source that the division is made—the principle of division deduced—correspondent to each branch of the subject is the branch of art and science by which it is operated upon and conversely correspondent to each branch of art and science is that branch of the subject on which it operates in the preface written by dalembert and prefixed to the french encyclopædia under the title of systême figuré des connoissances humaines—figured system of human knowledge a systematic table or map is given accompanied with a paper entitled explication détaillée du systême des connoissances humaines in that sketch what is the declared subject of the work—art and science in conjunction—no but sciences alone to the exclusion of arts for surely under the french word connoissances arts are no more included than under the english word knowledge or the english word science yet in the table itself the words art and arts occur in many places again the source of division or to begin with the first division which presents itself—the source of that leading division—what is it is it the nature of the subject—the different natures of the several different branches of the subject—on which the corresponding branches of art and science have to operate—no but the nature of the faculties by means of which the subject in its different parts is it is supposed operated upon lastly the plan or scheme of division—considered in respect of the number of branches which are respectively the results of the several successive acts of partition or distribution performed upon it—what is it is it as above proposed regular and bifurcate the number at the first step two and at every step the same—no but at the first step trifurcate and after that the number at each step varying to the number of halfadozen or more such is the scheme or plan of division pursued in that justly celebrated work in these may be seen a part and but a part of the whole number of its incongruities and of some of the practical inconveniences resulting from some of these logical incongruities—if on the ground of science confusion and on the one part misrepresentation and on the other    part misconception belong to the category of inconvenience—it will be the endeavour of the next section to give a view section vii dalemberts encyclopedical map or tabular sketch—its imperfections of the sketch given by dalembert the leading principles are—as he himself has been careful to declare taken from that given by lord bacon had it been entirely his own it would have been beyond comparison a better one for the age of bacon bacons was a precocious and precious fruit of the union of learning with genius for the age of dalembert it will it is believed be found but a poor production below the author as well as the age prudential considerations suggested to the french philosopher the precaution of seeking shelter under the mantle of the foreign sage but of this perhaps in another place ingenious as in several parts and in several respects it would upon a particular examination be found—smoke rather than light will upon the whole be seen to be the result of it at the very first step the whole field it will be seen is involved in an allobscuring cloud a cloud too thick for any ulterior operation to be capable of dissipating its principal merit and use will it is believed be seen to consist in the having formed and presented to view a general conception of a work of this sort—and the having placed together under one view the whole stock of the materials at that time known to belong to it and to require to be employed in the composition of it taking the work in the form in which it is exhibited by dalembert the following are among the imperfections which have presented themselves as chargeable upon it—   the very subject of the work inadequately designated   the primary source of division unhappily chosen   the scheme of division loose and irregular   the appellations in several leading instances inapposite   the distinctions in several instances groundless distinctions without any determinate and assignable difference   repetitions abundant—under different names the same object repeated a multitude of times   the texture of the discourse incomplete no verbs consequently no propositions nothing but substantives with here and there an article or an adjective i subject of the work inadequately designated of the relation between art and science—as well as of the relation between art and science taken together on the one part and the remainder of the whole field of thought and action on the other part—the idea above given† will it is hoped be found a tolerably clear one of this relation no attempt to give any idea is made in dalemberts map or in the explanation given of it systême figuré—figured system des connoissances humaines—of human knowledge is the title under which the whole contents of the table are arranged at the conclusion even poetry presented to view in the character of the principal product of the imagination is at the same time exhibited in the character of a subject or a branch of the allcomprehending aggregate—human knowledge‡ in the same paragraph and but four lines after he speaks of this table by the description of a genealogical distribution or map of the sciences and the arts and in this loose shape and no other is introduced the only mention made of the arts or the word art and though    fiction is mentioned as an essential ingredient in the composition of the idea meant by him to be attached to the word yet neither on this occasion nor on any other is it brought to view in the character of the name of an art nor in any other character than that of the name of a branch of science from the difficulty here in question the mind of dalembert it therefore appears withdrew its force his precursor chambers in the preface to his dictionary had before him grappled with it but as any one who in this view may be disposed to turn to that elaborate work will it is believed find reason to acknowledge altogether without success instead of knowledge in which see chrestomathia table i science is included—instead of knowledge alone the subject of the work in question should then have been art and science art and science all along in conjunction for in conjunction they must all along be taken and considered or no tolerably adequate conception of either will be formed but the subject of art and science together what is it—answer—being in general being in all the modifications of which to our view it is susceptible being in some shape or shapes the subject—wellbeing in some shape or shapes the object—of everything that by man is or can be done or thought of of these fundamental and eminently simple truths the bare mention may suffice for the present in the section in which some of the first lines of the sort of map in question are attempted to be given the consideration of them will come to be resumed as the process of division and distribution drawn as the principle of division is from different sources—as this sort of anatomical process proceeds the several modifications of being which are the result of it display themselves to view ii primary source of division ill chosen the primary source of his divisions is—what not the nature of the subject and of its respective parts but as already noticed the nature of the several human faculties which by a strange misconception are respectively considered as applying themselves exclusively to different parts of it strange indeed may this misconception be pronounced at any rate if it be true that when these faculties come to be mentioned so it is that of all the branches into which the body of the arts and sciences has ever been or ever can be divided not a single one can be mentioned upon which the whole list of the human faculties can not be shown to be in some way or other applied memory reason imagination—of these and these alone is his list of the human faculties as brought forward on this occasion composed if for any other purpose if on any other occasion asked for a list of those faculties would dalembert have given this for a complete one perception for example not to look any further would not this have been added would it not have been placed before memory but the truth is that in the subsequent ramifications though not in this primary one not only perception but other faculties besides are by dalembert himself brought to view but for this purpose what list of these faculties other than a complete one could with propriety have been proposed to serve in addition to these three each of which according to this division applies itself exclusively to a certain parcel of the branches of art and science or at any rate of science is it that there are any of which no application is made to any branch of art or science of the faculty of perception for example is it that no application is made in the study of natural history for example if either in this or in any other instance any such faculty be to be found if this be indeed a truth it surely is not of the number of those truths which are so completely obvious that no proof of them can either for conviction or satisfaction be justly regarded as necessary quere unless it be through the perceptive faculty through what medium does the retentive receive any of the original and exteriorly derived part of its contents of a set of fictitious entities to give in a list neither the correctness nor the completeness of which shall be exempt from dispute or doubt cannot be a very easy task of the articles inserted in the note neither the perceptibility meaning that sort of perceptibility of which these sorts of fictitious entities are susceptible—neither the perceptibility nor the mutual distinctness—say rather distinguibility—will it is hoped be found much exposed to dispute the inventor the learner the teacher the inventor or in the place of or in company with the inventor the discoverer and their assistant k table iii being a reprint of dalemberts encyclopædical table as inserted in his melanges tom i p     or   0 amsterdam      for an examination of this table see chrestomathia appendix no iv from p    to     systême figure des connoissances humaines entendement    the observer in regard to every branch of science be it what it may—by these different sets of persons different faculties or sets of faculties are put into exercise    what the inventor is in relation to art the discoverer is in relation to science in art and science not merely every existing branch but every the minutest twig must have given exercise to the inventive faculty ere it could have come into existence invention as above is imagination taken under command by attention and directed to the accomplishment of some particular object or end in view the products of the exercise of the abstractive faculty are the materials of which the work of the imagination is composed among the objects of invention or discovery is method and when once invented or discovered it becomes an instrument in the hands of invention of discovery and of observation it is by natural history in greater proportion than by any other branch of art and science that exercise is afforded for observation and for method next to that by those branches which have mind for their subject abstraction imagination invention discovery methodization communication of none of these faculties does the learner as such find in himself any demand for the exercise attention and observation applied to the impressions and ideas which are respectively the products of the exercise of the several faculties of perception judgment memory and ratiocination—for the exercise of all these faculties but for that of no others than these does the situation occupied by the learner as such afford a demand to the faculties for the exercise of which the situation of the learner affords a demand that of teacher adds that of communication of communication and in so far as in the method which he employs there happens to be anything which was thought of by him without its having to his knowledge been thought of by any other person invention without any the slightest notice taken of any of these distinctions—poetry with its nearest branches in vast capitals and those next to them still in great and upright ones after poetry music painting sculpture civil architecture and engraving these and no others are by dalembert huddled together in a corner and—as if standing in awe of poetry and should they presume to place themselves on a line with her fearing the lash of one of her daughters viz satire—are dressed in capitals indeed but those leaning ones and in comparison with those which are not refused to madrigal epigram or romance scarcely visible these too are all together placed under the head of imagination as if in the first place to the exercise of all these branches of art the exercise of the imaginative faculty were necessary and as if in the next place it were not so to any of the others yet when once pointed out who is there that does not recognise that neither to the musical performer nor to the painter as such nor to the sculptor as such nor to the architect or in plain english the builder as such nor to the engraver as such is any exercise of the imaginative faculty necessary yes in so far as by any of them anything new is to be hit upon but in this there is nothing which they do not possess in common with the artist in every other line whatsoever aristotle was an observer and inventor for by him was invented how far soever from perfected the art and science of logic schoolmistress of all the other arts and sciences bacon was an observer and inventor for by him was invented the art of learning natural history and natural philosophy more particularly the latter neuton was an observer a discoverer and an inventor locke was an observer and a discoverer his field of discovery the region of mind linnæus was werner is an observer and inventive and thereby imaginative methodizer—which of these men was ever a musician a painter a sculptor a builder or an engraver placed where it is the word reason is of itself sufficient to involve the whole subject in a cloud to the production of confusion and dismay had that been the purpose it would have been but too effectually adapted clear conceptions placed where it is it is not in the nature of it to bring to view what is the object meant to be presented by it—answer one of the faculties of the human mind what    then is this faculty—answer the faculty called the ratiocinative or inductive faculty including of course the judgment or judicial faculty what then is reason—answer it is a name which on some occasions and only on some occasions a man is wont to give to the ratiocinative faculty or the exercise of it what then are these occasions—answer those and those alone on which the exercise which he considers as given to it is such as he approves of here then instead of that neutral sort of appellation which alone is suitable to the purpose viz that sort of appellation of which the words induction and inductive faculty judgment and judicial faculty as well as the words memory and imagination are exemplifications the appellative employed for the designation of the ratiocinative including the judicial faculty is an eulogistic one of the act of misappellation thus committed now then observe the consequence of every application made of this word in the designation of the faculty in question the effect being to attach to it a latent proposition expressive of the approbation of the speaker as annexed to the exercise given to the faculty one consequence is that without a contradiction in terms it cannot be employed on any occasion in which it is the intention to bring that exercise to view in the character of an object of disapprobation or even to avoid bringing it to view in the opposite character thus it is that of the three leading terms in question while two are as far as they go proper and suitable to the purpose between them is thrust in another which mismatches them—and communicates to the whole group its own delusive colour memory and imagination—it is by the logicians that these two appellations simple and suitable as they are were taken in hand reason—it is of the rhetorician that this appellative was the choice in the word reason may be seen one of that numerous set of names of fictitious entities in the fabrication of which the labours of the rhetorician and the poet have been conjoined in reason they have joined in giving us a sort of goddess a goddess in whom another goddess passion finds a constant antagonist—and a third goddess religion reasons elder sister—sometimes a troublesome rival sometimes a useful subordinate it is not by any such mythology that any clear and correct instruction can be conveyed under the head of memory—under that one head—are arranged the contents of the whole field of natural history together with those of the field of history simply and properly so called—under the head of reason the contents of the field of natural philosophy in regard to the distribution thus made thus much is indeed true viz that in the formation and retention of ideas relative to the subject of natural philosophy the quantity of exercise given to the ratiocinative faculty—more particularly in so far as the art and science takes for its subject the relation between cause and effect—is commonly greater than the quantity of exercise given to another faculty but this other faculty what is it not the memory to which the two philosophers refer so much but the perception or apprehension to which they refer nothing scarcely has even history—history in its narrowed and most usual sense viz an account of states of things and events as they are supposed to have had existence in times past—scarcely in this limited sense can history with more propriety than natural history or natural philosophy be said to belong to the province of the memory to the memory it is true almost exclusively before the invention of the art of writing must all successive generations have been indebted for whatsoever notions they could have obtained and retained concerning the states of things and events that had had place in the respectively preceding generations but—of a state of things or an event that had had place at an antecedent point of time when the description had once been expressed and fixed in and by the permanent sort of signs which are the product of that mindexalting art—a mans faculty of bearing it in mind was no more dependent upon memory than his faculty of bearing in mind the matter of any other branch of art and science—the correspondency for example between the acquisition of mechanical power and the sacrifice of despatch the composition of water and respirable air or the equivalency of the sum of all the angles that can be constructed round any given point to that of four right ones a circumstance which at the times respectively in question these philosophers seem not either of them to have been aware of but which when once brought to view will not be found the less undeniable is that not only the practice and knowledge that has had place in relation to international intercourse and internal government but every other branch of art and science—every one as well as every other—has its history natural history natural philosophy poetry music logic everything in relation to war and government has the state of this part of the universe presented itself at different times in different shapes so has it in relation to mechanics to chemistry to poetry to music and so on not to speak of the future which to our limited view is all of it in a state of contingency the distinction between the past and the present to what portion of the whole field of thought and action to what portion of the known field of existence does it not apply itself placed under the head of memory the title irregularities of nature ecarts de la nature presents itself in the character of a blotch to which a sponge might apply a not incongruous cure natural and but too excusable in bacons time it was not equally so in dalemberts    in the time of the english philosopher the mind was annoyed and oppressed by terrors which in the time of his french disciple had lost though not the whole the greater part of their force in bacons time—in the early part of the   th century—everything in nature that was or was supposed to be extraordinary was alarming alarming and in some shape or other if not productive predictive at least of human misery in this place as in other places—at this time as at other times—ghosts and witches composed a constant part of the population devils an occasional one patronised by queen elizabeth dee had not long ceased to hold converse with his disembodied intimates lilly was preparing for the connexion he succeeded in forming with his to burn heretics to hang witches and to combat devils were operations for all which bacons royal patron held himself in equal and constant readiness celestial prodigies prodigious meteors prodigies on land and sea monstrous minerals monstrous vegetables monstrous animals prodigies of the elements by dalembert all these alas are exhibited in the character of so many distinct classes of the subjects of human knowledge distinct classes of things subordinate and standing next in subordination to the including class denominated as above irregularities of nature this too under title memory for most of them at least the imagination might have been a more apposite one in the days of bacon battles on dry ground were scarcely more common than battles in the air in the thin element peace had assuredly been already pretty well established in dalemberts time placed under the head of reason divination and black magic were perhaps two whiffs of necessary incense offered up to the archbishop of paris subjects if not branches of that science which had for its already declared subjects spirits beneficent and malificent for the expulsion of the latter of whom the ritual of that most reverend person furnished him with weapons to which they had never been known to oppose any effectual resistance—those gems in the panoply of theological warfare could not then be spared—but by that oblation his appetite for the supernatural might one should have thought have been satisfied without the addition of so many swarms of monsters at present at any rate much it is believed will hardly be found to be said in favour of a principle of classification by which a middlesized man is placed in one niche a tall man and a short man together in another in the ancient order of things commencement precedes accomplishment trial precedes success experiment upon a small scale precedes establishment upon a large scale in each and every part of the field experimental researches must necessarily have preceded those established practices of which the products of handicraft arts manufactures and the arts called fine arts are the results accordingly in the sketch attempted in the next section exhibited under the new name proposed as a substitute to this its present trivial one experimental philosophy precedes technology the branch of science which belongs to the necessary and more useful part of the arts not so in dalemberts in that it is under the general head of natural history that we see ranked what concerns all finished products of the arts with their et ceteras as above while by the still more general head memory intimation is given if not that it is by the exertion of that single faculty that they are produced at any rate that it is by that one alone of all the human faculties that anything else in relation to them is either known or done a dislocation so strange by what train of thought can it have been produced from the terms of the table a sort of conjectural answer may be collected by every exercise given to art some production of nature is put to use accordingly arts handicraft trades and manufactures are there exhibited in the character of exemplifications of the uses made of nature but by the same title might not poetry be ranked under the head of natural history and its fruits—an epic or dramatic poem for example—represented as being the work of memory or at any rate as belonging in some way or other to the province or faculty of memory for the brain by which it was dictated as well as the pen by which it was written not to speak of the gall nuts the sulphate of iron and the water by which the pen was enabled to give permanence to the marks traced by it what are they any of them but so many works of nature iii scheme of division loose and irregular in a former section vi the dichotomous or bifurcate mode of division performed upon the exhaustive principle has been already brought to view in the character of the only one perfectly suited to what ought to be the design of the first lines of an encyclopedical map or table of the considerations or reasons by which its claim to that character was suggested a view will be given in an ensuing section at the same time the observation was made that with the regularity and comprehensiveness which characterize that mode the mode pursued in this map of dalemberts forms a striking contrast of the existence of this character in it—of this imperfection if such it should be deemed—it would be useless to present to view in this place and in this manner any protracted chain of proofs by a single glance at the table they will be seen all together—for the assistance of the first steps of such a survey a few words will be sufficient at least if not superfluous    common trunk the understanding ramification of this trunk into three branches viz memory reason and imagination—division trifurcate under memory placed history no division under history sacred ecclesiastical civil ancient and modern and natural history—division quadrifurcate or quinquefurcate under natural history uniformity of nature irregularities of nature and uses made of nature—division trifurcate—of title uniformity seven branches of title irregularities seven by the side of title uses made of nature—terms put in apposition arts handicraft trades and manufactures—division novemfurcate—the list of nine branches concluding with an c each of them having its own branches each concluding in like manner with an c thus much under memory and without proceeding onwards either with reason or with imagination this sample will assuredly be found sufficient iv appellations inapposite of this species of imperfection no exemplifications worth noticing have been observed other than those with which the language he found in general use stood chargeable—and of which the principal samples have in this essay been already brought to view §  —these are   natural history—  philosophy—not as with us natural philosophy but simply philosophy under which comes physics physics is divided into general and particular but under neither of them is natural history that being ranked under history included—  mathematics the promise which it fell to his lot to give being the promise of a body of information relative to all the branches of art and science which were or were at that time considered as being in existence—that which it was necessary his map should contain was a collection of those names by which they were respectively in use to be designated and by which and which alone they were generally known under these circumstances whatsoever might be the imperfections which any of these denominations might be found labouring under with none of them could this intelligent philosopher be justly chargeable and it appears not that to this established stock of imperfections any of his own making have been added v distinctions groundless— unwarranted by any determinate and assignable correspondent differences of this species of imperfection several exemplifications may be seen under the ensuing head of repetitions vi repetitions abundant— under different names the same objects presented to view a number of different times four times over in the character of subjects of memory are the several classes of known bodies of which the earths surface is composed brought to view in this table viz  st under the name of meteors  dly under the name of earth and sea  dly under their own distinctive names viz minerals vegetables and animals  thly under the name of elements four times yes and also four times more viz all such of them to which it should at any time happen to present to the eye of the reader whoever he may be anything which to that same eye shall appear to have in it anything that is extraordinary as if ordinary and extraordinary were anything more than relative terms relative not to the nature of the objects themselves but to the position occupied at the moment by the mind by which they are respectively viewed as if the same object which to a preceding generation had been extraordinary had not become ordinary to a succeeding one such as they are here they follow—  prodigious meteors or meteoric prodigies   prodigies on earth and sea   monstrous minerals   monstrous vegetables   monstrous animals   prodigies of the elements not content with thus presenting them eight times over in the character of objects or subjects of memory once more are we made to see these same beings and now in the character of objects or subjects of reason for still they are the same existences and even viewed under the same aspects notwithstanding the termination logy in the french logie which now forms a termination to the greek word by which they are respectively brought to view meteors are now represented in the first place by meteorology then presently once more by aerology minerals first by geology then presently once more by mineralogy water by hydrology vegetables by botany—divided and not improperly into agriculture and gardening meteors as already observed meteors—i e meteoric meaning neither more nor less than elevated bodies or particles are—what are they what can they be but bodies or particles of the number of those of which the earths surface is composed—only mixed up with that part of it which is mostly in a gaseous state and then detached to a distance more or less considerable above i e beyond that principal mass which is partly in a solid partly in a liquid state—masses consequently composed in different and evervarying proportions of matters belonging respectively to the three great kingdoms as they are called—the mineral the vegetable and the animal yet in the character of a sort of subject—and that a distinct one—of natural history dalembert as we have seen already places meteors and that in a situation anterior to the situations respectively allotted to minerals vegetables and animals and to them he subjoins as if they were constitutive of a distinct  0 class of objects elements—a word which in trivial language is indeed employed even now but which had had its rise in modes of thought and action which even in dalemberts time were already antiquated and exploded four in number as every body knows used to be these elements viz earth water air and fire earth a term employed to designate any mass of matter whatsoever in so far as it is considered as being in a solid state water a term employed to designate a mass of the same matter when in the liquid state—a mass of matter which is itself the same though by its being thus designated by a different appellative represented and spoken of as if it were different air a term by which the selfsame mass is once more designated when considered as being in the gaseous state fire a word to which no determinate idea was ever annexed but which is wont to be employed whenever in conjunction with an extraordinary mass of light an extraordinary mass of caloric i e heat is perceived to issue from the same spot in a manner not unsuitable to our situation and thence to our mode of contemplating objects of all sorts the world i e all that part of it in relation to which it has been within our power to obtain any the smallest and faintest spark of knowledge has by some been divided into earth and heaven earth the globe which we inhabit heaven comprehending all other globes all other bodies whatsoever accordingly such is the conception by which the philosopher seems to have been guided while memory was the presiding deity first comes celestial history and without any division then comes history by itself followed by its several adjuncts viz meteors earth and sea and so forth as above in conformity to this part of the plan when furnished with greeksprung names with the termination logy tacked to each name the same objects or subjects came to be put under the presidence of reason science de la nature—natural history not having it should seem been recognised in the character of a science but only as a sort of knowledge different from and employed to prepare the way for science—science de la nature followed by its synonym physique particulière should have been branched out in the first place into cosmologie and géologie and after that géologie into météorologie mineralogie and the other logies according to the method which as above had already been observed instead of that follow the particulars in an order which besides being with relation to that in which the same objects had already been arranged so completely incongruous is in itself so completely perturbate that to delineate in the form of a continuous discourse those intrinsic incongruities which after this intimation—at any rate with the help of the ensuing sketch—may be discovered by the examination of about forty words such being the number contained in this part of dalemberts sketch might afford full work for as many pages branches of the science of nature alias particular physics seven viz   zoology   physical astronomy as if there were an astronomy that was not physical   meteorology   cosmology   botany   mineralogy   chemistry thus in the first place animals of all sorts then the stars and then whatever they are the meteors are brought to view and that by reason before any such receptacle as a world has been found for them to exist in and between animals and the plants on which they have to depend for their existence this same whole world as soon as it is found is placed besides all the stars and all the meteors in company with this figured system systême figuré and antecedently to it is presented by the author as above noticed an explanation of it for an explanation and therein for a justification of the sort of order a sample of which has just been exhibited reference to the above explanation was of course made of this reference what was the result—that the order pursued in the explanation was on this part of the ground altogether different from the order given to the articles which it professed to explain this too after his having observed in so many words that p     particular physics ought to follow the same distribution as natural history in this same explanation another strange intimation is given and such is the store set upon it it is repeated through the whole course of several pages this is that so long as under the presidence of memory you are studying natural history in which he includes the history of all the arts except the fine ones you are to make use of your senses and nothing more on the other hand when you come to the study of the same objects under the presidence of reason then it is that for the first time you are to apply to them the faculty of reflection and so long as that is at work you have no occasion for your senses† what perhaps might be found to be true is that in the study of natural history rather more use is made of the senses than in that of natural philosophy in the study of natural philosophy rather more use made of the faculty of reflection than in the study of natural history but he who should attempt to do anything in natural history without being at any expense    in the article of reflection or in natural philosophy without making any use of his senses would assuredly find it very uphill work vii the nature of the discourse incomplete no verbs in it consequently no propositions nothing but substantives with here and there an adjective by this sort of discourse if discourse it can be called for want of the necessary and indispensable tie or copula as the logicians and grammarians call it which is afforded by the part of speech called a verb no complete assertion being contained in it no determinate information is conveyed by nothing short of an entire proposition can any such conveyance be made true it is that nouns and in particular noun substantives are the principal materials out of which the sign of an assertion is composed but still without the copula no determinate assertion is formed set down any two or any greater number of substantives out of these same materials one man will make one sort of proposition another man another and a third man will not know what to make of them of the readers—that is of the persons for whose instruction the work is intended—some it is possible there may be whose conception of the work when executed may be adequate to that which the workman the instructor had in his mind at the time he executed it but that such will be the case with the generality of readers is surely not the sort of supposition on which a work of this sort ought to be grounded destitute of this principle of fixation and bond of union objects may in innumerable multitude and endless succession be presented to the mind and after all leave in it an impression not more durable than that which is left in the waters by a vessel by which they have been traversed to the sort of sketch a sample of which is attempted in the ensuing section a tabular sketch jotted down in this unconnected mode will be found to bear much the same sort of relation as a stock of bricks mortar and timber deposited by the side of each other bears to a house thus instead of a structure ready put together for use the reader out of the materials thus shot down before him is left to make one for himself as well as he is able the learner is left and called upon to do for himself what the teacher perhaps because he knew not how to do it has left undone several causes concur in recommending to the hand of the workman this mode of executing the work in comparison of the opposite mode the value given to the work in this mode is indeed small and the interest of the customer the learner proportionably illserved not so the interest of the workman the instructor over all errors and all ignorances a very convenient veil is everywhere spread by it   no assertion at all being contained in it no false assertion no erroneous judgment can be imputed to it scarcely in any way can a man thoroughly commit himself by anything which he has inserted still less by anything which he has omitted to insert in it   yet by a too natural misconception the less the instructor has in this case done for his pupil the more he is thought to have had it in his power to do or even to have done by this form of discourse if discourse it can be called an air of mysticism and oracularity is cast over it this was among the characteristics of the egyptian hieroglyphics ideas such as they are suggested in abundance but among them no such thing as an assertion to be found only in proportion as it is understood is language of any use whatsoever is obscure is in proportion to the obscurity unintelligible speaking thus obscurely and unintelligibly is it that you are unable to speak plain or is it that you are unwilling if unwilling what but deception can be your object such are the questions to which every discourse stands exposed in proportion as it is obscure yet to those materials for thinking—loose as they were—profound in former ages was the depth of wisdom that was ascribed to those loose materials for thinking out of which the best thoughts that could have been made would probably have been most if not all of them foolish ones at the same time while the understanding of the reader is thus left in this comparatively unsupplied state his vanity is gratified to do what the philosophers have left undone affords to those who have a taste for it a pastime a pastime in the course of which as many little triumphs may be reaped as there are propositions that can be put together out of such materials as it supplies sketches of this sort on a variety of subjects are assuredly not wanting in which dalembert may have found so many precedents and thereby so many warrants for this unconnected and to the reader so little instructive—but at the same time to the author so much the most convenient—mode if unconscious of any such warrant he had regarded it as matter of obligation to employ that mode which was best suited to the end in view none but the connected mode would have presented itself to his view the conception he would thus have been forced to frame to himself would have been correspondently clear and the work would have appeared in a form very different from that in which it meets the eye at present all this while to the french philosopher    circumstanced as he was the choice of this inadequate form was matter not so much of policy alone as of necessity but of this perhaps in another place whether in any place it is in the nature of any such speculations as the above to be of any real use to render to mankind any perceptible service—whether for speculations of this sort and to this effect the place in which they are thus brought to view is a fit place—these are among the points in which in his own way every reader will pronounce his own judgment by any one whose patience may have carried him thus far thus much at any rate will it is believed be admitted viz that if at the time when that table was made public there existed on the ground of utility any real demand for a table of that sort that demand has not by any of the information therein given been superseded section viii specimen of a new encyclopedical sketch with a correspondent synoptic table or diagram directly or indirectly wellbeing in some shape or other or in several shapes or all

all of them taken together may be said to be the object of every branch of art and the subject of every branch of science eudæmonics† the art which has for the object of its endeavours to contribute in some way or other to the attainment of wellbeing and the science in virtue of which in so far as it is possessed by him a man knows in what manner he is to conduct himself in order to exercise that art with effect considered in the character of an edifice or receptacle eudæmonics may therefore be termed the common hall or central place of meeting of all the arts and sciences change the metaphor every art with its correspondent science is a branch of eudæmonics if the above observation be correct it is only in one or other of two shapes or characters—viz that of a source of happiness or that

acquaintance more or less considerable with the seat of happiness and with such beings as in each instance afford a promise of serving in the character of instruments of happiness is more or less conducive or even necessary for the designation of whatsoever portion of science may be regarded as capable of being attained concerning being taken in its utmost conceivable extent the word ontology has for ages been employed eudæmonics is the art of wellbeing necessary to wellbeing is being in every part therefore of the common field concomitant and correspondent to eudæmonics considered as an art runs ontology† considered as a science for the expressly declared subject of division let us take the science art and science running along everywhere together every division performed on the one may on any occasion be considered as applying to the other by means of this joint consideration as often as on looking at the name of a branch of art and science as it stands in the table we come to consider its nature our attention will be pointed to the only source and measure of its value familiar as is the name ontology the idea commonly attached to that appellation has hitherto been subjected by usage to a restriction which is not exactly conformable either to the present purpose or even to the etymology and original signification of the word as above the case is that by all those philosophers by whom under this name any instruction has been undertaken to be given those properties alone have been either considered or professed to be considered which have been regarded by them as incident to all beings without distinction such as actuality possibility necessity impossibility probability improbability certainty simplicity compositeness power of causation derivation from a cause and so forth coenoscopic‡ and idioscopic§ by successively    attaching to the subject ontology these two adjuncts the field of art and science may thus be divided the whole of it into two portions in one of which viz the coenoscopic shall be contained the appalling and repulsive branch of science to which the no less formidable and to many a man intensely odious appellation of metaphysics is sometimes also applied while to the other viz the idioscopic all the other branches of art and science may without distinction be consigned division the  st division of ontology into   coenoscopic and   idioscopic matter and mind—into these two portions being in general considered as an aggregate is wont to be considered as divided hence arises   division the  d division of idioscopic ontology into somatology or somatics and pneumatology† or‡ pneumatics synonyms psychology and psychics§ in the consideration bestowed upon body the mind may confine itself or not confine itself    to that property which belongs alike to all body and even to every determinate portion of space unoccupied by body viz quantity hence arises division  d division of somatics into posological pososcopic somatics and poiological† poioscopic somatics to avoid an inconvenience above brought to view for an equivalent to posological somatics may be employed the singleworded appellative posology in the consideration of quantity that of figure may be either taken into account or neglected hence arises division  th division of posology into morphoscopic‡ posology and alegomorphic or alegomorphous§ posology by morphoscopic posology is denoted the same branch of art and science for the designation of which the not altogether unexpressive yet but inadequately expressive term geometry is the word in use in so far as it is without relation to figure that quantity is considered the only diversification of which it is susceptible is of that sort for the expression of which the several modifications of which number is susceptible are employed by alegomorphic or alegomorphous posology is here designated the same branch of art and science for the designation of which the singleworded and adequately expressive appellation arithmetic is the word in universal use of a quantity for the designation of which no more than one numerical figure—or one line of such figures no matter how long so it be an uninterrupted one—is employed the amount is considered as known i e by itself the conception of it being in so far as it is capable of being conveyed conveyed in a direct way and without need of the intervention of any other set of signs to the mind of every person by whom the import of those same figures placed in that position with relation to one another is understood of a quantity for the designation of which any two or more such lines of numerical figures or one or more single figures together with one or more such lines of figures are employed the amount is not in a direct way as yet known for practical purposes it is not sufficiently known until the composite expression composed as above has been transformed or translated as it were into a simple expression consisting as above of some one single numerical figure or some one single line of numerical figures the elements of which are free from all such interruption as is produced by the interposition of any other sort of sign to substitute to any other more complicated mode the simple mode of notation thus described is what every operation of simple arithmetic has for its object in and for the designation of numbers a convenience has comparatively speaking of late years been found in the employing in addition to numerical figures and even on some occasions or during some part of the operation in lieu of numerical figures signs of another kind not varying in their signification according to the order in which they succeed one another in the same way as do the component elements of a line of numerical figures of these newly devised signs such as are capable of being ultimately translated into those which are composed of numerical figures have for a    long time past universally and exclusively been composed of the letters of the alphabet but by none of these recently employed signs can any quantity ever be expressed in a direct manner in any other manner than by reference to some single numerical figure or line of numerical figures ranged in arithmetical order as above hence arises division  th division of alegomorphous posology into gnostosymbolic or say delosymbolic† and agnostosymbolic or say adelosymbolic‡ gnostosymbolic or delosymbolic being the term employed for the designation of the branch for the designation of which the term common arithmetic is in use to be employed agnostosymbolic or adelosymbolic is the term employed for the designation of that for the designation of which the inadequately expressive composite appellation algebraical arithmetic—or much more frequently the singleworded and completely unexpressive appellative algebra—is employed ii to return to poiological somatology poioscopic somatics or somatology at large—where bodies are considered it may be either with or without reference to any operation performed upon or in relation to them by human art by the help of human science hence arises division  th division of somatology or somatics at large into physiurgic§ physiurgoscopic and anthropurgic∥ anthropurgoscopic this division has for its source the consideration of the absence or presence of human art and science applied to the purpose either of discovering latent properties already belonging to the subject or of investing it with new ones physiurgic somatology has for its synonym the abovementioned misexpressive appellation—natural history anthropurgic somatology has for its synonym the still more flagrantly and perplexingly misexpressive appellation natural philosophy taken in one of the two or more different degrees of extension which as above have been given to it applied to bodies alias portions of matter in their natural or say physiurgic state human art—or say elaboration by human art—has two distinguishable objects sometimes it is to the one sometimes to the other sometimes to both that it is directed these are   the discovery of such properties as—already and before it has by the application of human genius and industry been endued with any new properties—it is in possession of having been put in possession of them as it were by the hand of nature   the giving to it in addition to or instead of any such properties as it is found endued with by the hands of nature some new property or set of properties intimately connected and in many instances inextricably blended and intermingled are it is evident these two functions the detection of an already existing property or set of properties being very often a condition precedent—and always in so far as it affords suitable indications an encouragement—to the engaging in any such operations as are found conducive to the faculty of investing the subject with new ones of physiurgy alias natural history the object and business is—to discover and observe the properties possessed by objects in the state into which they have been brought by the powers of unassisted nature but to the bringing them for that purpose to view and presenting them in a state as little changed as may be new properties are in many instances requisite to be given to them nor in general would the labour necessary to the accomplishment of this purpose be bestowed upon them but in the view of investing them with new properties—properties by which they will be brought into some state or other better adapted to human use than any into which they had been brought by the hand of nature division   division of physiurgic somatology or say physiurgics into uranoscopic¶ and epigeoscopic physiurgics uranoscopic physiurgics has for its singleworded synonym the adequately expressive appellative astronomy division   division of epigeoscopic physiurgics into abioscopic†† and embioscopic‡‡    physiurgics say abioscopic and embioscopic epigeoscopics abioscopic physiurgics has for its synonym the adequately expressive and singleworded appellative mineralogy division   division of embioscopic physiurgics into azooscopic azoologic or azoic and zooscopic or zoologic physiurgics azooscopic embioscopics has for its synonyms the adequately expressive and singleworded appellations already in use—botany and phytology zooscopic embioscopics has for its synonym the adequately expressive and singleworded appellative already in use—zoology beyond this point no adequate advantage seems to be promised at least on the present occasion by the task of carrying on in this direction that track of dichotomous or bifurcate division which at the expense of much labour to the workman—and not less perhaps to the small number of amateurs that can reasonably be looked for—has thus far been persevered in by the words zoophytology entomology erpetology ichthyology ornithology tetrapodology and amphibiology having for their respective subjects plantanimals insects reptiles fishes birds beasts alias quadrupeds and amphibious alias landandwater animals—so many divisions of zoology have for this long time actually been or in virtue of powers granted by analogy may at any time be in use to be designated division  0   division of anthropurgics or say anthropurgoscopic somatology or somatics into coenoscopic† or phanerodynamic‡ anthropurgics and idioscopic§ or cryptodynamic∥ anthropurgics coenoscopic or phanerodynamic anthropurgics has for its singleworded synonym the inadequately expressive appellative mechanics viz when taken in the most extensive sense of the word i e that in which it is employed to include whatsoever portions of anthropurgic somatics are not comprehended within the domain of chemistry idioscopic or cryptodynamic anthropurgics has for its singleworded synonym the unexpressive appellation chemistry the properties of which mechanics—or as the phrase is mechanical philosophy—takes cognizance are for the most part such as belong to all matter taken in all its forms and species by this circumstance it is that this branch of art and science is entitled to the appellation of coenoscopic anthropurgics or somatics these properties are moreover in comparison with those which belong to the subjects of the other justmentioned branch manifest or say conspicuous of themselves not requiring the aid of human art to bring them out to view in this circumstance it is that this same branch founds its title to the appellation of phanerodynamic these properties being mostly if not altogether such as in the common course of scientific language come under the denomination of powers hence in speaking of this division of art and science it has been thought that on this occasion a word corresponding to powers might by contributing to clearness of apprehension be not altogether without its use the properties of which chemistry takes cognizance are for the most part such as belong not to all matter nor to matter in general but to this or that particular species of matter as distinguished each of them from the rest by such a collection of these properties as taken in the aggregate belongs peculiarly to itself by this circumstance it is that this branch of art and science entitles itself to the appellation of idioscopic anthropurgics these properties are moreover in comparison with those which belong to the branch just mentioned recondite and unconspicuous requiring—to the production and in some instances as it were to the creation of them—more or less of human art and elaboration consisting chiefly in mixture and in the application of different degrees of temperature changes which in so far as the phenomena of heat and cold are considered as being the result of the absence or presence the influx or efflux of a particular species of matter termed caloric or the matter of heat may also be considered as referable to the head of mixture accordingly in the adequately expressive appellative mixiology or symmictology should any clear advantage be ever found derivable from the use of it the originally unexpressive term chemistry might at any time find an equally singleworded and by no means unexpressive synonym¶    division  0   division of anthropurgics into anapirical or anapiric and catastatical or catastatic† catastaticochrestic‡ this division has for its source the application or nonapplication of those newly discovered or created properties which art in conjunction with science has had for its fruits to the purposes of common life through the medium of commercially established art and manufacture art and manufacture established upon such a footing that their produce is become an object of commerce anapirical anthropurgics has for its synonym the familiar compound appellative experimental philosophy catastatical or catastatic anthropurgics has for its synonym the expressive already established and not altogether unfamiliar appellative technology§ this tenth division it is manifest is not with reference to the last preceding one subordinate but coordinate the aggregate being in both cases the same only the source from which the principle of division is derived different it comprehends accordingly and with equal propriety applies itself to the mechanical branch and the chemical the demand which in practice there seemed to be for this division viz experimental philosophy and technology being considered the appellatives which constitute the two branches of it being already in use a place in this sketch could not be refused to it true it is that from the first of these ideal receptacles as the newly produced fruits of art and science are converted into articles of commerce individual objects are continually passing into the second but of the appellations respectively given to the receptacles themselves the propriety remains unchanged beyond this point in the line of bifurcate division there seems not at present at least any adequate use in carrying on the investigation in this direction of the genus mechanics the species according to a list more or less approaching to completeness will be found ranged in a vertical line in a column of table i and so of the genus chemistry iii to return to pneumatology or pneumatics division    division of pneumatology into alegopathematic∥ nooscopic¶ and pathematoscopic pathoscopic†† alegopathematic or say alegoæsthetic pneumatology has for its singleworded synonym the not unexpressive appellation noology‡‡ it has for its subject spirit or mind considered apart from all feeling whether of the pleasurable or painful kind considered that is to say with reference to the purely intellectual part of the animal frame including simple perception memory judgment reasoning abstraction imagination c pathematoscopic pneumatology may have for its synomyn pneumatic or psychological∥∥ pathology    division    division of pathematoscopic pathoscopic pneumatology or say pneumatic or psychological pathology into aplopathematic† aplopathoscopic‡ and thelematoscopic§ aplopathematic pneumatology or pathology has for its subject the aggregate of pleasures and pains of all kinds considered apart from whatsoever influence in the character of motives the prospects of them may have upon the will or volitional faculty and the acts as well purely mental and internal as corporeal and external of which those prospects may become the causes∥ thelematoscopic pneumatology or pathology  0 has for a syonym the singleworded appellative ethics taken in its largest sense in the character of synonyms to ethics are also used in some circumstances the words morals and morality division    division of nooscopics or noology    into plasioscopic and coenonesioscopic†—plasioscopic i e formation—regarding coenonesioscopic i e communication—regarding to the head of plasioscopic noology may be referred the art of thinking with the correspondent science of what belongs to the formation of the matter of thought in so far as the work of formation can be kept in view and carried on in a state of separation from the work of communication as applied to the same individual portion of that ideal species of matter to the word logic considered as the name of a branch of art and science the conception that has been attached seems never to have been altogether so determinate and definite as could be wished but in one at least of the senses in which it has been employed it may be considered as the singleworded synonym of plasioscopic noology as above characterized division    division of coenonesioscopic noology or say coenonesiology into aplodidactic or say didactic and pathemategeretic pathocinetic‡ or say egeretic

the same whatsoever may be the particular purpose and occasion of the communication and the nature and subject of the thoughts communicated§ to the head of rhetoric seem commonly to have been referred those rules which have for their subject the choice capable of being made of words and combinations of words on occasions on which the communication made has for its purpose or in the number of its purposes the exercising an influence on the affections on the affections whether considered as having place in a calm state or as in that state of intensity and perturbation in which they receive the name of passions∥    division    first division of ethics taken in the largest sense of the word viz into    dicastic i e censorial and simply exegetic† i e expository or enunciative dioastic or censorial i e expressive of a judgment or sentiment of approbation or disapprobation as intended by the author of the discourse to be attached to the ideas of the several voluntary actions or say modifications of human conduct which in the course of it are brought to view in other words his opinion in relation to each such act on the question whether it ought to be done ought to be left undone or may without impropriety be done or left undone simply exegetic i e expository or enunciative viz in so far as without bestowing any such mark of approbation disapprobation or indifference the discourse has for its object the stating what in the opinion of the author has on each such occasion actually come to pass or is likely to have come to pass or to have place at present or to be about to come to pass in future—i e what act is on the occasion in question most likely to have been done to be doing or to be about to be done this division has for its source the nature of the mental faculty to which the discourse is immediately addressed in so far as the discourse is of the censorial cast the faculty to which it addresses itself and which in so doing it seeks to influence is the volitional—the will or at any rate the pathematic in so far as it is of the simply expository or enunciative cast the only faculty to which it immediately applies itself viz by seeking to afford information to it is the intellectual faculty the understanding for a synonym dicastic ethics may have the singleworded appellative deontology‡ the principle of division deduced from this    source will be seen to be applicable and accordingly applying itself severally to all the following ones division    division of ethics whether expository or dicastic into genicoscopic† i e general mattersregarding and idioscopic‡ i e particularmattersregarding synonyms to genicoscopic as applied to ethics are   theoretical   speculative synonyms to idioscopic as applied to ethics is the word

other practical of the observations expressed such part as is allotted to the explanation and fixation of the import of general words—words of extensive import the use of each of which is spread over the whole field or a large portion of the whole field of the art and science—will belong mostly to the genicoscopic theoretical or speculative branch and under the name of principles to the above observations will naturally be added any such rules whether of the expository or the censorial cast as in this respect are most extensive the deeper it descends into particulars the more plainly it will be seen to belong to the idioscopic in so far as with the incidents exhibited in the fictitious narrative any rules of a deontological nature as in modern productions is frequently the case

themselves as having in a greater or less degree a claim to notice subjoined to them respectively are a few questions in relation to which some satisfaction may not improbably it is supposed be looked for and will accordingly be here endeavoured to be afforded—   in the tabular diagram and accordingly in the explanation given of it the division or ramification professes all along to be exhaustive—question   what are the uses or advantages derivable from a tabular sketch exhibiting in one view a number more or less considerable of the branches of art and science answer see §  0—question   why branches of art and science and not arts and sciences answer because in every part of the field art and science are found together no branch of art without a correspondent branch of science—no branch of science without a correspondent branch of art it is not that in one part of the field you have an art in another a science in a third both but that in whatever part you have either you have both see chrestomathia table i note    supra p   —question   why exhaustive what are the uses and advantages resulting from its being so answer see §   —question   can it by any and what means be proved to be so answer see §   —question   the idea of the utility of exhaustiveness as applied to logical division—is it new to the scientific and in particular to the logical world answer far from new but at the same time not as yet quite so clear as it might be and it is hoped will here be rendered see §   —question   can any directions be given by the pursuance of which the exhaustiveness of a systematic sketch of the subdivisions and contents of any branch of art and science may be secured answer see §      the ramification is all along dichotomous alias bifurcate i e twopronged—question   why bifurcate rather than multifurcate answer to secure its being exhaustive concerning which see §   —question   is the idea of the necessity of bifurcation to exhaustiveness    new as above answer so it is supposed to be see §      of the first partition of this kind that occurs the result is composed of two and no more than two branches of art and science which are thereby represented as included in that one the division of which has thus been made and as containing between them the whole contents of it and so in the case of any other   of those two condivident branches the names are respectively formed by and composed of the name of the immediate trunk—which grammatically speaking is a nounsubstantive—followed in each of the two instances by a nounadjective question   of this twoworded name what is the use answer to afford a definition and by means of the definition an explanation of the name constituting the immediate trunk   being thus composed of two words put together each such name may in greeksprung language be termed a polyepic and in particular a biepic name in englishsprung language a manyworded and in particular a twoworded name   in every instance for reasons that have already been brought to view §   this twoworded name is in the first instance a greeksprung and in most instances a newlyframed denomination question why greeksprung answer see above §     in several instances in the character of synonyms subjoined to this principal biepic and greeksprung name are other such names one or more in each division for which see the notes question why these synonyms answer   that in each such group of names the identity of import between the several names may be established and in so far that error prevented which would have place if from diversity in the sign diversity in the object meant to be brought to view were inferred   that by each of these names the object may in future be made known—not by that name only but by any one or more of the others—so that on each occasion that one of them may be employed which with reference to that same occasion appears most convenient   in most instances to those greeksprung twoworded names are added one or more twoworded or manyworded englishsprung names question why these names answer to make known the import to such readers of english to whom the import of the greeksprung names new as they mostly are—especially to english readers—would not explain itself by the unavoidable awkwardness of these compound english names will be afforded the only justification that could be afforded for the practice of employing any such names as being borrowed from a foreign language—and that a dead one—are until explanations of them have respectively been given and received not intelligible to any but the comparatively small number of those by whom the import of the corresponding foreign words happens to be understood   also in several instances newcoined monoepic or singleworded greeksprung names question   to what purpose are they thus added answer to show by what means in these several instances the facility afforded by the use of singleworded appellatives may be substituted to the entanglement and embarrassment produced by the use of manyworded ones  0 also in several instances appellatives already in familiar use question   for what purpose are these added answer for the purpose of contributing to the fixation of the import of these most familiar terms viz by presenting the clearest and most correct conception that can be afforded of the mutual relations of the objects respectively designated by them—and thus giving the greatest extent that can be given to whatsoever benefits may be derivable from the use of a table constructed in this mode    the first singleworded names that occur viz eudæmonics and its associate ontology both of them greeksprung are so many names of that trunk which with reference to the several pairs of branches—products of successive acts of partition or ramification—may be styled the universal trunk—eudæmonics the universal trunk of arts ontology of sciences    with reference to the two branches into which it is divided the name of every branch of art and science which here presents itself may as above be termed the name of the immediate trunk every such immediate trunk may with reference to the universal trunk be styled a particular or partial trunk    any number of trunks intervening between the universal trunk and the partial trunk in question may with reference to these two trunks be styled intermediate trunks    the trunk which stands next to the universal trunk may be styled the partial trunk of the first rank or order that which stands next to it the partial trunk of the second rank or order and so on    in some instances several partial trunks are of the same rank or order this is the case as often as from different sources the same trunk is successively subjected to so many different divisive operations in this case whatsoever be the number of these operations the divisions performed by them may in every instance be equally exhaustive be the numbers of sets of branches viz in so far as the bifurcate mode is conformed to pairs of branches ever so numerous the operations themselves and the pairs of branches which    are respectively their results are all with reference to each other coordinate with reference to the results of a division performed on any trunk of a higher rank the highest rank being expressed by the smallest number subordinate with reference to the results of a division performed on a trunk of a lower rank superordinate    the relation which by the lesser aggregate designated by the name attached to any such subordinate trunk is borne to the greater aggregate designated by the name attached to its immediate superordinate is the same as that which in the language of the current logic a species bears to its next immediate genus—the genus of which it is the immediate species the trunk here styled the universal trunk corresponds to the genus generalissimum of logicians    contrarily to the usage which seems chiefly if not exclusively prevalent—for giving intimation of the relation which in each instance is represented as having place between the trunk and its two immediate branches the word is—instead of being omitted and left to be supplied by the reader is inserted question   why thus depart from the most usual it being also the most simple mode answer   to exclude obscurity unless the sign of this instrument of connexion is brought to view no meaning is fully and adequately expressed—unless the import of it is present to the mind no meaning is comprehended true it is that to the mind of one to whom tables of this kind are to a certain degree familiar the import of this necessary bond of connexion may at the first glance and at the same instant have been presented by those words of the proposition which are inserted and thus far no obscurity has place but other minds there may be by which though through the abovementioned means this same conception will sooner or later have been obtained by them yet for some time it will not have been obtained and till it is obtained the undesirable quality of obscurity remains in the object and the unpleasant sense of fruitless labour in the mind to which the object is presented answer   to exclude ambiguity—by the sort of omission here in question it may be that in the individual sketch in question framed as it is here framed the imperfection thus denominated would not have been found produced but in a table framed in the manner in which to say the least most tables constructed for the sort of purpose here in question have been framed the imperfection would it is believed be apt to have place two cases may be mentioned in either of which it has place   in so far as between any two nouns that have place in the table a doubt arises what is the copula intended viz whether the simple copula—the verb substantive—or this or that complex copula that is any verb other than the verb substantive†   in so far as this simple copula being the one fixed upon so it is that of the nouns for the connexion of which it is capable of serving the number is greater than two a doubt arises for the connexion of what two or more it was intended to serve in the table of dalembert these doubts—one of them at least if not both—will frequently it is believed be found presenting themselves answer   to exclude misconception—as often as of two conceptions by the simultaneous existence of which ambiguity is presented one alone is that which was intended by him whose discourse the discourse is here the ambiguity has two issues or modes of termination either of them capable of taking place in so far as that which happens to be embraced by the reader is different from that which was intended by the writer misconception is the result    for presenting to view so many different classes of the words of which the table in question is composed so many different types are it may be observed employed—viz   for the designation of the greeksprung words which in conjunction with the name of the immediate trunk constitute respectively the twoworded names of its immediate branches italics and these in a comparatively large type are employed   —  for the familiar english words which when strung together in the form of one composite word form those appellatives which to the english reader are designed to afford an explanation of the in most instances new and in every instance greeksprung epithet—the common roman types and in a comparatively small size are employed   —  for the words which form respectively those singleworded appellatives which    being of greek origin and for the most part new have on the present occasion been framed for the present purpose—the sort of type called blackletter is employed  0—  for those words which being respectively names of so many branches of art and science are already in the english language and in familiar use—for these appellatives whether singleworded or twoworded—capital letters are employed    as the trunks which they respectively designate recede further and further from the universal trunk the types employed for these capitals are smaller and smaller questions respecting articles    to    question   why for the different classes of words employ types of different species—answer that at short glances the differences may be the more rapidly and clearly apprehended question   why for trunks at different distances from the universal trunk employ types of different sizes—answer that the relations which have place in respect of extent of import between these several terms may be the more rapidly and clearly apprehended question   for the english manyworded appellatives viz epithets inserted for the explanation of the corresponding greeksprung and mostly newcoined appellatives why employ so small a type—answer in order that forming as it were so many botches they may while offering themselves to the eye rather recede from it than meet it so as not to be looked at but in proportion as the demand for the use of them presents itself uncouth as this portion of the language here employed cannot be denied to be it is not more so than that in which for the accommodation of english readers entire works viz on the subject of botany may be seen composed question   for those names of arts and sciences which are already in familiar use why employ large and conspicuous capitals answer that with a particular degree of force they may attract the eye two main uses of the table being the helping to fix the imports respectively attached to these most frequently employed appellatives and to exhibit to view in the clearest manner the mutual relations between the objects which they are respectively employed to designate    by the familiar sign composed of the letters i e—initials of the latin words id est—the eye is throughout conducted to the abovementioned explanatory words explanatory of the greeksprung adjectives by the kindred sign viz for videlicet to those appellatives in common use to which for the reason abovementioned the types called capitals have been allotted    though by means of some of the abovementioned appellatives—viz trunk universal trunk partial trunks and intermediate branches the matter of the table is spoken of as if it were arranged in the form of a tree yet the position of the object styled the universal trunk is at the top of the table and that of the branches instead of being higher and higher is lower and lower as they recede from it question why this apparent contradiction and incongruity answer that here in the tabular diagram as in the continued explanatory discourse those parts which for the understanding of it require to be first read may be the first to meet the eye nor at bottom is there any absolute contradiction in the case roots as well as trunks have their branches and in the instance of a numerous tribe of plants in a word in that of trees in general by so simple a cause as a change in the surrounding medium branches being buried in the earth while roots are exposed to the air not only under the hand of the artist but even under the hand of nature roots are found convertible into branches as well as branches into roots section x uses of a synoptic encyclopedical table or diagram by the name of an encyclopedical sketch two perfectly different however nearly related objects may with equal propriety be designated and under that common appellative thereby comprehended the one is a continued discourse expressed in the forms of ordinary language the other is a systematic table or diagram so constructed as to be in some degree emblematic in the continued discourse the relations in question are expressed at length in words and words alone in the emblematic diagram some image is employed by reason of which while by their respective names the objects in question are presented to the eye all of them in the same place and at the same time certain relations    which they bear to one another are at the same time held up to view as to the image that of a tree with its trunk and branches is that which in the earliest example known was thus employed nor does it appear that the nature of the case affords any object better adapted to this purpose to the form of a continued discourse the advantage attached is that the quantity of explanation given by it is not restricted but with this advantage is connected a disadvantage viz that if it be of a certain length it is only in succession that the several parts of it are presented to and can be taken cognizance of by the eye so that unless it be under the constantly repeated trouble and embarrassment of turning backwards and forwards leaf after leaf or that of a constant strain upon the memory or both no comparison of part to part can be made in the systematic diagram the advantage is that for the purpose of uninterrupted and universal comparison continued to any length after the objects with their several relations have been respectively explained each of them at whatever length may have been deemed requisite in and by the continued discourse the whole assemblage of them is or at least as abovementioned may be so brought together as to be kept under the eye at once forming as it were so many parts of one and the same picture thus it is that to this form two perfectly distinguishable howsoever closely connected advantages both of them of a practical nature are attached in the first place of the whole matter taken together conception is facilitated and expedited in the next place comparison—reciprocal comparison—the articles being capable of being run over for all purposes in all directions and in all imaginable orders of succession without interruption and with that rapidity which is proverbial as being among the characters of thought to set against these advantages no disadvantage has place except that to the quantity of matter to which this form is capable of being given there are limits which apply not to the other but within these limits here as in a map or an assortment of maps it is seldom that be the purpose what it may within the quantity of space capable of being thus employed a quantity of matter sufficient for the purpose will not be capable of being displayed anterior to the time of bacon were the profit worth the trouble encyclopedical sketches might even in the tabular form it is believed be found and in both forms in no inconsiderable abundance but by the true lights shed upon the field of thought and action and thence upon the field of art and science by that resplendent genius all those false lights have been extinguished of the two abovedistinguished forms of which an encyclopedical sketch is susceptible the only one however of which the works of bacon afford an exemplification is that of a continued discourse the purely verbal form in like manner in no other than the purely verbal form and that too wrought in a looser texture may be seen the encyclopedical sketch prefixed by ephraim chambers to his dictionary of arts and sciences with the two encylopedical sketches of bacon and chambers before him dalembert prefixed to the french encyclopedia his encyclopedical sketch in the purely verbal form taken as he says chiefly from bacon and moreover—and for the first time reckoning from the days of bacon—that correspondent sketch in the form of a systematic diagram which is here copied† and which has been the subject of the remarks given above this diagram is exhibited by him in the character of the principal object and it is in the character of an explanation of that principal object that the continued and purely verbal discourse attached to it is delivered by him notwithstanding the imperfections above held up to view to which others might have been added signal was the service which in the estimation of the authors collaborators among whom were numbered almost all the men of any literary eminence whom france at that time afforded was rendered by the instrument  00 so constructed as hath been seen in it they beheld nor with other eyes has it been beholden it is believed in that or other countries by their contemporaries or their successors a sort of novum organum in miniature a sort of instrument which every man to whose lot it has fallen to labour upon a scale of any considerable extent in any part of the field of art and science ought to have constantly in his hands and before his eyes to what instruction soever may have been extractible from that diagram whether any and what addition has been afforded by the remarks herein above made on it together with the subjoined sample of another executed upon a plan considerably different the reader will judge a table of this sort may be considered as an instrument in the hand of analogy scarce will the art be found from which through the medium of analogy assistance may not in some shape or other be borrowed by some other art not to say by every other by analogy scarce will the article of knowledge be found by which in some shape or other light may not be received from some other not to say every other conception retention combination generalization analysis distribution comparison methodization invention—for all or any of these purposes with an encyclopedical tree in his hand suited to the particular object which he has in view skipping backwards and forwards with the rapidity of thought from twig to twig hunting out and pursuing whatsoever analogies it appears to afford the eye of the artist or of the man of science may at pleasure make its profit of the labour expended on this field yes true it is that no otherwise than through individual objects can any clear ideas be imbibed from the names of those ideal aggregates or bundles of different sorts and sizes into which by the associating and dividing power of those appellations they are collected and distributed but from a comparatively small number of individual objects may be obtained very instructive and practically serviceable ideas of very extensive aggregates many years age forty thousand or thereabouts was supposed to be the number of species of plants at that time more or less known forty thousand the number of those ideal aggregates designated by the name of species millions of millions the number of the individuals at each moment designated by those same specific names yet from any one of those individuals may be abstracted a tolerably adequate idea of the species in which it is considered as contained and how small is the number of species necessary to plant in the mind the prodigiously extensive idea designated by the word plant by attention applying itself all along with still closer and closer grasp by this faculty it is that advances fresh and fresh advances all of them so many conquests are continually made in the field of art and science each laborious and inventive adventurer proceeds on in the wilderness as far as his inclination and the force of his mind will carry him sooner or later the same man or another more frequently another makes a road whereby to succeeding travellers the quantity of labour necessary to the reaching of that farthest point is more or less reduced by successive labourers of this pioneering class the road is made gradually smoother and smoother where one ends another begins and hence it is that the veriest pigmy is at present able to look down from a point which by his utmost exertions the giant of anterior times could never reach that of the branches of art and science which by the denominations here employed are thus endeavoured to be brought to view the distinctness is in a multitude of instances far from corresponding to the distinctness of the denominations themselves is but too true and presents to view an imperfection no less undeniable than it is believed to be irremediable in this tract approximation is throughout the utmost that can be hoped for but unless and until some other scheme of distribution shall have been found such as shall be exempt from or at least in a less degree exposed to this imputation of indistinctness than that which is here submitted the imperfection so long as the work has any use will not afford any sufficient reason for leaving it unattempted that no scheme will be found altogether exempt from the imperfection may be asserted with full assurance and if any scheme less tinctured with it than the present one is could on this occasion and by these eyes have been found that and not this would have been the scheme in this place brought to view let it not at any rate be said that by reason of this indistinctness it is no more than upon a par with those other encyclopedical sketches in the hope of superseding which it has been framed between the degree and even the species of indistinctness which has place in the two cases wide indeed it is believed will be seen to be the difference in this sketch to borrow a phrase from scottish history in this sketch may here and there be found it is true a small proportion of debateable land concerning which it may be dubious to which of two contiguous districts it may with most propriety be said to belong but in those cases many are the instances in which the whole of the territory which is represented as belonging exclusively to one of two districts may with equal propriety be said to belong to either or to both  0  section xi the mode of division should as far as may be be exhaustive—why if of a sketch of the kind in question the utility is by any person recognised to satisfy him of the utility of its being rendered exhaustive not many words can it is supposed be necessary to be exhaustive the parts which at each partition or division so made are the results of the operation must if put together again be equal to the whole and thus and in this sense exhaust to use the word employed by logicians the contents of the whole it is only in so far as the divisions which it contains are in this sense respectively exhaustive that the information contained in a work which is composed of them can be complete—can be what it appears to undertake for being can be what it might be and what if it might it ought to be this being the case if it be not exhaustive every proposition in which the exhaustiveness and completeness of the division is assumed will in so far as the assumption is proceeded upon be pro tanto erroneous and incorrect and if received and acted upon delusive and in whatsoever stage of the division the incompleteness has place the consequence is that in every subdivision the original imperfection is repeated and the correspondent part of the work tainted with it but it is only by means of a system of division carried on in the thus declaredly exhaustive mode that any assurance can be afforded or obtained that the survey taken of the field of thought and action and therein of the field of science and art or of whatsoever portion of that field is proposed to be comprehended in the survey is complete any assurance that in the course of the progress made through it a number of parts in unlimited abundance each to an unlimited extent may not have been omitted it is only in this way that even supposing the whole to have been actually embraced and comprehended in the survey it can in the mind that has embraced it wear the aspect and character of a whole instead of that of a regular tree the form in which it presents itself will be no other than that of a confused heap of unconnected fragments—each of them in respect of form and quantity boundless and indeterminate in the body of this work intimation was given of what presented itself as the chief use derivable from an insight more or less extensive into those foreign languages ancient and modern in which the vernacular language has its roots it consists it was said in this viz that to an eye thus instructed in the whole field of the language there being no hard words there shall be no absolutely dark spots nothing that shall have the effect of casting a damp upon the mind by presenting to it the idea of its ignorance and thence of its weakness correspondent to the sort of consciousness of power so obtainable in the field of language is that which by means of a set of systematic sketches—and an particular by means of a set of systematic and tabular diagrams—always supposing the mode pursued to be exhaustive may be obtained and exercised over the field of art and science no parts in it from which through the medium of these appropriate denominations the relations of which as well those to one another as to the matter of the body or branch of art and science are determined and brought to view ideas more or less clear correct and complete are not radiated to the surveying eye in a word no absolutely dark spots no words that do not contribute their share towards the production of so desirable an effect as that of substituting the exhilarating perception of mental strength to the humiliating consciousness of ignorance and weakness desirable as this property will it is hoped be acknowledged to be with reference to the purpose at present in question—a purpose will now be mentioned to which it must be acknowledged not to be applicable relations of logical identity and diversity and relations of practical dependence as between branch and branch both these sets of relations have already been mentioned as capable of being with good effect brought to view in the form of a synoptic table but for the exhibition of relations thus different neither can any one table nor any number of tables upon this same plan be made to serve in the plan of division and correspondent distribution pursued in the view given of the logical relations as above explained exhaustiveness will indeed always be an essential feature but where the relations to be exhibited are the practical sort of relations just spoken of viz those of dependence or say of subservience whether the subservience be mutual or but unilateral the nature of the subject admits not of any such regularity and allcomprehensiveness from branches of art and science the most remote from one another in the logical tree one and the same art may be seen looking for  0  assistance natural history anatomy chemistry architecture political history ethics—all these not to mention any more the painter not to speak of the poet may have occasion to summon to his aid exercising dominion over almost every branch of art and science sometimes in furtherance of the interests of the professors of that particular branch more frequently and more necessarily in furtherance of the interests of the whole community the legislator on pain of acting blindfold has need of an insight—the more clear correct and extensive the better—into the matter of every such branch of art and science for his use therefore to the table of logical relations exhibited upon an exhaustive plan a table of relations of dependence or subservience as above explained constructed upon a plan in which particularity and copiousness should be the ruling objects would be an essential accompaniment section xii test of allcomprehensiveness in a division how constructed—additional advantages distinctness and instinctiveness bifurcation why necessary a problem is here proposed and undertaken to be solved a logical aggregate of any kind as designated by any appropriate name being given required to divide it into a number of parts each in like manner designated by a distinctive name in such sort that in the sum of these parts shall be contained the same individuals and all the individuals which and no other individuals than those which are contained in the whole such is the problem the solution of which is requisite for the present purpose in other words the solution of it consists in securing to the parts into which the sort of whole in question is to be divided the property of allcomprehensiveness for the accomplishing of this solution what has been found necessary is the construction of an instrument such as being employed in the divisional operation in question and thereby in the conformation of the parts which are the results of it shall serve as a test in such sort as to demonstrate if such be really the case that the division thus effected is in fact an allcomprehensive one call it accordingly the test of allcomprehensiveness an instrument of this sort has accordingly been constructed† and on turning to the encyclopædical table will be seen to have in every part of it been explicitly or implicitly employed it consists in what may be called the contradictory formula the essence of which consists in the sign of negation employed or employable in the designation of some one in each pair of branches and not in that of the other but of this presently in and by the word pair as applied to the branches thus produced what is already implied is that by the instrument in question it is only in the way of bisection that the problem can be solved but in this mode it will be seen that every desirable purpose may be accomplished that it cannot by any other mode and that on any occasion at pleasure by division into two parts division into any other number of parts may if there be any use in it be accomplished of the desirable property which on this occasion stands as the principal object and occupies the foreground—allcomprehensiveness having for its synonym as already explained the word exhaustiveness—is the name but by the same means by which to the scheme of division in question this property is secured two other desirable properties as it will be seen are at this same time secured viz distinctness and instructiveness intimately as they are connected with the principal property and by the same docimastic instrument secured to the scheme of division executed by means of it what will at the same time be seen is that these two subsidiary properties are not either of them inseparable from it instances require to be shown and will accordingly be shown in which a scheme of division is or may be allcomprehensive without being distinct and allcomprehensive and distinct without being instructive‡ for securing clearness to the ideas attached  0  to the names of those three properties a few words of explanation may have their use   of allcomprehensiveness with its synonym exhaustiveness enough has in this view been said already   by distinctness as applied to the division in question whether by the word division what is here meant be the operation or the result by distinctness what is meant is that of all the individuals contained in the subject of the division viz the trunk or say the major aggregate it shall when the division has been performed be in the instance of every such individual clear and manifest to which of the several branches it belongs   by instructiveness is meant a property which bears relation and applies to both the others it consists in this viz that the words employed for giving denomination to the branches shall be such as to declare and announce that the division is allcomprehensive as also that it is distinct of this property it will be seen that neither is it useless nor is the warning thus given to secure to the scheme of division the benefit of it superfluous   the property is not useless for from the property of allcomprehensiveness no use can be derived but in so far as the scheme of division is understood to be possessed of it and so in the case of distinctness   neither is the warning superfluous for various it will be seen are the instances in which these properties though really possessed by the branches into which by the current names employed in the designation of them the trunk has been divided yet such is the structure of those names are not held up by them to view and are therefore of little or no use thus much as to the desirable properties which by the test above alluded to viz the contradictory formula have been secured it is supposed to the scheme of division here employed—now as to the contradictory formula itself examples of it have been in existence as long as the logical tree of rames improperly as will be seen attributed to porphyrius has been in existence examples of it are as above the matter of which the encyclopædical tree here attempted is composed what remains to be done here is to point out the precise part to which the appellation is meant to be applied and the ground on which it has been thus applied in the instance of each trunk observation has been made of a particular property as being possessed by every individual to which the name of the generic say the major or comprehending aggregate employed to represent the trunk is applied possessed moreover in like manner by every individual is a property to which the name of the minor or comprehended aggregate the relatively specific appellative employed to designate one of the two branches is applied—but as to the other of the two branches not possessed by any one of the individuals to which the appellative employed to designate that branch is applied having thus the effect of giving as it were birth to and at any rate indication of the distinctness supposed to be possessed by the two branches this property may be termed the distinctive property this subject be it what it may is possessed of this quality be it what it may this subject meaning the same subject† is not possessed of the quality meaning the same quality—these two are—as the logicians call them and as any body may see they are—a pair of contradictory viz mutually contradictory propositions the former of these may be termed the positive contradictory the other the negative in regard to contradictories such for shortness is the term employed instead of saying a pair of mutually contradictory propositions two observations have been made by logicians and delivered in the character of axioms one is that to whatsoever property and with reference to whatsoever subject these opposite assertions are applied in no instance will they both of them be found true the other is that to whatsoever quality and with reference to whatsoever subject they are applied one or other of them will be found true‡  0  an example may here perhaps be required turning to the encyclopædical tree letterpress or diagram take then for the dividendum viz the trunk or major aggregate the branch of art and science therein denominated posology but commonly called mathematics it having been proposed in an allcomprehensive and distinct manner to divide this major aggregate into two minor aggregates exhibited in the character of branches a property was looked out for which being possessed by every individual object comprehended in the major aggregate as also by every individual in one of the two aggregates into which the major aggregate was to be divided—and at the same time not possessed by any individual not comprehended in that same minor aggregate—might for the purpose of distinguishing each of the two minor aggregates from the other serve in the character of a distinctive property in the property of bearing relation to form or say figure—i e in the property of taking for its subject form or figure—a property which seemed capable of being employed in the character of a distinctive property was found of the two minor aggregates into which by this means the major aggregate posology or mathematics was divided formregarding or figureregarding posology or mathematics in greeksprung language morphoscopic posology was the name given to the positive minor aggregate this done the name of the negative minor aggregate was thereby determined and given viz formnotregarding in greeksprung language amorphoscopic posology or to exclude ambiguity alegomorphoscopic but in that portion of the matter of discourse which in the table is employed for giving expression to these two minor aggregates in the character of branches of the major aggregate of the division of which they are the immediate results is contained the import of the abovementioned formula brought to view under the name of the contradictory formula the division of which they are the results is therefore at the same time allcomprehensive or say exhaustive and distinct it is moreover instructive for in and by the terms of it the allcomprehensiveness and distinctness which really belong to it are declared speaking of propositions delivered on the subject of mathematics—this proposition does regard figure—this proposition does not regard figure of no one proposition delivered on the subject of mathematics will these two contradictories be found both of them to hold good and if of all the propositions which do thus regard figure one branch of mathematics be and there is nothing to hinder it from being composed and if of all those which do not thus regard figure another and the whole of that other branch be composed here we have two branches in one or other of which every conceivable proposition belonging to mathematics will be found to be contained for each one of these minor aggregates or branches when in the character of a major aggregate in pursuance of the divisional process it came itself to be divided in lieu of or at least in addition to the manyworded appellative which in its character of a branch is in the first instance employed to designate it there should be a singleworded appellative in the words geometry and arithmetic two words in current use presented themselves as being—and that without any violence done to their established imports—capable of being employed in this character i e as comprehending between them the whole of the import which either is or with propriety can be  0  comprehended in the import of the word mathematics with propriety ie without outstretching the most extensive import for the designation of which that appellative has ever been employed on this occasion the pair of names which for these two branches of mathematics have on this occasion been in the first place brought to view are the two newlydevised manyworded ones but the pair of names by which those names and the relation of which they are expressive were in the first instance suggested are the two oldestablished singleworded ones geometry and arithmetic considered as branches of art and science in what particular it was asked do they agree the answer was obvious enough—as being both of them branches of mathematics so far so good but forasmuch as they are not the same branch in what is it that they differ of a survey taken of the contents of each with a view to this question the result was that to which as above the pair of manyworded appellatives have given expression in one of them figure is regarded in the other not now then thanks to the encyclopædical names—of the two trivial names viz geometry and arithmetic which are in use to be employed in the designation of these two branches of mathematical art and science the allcomprehensiveness† will it is believed be readily enough and generally enough recognised nor will the distinctness‡ it is believed be found to be in any greater degree exposed to dispute at the same time in regard to instructiveness as above explained the utter absence of this quality will in the instance of both these trivial names be found it is believed equally manifest and thence it was that as soon as it did present itself it was in the character of a sort of discovery that the coincidence of these two imports with the imports of the two manyworded appellatives to which they are here stated as being respectively synonymous presented itself—and in this same character howsoever it may be in the case of an adept in the case of many a learner there seems little doubt of its presenting itself of the nature of the contradictory formula the explanation above given will it is hoped be found tolerably intelligible its capacity of serving in the character of a test of allcomprehensiveness and distinctness in a logical division will also it is hoped be recognised in the formation of the encyclopædical appellatives employed in the table this test will in several instances be seen actually and explicitly employed included as it is in the composition of the words themselves other instances however there are in which it is not thus employed in the production of this omission two considerations whether sufficient or not concurred one was—that by the employment of the two epithets both in the positive form and independent of each other instead of no more than one positive one  0  with the correspondent negative a greater quantity of instruction might in a given compass be conveyed the other was—that in some instances doubts seemed to hang over the question which of the two contradictory properties should be presented in the positive form which in the negative and on whichever side the determination might happen to fall for explaining the grounds of such determination more words might become necessary than could well be spared of the plan of nomenclature here pursued the characteristic property accordingly is—not that in the composition of either name of the pair the criterion in question—the sign of the contradictory formula—has in every instance been actually employed but that in the character of a test of the allcomprehensiveness and distinctness of the division in the expression of which these names have been employed a pair of names in one of which this sign is employed may without misrepresentation in every instance in which it has not been thus employed be added or substituted of the lights which the nature of the work admits of and requires the encyclopædical names thus provided though they are the only instruments are not it should be observed the only objects other objects for the illustration of which the demand as being much more general is accordingly still more urgent are those current names examples of which have just been brought to view and which wheresoever they could be found have been sought out and put by the side of those encyclopædical names with the imports of which their respective imports seemed to approach nearest to a coincidence unfortunately that this coincidence should be perfect is in many instances plainly impossible such it will be seen to be in every instance in which the import attached to the current name is in any degree indeterminate and the further this import is from being determinate the further will the agreement be from amounting to a perfect coincidence unfortunately again these instances are at present but too numerous of one of these mention has already been made and without need of looking elsewhere among such of these names as are comprehended in this table other instances will it is believed be found observable to the satisfaction of the reader that in so far as it has place observation of the impossibility in question should be taken is highly necessary otherwise where everything has been done that can be done it may appear to him that nothing has been done to give determinateness to the import of an appellative of his own framing depends upon the author not so as to that of any of those which he finds already made towards effecting that coincidence which as abovementioned is so highly desirable all that depends upon him is in the first place to give to the appellatives of his own framing that degree of determinateness which the nature of the case admits of and in the next place among those which he finds ready made to choose for synonyms to those of his own making such trivial names the import of which appears upon the whole to come nearest to that of his own being at the same time if in any in the smallest degree indeterminate for securing determinateness to those of his own framing the established logical expedient of the distinctive property afforded to the author of this table an effectual means for choosing out of the existing stock of trivial names such as should stand least exposed to the imputation of indeterminateness no equal security could be afforded by the nature of the case in this way though by no direct and immediate means can determinateness be given to the import of those current names of which at present the import is indeterminate yet in time and by means of the instrument of fixation here brought to view an object so desirable may gradually perhaps be accomplished by the supposition a standard of comparison and reference will have been set up supposing it to be what it is intended to be and in the nature of the case well capable of being made supposing it to be in itself clear and as near as may be to the range of the variable one conformity to this standard will be found matter of general convenience and in proportion as the fixed import comes to be adopted the varying one in all its variations will drop out of use what if in this way and by these means the import of all words especially of all words belonging to the field of ethics including the field of politics and therein the field of political religion should one day become fixed what a source of perplexity of error of discord and even of bloodshed would be dried up towards a consummation thus devoutly to be wished there does seem to be a natural tendency but ere this auspicious tendency shall have been perfected into effect how many  0  centuries not to say tens of centuries must have passed away all this while on the nearness of the approach made to a perfect coincidence depend the strength and utility of the mental light capable of being reflected upon each others import by the two denominations the encyclopædical and the trivial hence comes the need of a memento to which expression may be given by the following rule—for determining the contents of the two branches into which the trunk in question is to be divided look out for that distinctive property by the application of which such a pair of branches shall be produced the imports of which shall come as near as possible to the imports of the two appellatives already in current use of the above rule in no instance will any neglect be followed by impunity he who taking up a word gives a definition of it issues thereby a requisition calling upon as many as read or hear of it to use the word in that sense let the word thus defined be a word of a mans own creation in this case if so it be that for this newinvented instrument an adequate use can be found—provided also that the newlyattributed import is not contradictory to any import already attached to it—if both these conditions are fulfilled then so it is that for any expectation he may happen to entertain of seeing the requisition generally complied with a substantial ground has been laid on the other hand if it be a word in common use in that case if the import thus newly endeavoured to be attached to it be to a certain degree at variance with common use the consequence is—what—that against the sort of law which he is thus taking upon himself to enact he finds nor is there any reason why he should not find as many rebels as there are persons by whom in its old established sense the word has been in use to be employed fixation yes this may be endured comparatively at least the thing is not difficult the use is manifest substitution no the difficulty is extreme and that difficulty not atoned for by any the smallest use   define your words says the capital rule laid down and so much insisted upon by locke—yes define your words—but in addition to this rule a subsidiary one there is the demand for which will it is believed be scarcely found less imperative   in defining a word if it be a word in current use be it your care that the import you are thus endeavouring to attach to it be not only determinate but as near to the current import as a determinate import can be to an indeterminate one in the character of a distinguishable addition to the mass of instruction afforded by means of the contradictory formula may perhaps be mentioned the series of those definitions which thus in substance and almost in form presenting themselves at every joint give to the whole system a degree of precision and compactness altogether incapable of being infused into it by any other means so many pairs of branches or minor aggregates so many pairs of definitions major aggregate at each joint a genus its two immediate branches the two minor aggregates its species the distinctive property with its negative the two specific or differential characters to this advantage a brief reference has been already made viz in the section §   in which the particular characters of the encyclopædical tree are brought to view such being the advantages indicated by the terms allcomprehensiveness distinctness and instructiveness as applied to a scheme of logical division—in the next place comes the question—in what way if in any is the existence of these advantages attached to the use of the bifurcate as contradistinguished from the multifurcate mode to this question the answer has probably in the mind of many a reader already presented itself to the bifurcate mode alone to the bifurcate mode and not to the multifurcate is the test of allcomprehensiveness and distinctness viz the contradictory formula applicable after the explanation above given exists there any person in whose eyes when compared with the bifurcate the multifurcate mode would be preferable to a tree or any part of a tree once constructed in the bifurcate mode might be substituted a tree constructed in the multifurcate mode without trouble and almost without a thought throw out the encyclopædical names put together the current names—the thing is done the plan of division pursued suppose it all along allcomprehensive and distinct the allcomprehensiveness and the distinctness would after this change  0  remain to the matter as expressed in the multifurcate mode but the proof of its being allcomprehensive the proof of its being distinct and the instruction afforded by the language by which this proof is expressed all this would be gone after these deductions made by this means out of a system constructed and exhibited in the bifurcate mode you might have remaining a system equally good constructed or at least exhibited in the multifurcate mode constructed yes but in what manner exactly in the manner in which in his oration given to an audience of shoemakers orator henley showed them how by one man a gross of shoes might be made in a day viz by cutting them out of a gross of boots of this conversion the converse would not be altogether so easy nor indeed without addition supposing the multifurcate tree to be in any one of its ramifications less than allcomprehensive would it be possible on the opposite supposition however i e if in every one of its ramifications it be supposed to be allcomprehensive the converse would be possible of the required bifurcate tree the matter would on this supposition in part though only in part be given and as to the mode of filling up the deficiencies it has already been explained and may be seen exemplified in the table of a division which in the article of allcomprehensiveness is deficient an example should any person be desirous of it may with equal facility be extracted from the same table take for instance natural history branches upon the multifurcate plan supposing it in the execution allcomprehensive three viz mineralogy botany and zoology suppose any one of them left out thus instead of the allcomprehensive division you have an imperfect or as euclid might have said a deficient one† that for obtaining a clear correct allcomprehensive and commanding view of the contents of any logical aggregate or whole bifurcate in contradistinction to multifurcate is the only adequate mode another consideration may perhaps help to satisfy us of two objects and no more can the eye of man whether it be of the bodily and real or the mental and fictitious organ that the word be understood as designative obtain any usefully distinct view at the same time vibrating as it were between the two and at each vibration applying as euclid might have said to the impression made by the one the still vivid idea‡  0  of the other one by one it can compare them but if any greater number say three be presented to it at the same time then so it is that for any such purpose as that of obtaining a perception of those reciprocal points of coincidence and diversity ere it can bestow upon them a steady and persevering consideration it will find itself under the necessity of dividing them in the first place into two lots in one of which it will place one of them and in the other lot either it will place one alone of the two remaining objects or if both then for the purpose of comparing the other object of the comparison the two will be put together and by conjunction in the same lot be in imagination reduced to one endeavours are used suppose to consider and compare all three at the same time what will be the consequence—that while any two of them are thus kept in comparison the third before any clear and decided judgment can be formed in relation to these two will be obtruding itself confusion will thus ensue and a necessity will be found of recommencing the comparison and so toties quoties one word more on the subject of instructiveness in the exhaustively bifurcate mode—in and by means of the ramified chain of virtual definitions which have been brought to view—at each joint a pair or rather a triplet of relations has been brought to view viz the relation of each minor aggregate to the immediate major aggregate and the relation of each minor aggregate to the other the two first relations of identity and coincidence the third a relation of diversity and separation but of every object of the understanding be it what it may the nature is the more thoroughly known the greater the number is of those relations† which it is seen to bear to other objects and were it only in virtue of its being an object of the understanding every such object bears some relation—in truth a multitude of relations to every other by algebra whatsoever riddles are solved are solved—whatsoever is done is done—by the converting of this or that unknown quantity into a known one a conversion which neither is nor ever can be effected in any other way than by means of a relation which it bears viz the relation termed the relation of equality‡ which in a case that affords nothing but quantity is the same as the relation of identity to such or such other quantity or quantities which were known already no object is known but in so far as its properties are known and for every property the manifestation of which depends upon any other object a correspondent relation between   0 the two objects must be acknowledged to have place section xiii† exhaustiveness as applied by logical division—the idea whence taken—saundersons logic—porphyrian or ramean tree—hermes to the author of these pages the first object by which the idea of exhaustiveness as applied to logical division was suggested was a chapter of saundersons logic which has this operation for its subject much about that same time viz some four and fifty years ago on the occasion of a set of collegelectures in which that book of saundersons was employed as a textbook the copy of it now lying on the table received in manuscript a copy of a diagram of a logical tree therein called arbor porphyriana—the porphyrian tree—exactly m table iv arbor porphyriana seu potius ramea being a diagram contrived for exhibiting at one view the principal divisions of the aggregate mass of real entities as designated by the word substantia employed by the latin logicians in imitation of their grecian masters as the name of a correspondent genus styled the genus generalissimum such divisions being designated by their several singleworded trivial or current names preceded by their several manyworded names herein termed encyclopædical names by which are expressed the mutual relations borne by one to another of the several assortments of objects so denominated such assortments being the results of the several corresponding divisional operations to which the matter of the whole aggregate mass has been subjected n b   this diagram exhibits the earliest example known of a system of logical divisions executed in the exhaustivelybifurcate mode with the test of exhaustiveness applied to each joint or ramification such test being in each instance expressed in and by the denomination given to the negative one of the two branches or minor aggregates—n b   of the system in question an explanation is given by porphyrius one of aristotles commentators in his isagoge i e introduction to the organon of aristotle as it stands in the edition of those same works printed at frankfort anno      to the letterpress is there attached a sort of diagram p   but darkness rather than light being the effect of it it is not here inserted—n b   as to the word genus considered as one single object the object designated by it is a fictitious entity although the individuals to the designation of each of which it is applicable are so many real entities concerning this diagram see chrestomathia appendix no iv pp   0    no i the arbor porphyriana in its orginal form being the forms in which it was transcribed from the copy exhibited in the course of a college lecture delivered anno      at queens college oxford  notes explanatory of the differences by which this amended form no ii is distinguished from the original form no i together with the reasons of those differences planta—vitale—vivum—animatum   taking for the subject the aggregate here in both forms designated by the word planta planta the name of the logical genus in which all individual plants are included to the application made of the word vivum as designative of the superior genus or major aggregate in which this inferior genus or minor aggregate is included—to the application made of this word in the character of a substantive together with the corresponding word vitale in the character of an adjective as in no ii there seems no objection not so in regard to the word animatum employed in the original diagram no i   compared with vitale vivum presented itself as having in this as in the other instances the advantage of varying the sign where the object to be designated is different it moreover seemed rather better adapted than vitale to the purpose of officiating in the character of a substantive   in the original table the use which in this one alone of the four ramifications is made of one and the same word for the expressing of two different objects viz the objects designated by the two different parts of speech a noun adjective and a noun substantive presented an anomaly which by the substitution of the word vitale for the one purpose while the word vivum was employed for the other is in the diagram as here amended avoided   in this second joint the place for the singleworded and trivial name of the negative minor aggregate being in the original diagram left blank so is it in the amended diagram the language as it should seem not affording any such trivial name no ii the arbor porphyriana in a supposed amended form more explicit and supposed to be in other respects now somewhat improved      in the state in which it is represented in table iv no i in table iv no ii it is exhibited with some little alterations which on the present occasion might serve it was thought to render it somewhat more readily intelligible in this same work of saundersons in a list given of the commentators of aristotle the very first place is occupied by this same porphyrius yet useful as it not only is in itself but more particularly useful as it might have been made to the purpose of affording exemplification and illustration to some of the instructions contained in that same work of saundersons in no part of that work is any reference to it to be found by every eye by which this prime and most ingenious example of logical analysis is glanced at the divisions made by it may at one glance be seen to be at each step bifurcate by every one who in this point of view shall have had the patience to examine into it it will be found to be at every such step exhaustive on the subject of division saunderson has—for in following out and paraphrasing the system of aristotle he could not fail to have—a chapter amongst other rules for the performance of this operation he requires that it be exhaustive—that it possess this property in that chapter had it occurred to him to avail himself of the exemplification thus already given of this his own rule he might have exhibited to his readers a specimen of division which being throughout bifurcate is throughout exhaustive in so doing after causing his readers to observe that it is bifurcate he might have shown to them in the first place that it is exhaustive in the next place that it is by its being bifurcate that it is rendered capable of being proved to be so and lastly that by the mutual contradictoriness of the two propositions the import of which is suggested by the pair of denominations presented by each pair of branches the proof of its being so is actually afforded†     planted and firmly rooted by the logical work of saunderson the conception of the necessity of the property of exhaustiveness to an adequate division received at a later period further confirmation as well as illustration from the grammatical work of james harris upon reference now made to that work no such word as exhaustiveness or allcomprehensiveness has been found in it but by the word all repeatedly decked out in emphatic capitals and reinforced by the word whatever together with the division made of the contents of it by the words either and or the idea was plainly meant to be conveyed and was accordingly brought to view whether in the instance of every one or so much as any one of the divisions there exhibited that quality is given to it has not for the present occasion been thought worth inquiring into what is certain is that for proof of the existence of that quality neither the test here in question nor any other is there brought to view what is also certain is that be they as they may in regard to exhaustiveness or say allcomprehensiveness in regard to distinctness the divisions exhibited in hermes are stark naught under the name of attributives of the second order adverbs—all adverbs—are there given as being in their import distinct from the three parts of speech following viz from substantives for example place and time from attributives of the first order for example the pronoun adjective this and from connectives for example the preposition in unfortunately to look no further in the import of every adverb designative of place and in that of every adverb designative of time may be found the several imports of the three several parts of speech from the imports of which the import of an attributive of the second order had in that division of harriss been represented as distinct adverb of place here i e in this place adverb of time now i e in or at this time and so in regard to quality manner and so forth section xiv imperfection of the current conceptions relatively to exhaustiveness and bifurcation—ex gr   in saundersons logic of the systems of logical division which for one purpose or other are so abundantly framed and so continually observable many there are which in some of their ramifications particularly those which are the nearest to the trunk will be seen to be bifurcate nor can it be doubted but that of these again a large proportion would upon the application of the above test be found to be exhaustive and lamentable indeed it would be if—in those arrangements by which on all sorts of subjects mens conceptions are settled and determined—a property which by all logicians has been acknowledged to be the inseparable accompaniment     of a good and adequate system of division and thence indisputably necessary to a complete and sufficient comprehension of the subject were not frequently to be found not very frequently however in giving denomination to the component parts of the division are those names employed those correlative and contrasted names by which as above the test of plenitude is actually applied on this occasion three institutes of logic have been referred to viz bishop saundersons in latin dr watts in english and the view given of the aristotelian logic by dr reid in lord kaimess history of man of all the views that have ever been given of aristotles system of logic—concise nervous compact methodical welldivided—saundersons would it is believed be found by far the best several others which for this purpose were taken in hand seemed far inferior to it in england at any rate watts as being in english and furnished with familiar illustrations—watts though diffuse and teeming with anilities appears by the multitude of the editions to have been the most in use posterior by a generation or more to watts as that is by several to the bishop of lincolns the view given in the work of kaimes presents in conjunction the authority of two distinguished scottish writers to no one of all these writers does the utility and excellence of the exhaustively bifurcate method or so much as the use actually made of it in the ramean tree appear to have made itself sufficiently sensible by all of them the bifurcate method is indeed mentioned—mentioned but for what purpose scarcely for any other purpose than the being slighted by reid and kaimes it is even taken for a subject of pleasantry but of pleasantry it will perhaps be seen not very happily applied   first as to saunderson—lib i cap    de divisione after stating that on the occasion of division the whole say rather the aggregate which is taken for the subject of the operation is called the divisum say rather dividendum† and that the parts into which it is divided viz the parts which are the results of the operation are called the membra dividentia—he immediately after designates them by the more expressive adjunct condividentia i e the divident or more expressively the condivident members—he proceeds to give his rules of division the rules in conformity to which the operation should according to him be carried on they here follow in so many words   membra absorbeant totum divisum let the members absorb i e include comprehend comprise the whole of the dividendum in other words let the division be exhaustive let the division be performed in such a manner that if of the parts which are the result of it the contents are summed up in the sum of them the whole sum of the contents of the dividend will be found   divisum esto latius singulis suis membris adæquatum universis let the dividendum be more extensive than each of its members equal or say commensurate to all of them put together after laying down the first to add in the character of a distinct one this second rule was sad trifling it shows as it should seem that on this subject the ideas of the author were far from being clear ones two separate parts does this rule of his include each of them in its form a distinct rule but in substance and import the second part of this second rule is identical with the first rule and the other part is as obviously as it is necessarily included in both in the first rule and in the second part of this same second rule to say of a part that it is equal to the whole would be neither more nor less than a selfcontradiction in terminis—a selfcontradictory proposition       membra condividentia sint contradistincta et opposita to which by way of explanation is added ita ut confundi nequeant vel coincidere let the condivident members be contradistinct viz from each other and opposite in such sort that they shall not coincide or be capable of being confounded by this explanation no very clear light seems to be thrown upon the subject what seems to be meant is that after the division has been made things shall be in such a state that of no one of all the several distinguishable articles or masses of matter contained in the whole dividend shall any portion be found to lie part in one of the members other part in another in so far as any such incongruity is found to have place the division it is evident is indistinct and being indistinct is therefore imperfect the operation has not been completely performed on the subject of distinctness see above §      divisio fiat in membra proxima et immediata et quam fieri commodè potest paucissima let the division be made into the nearest and so far as convenience allows fewest members then immediately after in the same paragraph and under this same  0th head or rule he goes on to say—a proximis porro ad remotiora et minutiora descendendum per subdivisiones from the nearest viz members to those which are more remote and minute say rather less extensive let descent be made by subdivisions in the instance just brought to view of the second of these rules the substance of one rule being in other words given over again was given in the character of a distinct and different rule in the instance of this  th rule two rules perfectly distinct are confounded under one head and represented as constituting but one and the same rule on this last occasion a new case or state of things is brought upon the carpet viz the case in which by the repeated application made of the operation of division to the results of a former division the operations with their results are thus carried on as it were in the form of a chain or rather as hath been seen in the form of a tree dichotomiæ he goes on to say sunt laudatissimæ ubi commodè haberi possunt non tamen nimium superstitiosè et anxiè ubique venandæ quod faciunt ramæi for division the dichotomous i e the bifurcate or twopronged mode is most to be commended when it can conveniently be employed but it ought not to be everywhere hunted out too superstitiously and anxiously as it is by the rameans in this translation the expression it will be seen is bad enough and in the original it is still worse it is composed of a cluster of tautological or as they are also called identical propositions a sort of verbiage the natural growth of a weak mind and of which every mind that is not a weak one will as it values its character avoid being seen to make use what ought not to be employed ought not to be employed on an occasion on which it ought not an instrument of the sort in question ought not to be employed what ought not to be done ought not to be done this is the language of a driveller in his dotage this instrument which at the first mention is pronounced to be a commendable one and of which therefore it cannot but be true that on some occasions at least the employing of it is a proper course to take what are the occasions on which it is convenient and thence proper what the occasions on which it is not convenient and thence not proper such are the questions by the answers to which and not otherwise the reproach of tautologism incurred as it is by the observation as it stands might have been wiped away section xv ii watts logic in his chapter intituled special rules to direct our conception of things sect   of division and the rules of it watts delivers on this subject a set of rules of which according to his numeration the number is six but in that which calls itself the sixth may be seen two perfectly distinct ones by anything like a thorough examination of them much more room would be taken up than can here be spared the fourth and the last part of the sixth are the only ones that have any direct bearing on the present point   let not subdivisions says the fourth be too numerous without necessity here we have anility in a still worse form than as above in saunderson anile tautology patent selfcontradiction latent let them not be too numerous this is plain identicalism and nothing more add without necessity the identicalism is now topped by selfcontradiction good simpleton what mean you by the word too know you then of so much as an imaginable case in which there is a necessity that anything should be too anything in which that which ought not to be done ought to be done   lastly as to that second part of his sixth rule—do not says he affect duplicities nor triplicities nor any certain number of parts in your division of things for continues he and then come reasons in which not much application to the subject has been perceived yet continues he some persons have disturbed the order of nature and abused their readers by an affectation of dichotomies trichotomies sevens twelves c the section then concludes with another     effusion of anility condemning what he calls a too nice and curious attention to the mere formalities of logical writers without a real acquaintance with things what applies more particularly to the subject here in hand is that this division into no more than two parts at each operation is in the scale of usefulness placed by him upon a level not superior to that of division into any other number of parts to this or any one number in comparison of any other any preference that can be given is equally ascribed to no better a source than affectation thus what is plain is that to his eyes as already observed the matchless beauty of the ramean tree the test which it affords of exhaustiveness had not displayed itself section xvi iii reid and kaimes in kaimess history of man in lord kaimess work entitled sketches of the history of man is contained a review of aristotles logic which he declares to have received from dr reid in general the account there given of that work is it may be presumed correct but in the particular passage which now stands for consideration his lordships froth seems in a dose more or less considerable to have mixed itself with the phlegm of dr reid on this occasion the exhaustive mode came under his review—he begins with a declaration of its usefulness he ends with an attempt to turn it into ridicule he acknowledges it to be good but at the same time finding the use of it to be attended with some difficulty and that a difficulty with which he did not feel himself in a condition to cope he vows revenge and to accomplish his vow applies to momus ascribing it and as it should seem with reason to the abovementioned ramus he calls it new in that character it becomes fair game for ridicule and with ridicule it seems to him that he has completely and sufficiently covered it by a proposal that for the purpose of exhaustion in a series of divisions carried on in this dichotomous mode to one of the two members an et cætera should in each instance be substituted here then according to this pair of logicians the latin phrase et cætera in english and the rest might on every occasion and with equal advantage be substituted to the name of either or at least to that of one of the branches in each joint of a system of logical divisions framed and denominated in the exhaustively bifurcate mode but is this so no not on any occasion with any such advantage why not answer because by an c substitute it to which of the two names you will though you may make your division equally exhaustive you can neither make sure of making it equally distinct nor can you see §    render it equally instructive in the name which upon the ramean plan you give to each branch viz the twoworded name be it positive be it even negative you bring to view two properties one in respect of which the individuals contained in both branches agree with one another another in respect of which they differ from one another those of the one having this latter property those of the other not but an et cætera—what are the properties of an et cætera let it not be said that the name the twoworded name of a negative branch shows no property for in the first place it shows that property which the individuals belonging to that branch possess in common with those that belong to the other in the next place it shows another property for to the purpose of instruction concerning the nature of the object even the nonpossession of this or that property is itself a property under the assurance afforded by the bifurcate mode when it is declaredly exhaustive viz the assurance that at each joint in the composition of the twoworded name of either of the two branches if the sign of negation is not actually employed it may without impropriety be so employed at pleasure under this assurance so it is that they may either or both of them be employed as trunks and in that character may be subjected to ulterior division and in this way accordingly it is that in several instances in the annexed sample of an encyclopædical tree both branches may be seen employed—but an c—the phrase et cætera—in what way could these logicians have made it serve in the character of a trunk in what way could they have divided it into branches of what one sort of aggregate is et cætera the name yet according to them with as much propriety as any given number of other names an et cætera if repeated that same number of times is capable of giving denomination to all sorts of aggregates by the contradictory formula which in every ramification if performed in the ramean mode is as above either expressed or implied—an assurance is given that the mode of division pursued is meant to be exhaustive and to that end is rendered bifurcate but if in the instance of either branch in the room     of a significant name the insignificant name et cætera is employed—in this way what assurance is given that the mode employed will be bifurcate true it is that in the case supposed by reid and kaimes the mode it seems to be taken for granted is the bifurcate mode but in the nature of their et cætera there is nothing to hinder its being employed when the mode is multifurcate whereas as hath been seen it is the property and excellence of the contradictory formula that it cannot be employed but that the mode of division is at the same time bifurcate and exhaustive more misconception—more confusion of the confusion made by watts for want of his being sufficiently aware that what belonged to the subject was not a physical and real whole but a logical and fictitious aggregate notice has been taken in §    exactly into that same inadvertence may reid and lord kaimes be seen to have fallen in this place division of england into middlesex and what is not middlesex this is what they give as an example of the only sort of division here in question viz a logical one but agreeing in this respect with the vegetable body called a tree the portion of the earths surface called england is a physical and real whole not a logical and fictitious aggregate in a logical division performed in the exhaustively bifurcate mode the twoworded name of each branch gives intimation of two properties belonging to all the individuals contained in it one in the possession of which they agree another by the possession and nonpossession of which they are distinguished but of no one property—whether as possessed either by all england or by itself or by anything that is not itself—dees the word middlesex give any intimation it is evident say they that these two members comprehend all england true in the same manner say they we may divide what is not middlesex into kent and what is not kent true again thus continue they one may go on by divisions and subdivisions that are absolutely complete true once more but while for your subject instead of a logical aggregate you take a physical whole although those divisions will indeed be as trifling and useless as to yourselves they appear to be being so will they prove what you bring them to prove not they indeed why because they are nothing to the purpose this example they go on to say may serve to give an idea of the spirit of ramean division how far this purpose is really served by it the reader may now judge a curious circumstance is that it is in the character of a source of objection to this mode that his lordship brings to view the train of false conclusions that in relation to this subject philosophers ancient and modern have according to him in great abundance fallen into fallen into and from what cause from the having made use of this security against error no but from their having says he omitted to make use of it to the divisions of their making the fault he ascribes is that of being incomplete of the mode of division which he is thus holding up to ridicule the distinctive character is that it is capable not only of being rendered but wherever it is so proved to be complete yet the mode is according to him a bad one why—but because by pursuing it—no because for want of having pursued it—certain persons have made bad work so much for the objection which by this pair of scottish philosophers we have seen made to the scheme of logical division which in that age of comparative darkness was invented as it should seem by the ingenious french logician pierre ramée as to any of those applications which by him as we are told were made of it that at this time of day unless it be from seeing how the instrument itself was managed by him any useful instruction should be derivable there seems no great reason to expect observation and experiment—in these as above observed §    may be seen the only sources of all real knowledge in the days of peter ramus anterior as they were to those of our lord bacon scarcely unless it were here and there by accident had these funds been either of them so much as begun to be drawn upon of logic with its divisions all that it is in the power to do is to arrange and display in the most instructive manner whatsoever matters have been extracted from those sources what it can do is to methodise and in that unimmediate way promote creation—what it can not do is to create section xvii process of exhaustive bifurcation to what length may and shall it be carried in the division of a logical aggregate exhaustiveness can never fail to be useful and instructive to afford assurance and demonstration of its existence bifurcation can never fail to be necessary by this time these propositions may it is hoped be assumed as truth there remain however still on every occasion two questions viz how far this useful process can be and how far it ought to be carried on by these questions the answers are suggested two bars present themselves by either of which where it has place the employment of these instruments may be effectually opposed one is impracticability the impracticability of the operation the other may perhaps be termed the uneconomicalness of it being that which has place where whatsoever may be the value of the benefit the value of labour necessarily attached to it—labour     of creation communication and receipt included—would be still greater i as to impracticability of impracticability in this case two causes present themselves as capable of having place viz uncognoscibility and unexpressibility   as to uncognoscibility it is only in so far as the properties of the aggregates or classes of things in question are known that for the purpose in question or any other any one such aggregate with its branches can thus be exhibited this or that property being stated as having place in all the individuals contained in one of the two branches and as not having place in any of those contained in the other take for example natural history and therein botany forty thousand was some years ago stated as the number of supposed different species of plants exclusive of varieties at that time more or less known to the botanic world but at that time the utmost knowledge obtained of them by any person was not to any such degree clear correct and complete as to enable him in this way to show of every one of them in any such concise mode its points of agreement and disagreement with reference to every other and even if in and for any one year the distinctive properties of the whole multitude of individuals contained in the whole multitude of species then known could have been exhibited in this systematic form the sketch given of them if with regard to the whole number of species of plants then existing it professed to be and even if it really were an exhaustive one would in and for the next year no longer possess that quality   the quantity of surface necessary to the exhibition of such a diagram presents another circumstance by which long enough before the number of the extreme branches had reached to any such number as forty thousand as above not to say the tenth or the hundredth part of it the bar of impracticability would be opposed number of the extreme branches being  0000 and this number being the last term of a series of multiplications in which two is the common multiplier what would be the sum required of the number of the intermediate branches which being to be interpolated between the first term viz   and the last viz  0000 would be to be added to the sum of those two numbers to this question the answer is left to be found by any ready arithmetician in whose eyes the profit would pay for the trouble ii as to uneconomicalness to perform the comparatively small number of ramifications exhibited by the annexed sample was found to have imposed so heavy a labour that over and over again the thought of having undertaken it has been matter of regret in comparison of the labour necessary to the execution of such a work the mere labour of perusing it is obviously nothing yet even with this comparatively slight burthen it is only in the instance of a very small proportion of the whole number of those by whom this volume may happen to be opened that any expectation of their charging themselves with it can reasonably be entertained to those who have inclination and leisure an assurance is here ventured to be afforded that whatsoever may be the information derivable from the perusal of a work of this sort to whatsoever subject applied much greater will be the profit derivable in that same shape from the execution of it as to the length to which the operation shall be pursued each individual will in both instances be determined by his own feelings in regard to net profit and convenience but in one thing all persons it is supposed will be agreed viz that of the whole number of ramifications which in this way it might be possible to exhibit it will in most instances be no more than a part and that in most instances a small part of the whole field that will be found to afford adequate payment for the trouble on the other hand the more extensive the universal trunk the more extensive will be the quantity of information which in and by each such ramification will have been obtained and communicated the more extensive the field the greater will be the profit derivable from this mode of cultivation in the fields of noology and ethics it is in contradistinction to that of somatology including natural history and natural philosophy that the nature of the field will it is believed be found to afford the greatest profit why because for example in natural history the knowledge of the utmost number of peculiar properties that could in this way be brought to view would be but inconsiderable in comparison with the number of such properties as are seen really to have place and for which though in each instance they might be exhibited as they are actually exhibited in a simple list—no place could be found in any such table the objects of which the words that belong to noology and ethics are the names are chiefly the works of man the products of his mind in multitude and variety the works produced by this instrument are as nothing in comparison with those produced by the hand of nature†     section xviii how to plant a ramean encyclopædical tree on any given part of the field of art and science having during a long course of years and on a great variety of occasions if his conceptions on this subject are not altogether illusory derived much advantage from the use of the ramean tree the author is unwilling to quit this part of the field altogether without having first thrown out a few hints which have occurred to him as capable of affording more or less assistance to any other person who on any occasion may feel inclined to make trial of the old logical instrument thus newly offered to notice   as far as they go employ such materials as you find ready provided to your hands these materials are such words as in relation to the subject in question are to be found already existing in the language the words and thereby the relations in the designation of which they are respectively employed set them down together one after another for example in columns as many as in the first instance you can think of or find adding from time to time others as they occur   when you have got enough of them to begin upon whatsoever be the field of which you were then endeavouring to take a survey among the words the import of which is contained within the limits of it look out for the one of which the import presents itself as most extensive see whether it exactly covers the whole extent of the proposed field of your survey if yes employ it for your universal trunk if not you must frame some word which by its import shall after what explanation may be found necessary present to view in the most effectual manner the whole contents of that same field   the universal trunk being thus found or made for the first pair of branches look out for the two words the imports of which present themselves as being both of them contained in the trunk and at the same time the most extensive of all those that are applying to them the test herein described observe whether within their imports taken together the whole matter of the trunk be comprehended if yes there is your first pair of minor aggregates given your first ramification made   if no two such words can be found then take the one the import of which—it being as it naturally will be the name of a positive property—appears next to that of the abovementioned trunk the most extensive taking this for the name of one of your two minor aggregates branches of the first ramification the sign of negation added to it gives you the other   the test always in hand or mind proceed in the same way carrying on your series of ramification as far as you find convenient at every joint for your two branches looking out for a pair of names both of them in common use taking up with only one such name and for the corresponding name adding to it its contradictory in those cases alone in which no such already existing pair of trivial but at the same time allcomprehensive names are to be found   for each such branch if you see occasion in addition to such its twoworded name framed as lastmentioned find or frame a singleworded name† which will thus stand as a synonym to the justmentioned encyclopædical twoworded name and will for ordinary use be a commodious substitute   if under any trunk whether by finding them or by framing them you provide yourself in the first instance with a pair of singleworded names then for purely encyclopædical synonyms you will have to frame for each a twoworded synonym if in the first instance the pair of twoworded encyclopædical names are those with which you provide yourself then for encyclopædical use or trivial use or both what you will have to do is as above to find or frame as the case may be one or two singleworded synonyms‡       on proceeding in this track what will be very apt to happen to you is the finding that after you have thus found places in your system for a certain stock of appellatives growing always in number greater and greater but in point of import each of them less and less extensive as you advance a number of appellatives more or less considerable the imports of which are more extensive than those of some to which you have given admittance have been left behind these imports however being by the supposition included every one of them within the limits of the field which you are thus surveying will not present to you any new difficulty by the imports of these words as well as by those of the others will the field be divisible only for the making of your divisions you must look out for some one or more other sources   in these cases as in those first mentioned these sources will be furnished by so many distinctive properties which accordingly you must be on the look out for and for each of which if it have not a name already you must make one  0 having found or made names for all these several sources of division set them down one after another in one list which done for exhibiting the relation which the objects so denominated bear to one another you will probably find some means of comprising in one and the same system of divisions the whole list of those sources of division in the same manner as you have comprised in one such system the results of the several divisions from the first of all these several sources†    on looking over the stock of words belonging to this your field you will probably find in a number more or less considerable pairs or parcels of words which with relation to one another are synonymous these as they occur you will pick up and in that character note them and set them down examples of words thus related may also be seen in the table    whatsoever they may be in other respects it was impossible these directions should be made anything like complete for use without some intimation given of the distinction between names of real entities and names of fictitious entities a distinction which in some of his encyclopædical remarks dalembert was it is believed the first to bring to view and which will be found to pervade the whole mass of every language upon earth actual or possible names of bodies for example are names of real entities‡ names of qualities and relations names of fictitious entities the names by which the branches of the porphyrian or ramean tree are designated are names of real entities§ the names of the branches of the encyclopædical tree here submitted to view are names of fictitious entities though to a considerable extent included in them as will be seen are references made to correspondent names of real entities names of real names of fictitious entities in the division thus expressed may be seen one exhaustive division of the whole stock of nouns substantive strict to the highest pitch of strictness as is the propriety with which the entities here called fictitious are thus denominated in no instance can the idea of fiction be freer from all tincture of blame in no other instance can it ever be equally beneficial since but for such fiction the language of man could not have risen above the language of brutes the above seemed as little as could be said to prevent the whole field of fictitious entities from presenting itself to the eye of the mind in the repulsive character of an absolutely   0 dark spot more cannot be said without wandering still further from the main subject and trespassing beyond hope of endurance upon the readers patience the endeavour to trace out throughout the whole of their extent the principal relations between the field of thought and the field of language—comprising of necessity the leading principles of the art and science of universal grammar—have been the business of a distinct essay which it has been and continues to be the wish of the author to include within the limits of the present work and in that work in addition to the discoveries half concealed or left unperfected by horne tooke the distinction between names of real and names of fictitious entities will constitute a capital and altogether indispensable instrument almost all names employed in speaking of the phenomena of the mind are names of fictitious entities in speaking of any pneumatic or say immaterial or spiritual object no name has ever been employed that had not first been employed as the name of some material or say corporeal one lamentable have been the confusion and darkness produced by taking the names of fictitious for the names of real entities in this misconception may perhaps be found the main if not the only source of the clouds in which notwithstanding all their rivalry plato and aristotle concurred in wrapping up the whole field of pneumatology in the phantoms generated in their own brains it seemed to them and their followers that they beheld so many realities of these fictitious entities many will be found of which they being each of them a genus generalissimum the names are consequently incapable of receiving what is commonly understood by a definition viz a definition per genus et differentiam but from their not being susceptible of this species of exposition they do not the less stand in need of that species of exposition of which they are susceptible† by any person—should there be any such person to whom the ideas thus hazarded present themselves as having a substantial footing in the nature of things on the one hand and the nature of language on the other—it will probably be admitted that a demand exists for an entirely new system of logic in which shall be comprehended a theory of language considered in the most general point of view for the construction of such an edifice a considerable proportion of the materials employed in the construction of the aristotelian system of logic would be indispensably necessary but in this very supposition is included the necessity of taking to pieces the whole mass of that most elaborate and considering its date justly admired and venerated monument of human industry and genius as to plato when in the vast wilderness of words with which by this spoilt child of socrates so many shelves and so many brains have been loaded and in which so many wits beginning with those of cicero have been lost when among all these signs so much as a single thought which is at once clear and instructive shall have been pointed out it will be time enough to steal from the examination of aristotles logic either a word or so much as a thought to bestow upon his masters eloquence with some modifications which reflection will suggest and which it would take up too much time and room here to endeavour to particularize the method herein above proposed as applicable to names of objects to those elementary parts of propositions which by logicians are distinguished by the name of terms would be found applicable to propositions themselves to those propositions for example by which under some such name as contents intimation is given in general expression of the matter contained in any literary work and more particularly in any work of the institutional kind and thus it is that to the view taken of any such portion of the field of art and science may be given in the promptest and most commodious manner any degree of extent of which the existing state of the materials collected by observation and experiment has rendered it susceptible and in truth terms being the matter of which propositions are principally composed by any arrangement given to those principal ingredients an arrangement is already in some sort given to the whole matter of all the several propositions into the composition of which those elementary articles are capable of being made to enter in the explanation above given of the manner in which out of such terms as in any given part of the field the existing state of the language furnishes a system of exhaustively bifurcate division may be formed—it has been seen how it is that in a number of places more or less considerable for want of such names already in use gaps will be left in the work gaps for the filling up of which instructions are thereupon given by the powers of the imagination working with analogy for its instrument as well as its guide words especially where in some orderly manner spread out a number of them together on one and the same surface before     the eye will bring to view each of them not only the particular object which in common discourse it is employed to designate but an indeterminate multitude of other objects which by means of some relation or other stand each of them in some way or other associated with it in this way it is that by means of some indication afforded by the import of this or that article belonging to the existing stock of names the filling up of a gap of the sort just described will be effected and by every gap thus filled up precision at least and frequently extension will if the operation be properly performed be given to the conception entertained of the contents of that part of the field and thus may be seen according to the nature of the branch of art and science which is in hand one way at least in which inventions may be and doubtless have been brought to light and discoveries made quodlibet cum quolibet is a motto that may serve for every discovering and every inventing mind section xix logical mode of division—its origin explained and illustrated for facilitating the execution of a work of the sort here in question viz a system of logical division in the exhaustively bifurcate mode—a few instructions such as they have been seen have just been hazarded the topic was upon the point of being closed when by a dip taken into condillacs little work on logic an addition was suggested which now seemed indispensable the only sort of analysis which in the present work hath as yet been in question is of that sort of which not so much as the conception could have presented itself but in a considerably matured state of the human mind but in that little work of condillac under the same name analysis was observed to be brought to view a sort of logical operation to which that appellation could not it seemed with propriety be refused but of which it was at the same time evident that it could not but have been in use in the very earliest stage of human existence a stage so early that although the operation must in its extension have kept pace with that of language yet in part the existence of it must have been anterior even to that of the earliest formed raw materials of which language was gradually composed since those materials are not any of them anything but signs of ideas and it is only by the sort of analysis now in question—viz the primæval logical analysis performed by the mind upon individual objects in the character of physical wholes that those ideas were supplied of every logical analysis—of every system of logical divisions—the subject is a logical whole but any such logical analysis nowhere could it ever have had a subject but for that system of primæval logical analysis which has had for its subjects physical wholes and for its results those ideas which at the very moment of their conception were respectively accompanied and fixed by so many names or denominations—signs by means of which in so far as those signs were the sort of names called common names those ideas were as it were tied up into bundles called sorts kinds species genera classes and the like the connexion being effected by another sort of logical instrument which as will be seen is not analysis but its converse synthesis of this double course—a course of analysis conjoined with a correspondent course of synthesis—the commencement must have had place in the very infancy of society and neither to the continuance nor to the extension of it can any conceivable bounds be assigned other than those which apply to the extension and continuance of society itself   difference between a physical whole and a logical whole   difference between physical analysis and logical analysis when both have for their subject a physical whole   difference between logical analysis and logical synthesis   operation and instrument by which logical synthesis is performed   necessity of an antecedent logical analysis performed upon a physical whole to the previous formation and thence to the subsequent analysis of a logical whole   necessity of an act of logical synthesis to the formation of such logical whole such are the points on all which as soon as the definitions of the two species of wholes have been given a conjunct illustration will be attempted by a physical whole understand any corporeal real entity considered as being in one mass and without any regard paid at the instant to any parts that might be observable in it for instance this or that individual plant by a logical whole understand that sort of fictitious aggregate or collection of objects for the designation of which any one of those names which in contradistinction to proper names are termed common names are employed for example the aggregate designated by that same word plant the common name plant is applicable to every individual plant that grows and not only to those but moreover to all those which ever grew in time past and to all those which will grow in time future and in saying of any one of them individually taken—viz of those that are now growing this plant exists there is no fiction but the aggregate conceived as composed of all plants present past and future put together is manifestly the work of the imagination—a pure fiction the logical whole designated by the word plant is therefore a fictitious entity for the illustration of these several points follows now a short history which though at no time perhaps realized in every minute particular must many millions of times have been exemplified in every circumstance which to the purpose of the present explanation is a material one     walking one day over his grounds a certain husbandman observed a plant which was not of the number of those which he was employed in cultivating overhanging some of them it seemed to him to impede their growth taking out his knife he cut the plant off just above the root and a fire in which he was burning weeds for the ashes being near at hand he threw it into the fire in so doing he had thus in two different modes performed upon this physical whole the physical analysis by being cut as it was it became divided into two parts viz the root and that which was above the root and thus in the mechanical mode was the physical analysis performed upon it by its being thrown into the fire and there consumed of the portion so cut off as above part was made to fly off in the state of gas the rest staid behind in the state of ashes and thus in the chemical mode was the physical analysis performed upon it not long after came a daughter of his that same way and a plant of the same kind which her father had thus cut down being left standing her attention was caught by the beauty of it it was a sweetbrier rose of which one flower had just expanded itself all parts of the plant were not alike beautiful by one part her attention was more forcibly engaged than by the rest it was the flower to examine it more closely she plucked it off and brought it near her eye during its approach the scent of it became perceptible and thus another sense received its gratification to prolong it she tried to stick the flower in a part of her dress that covered her bosom meeting with some resistance the stalk to which with a few leaves on it the flower was attached was somewhat bruised and now she perceived and distinguished another odour which though not less agreeable was somewhat different from the first all this while she had been performing upon this physical whole the logical operation termed logical analysis performing it not the less though as in molieres bourgeois gentilhomme monsieur jourdan when talking prose without knowing it the instrument by which this mental operation was performed by her was the fictitious entity attention by the attention which she bestowed upon the flower while no equal degree of attention was bestowed upon any other part of the plant she analyzed it—she mentally resolved or divided it—into two parts viz the flower and all that was not the flower and thus she distinguished part from part again by applying her attention first to the beauty of the flower composed as it was of the beauty of its form and the beauty of its colour she performed in this same original subject another analysis which though still a logical analysis was productive of results somewhat different from those produced by the former for thus in the same part she distinguished two properties or qualities viz that of presenting to the sense of sight a peculiarly agreeable appearance and that of presenting to the sense of smell a peculiarly agreeable odour the parts were both of them real entities the qualities were both of them fictitious entities eager to communicate the discovery to a little brother of hers she took him to the spot she showed him the plant from which the flower had been plucked the flower had already become a subject of conversation to them that part had already received the name of flower not having equally engaged her attention the other part like a sheep in a flock or a pig in a litter remained without any distinctive name ere long her sweetbrier rose put forth two other blossoms being so little different from the first each of these became flower likewise from a proper name flower thus became a common name in the course of another social ramble a mallow plant with a flower on it met her eye at a distance the flower was not yet distinguished from that of the sweetbrier rose—ah cried she here is flower again the sweetbrier on account of its scent which continued after the flower was gone had been preserved the mallow having nothing but colour to recommend it was neglected these rambles had not continued long before other sweetbriers and other mallows met her eye the former being regarded with interest the other with comparative indifference the occasion for distinguishing them in conversation was not unfrequently recurring the rose flower became a rose flower the mallow flower a mallow flower when the flower first observed was named flower as yet nothing but analysis—logical analysis—had been performed no operation of the nature of logical synthesis of one individual object it was and no other that the word flower had been made the name but no sooner was the second flower observed and the same name flower which had been applied to the first applied to this other than an act of logical synthesis was performed the proper name was thus turned into a common one and the fictitious entity called a sort a kind a species or a genus call it which you please was created the fictitious entity being nothing at all and the two real entities being each of them something the fictitious entity itself did not contain within itself the two real entities or either of them but the name which after having occasionally been applied to each of     the two real entities became by degrees designative of the fictitious entity deduced from them as above by abstraction continued to be employed for the designation of either of them and occasionally for the designation of both of them together and thus in a sense which although not strictly proper has the advantage of conciseness the one fictitious entity the species may be said to have contained and to contain the two individual real ones to contain viz though not in a physical in a logical sense the analysis thus unconsciously performed by the maiden on the firstobserved sweetbrier rose viz by applying her attention to one part while it was not applied to the other had for its subject the real entity the physical whole it may be termed the primæval or primordial analysis for by no other sort of logical analysis will it be found capable of having been preceded the analysis by which the roseflower became roseflower and the mallowflower mallowflower had for its subject no other than the fictitious entity the logical whole viz the whole designated fixed and as it were created by the denomination flower so soon as after having been employed merely as a proper name it had come to be employed as a common and thence as a specific or generic name it may be termed the secondary analysis or analysis of the  d order in her young mind and in this its simple form this secondary mode of analysis had nothing in it of science nothing of system but in it may be seen the germ of all those systems of division which being framed by scientific hands have spread so much useful light over every portion of the field of art and science the maiden had for her sweetheart a young man who though not a member of the company     of apothecaries for the company had not yet received its charter had on his part been engaged in a little train of observations to an improved and extended series of which together with the experiments which they suggested some thousands of years afterwards that most useful and respectable community became indebted for its establishment he had observed his dog after a full meal betake itself to a grassplat and gnaw the grass a sort of article which when hungry it had never been seen to meddle with to this sagacious swain the maiden was not backward in reporting her abovementioned discoveries it might perhaps have been not altogether impossible to obtain a communication of some of those observations and discoveries of his for the purpose of adding them to hers but for the explanation of what has here been endeavoured to be explained what has already been reported of the damsels will it is hoped be found to suffice without any further trial of the readers patience some thousands of years after appeared linnæus in the course of that interval not     only in the language in which he wrote but in every lettered language at least not indeed with perfect steadiness but still without much dispute or variation a name corresponding to the word plant had been in use to be employed in the designation of any one of those physical objects to which when individually taken that same denomination continues to be applied for the same length of time accordingly a logical whole possessing this vast extent—a logical whole formed by the logical process called synthesis—had been in possession of the sort of existence which the nature of an object of this sort admits of for the purpose of distributing according to such of these properties as were at the same time most easily observable most steady in their union and most interesting to man whether in the way of use or harm such individual plants as from time to time should come under observation and this to the end that such names might be given to them whereby for the purpose of putting to use their useful properties or excluding the operation of their pernicious properties they might when seen be recognised—various sources of division had occurred to various scientific observers by none of them had this useful object been completely accomplished to linnæus it appeared that it was in the flower that the most apt source of division was to be found inasmuch as for the determination of the principal and most comprehensive divisions of a vast logical whole certain differences in respect of the form in which that part manifests itself might be made to serve with as yet unknown advantage why because with those differences in respect of the flower other differences in respect of some of the properties most interesting to man—differences pervading the entire mass of each individual plant—had been observed to be conjoined thence by seeing what sort of a thing the plant in question is in respect of the flower a guess may be formed better than can be formed by any other means what sort of a thing the plant is in other respects from this view a conception may be formed of the disadvantage under which every system of logical division comes to be framed in this way no two things can be put asunder but what have first been put together to no other objects can this mode of analysis be applied other than to logical wholes—objects which are altogether the product of so many antecedent logical syntheses but in the first place the primæval logical analysis performed upon individual objects—this process notwithstanding this its scientific name having taken its commencement at the very earliest stage of society cannot but have had for its operators the most unexperienced the most     uninformed and unskilful hands in the next place the synthetic process by which the results of that analysis fragments detached by abstraction from these physical wholes were placed as it were under so many different common names and by those names bound together by so many logical ties—this likewise was a work which though not yet concluded nor in a way to be soon concluded must in its commencement have been coæval even with that of the primæval process to which it has been indebted for all the materials on which it has had to operate coæval with the very first crude effusions of the results of which the matter of spoken and thence of written language came by continual additions to be composed thus stands the matter in regard to those names of aggregates in the signification of which are comprised such individual objects as are purely corporeal how then stands it says somebody in regard to objects of the pneumatic cast real and fictitious the answer is—to apply to this division of the objects of thought the triple process just above described would require a full and detailed explanation of the nature of those fictitious entities which by reason of the similarity of the aspect of their names to that of the names of corporeal objects all which names are real entities are so continually confounded with real ones but to suggest the question is almost all that can be done here to attempt anything like a complete answer would be to transgress beyond endurance the proper limits of this work a few words for the purpose of affording an indication how faint soever of the only track by the pursuit of which a satisfactory answer would it is supposed be to be found may be seen in the concluding note section xx proposed new names—in what cases desirable—in what likely to be employed among the new names here proposed for encyclopedical purposes are there any of which it is desirable that they should come to     be employed for ordinary use among these again are there any which present any chance of their being so employed in answer to both these questions a very few words are all that can be afforded geometry arithmetic algebra fluxions—for familiar use what seems as far from being desirable as from being probable is—that terms of all which though only one of them is exactly and originally expressive the import is so well fixed should be expelled by new ones to mathematics considered as a branch of art and science in which all those others are included—to mathematics howsoever in its original import misexpressive the same observation may be extended not but that posology should it ever be its lot to come into use     would form a more instructive and to all by whom its original import is borne in mind a more satisfactory name being in their original import so misexpressive—and even in respect of present import one of them at least so indeterminate—that natural history and natural philosophy should give way to appellations fixed in their import in some sort instructive and at the worst not misexpressive seems at any rate to be wished whether to be looked for seems not equally clear to a grecianized ear in the first instance and to an ungrecianized ear when explained to it physiurgic somatology and anthropurgic somatology are expressive—but then they are not singleworded physiurgics and anthropurgics are each of them when separated from somatology singleworded to the use of these what seems to be the only obstacle or at any rate the only assignable objection is—that being expressive of accidents without a subject—being substantives formed out of an adjective without a visible substantive—they might for some time fail of being sufficiently expressive in themselves not to speak of algebra which in its original import is all darkness they are however in this respect but upon a par with fluxions even physiurgic somatics or physiurgic somatology—anthropurgic somatics or anthropurgic somatology—even these though as touching their twowordedness they are in no better case than natural history and natural philosophy yet in that respect they are in no worse case and in respect of determinateness and instructiveness they stand in that so much better case which in section the fourth has been brought to view in all these instances for presenting the import desired—the import for the presentation of which the demand is continually occurring—words howsoever originally unexpressive or misexpressive are—and without any very considerable inconvenience—already in universal use not so in the case of that branch of ethics for the designation of which the word deontology has here been ventured to be proposed under the undiscriminating import of the word ethics a branch in itself so perfectly distinct and which in practice so frequently requires to be distinguished from and put in opposition to that which joins with it in forming the two branches of the common trunk is at present continually and but for those manyworded explanations which are never given and scarcely ever so much as thought of irremediably confounded for exemplification thus much may perhaps have its use to examine in this same view every new appellative which the table furnishes would surely be superfluous appendix—no v sources of motion analytical sketch of the several sources of motion with their correspondent primum mobiles of motion in general—its generation and extinction in the masses of matter with which man is conversant and on which for his being as well as his wellbeing he is at all times dependent whatsoever change is effected—this change is either itself some motion or owes its origin to some motion of which it is the result motion is the motion of some body or bodies of some portion or portions of matter of the aggregate mass of matter with which man is conversant of this aggregate mass no particle can at any time or in any place in any direction enter or be made to enter into a state of motion without having to encounter a perpetual and indefatigable antagonist styled resistance according to the commonly received distinction this resistance is susceptible of two     different modifications viz   counter motion i e active and   vis inertiæ or purely passive resisting force but perhaps upon a closer examination it might be found that that which presents itself in the character of a purely passive resisting force is no other than an actively resisting force produced by the elasticity of the mass to which the moving power is applied that is the repulsive power the countermotion or tendency to countermotion of the particles of which the mass acted upon by the moving force is composed to one or other of these powers if between them there can be any real difference will be to be referred that cause to the designation of which when cessation of motion is considered as the effect of it the word friction is applied for the purpose of rendering in the best manner in which we are able an account of the motion of such bodies as are in motion and of the rest of such as are at rest certain fictitious entities are by a sort of innocent falsehood the utterance of which is necessary to the purpose of discourse feigned to exist and operate in the character of causes equally real with and distinct from the perceptible and perceived effects in relation to which they are considered in the character of causes all bodies we are acquainted with it is universally agreed are compounds as it were of solid matter and empty space all bodies viz the ultimate particles of solid matter which enter into their composition are separated by intervals of space in which no matter at all at any rate none that we have any acquaintance with is contained to the different distances at which in different states of its existence the component particles of the same body are placed are owing in some degree the different textures of which it is susceptible and which under different circumstances it exhibits to our senses take for example any mass of matter whatsoever suppose an apple the apple let it be from which newton derived the first hint of the attraction of gravitation the ever memorable apple which as an object of worship to the latest posterity ought to have been preserved from corruption in a hermetically sealed glasscase ought to have been transmitted as an object of worship to the latest inheritors of this our globe—the particles of solid matter of which this apple is constituted are each of them at a certain distance from each of the several others how happens it that they are not more distant what is the cause of such their propinquity the necessary fiction above spoken of provides an answer and says the attraction of cohesion is the cause by the operation of which they are thus kept together how happens it that they are as distant as they are what is the cause of such their distance here again steps in the same useful respondent and answers it is by mutual repulsion that they are thus kept asunder it is to distinguish it from the attraction of gravity of which presently that the attraction termed the attraction of cohesion has acquired that name of this species of attraction repulsion it has been seen is the constant companion and antagonist each of the opposite and mutually balancing effects have equal need of a fictitious cause repulsion is the generic name applicable to other cases attraction of cohesion is a specific one to match with this its antagonist the particular species of repulsion here in question requires its specific name repulsion corresponding to the attraction of cohesion let this be that specific name or rather an appellation thus multitudinously worded being too cumbersome for use say the repulsion of cohesion and though taken by itself and without explanation the appellative would upon the face of it be selfcontradictory yet by this explanation to which by its texture it would naturally point it may perhaps be found not altogether unfit for use instead of this appellation or   0 for variety along with it if for attraction of cohesion the appellation internal attraction or intestine attraction be employed for repulsion of cohesion the term internal repulsion or intestine repulsion may be employed in the attraction of gravity may be seen one of the fictitious entities to the operation of which in the character of causes or sources the birth of motion howsoever modified may as far as we are acquainted with it be referred to the repulsion of cohesion—to this one simple cause will it is believed be found referable with equal propriety the death of all these several motions which at the conclusion of the conflict maintained by the various species of attraction endowed with their several unequal degrees of force remains constituting the only force by which matter is retained in that state of composition abovementioned which seems essential to its existence and by which the whole multitude of its particles are prevented from being crowded together into one mass to account for the difference of bodies in point of distance a sort of nominal entity is feigned to represent the cause of it and motion is the name by which this imaginary cause is designated motion is thereupon considered for such are the shifts that language is reduced to as a sort of receptacle in which bodies are lodged they are accordingly said to be in motion as a man is said to be in a house by laying out of consideration everything that concerns the particular nature of these bodies respectively everything in a word concerning them but the difference between the distance or interval between them at the one time and the distance or interval between them at the other we obtain the abstract idea for the designation of which the word motion is employed in speaking of it we speak of it as if it were itself a substance a hollow mass into which the body the really and independently existing body whatever it be and how vast soever it be is capable of being put and which is capable of being communicated to that body and so in regard to bodies in any number a philosopher says the old greek story denying the existence of motion another to refute him got up and walked good for a practical joke not so for a serious refutation of the existence of the faculty of locomotion the denier of the existence of motion was not less perfectly aware before the experiment than after it what he denied was—not the universally exemplified and universally known and acknowledged matter of fact that the same body is at one time in one place at another time in another and in that sense the existence of motion—but the existence of any real entity corresponding to the appellation motion any entity real and distinct from the body or bodies in which the motion is said to have place thus early as appears from this story had a conception however narrow and inadequate been formed of the distinction between names of real entities and names of fictitious entities† a distinction by which much light has already been thrown and by degrees much more will be thrown on the field of language and through that medium on the field of thought and action and in particular on the nature of the relation between cause and effect cause when the word is used in its proper signification is perhaps in every instance the name of a fictitious entity if you want the name of the correspondent real entity substitute the word author or the word instrument to the word cause rest is the absence nonexistence or negation of this imaginary receptacle when after observation taken of the two bodies in question at two different points of time no such difference of distance is found they are said to have been during that length of time each of them at rest rest is thus a sort of imaginary pillar or anchor to which in the english language they are considered or at least spoken of as being fastened‡ enclosed in that receptacle or fastened to this pillar or anchor—one or other is at every point of time the condition of every object to which the name of body has been attached the truth is that absolutely and properly speaking in as far as observation and inference have extended motion is the state or condition in which at every point every body is and so for ever is likely to continue rest is not the state of our own sun about which the planet that we inhabit moves if a state of rest were predicable of anything it would be of the ideal point in the expanse of space the centre of gravity as it is called about which the sun on the one part and the planets on the other are observed or supposed to turn the observations and inferences thus applied in the first instance to our sun have been extended to those other bodies to which to distinguish them from those companions to our earth called planets we give the name of fixed stars but which determined as they have been by these observations and these inferences it has seemed good to our astronomers not to tie to the abovementioned pillar but to put all together into the abovementioned receptacle so it is then that for the purposes of discourse as well as of thought and action the     pillar is not less necessary to us than the receptacle for this purpose rest requires to be distinguished into absolute and relative absolutely speaking as above no one body is at rest but on this our little planet the theatre of all our little doings and sufferings bodies in abundance are to be found which as between any two given points of time having been at the same distance from each other have during these two points of time together with the whole interval if any that has been between them been at rest upon the whole then absolute rest is not exemplified anywhere but on the surface of our planet exemplifications of relative rest may be found everywhere these things considered henceforward as often as rest is spoken of as having place relative rest and that alone will be intended the motions in which the various effects as yet observed by us to be produced by the powers of nature modified or not modified by human art and industry have their essential causes are derived from various sources of these motions obvious as when once brought to view the task of giving a list may seem to be—obvious and by its conduciveness to the purpose of instruction presenting an incontrovertible claim to the notice of the institutional writer who for the theatre of his labours has chosen the field of natural philosophy—the task of giving such a list hath it is believed as yet been undertaken by no one no work in which that task has been executed or endeavoured to be executed is as yet anywhere to be found consideration had of the utter absence of all information from more competent hands to the author of these pages how little soever accustomed to apply his industry to this department in the field of science it occurred that an attempt to afford in a manner however inadequate a supply to this deficiency might have its use were it only by attracting to so interesting a subject which presents so strong a claim to their notice the attention of those from whose more adequate learning and ingenuity it may receive more correct and complete explanation of these various sorts of motions some are as far as we have reason to believe in their nature perpetual unintermitting or if a common figure of speech may be allowed immortal others and by far the greater number in their nature mortal and perishable of these two so materially different heads which come under the former which under the latter in any attempt to give answers to these questions an answer to the question concerning the existence of what is called perpetual motion is necessarily involved of the following sketch the design is in the first place to perform the enumeration of the several distinguishable sources of motion considered as it is wont to be produced or capable of being produced by human art in some determinate direction for the purpose of accomplishing some determinate object or end in view in the next place by means of a systematical sketch to bring to view the several points of relation between these several sources of motion—the points in respect of which they agree with one another and those on which they differ by this means a facility it is hoped will be given to the decision on the question whether in the preceding enumeration all such sources actual and possible are included or whether any and what are omitted primum mobile is a term already in use and by it in each instance is designated that mass of matter which when from the particular source in question motion is considered as derived is considered as being of all the bodies by which the motion is experienced which at the time in question issues from that source the first in which it has place accordingly corresponding to every distinguishable source of motion a primum mobile will be to be brought to view of the two expressions viz sources of motion and primum mobiles the latter is the one principally if not exclusively in use to the other the preference has notwithstanding here been given and that on several accounts   it is only in as far as it points to the source whence it is derived that the question what or which is the first mover the body which on the occasion in question is of all the bodies in which the motion is observed to have place the first in which it makes its appearance is an object of regard in the class of objects designated by the generic word motion men behold the cause of every effect desirable or undesirable which they perceive to take place but various are the sources whence this important agent is seen to be derived an object of anxious and continual research cannot but be the determining on every occasion from which of all these sources the article thus in universal demand may be derived to most advantage of this inquiry source is the only direct and intrinsically important object the primum mobile is so no otherwise than either in respect of its affording indication of the source or in respect of the need there is of commencing with this article the plan of the operations instituted for the deriving down to the ultimate object whatsoever supply there may be occasion to draw from this source   in many instances in which the source is sufficiently distinguishable to admit of a separate name the primum mobile is altogether undiscernible or to speak more properly a primum mobile is a thing that has no existence—two bodies or sets of bodies move each of them towards the other both beginning at the same instant of time as is plainly the case for example in all those minute motions or dances of atoms which belong to the experience of the chemical branch of science     in a word of the phrase source of motion the applicability will be seen to be universal that of primum mobile very confined so much so that it is only in deference to usage that any notice is here taken of it sources of motion enumerated with their corresponding primum mobiles a sketch supposed to be allcomprehensive and now for the first time attempted i selenic selenigenous† or simply mechanical source of motion by the appellation attraction of gravity stated also simply gravitation is designated the species of force by which as far as observation or induction have extended all particles of matter without exception are drawn towards one another the heavenly bodies commonly termed in contradistinction to planets fixed stars they being comparatively such among the rest our sun not excepted on this our earth a body is said to fall when it is understood to come nearer to the centre of the earth than it was before when to any mass of matter in the liquid state it happens to fall otherwise than by means of the removal of some mass of matter in the vessel or state which had served for the support of it in such case antecedently to such its fall it has by some assignable cause been made to rise the only constantly and regularly and universally operating cause by which on this our earth water is raised is the action of the moon the mass of matter contained in that secondary planet the motions of which are principally determined by those of that which we inhabit operating in virtue of the universal principle of gravitation upon the whole mass of matter contained in ours but in our planet that part of its mass which is in a state of liquidity or in a gaseous state is free and able to yield while that which is in the state of solidity being kept together by another source of attraction called attraction of cohesion is not able to yield any otherwise than the whole of it together hence as the moon moves while the solid part of the earths substance remains relatively and apparently stationary the fluid part of the mass is perpetually in a state of relative motion which is determined by that of the moon and which bating the disturbance it receives from winds of which further on would be a perfectly regular one in these circumstances as it rises any solid body floating on its surface is made to rise with it and as it falls to fall and thence in both cases to operate with a force proportioned to its weight upon any body with which it is connected and thus from body to body through any series of bodies till the motion thus produced reaches that body or assemblage of bodies on which for the purpose of the practical use in question the ultimately serviceable impression is intended to be made to the end that the form adapted to that use may be given to it laying out of the account temperature and changes of temperature—i e the quantities of perceptible heat in particular places—viz in the air or other bodies by which these places are respectively occupied—laying out of the account temperature and those other meteorological circumstances by which the fall of water as will presently be mentioned—the fall of water in the shape of rivers—is produced it is only by the attraction of gravitation that has place between the earth and the moon that this source of motion is afforded selenic or selenigenous is therefore a term which if employed for the designation of this source of motion will serve to indicate the characteristic nature of it corresponding primum mobile in this case the moon secundum mobile the water so made to rise and sink tertium mobile the solid body which floating on the water is made to rise and sink with it quartum mobile that part of any system of machinery with which the tertium mobile is in immediate communication the system of machinery in which use is made of this source of motion and its corresponding primum mobile is called a tidemill ii hydropiptic‡ or chemicomechanical§ source of motion a river is a mass of falling water—i e a mass of ice which by mixture of a certain proportion of the matter of heat is brought into a liquid state and having in such its liquid state or at first in its state of solid ice been dissolved in the air of the atmosphere and so raised aloft is by means of a diminution in the proportion of caloric mixed with it changed from the gaseous state into a liquid state and by the attraction which in common with all matter stationed at the surface it has for the centre of the earth runs down till it arrives at a spot at which it finds its further immediate descent prevented by such portions of the matter of the earth as are in the solid state in so doing it acts and presses upon all bodies opposed to it in such manner as to communicate or tend to communicate to them a quantity of motion not greater than that which it of itself possesses corresponding primum mobile in this case the falling water secundum mobile any moveable solid body placed as in the case of the mainwheel of a watermill in such sort as     to receive the motion which it is capable of communicating and therefore to communicate it onwards according to the nature of the practical effect which by the use of the watermill is intended to be produced iii stereopiptic source of motion if as in the case of water any portion of that part of the earths surface which is in the solid state were by any regularly operating cause disposed to detach itself from the rest and like the sand in an hourglass in obedience to the law of gravitation approach nearer to the centre of the earth if for example as in africa and elsewhere there are seas of sand the fall of matter thus having place in a solid state might as well as the fall of matter in a liquid state in the way of communicating motion for the purpose of producing useful changes in the condition of bodies be put to use but of any such fall regularly produced by the unassisted powers of nature no instance has ever been known nor forasmuch as nature furnishes not for other substances any such regularly operating causes of elevation as she does in the case of water could it anywhere be of long continuance it is therefore only for the purpose of illustration that in the catalogue of sources of motion motion thus produced is inserted but when by human art and industry for any particular purpose in the instance of any mass of matter whether in a liquid or in a solid state a fall or descent has been produced in this case there is a source of motion which by economy may be turned to account on this head see no    economistic source of motion iv anemistic or aeropnutic source of motion considered in a state of motion and in such quantity and with such velocity as to be capable of producing a considerable quantity of effect any body when in the gaseous state is called wind of all bodies in a gaseous state the only species which exists in a quantity sufficient to operate with regularity in the character of a source of motion is that in which by far the greater part of the contents of the atmosphere consist viz the mixture of oxygen gas and azote with the occasional addition of carbonic acid gas in considerable quantities and many others in minute quantities corresponding primum mobile in this case the air considered as being in motion and in whatsoever direction it may happen viz the wind secundum mobile any body which for the purpose of receiving such quantity of motion as the wind is able to communicate is opposed to it for example the sails of a windmill and the sails of a ship v barometrical source of motion independently of the motion which as in the case of wind the air is liable to receive from various causes principally belonging to the head of temperature i e change in the quantity of the matter of heat in a free state mixed with it a motion in one particular direction viz a vertical one and that as it may happen sometimes in the way of rise i e increase of distance from the centre of the earth sometimes in the way of fall i e decrease of distance from the centre of the earth is almost continually impressed† upon all matter and accordingly on all liquid matter lying under it if while the quantity superincumbent on a certain portion of matter in a liquid state increases the quantity superincumbent on a portion of the like matter communicating with it is kept from receiving increase the consequence is that the quantity of air thus insulated and detached from the rest being in a state of pressure determined by the altitude of the whole column of air from the solid or fluid part of the earths surface in that spot to the extreme limits of the atmosphere while the other noninsulated portion was left free to receive the increase of quantity and accordingly did receive it will yield to the greater pressure and thus suffer the liquid matter to rise in the vessel in which the air has thus been kept in an insulated state the nature of things will scarcely admit of the applying of this source of motion with advantage comparison being made with the other sources of motion which have been and those which remain to be brought to view so great is the quantity necessary to be kept in the insulated state so great accordingly the expense of the receptacle in which it is to be kept compared with the smallness of the quantity of motion capable of being thus produced and the uncertainty at what time and for what length of time any motion at all will be thus producible but in the way of curiosity a machine of this sort was once produced and formed one of the articles comprised in the museum called from the maker coxs museum and disposed of in the way of lottery under a special act of parliament in and by which this product of mechanical ingenuity was exempted from the operation of the law by which lotteries made on account of individuals stood prohibited in these circumstances the air operates somewhat in the manner of the water in a tidemill corresponding primum mobile in this case the air of the atmosphere considered in the state of simply vertical ascent and descent‡     vi thelematic or myiobrachiatic† source of motion in all cases in which it is produced in any considerable quantity motion when by an exertion of will produced in an immediate way or in any part of the body of a living animal is as far as the powers of observation extend found to be produced by the shortening of a mass of muscular fibres for a long time in all the cases in which by the will of men motion is to any purpose produced for an indefinitely long period in the history of man this was the only source of motion drawn upon and employed and in those assemblages of human beings which continue in the state of savage life this is still the only source of motion that is employed in most cases for the production of the effect ultimately in view the motion derived from this source is employed in a direct way and without the intervention of any such apparatus of bodies as is designated by the word instrument or machinery employed for the gaining of power machinery not being so much employed in giving direction or quality to motion derived from this source as in giving direction or quality to motion derived from the abovementioned and other more powerful sources but neither are instances by any means wanting in which even with the intervention of very elaborate and complicated systems of machinery this source of motion is the only source employed the machinery having for its object the production either of the particular direction desired or of velocity or time at the expense of labour or of quantity of matter put in motion at the expense of time or of steadiness and regularity at the expense either of time of labour or of both by the mere contraction of muscular fibres the greatest quantity of force employed is that in which the animal force of some animal stronger than man—such as a horse an ox or an ass—is employed in this case there are two different wills employed that of the human being and that of the inferior animal whose will receives its impulse and direction from its human ruler the will of the inferior animal is employed for giving birth to the motion the will of the superior for giving direction to it corresponding primum mobile in this case psychological the fictitious entity called the will secundum mobile the mass of muscular fibres thereby shortened tertium mobile the unbending parts of the animal machine viz the bones according to the limb or other member on which the motion is impressed quartum mobile the external moveable body to which the motion thus generated is communicated in the first instance vii parallacticosuncrotic or alternate gassification and digassification source or steamengine source elasticity i e that property by which while in virtue of the universally operating principle gravitation these as well as all other particles of matter are attracted towards the common centre and thence towards one another they are while in this state by the introduction of the matter of heat made to repel one another in the case of every body so long as it remains either in a solid or in a liquid state the field of the operation of this property has its limits and those comparatively very narrow ones in the case of the same body when in the gaseous state it has no determinate limits and the quantity of matter of all other sorts contained in the body being given the degree of this elasticity and thence the quantity of motion communicated by it to any body which stands opposed to it increases with the quantity of the matter of heat mixed with it when without any such change in its external texture as among chemists is designated by the word decomposition a quantity of matter is by the mere intermixture of a quantity of the matter of heat transformed from the liquid into the gaseous i e the indefinitely elastic state in this case by the mere abstraction of the quantity of heat by which this effect has been produced it is reconverted to the liquid i e to the definitely elastic state when by and during the intermixture of a certain quantity of caloric it has by the continuance of its unlimited elasticity been generating and communicating a proportionate quantity of motion if in a closed receptacle by the application of a mass of matter in which a less quantity of caloric in a free state is intermixed it be divested of its extra quantity of caloric and thus reduced to its definitely elastic or liquid state it is then in a condition ready to be by the same means as before converted anew into the gaseous state and in this state to be employed in the generation of a quantity of motion which if generated under the same circumstances will be exactly equal to that generated in the first instance and in this way by the alternate conversion and reconversion of the same mass     of matter the alternation between a state of liquidity and a state of gas between the liquid and the gaseous state a proportionate quantity of motion may for any length of time be generated if in the form of a parallelopiped or that of a cylinder the most commodious on several accounts is that of a cylinder the receptacle in which the liquid say as being cheapest the water is thus converted into the gaseous and reconverted into the liquid state be kept to such a degree close as that no portion of it either while in the liquid or while in the gaseous state can make its escape at the same time that a mass of solid matter one of the boundaries of which forms one of the boundaries of this receptacle is as free to move in any direction backwards and forwards the most convenient is the vertical because in that case after the occasionally generated motion generated by elasticity has been expended the constantly existing force of gravity suffices to produce a correspondent quantity of motion if of the mass of matter while in the gaseous state any portion make its escape the larger the quantity which thus escapes the larger the quantity of indefinitely elastic matter which expending its motion upon bodies other than those to which it is intended that the motion should be communicated is thus expended in waste† the system of machinery in and by which motion derived from this source is employed is called the steamengine steam being the name by which water till comparatively of late years the only species of matter which was clearly seen to be alternately interconvertible for any length of time from the liquid into the gaseous form and vice versá was alone in its gaseous form designated primum mobile in this case the water while operating in its gaseous or indefinitely elastic state secundum mobile the mass of solid matter called in the steamengine the piston to which the force thus continually generated is communicated some thirty or forty years ago a source of motion which may be considered as analogous in some respects to the barometrical and in others to the parallactic source presented itself to the imagination of the writer of these pages an instrument by which application was made of it might be styled the flashpump or rarefactionpump compared with the steamengine it has the advantage of being capable of being so employed as to generate within a given time and as it were by one stroke a much greater quantity of motion than within the same time and at one stroke could be raised by any steamengine but whether the advantage thus gained could by any circumstances be rendered such as to overbalance or balance the advantage possessed by the steamengine in the article of quickness of reciprocation is a question the answer to which must be left to any person whose positive knowledge of the subject may dispose him whilst it qualifies him to make the requisite calculations the principle may be thus explained out of a hollow cylinder open at both ends and in a vertical position stationed in an open reservoir of water a portion of the air being driven out by the sudden application of heat in a manner analogous to that employed in the montgolfier or rarefied air balloon a correspondent portion of the water being thus made to rise and occupy its place may by running out perform the office of a primum mobile for speediness of combustion a match composed of tubes open at both ends such as would be afforded by reeds or straws the longer the better cut at each end close to the knot and after being dipped in a solution of nitre would whatsoever may be the case in regard to economy at least be as well suited as any others which the nature of the case could furnish matters must be so ordered as that when the rarefication thus produced by the combustion of this match has attained its maximum a cover shall apply itself to the top of the cylinder and the more the degree of closeness wants of that perfection for the designation of which the name of hermetical is wont to be employed the less of course will be the rarity of the included air and the less the quantity of water raised by the pressure of the air on the water of the reservoir matters must likewise be so ordered as that when the height of the column of water thus raised has attained its maximum it shall be     prevented from sinking through the same channel through which it rose and shall by this means be forced to fall in the direction in which while falling it will perform the function of a primum mobile to give continuance to the effect matters would require to be so ordered as that as soon as the effect produced by the first match has ceased a second shall take its place and so on and for the accension of each match the place of human reason might be supplied by some one or other of the expeditious modes of accension already in use while that part of the water which is performing the function of a primum mobile is for that purpose descending gradually a partition sliding horizontally must separate it from that part which is to descend suddenly to make room for the reascent compared with any which is employed in the steamengine the species of fuel would of course be in a very high degree more expensive whether by the superiority of the quantity of water thus raised by a given weight of the fuel that inferiority would be counterbalanced is another point which must be left to calculation in the hands of any person in whose eyes the labour may present itself as capable of yielding a compensation if upon calculation this source of motion should in inexperienced hands be found to afford no promise of being in comparison of the steamengine capable in any situation of being employed to advantage it will in this respect stand upon a footing with the barometrical source the magnetic source and the electric and galvanic sources viii aplosyncrotic or simpleexplosion source when not without decomposition the conversion from the nongaseous into the gaseous state is effected reconversion cannot by the abstraction of the extra quantity of caloric as above be made to take place by the art of the chemist bodies in great variety have been discovered in the instance of which they being all of them in the solid state by the application of a certain quantity of caloric accumulated for the moment in a portion of matter be it ever so small the whole mass be it ever so large is with an almost instantaneous rapidity converted from the solid without passing into the liquid into the gaseous state and thereby a quantity of motion generated proportioned to the quality and quantity of the matter in the mass thus suddenly transformed and capable of being employed in the generation of motion as in the steamengine closed or open as above of these compounds the one most known and that which being in respect of cheapness most advantageous or the only one thus employed in general practice is gunpowder in this way viz in the case where antecedently to the gassification the matter in question is not in the liquid but in the solid state by the gassification of a given quantity of matter a much greater degree of elasticity and in this way a much greater quantity of motion can in a given space of time be produced than by the conversion of a quantity of matter without decomposition from the liquid into the gaseous state but forasmuch as in this way instead of being employed an indefinite number of times the mass of matter thus employed in the generation of motion cannot be made to serve more times than one hence in cases in which in one and the same receptacle the generation of motion is required to be kept up without interruption for a constancy and for an indefinite length of time this mode of simple explosion cannot be employed with advantage in the cases in which it is employed such as that of the destruction of solid bodies dead or living at great distances the preservation of the gassified matter not being possible and the quantity of motion producible by a given quantity of it being so much greater than could by the gassification of the same quantity of water be produced by a steamengine hence it is that to these destructive purposes the costly matter gunpowder and not the cheaper matter water and coal for heating it are employed in the case where in a ship of war endeavouring to escape from an enemys ship sternchase guns are fired over and above the principal effect the taking the chance for impeding the advance of the enemys ship by damage to the ship and crew some advantage is said to be obtained in the shape of acceleration given to the course of the ship from which these guns are fired some fifty years ago or more a person of the name of moore a linendraper in fleet street or cheapside formed a plan for giving motion upon this same principle to a carriage by land by the description of a carriage which was to go without horses under which was to be understood the going without the application of muscular force the particular means proposed to be employed being kept secret great expectation was excited or endeavoured to be excited as if it were an invention applicable to general use no trial of it could naturally be made without demonstrating at the same time the possibility of the achievement and its inapplicability to any generally useful purpose by persons unacquainted with the general principles of mechanics and chemistry a matchless degree of velocity was expected and at length announced to be thus attainable wagers to a considerable     amount were at the time said to be laid upon the subject of it if at any time an actual trial of it were made the project was of course thereby shown to be abortive had gunpowder been mentioned as the source trusted to its inutility would not to any person tolerably well versed in mechanics and chemistry have afforded matter for any the smallest doubt but the nature of the source not being divulged a man who for this or some other purpose happened to take a comprehensive view of the whole list of possible sources of motion would scarcely on the first mention have ventured to have pronounced the impossibility of the results declared to be expected ix magnetic source after the man the horse the windmill the watermill and the steamengine considered with a view to general and extensive use all other sources of original motion dwindle into insignificance other sources of original motion however still remain which in the way of curiosity and in a logical view are necessary to complete the inventory of the distinguishable sources of motion which as being known to be in existence or in prospect present a claim to notice magnetism electricity galvanism—to one or other of these heads it is believed may be referred all the other distinguishable sources of motion with which we are as yet or have any prospect of becoming acquainted in magnetic attraction may be seen a source of motion which of a first view is not unapt to present the idea of an inexhaustible one to magnetized iron power attractive force has and therefore can at any time be given superior to that of any other motive power which for a constancy the muscular power of man is capable of creating a magnet never tires and from diuturnity of action instead of decrease magnetic power derives increase unfortunately of any motion derivable from this source the death is immediate and not less certain than the birth the contact produced—the contact which it has in a manner for its object—all motion is at an end for concealing the source of motion and in that way affording the pleasure of surprise to uninitiated minds the use of this instrument is well enough known if motion could for a continuance be produced by it no source of motion could be so economical a one but of this there are unhappily no hopes contrivances whereby to the same magnetized bar a number of plates might be presented in a circularly recurring succession are sufficiently obvious and that in such manner that contact never taking place between the bar and any of these plates the magnetic appetite might still remain unsatisfied a brass wheel for instance in a vertical position turning on a fixed axis is say at the end of each spoke furnished with an iron plate up to this wheel on a plane forming a tangent to the circumference of the wheel a magnetized bar is slid till it arrives at the spot at which the attraction between itself and one of the plates rising from the wheel in a position exactly vertical becomes perceptible by being fixed to the wheel this plate is prevented from coming in contact with the bar and thus satisfying the magnetic appetite if by the action of the bar upon the plate first presented to it the wheel with the plate on it could be brought so far round as after coming a proportionate way under the bar to present to it a second plate and so on the circuit would thus be completed and if once completed would by the operation of the same causes be continually renewed and thus the problem of the perpetual motion would be accomplished unfortunately between the action of the magnet on the second presented plate in a direction tending to continue the revolution of the wheel and its action on the first presented plate after its descent in a direction tending to prevent such continuance an equilibrium would at some point or other in the circle take place and at that point the revolution would stop for the prevention of this catastrophe to a mind better furnished with practical mechanical experience than with sound theory the resources of mechanic art might suggest a variety of expedients of which the insufficiency would it is believed be proved by experiment in each instance but the nature of things would it is believed be inexorable the track of the subject is not however to such a degree beaten but that in any institutional work on the subject of mechanics a demonstration on this ground might it is supposed have its use x electric source that the list may not be justly accused of being an imperfect one this source of motion must be inserted in it but compared with those that have been already mentioned its radical inutility will be altogether obvious of those which appertain to the cognizance of the chemist no decomposition composition or recomposition can have taken place but motion must have been produced but in all those cases the quantity of motion is at the source by much too small and confined within too narrow limits to be capable of being communicated to any exterior body in such sort as to be productive of any serviceable or even so much as sensible effects in so far indeed as in virtue of any such decomposition or composition any change of matter from a solid or a liquid state into a gaseous state has place motion in a sensible     degree is produced but in so far what has place in this way comes under a head already brought to view viz that of the aplosyncrotic source similar in this respect to the magnetic the electric attraction extends over a space not limited as in the case of chemical attraction between particle and particle of a mass in the liquid state by the sphere of attraction of cohesion it is even as in the case of thunder and lightning capable of operating in the character of a source of motion with great force and through a great extent of space unfortunately in as far as it is under command the quantity of motion derivable from this source is by far too small to be in comparison of any of those ordinary sources abovementioned of any the smallest use and when the quantity of motion produced by it is considerable enough to be put to use were it but under command it is altogether incapable of being put under command and by this dilemma it is completely withdrawn from use xi galvanic source by the same consideration by which the obligation of inserting in the character of sources of motion the electric power the like obligation in relation to the galvanic is created already by application made of the species of physical power thus denominated has been produced a motion of long continuance a motion which presents the idea of and falls little if any short of the character of a perpetual one though in a perpetuity so curious and in that respect so desirable a solution of continuity seems liable to be ever and anon produced by an untoward state of the atmosphere but by the irreversible laws of nature the utmost that in the case of generating motion can be done by application of that species of power is in comparison with what can be done by motion derived from the ordinary sources so completely in miniature that all the achievements capable of being performed by power of this description seems irrevocably doomed to be confined within the field of curiosity without ever extending themselves over any part of the field of use in one laboratory twenty thousand galvanic dishes have been it is said and probably at this moment are at work and for a fruit and at the same time a proof of their labours a peal of bells kept ringing by them but scarcely by a hundred times as many could the sum of their action be brought to bear upon one point—could any quantity of motion applicable to any purpose of vulgar use be produced xii antactive or rcactive source the source of the application of which the use of springs furnishes an example in some instances when in consequence of external pressure applied to it by another body a portion more or less considerable of the whole mass of a body has been forced into a portion of space different from that which antecedently to such pressure was occupied by it the remaining part continuing fixed the part that was so removed returns into its antecedent position in as far as this restitution has place the body is said to be an elastic body and a correspondent fictitious entity a property a quality—the property or quality of elasticity is said to belong to it an instrument to which by appropriate configuration this property has purposely been bestowed is termed a spring a spring may be defined a reservoir of motion with reference to motion it performs exactly the office which a reservoir or receptacle of any kind performs with reference to matter a reservoir of any kind—a reservoir suppose of water—cannot for any purpose supply any quantity of matter greater than has been introduced into it a spring cannot supply any quantity of motion greater than has been introduced into it viz by what may be called the preactive or tensive force in general the greatest quantity of matter which for any purpose a reservoir can furnish is not quite as great as the greatest quantity of matter—say of water—which having been introduced to it has been contained in it at one and the same time by the attraction of cohesion a portion more or less considerable is detained by the matter of which the boundaries of the receptacle are composed and remains in contact with them in like manner the greatest quantity of motion which for any purpose a spring can furnish is probably not quite as great as the quantity of motion or capacity of motion which having been introduced into it remains in it by means of the phenomenon for the designation of which the word friction has been employed a portion more or less considerable of whatsoever motion had for the purpose in question been infused into the spring has been absorbed as it were and destroyed to actual motion the sort of capacity for motion for producing those perceptible phenomena for the designation of which the word motion is wont to be employed—in a word the sort of capacity for motion which is in this way kept in store may be considered as bearing a relation similar to that which in the case of heat what is called latent heat bears to sensible heat it is nothing more than a capacity of affording sensible heat and the substance with which it is combined and in     which it is as it were enclosed and imprisoned may in virtue of it be considered as a reservoir of sensible heat the action and efficiency of a spring is produced by and its efficiency depends upon and is proportioned to the elasticity of the matter of which it is composed the extra elasticity that is what may be called the repulsion correspondent to the attraction of cohesion or for shortness the repulsion of cohesion the repulsion by which in correspondency with the antagonizing force viz the attraction of cohesion the texture of the substance is determined to introduce into the substance designed to serve as a spring the quantity of latent motion desired some external force is and always must be applied in such manner as to counteract and overpower the repulsion of cohesion in virtue of which at the spot at which the external force is made to act the particles of the body are kept at a distance from each other if upon the removal of their external pressure no other obstacle being opposed to the action of the repulsion of cohesion the particles of matter in the spot in question arrange themselves exactly in their former places and thence at their former distances from each other the matter of which the spring is made is restored to a form exactly the same as that in which it was before the pressure in this case the body is said to be perfectly elastic if in any part after the removal of the pressure the form of the substance is different from what it was antecedently to the application of the pressure in as far as the form is thus changed in so far in the parts in question has a correspondent quantity or degree of the repulsion of cohesion been destroyed in this case the body is imperfectly elastic the degree of imperfection being in correspondency with the quantity of the repulsion in question destroyed and the magnitude of the permanent change which the form of the body has undergone the mode in which the latent motion is introduced into the reservoir may be either pressure impulse or tension distension for pressure impulse no more than one fixed point is necessary for tension two at least are necessary in the case of the bow and the catapult there are three in the case where the latent motion is produced by tension is it by the repulsion of cohesion alone or by that and the attraction of cohesion together that the reaction and consequent reinstatement is produced answer it should seem by the repulsion of cohesion alone why because in as far as the distension has place the particles are removed from one another to a distance at and beyond which the incapacity of the attraction of cohesion to act might be proved by juxtaposition in an exhausted receiver of whatsoever sort the spring may be and to the production of whatsoever ultimate effect meant to be applied it cannot be put to use any further than as whether by impulse or distension as above—a quantity of latent motion has been treasured up in the matter of which it is composed in as far as any such quantity of latent motion has been injected into it the spring may be said to be charged as the spring is put to use the motion thus treasured up is expended or as it were consumed the expenditure may be either sudden or gradual it may be termed sudden when the time occupied in the expenditure is not determinately greater than the time that had been occupied in the infusion of it if it be gradual it is so in consequence of the retardation which it experiences from some opposing and gradually yielding counterforce the term at which the expenditure or consumption whether sudden or gradual is destined to take place may be either immediately upon the termination of the winding up or other operation by which the motion is infused and the spring charged† or any subsequent instant of time in the former case the spring may be termed a spring for immediate action in the other case a spring for predestinated action in the case of the ordinary timepiece the spring is a spring for immediate action and the expenditure of the injected latent motion gradual when the expenditure is gradual in the course of it and before any fresh supply is injected it may be employed according to the quantity of it in the production of any effects quantity consumed by friction deducted to which the same quantity of original motion could be applied within the field of motion within which the process is confined of these effects the most in use to be produced are the two sorts of clocks termed an astronomical clock and a musical clock an astronomical clock is nothing more than an ordinary timepiece applied to the indication of a greater number of points of time in the same length of time than in the case of an ordinary clock or watch in a musical clock a system of tubes being provided into each of which the air being drawn at a certain aperture a particular sound is thereupon emitted and a constant stream of air being injected into a box for example by a pair of bellows in which these tubes terminate matters are so ordered that at preappointed times the aperture necessary to produce the intended succession of sounds shall be opened and when the quantity of time allotted in each instance to the sound in question has elapsed shall thereupon be instantaneously closed in the case when the general expenditure   0 being gradual as in a timepiece a particular effect not announced is predestined to be produced at a distant point of time the purpose in view howsoever in other respects susceptible of being diversified consists in the production of surprise in this case the expenditure applied to this particular purpose may as well as the general expenditure be of the gradual kind but generally speaking it is rather a sudden than a gradual expenditure that is the best adapted to this purpose of the sort of machine in the construction of which the motion produced by the spring being predestinated is instantaneous the purpose and that a very variable and extensive one is the production of surprise under the denomination of mischief in some shape or other may be included the only practical purpose to which a machine of this nature complicated and expensive as it cannot but be seems likely to be applied and for the prevention of any such mischief divulgation antecedent to the attempt divulgation the more extensive the better affords the only chance which the nature of the case admits of clocks it is said have been made in the instance of each of which by means of one winding up the motion has been continued for a twelvemonth many a one in which at a predestined time a door flew open disclosing some object or objects in motion or at rest the accusation of some individual guilty or innocent the announcement true or false of some catastrophe natural or supernatural past or future affecting this or that individual class neighbourhood or whole nation written in characters of fire it is only in semibarbarous society that a contrivance of this sort could be productive of any permanent bad effect but by the combustion of a quantity of combustible matter lodged in the machine for that purpose a conflagration might be produced in any edifice in which without due examination of its contents a case containing a machine of this sort should have been retained under the name of the torpedo for the purpose of maritime warfare in the war now so happily terminated the americans employed or had it in contemplation to employ a machine for the producing of subaqueous explosion or conflagration of a destructive machine of this sort a timepiece would naturally be a component part at the siege of troy had this application of the spring to the production of predestinated effects at predetermined points of time been known a destructive machine of this sort instead of a party of armed men would have constituted the stuffing of the trojan horse for the purpose of a security against depredation predestinated destructive movements have been inserted in receptacles destined for the preservation of articles of value against attempts on the part of depredators a contrivance for example whereby on the opening of the receptacle by any person who is not in the secret a loaded pistol is discharged in this case no demand it is evident has place for a timepiece of the latent motion by which the purpose is effected either the expenditure alone or first the infusion and thereupon the expenditure is performed by the muscular exertion by which the aperture of the receptacle is effected or attempted for such a purpose the spring would probably be found in every case a convenient instrument though cases may be conceded in which it would not be an absolutely indispensable one upon an estimate if correctly and completely formed of the effects of both sorts beneficial and mischievous in all shapes expectable from any eventually destructive machine of this description the probability seems to be that it is on the side of mischief that the balance would be found and on this supposition it would seem that besides treating all persons knowingly concerned in the fabrication of any such machine on the footing of codelinquents in respect of any mischief eventually produced by it for the purpose of timely prevention a lesser penalty might be attached to the mere act of him who knowingly as above or with just grounds of suspicion before his eyes shall have engaged or cooperated in the fabrication of it in the case of the ball employed in pastime the lateral injection or impulse is the operation by which the lateral motion is infused and the motion is instantaneous primum mobile in the case in which the bound is produced by a single fall or drop the ball itself secundum mobile the earth which thereupon reacts upon it and drives it up again primum mobile in the case in which it is struck the instrument with which it is struck or rather the primum mobile by which in action that instrument is moved for example when it is by human will that the stroke is produced the muscular fibres by the shortening of which the stroke is made in the case of the ball the whole instrument is in every part a spring when a spring enters into the composition of another instrument it has either a single fixed point or a number of fixed points of the latent motion when injected these fixed points may for the purpose of nomenclature be considered as the seats and then we have singleseated springs and doubleseated ones as in the case of the timepiece spring in the case of the common lockspring it has but one fixed point impulse is the operation by which in this case the latent motion is infused this species of spring may be called the singleseated spring in the case of the archers bow it has two fixed points both permanent distension is the operation by which in this case the latent motion is infused     at the instant preceding that of the expenditure an additional quantity of latent motion is infused by distension applied at a third point between the two and with most advantage exactly in the midway between the two sound is a collateral effect producible in certain circumstances by the expenditure of the latent motion of a spring it results incidentally and without design from the use made of an arched bow when the spring is applied to the production of musical sounds this collateral effect becomes the principal one in the case of the jews harp and the musical pitchfork the spring is of the singleseated kind not long ago an instrument was constructed a species of pianoforte in which instead of a string a pitchfork was allotted to each note no such instrument having come into use the experiment must have been an unsuccessful one the inventor was a musician of the name of claget in the case of the violin with its different enlargements—in the case of the harpsichord and the pianoforte—the spring is of the doubleseated kind the occasional additional tension is effected either by gradual friction as in the case of the violin by impulse of a plectrum passing beyond the string as in the case of the harpsichord or by a hooked plectrum drawing the string and letting it go as in the case of the harp the lute and the guitar or by a hammer striking against it and not going beyond it as in the case of the pianoforte in the case of the æolian harp the office of an impelling plectrum is performed by the wind all the strings are all of them tuned to the same note and the succession of notes is left to æolus who in such circumstances is unable to produce any other notes than those of which the combination called the common chord is composed in an organ could a stop exhibiting any pleasing variety of intonation be composed by the application of the principle of the æolian harp the air by the escape of which from the common reservoir such note is formed suppose it to strike against a string tuned to that same note the pedal spring—by this appellation may be designated the sort of spring by which a continued motion is rendered capable of being produced by the alternating tread of the human foot the spring is in this case a singleseated one to the fore end is attached an end of a cord—by the other end of which motion is given to any system of mechanism to what purpose soever applied a turninglathe diversified according to the infinite diversity of purposes to which this instrument is applicable presents the application most commonly exemplified the machine for grinding tools is one of them the use of the spring here is only after the fore end of it has been pressed down by the foot by one tread to bring itself up to its former position that it may be in readiness without change of posture to receive another tread and so toties quoties in the action thus carried on by the foot the force produced by the muscular action receives or may occasionally be made to receive more or less of addition from the attraction of gravity operating on the body in the case of the carriagespring for diminishing jolts the object is not to treasure up or direct motion but to destroy the effect of it mode in which this effect is produced—by being communicated along the substance of the spring the motion produced by the stereopiptic effect of the attraction of gravity is as it were impalpably pulverised the quantity of matter being the same the motion is divided into as many motioncules as there are particles of matter in a line measuring the altitude of the fall and throughout the line it is encumbered by the repulsion of cohesion by the expenditure of the latent motion infused by itself into this spring as into a ball as above to the aggregate of the exemplifications made and capable of being made to practical use of the instrument of reactive motion called the spring the application of the bifurcately exhaustive mode of division may if the mode should afford a promise of being useful be made by any student by whom any such promise shall have been desired and of such a labour the discovery of this or that new and useful application of the instrument might possibly be the fruit as to the author of these pages having already travelled in this track to a length sufficient for marking out the course to any such person as may happen to feel inclined to pursue it further to their industry he leaves it it must be for technology and not here that the application of the generalisative mode of considering the subject must be reserved xii eclecticospastic source a source of changes infinitely diversified is the terminal cause which from british chemists received the name of elective attraction an expressive and correctly designative name in the place of which the appellation affinity has not only by french chemists but to a great degree even by british been employed     limited as is the field of action belonging to this source confined within limits not distinguishable from those by which the field of attraction of cohesion is circumscribed—limited and that to such a degree as to be manifestly incapable of affording on any occasion a quantity of motion large enough to be employed to a mechanical purpose to any advantage still in a catalogue allcomprehensive of sources of motion it is not the less strictly entitled to a place to enable it to match with the others it will require a greek appellation eclectic suppose or eclecticospastic be that name xiii in some instances when upon the application of caloric a body is made to pass out of the solid into the liquid form in one word upon its melting say rather to distinguish this mode of liquefaction from solution in a body already in the liquid form on its being smelted its dimensions are on all sides contracted and this without any such change in its composition as that which has for its cause the species of attraction called elective attraction as above but without intestine motion in some shape or other no such change it is evident can take place of this motion the result being that upon the whole the particles of the body are nearer than they were before attraction and not repulsion is it should seem the head to which it must be referred texigenous or for shortness tictic present themselves as the names by either of which if the word idea be put into a greek dress this source of motion may be designated xiv in some instances the like contraction is the result when upon the expulsion or absorption of caloric the body passes out of the liquid into the solid form for designating the source of the motion which has place in this case the appellation stereosigenous or stereotic might with corresponding propriety be employed in the opposite direction viz expansion very considerable has been the effect produced by or on the passing of a body out of the liquid into the solid form on the freezing of an enclosed mass of water a thick mass of iron in the form of a bombshell has been burst—this for curiosity applied to fissures for the purpose of detaching smaller pieces from the huge masses of stone so denominated motion from this source has been employed in practice in the character of an economical substitute to mechanical fissures thus much for illustration in this place but as repulsion rather than attraction seems to be the genus to which this effect properly belongs it is under that head alone that its proper place will be to be found the most copious and efficient of all sources from which it is in the power of man to derive any quantity of motion for which he has a demand is that which has place when in the instance of water a mass of water is made to pass out of the liquid into the gaseous or pneumatic state in the word pneumatic or rather pneumatistic we have accordingly an epithet by which this source of motion may be designated but repulsion and not attraction is the genus to which in this as in the lastmentioned case the source of motion here in question seems properly to belong when once by the passing of a body out of the liquid into the gaseous state in a confined space a quantity of motion has been generated a correspondent and equal quantity of motion may be generated if in the same confined space the same mass may be made to pass back again out of the gaseous into the liquid state if for designating the source of the motion which has place in the case last mentioned the term pneumatistic be employed for the designation of that which has place in this present case some such term as anapneumatistic or catapneumatistic might be employed but to the head or genus here in question viz attraction neither can this source any more than that other be referred but for the motion which immediately precedes this recurrent motion would not have place and when it does take place it is not in any local and intestine attraction but only in the cessation of the intestine repulsion and the consequent sole dominion of the universally acting attraction—the attraction of gravity that it has its nominal cause to no one body or assemblage of bodies can change of any sort take place but in some mass of matter or other in some direction or other motion must take place in the case of vegetation those changes take place by which a small seed is converted into a lofty tree narrow as is the field of these motions at each given instant yet by means of them effects have been produced similar to and not less than those already spoken of as producible by the conversion of a mass of water from the liquid into the solid state by the progress of a mass of matter with the requisite accessions from the state of the small seed into the state     of the tree fissures and separations have been made not only in artificial masses of solid matter called walls but in the natural ones called rocks of the motion thus produced it seems difficult if not impossible to say in what proportion if in any it has attraction and in what if in any it has repulsion for its nominal source or nominal cause to whichsoever of these two heads the cause here in question may be deemed to belong or phytobiogenous emphyteutic present themselves as names by the one or the other of which it may be designated thus much as to that species of life which is considered and spoken of as having place in the case of vegetation over and above these motions of which so many exertions of the faculty of the will are the continually and universally experienced sources there are others viz those on which the continuance of life more immediately and essentially depends in the production of which the will bears no part in this case it seems altogether as difficult if not impracticable as in any of the preceding ones to say in what proportion if in any to attraction and in what if in any to repulsion the motions which in such infinite variety as well as profound obscurity have place are referable whether it be referable to the one to the other or to both epizoic or zoobiogenous present two adjective denominations by the one or the other or by both of which it may for the purpose of matching with emphyteutic or phytobiogenous be designated with the nominal source above designated by the term eclecticospastic or elective attraction a source productive of effects so conspicuously different can scarcely be considered as identical but to that source it seems to bear a closer analogy than to any others that have been or to any that remain to be brought to view xv economistic source magnum rectigal est parsimonia—economy is itself a great revenue—was the saying of a roman monarch whose principles in this respect might with so much advantage to subjects be adopted by so many other sovereigns to motion considered as a source of mechanic power—to motion applied to the humble purposes of mechanics it may be applied with no less propriety than to the purposes of government in this way in several instances it has been known to be applied and the ulterior instances in which it is capable of being applied with advantage but in which for want of being present to the mind it has failed of being applied are in number and variety believed not to be inconsiderable it consists in watching for and applying to use all such quantity of motion and all capacity for affording motion as within the reach of the person in question afforded either by the spontaneously exerted powers of nature or by human industry in the case where in pursuit of other objects it is occupied in giving direction to the powers of nature is obtainable from any of the original sources above brought to view in it may accordingly be seen—in the field of possibility though not in the field of actual use—a branch corresponding to each one of all these several original sources by that source of motion which is afforded by the attraction of gravity is afforded as will soon be seen the most considerable part of the field in which economy can be employed in this shape on a slight glance at the several classes on that list it will be evident that the stereopiptic the hydropiptic and the thelematic are the only ones from which under the head of this source of motion unless the selenio should be considered as an exemplification of it any considerable portion of practical use promises ever to be derived of the uses derivable in this shape from falling water and from wind every one is sufficiently aware of an occasional use capable of being made of the stereopiptic source the following mementos may afford an exemplification—   when from a quarry of any kind situated on an eminence you are conveying its contents if circumstances be favourable so order matters that whatsoever sort of carriage is employed the descent of one carriage when loaded shall without the employment of any other force produce the ascent of an empty or less loaded one for this purpose all you have to do is to fix in the middle of the breadth of the road a post or a series of posts furnished with horizontal pulleys at the elevation of the line of draught in these pulleys plays a rope attached at one end to the front of the empty carriage which is to be drawn up hill and the other end to the back of the loaded carriage which by the force of gravity is to be suffered to run down hill when circumstances admit this expedient it is believed is in common though probably not in universal use   when up one and the same ascent you have occasion to cause to be drawn a loaded carriage such a number of times that the saving of labour made in this way will be sufficient to compensate the quantity of labour and wear and tear of the materials necessary to the construction of an apparatus similar to the above instead of setting your man or men beast or beasts of draught to walk up the slope set them to walk down it whereupon by means of the rope playing on the pulley as they descend the loaded carriage will ascend in this way the weight will be acting in cooperation with instead of opposition to the muscular force employed in a mine one bucket is doubtless commonly     on the above principle employed in the drawing up an unloaded or less loaded one supposing any the least attention applied to the establishing of a balance between the descending and the ascending weights a loaded carriage could in this way be conveyed up a declivity beyond comparison steeper than any up which it would be possible for animals of draught to draw a carriage even in an unloaded state   when for any economical purpose within a limited space such as that of a mine a manufactory or ship or an edifice during the process of erection men are in the habit of ascending and descending and at the same time of carrying to the superior level masses of considerable weight the weight of whatsoever persons or things have to descend may in the same way be employed to advantage the weight to be raised being by means of a rope moving on a pulley fixed above the highest point up to which it is proposed to convey any weight and the saving thus produced in the article of labour will be equal to the labour of conveying to the superior spot in question in each instance a quantity of matter equal in weight to that the descent of which is connected with the ascent of the antagonizing mass deducting that which corresponds to the quantity lost by friction analagous to this is the expedient of saving for the purpose of thus serving in the aggregate in the character of a primum mobile portions of water too minute to be separately applicable to any serviceable purpose they are conducted into a bucket which when a quantity sufficient for the purpose has been received into it descends and in its descent raises an empty one the several known sources of motion exhibited in systematic order in the bifurcate and exhaustive mode of division and arrangement the remaining task consists in the ranging these several distinguishable sources of motion in systematic order in such sort that it may be seen in what particulars they respectively agree and in what particulars they differ archaic or original and antactic or nonoriginal—applied to the word designative of source the adjunct original disaffirms the generation of motion from any other source as a necessary condition by the adjunct antastic or reactive it is affirmed and from whatsoever original source the original first motion be derived the antastic is equally capable of manifesting itself being exemplified in the sort of instrument or mechanical power called in english a spring the antastic or reactive source of motion may also be termed the spring source purely physical or physiurgic purely psychical or thelematic and mixed physicopsychical anthropophysiurgic or psychothelematic under one or other of these heads will all original sources of motion it is believed be found to be comprehended geogenous esoteric or indigenous and exogenous or exoteric indigenous with reference to the earth the planet in which the motion in question is produced to the head of exogenous exoteric belongs the source above designated by the name of selenic or lunar     in respect of texture as depending upon and constituted by the result of the conflict betwixt or amongst the principles of internal attraction and repulsion all matter to which we have access as far as we are able to judge is at all times in one or other of these states viz   the solid   the liquid   the gaseous state and the liquid and the gaseous states are included under one common denomination viz the fluid state to each of these three states corresponds a natural purely physical source of motion to the solid state the stereopiptic to the liquid the hydropiptic to the gaseous the aerogenous in as far as it is set at work simply by the hand of nature without assistance or direction given by the hand of man it may to distinguish it from the case in which the hand of man is occupied in the giving birth or direction to it be termed æropnutic i e a source of motion afforded by the wind delodiathetic or phanerodiathetic and cryptodiathetic under one or other of these appellatives may every source of motion which belongs to the psychicophysical class be designated under the head of delodiathetic or phancrodiathetic may be arranged those sources of motion which are produced by the powers of human invention under the direction of human will operating upon any one or more of the natural sources of motion above enumerated in all which cases the motion is the result of those powers with which at all times and in his rudest state man has been familiarly acquainted viz the powers corresponding to the different states in all of which as above all matter is apt to place itself or found capable of being placed of that same psychicophysical class of sources of motion under the crypturgic or cryptodiathetic branch are here arranged those sources of motion which correspond to so many different powers or sources of motion with which in comparison with that which we have with those others our acquaintance is of recent date and in respect of extent and clearness of comprehension is still comparatively imperfect of these the list will presently be brought to view there are—  the magnetic or magneticospastic   the electric or electricospastic   the galvanic or galvanicospastic in this case the source from which the division is drawn is not any property belonging to the objects themselves but the relations which the present state of our own power bear to them respectively on this occasion the natural philosopher in his character of chemist employed in the service of the mechanician is glad to have recourse to the same shift as that which in the instance of the class cryptogamia was employed by the natural philosopher acting in the character of botanist—making the most of everything and deriving profit to science in some sort even from his own ignorance in the case in which the cryptodiathetic branch of the psychicophysical branch of the sources of motion is employed the state in which the matter or matters in question is employed in the character in question viz that of a source of motion is either a state in which at the time during which they are put in action they had already been placed by the hand of nature or a state in which for the purpose they are placed by the hand of art in the first case is that source of motion for the designation of which the appellation of barometrical is here employed in the other are the two sources of motion for the designation of which the two appellations parallacticosuncrotic and aplosuncrotic are here employed parallacticosyncrotic when as in the instance of the water which in the case of the steamengine is the primum mobile employed—to produce the effect ultimately desired it is necessary that the same portion of matter should a number of times successively pass alteruately from the liquid to the gaseous state and vice versâ aplosyncrotic when to produce the alternate effect ultimately desired no more than one such transition viz that from the liquid to the gaseous state is necessary which transition is all that the nature of the species of matter in question admits of in the first case for the purpose of their being placed in and forming part of a systematic sketch ametamorphotic in the other case metamorphotic is the appellation by which these several branches of the psychicophysical division of the aggregate system of sources of motion may be designated   the magnetic or magneticospastic   the electric or electricospastic   the galvanic or galvanicospastic—these of each of which an explanation has been given above may be considered as so many sources comprehended under the class for the designation of which the terms crypturgic and cryptodiathetic have been employed itself as above a branch of the psychicophysical class these last and themselves undivided classes or sources three in number are placed upon a one line as they present themselves without any attempt to apply to them the bifurcate mode of division their relations to one another are as yet too little understood to admit of their being thus put under subjection by the arranging hand as to that source of motion which under the name of the economistic has been brought to view by the account which on that same occasion was given of it it is represented as not to be in itself a distinct one distinct from all or any of the others it cannot therefore without impropriety be brought under any such plan of division as the one here attempted to be exemplified but the task of bringing it to view for which purpose it was necessary that a distinct name should be given to it presenting itself as one that might be productive of practical advantage it is therefore in     the character of an appendage placed at the end of the list of the distinguishable sources of motion on which the bifurcate and exhaustive mode of division has here been in the least imperfect manner which the power of the workman admitted of exemplified by the above arrangements the conception formed of the matters contained in them was in the authors own instance facilitated and as it seemed to him clarified in as far as in the instance of any other minds the like good effects shall have been produced payment for the labour thus expended will have been made detecting and if practicable remedying the imperfections from which it was not in the authors power at least with the quantity of time which he could afford to allow to the task to clear it might afford an exercise and it is imagined one not altogether unuseful to the juvenile vigour of the studious mind if from the labour thus bestowed in this field any fruit should come to be reaped by any other mind it may be referred to the improvement made upon an attempt to exhibit in the form of a systematic tree such as is here subjoined the arrangement made in his hermes by james harris of the grammatical parts of speech and of the view thereby taken of the delusions into which by his devotion to the ancients the author with all his ingenuity was on that occasion found to have been led† mechanical powers on this ulterior subject a few loose hints are all that the writer can at present afford—all that he can hope to find the readers to whom he looks disposed on this occasion to bestow any further portion of their notice to reduce to one and the same expression the description of the several sorts of instruments which are in use to be included under the common name of the mechanical powers seems to have been an object of desire and in some respects of endeavour with the authors of institutional works in any such desire in any such endeavour at least the notion of the practicability of the work is included that it may be practicable to reduce to a single expression some certain property or certain properties common to all these several instruments is a proposition which i see no reason nor feel any disposition to dispute but it is only in respect of the uses which they are capable of being put to that for any purpose but that of barren speculation and solitary amusement or curiosity they have any of them any claim to the attention of the ingenious or any other part of mankind now howsoever it may be in regard to this or that speculative property in regard to the practical applications made of them—those applications in respect of which alone they can lay any claim to the property of being of use—in reference solely to this property what may be asserted with confidence is—that they are not capable of being reduced to any such common denomination instruments for gaining force at the expense of velocity or velocity at the expense of force were this a property belonging to all of them the problem of reducing to one expression the advantage gained by them might be a not unsolvable one but out of the six or seven it is to three only that this common property can justly be ascribed viz the lever the axis in peritrochio and the pulley or combination of pulleys to the inclined plane the screw and the wedge it is not applicable in all these instances the use derived from the instrument in practice depends upon other sources upon properties in which the three beforementioned powers do not any of them partake in the case of the lever the axis in peritrochio and the pulley the power of the machine finds not an assistance but in so far as it operates an impediment whereas in the case of the screw and the wedge were it not for the power of friction the effect aimed at would not generally speaking be produced of the screw though it certainly may be and actually is employed as well as the lever axis in peritrochio and pulley in the raising of weights yet the use to which it is applied with much greater frequency and with a correspondent amount of advantage is that of connexion binding for an infinity of different purposes two or more masses of matter in a solid form into one so again the inclined plane it is not for gaining force at the expense of velocity or velocity at the expense of force that the instrument thus denominated is commonly if ever applied it is for modifying direction it is for producing in a certain direction certain results which but for this instrument could not in certain circumstances by all the force obtainable by any of these instruments be obtained suppose a natural rock or an artificial erection having for its altitude that of one of the egyptian pyramids and for the boundaries of its upper surface as well of those of its under surface those of that same pyramid by the application of force on one side of the parallelipedon with all the levers wheels and pulleys that could be collected a man would not communicate the power of either himself mounting to the top of it or causing a block of stone so to     do applying an inclined plane to it making an angle coinciding with any one of the angles made with its base and the plane at the vertex of the pyramid by one of its present sides the man may mount upon it or the block of stone may be drawn up to it on this head the theoretical conclusion is that in pursuing without sufficient scrutiny and hence with too undeviating an adherence the path chalked out by the ancients and by them pointed out by the collective appellation of the mechanical powers—the five or the six mechanical powers—the progress of science has in this part of the field as in so many others been retarded so much for the theoretical conclusion and the practical which corresponds to it and is deduced from it is that some other principle of arrangement should be looked out for and that a more comprehensive one—a principle which will afford an opportunity of placing upon the list many species of instruments which though actually invented and in use are not as yet put upon the list many instruments actually known and known to be in use and peradventure other instruments which by a more correct and complete conception of the subject may continually be brought to light what is the principle it consists in substituting to the present arrangement an arrangement which shall bear reference to the several distinguishable purposes or uses for which mechanical contrivance is in demand in one word in substituting the idea of uses to that of powers gaining force at the expense of velocity—gaining velocity at the expense of force—are but two of those purposes—are but two items in an indefinitely in an hitherto indeterminately ample catalogue changing direction is a third forming connexion is a fourth dissolving connexion is a fifth and so on but here on pain of losing myself altogether in a field foreign to the present purpose i must make an end perpetual motion in the history of the generation and extinction of the birth and death of motion is involved the question of perpetual motion one species of motion there is which as far as we can judge may with good reason be pronounced perpetual it is that by which the bodies which compose the perceptible part of the universe are kept whirling in their orbits perpetual as far as we can judge it must be presumed to be why because there can be discerned no cause the operation of which should tend to make it cease this however supposes the spaces in which they respectively move to be so many vacuums for suppose them occupied with matter in any shape—in the shape of a gas how rare soever—in the resistance opposed by friction by the gaseous repulsion of the particles of which it is composed in that resistance how distant soever the term may be may be seen a cause fully adequate to the production of its effect in the instance of the stereopiptic source numerous it is believed have been the contrivances produced by the hope of converting a source of shortlived motion into a perpetual one one consisted of a wheel in which along a spiral channel a quantity of mercury was to find its way in its fall from the axis to the circumference the longer the semidiameter of the wheel the longer the lever with which when arrived at the circumference the mass of mercury would act upon any body situated nearer to the centre make the diameter of your wheel infinite and the force you will thus acquire will be the half of an infinite force but long before you had been at the trouble of giving to it any such inconvenient extent you would have acquired force enough to pump up into the annular reservoir contiguous to the axletree a supply of mercury sufficient to continue the motion and thus your motion would be a perpetual one somewhat in this strain seems to have been the reasoning that gave birth to this contrivance by the time it had reached the circumference subtraction made of the force destroyed by friction the mercury would have produced an effect equal to the effect produced by the same mass of mercury in falling from its position near the axis to its position near the circumference without the trouble of taking any such sweep in the course of its transit from the one end of the spiral to the other it would have to make a number of descents as also a number of ascents proportioned to the number of convolutions or threads in the spiral the descents would be so many motions having for their adequate cause the attraction of gravity the ascents would be so many motions none of which would have any adequate cause friction sufficing of itself to prevent the cause which in the preceding descent they respectively had from being an adequate one all perpetual motions having for their source the attraction of gravity would it is believed be found resolvable into this mercurial one some five and forty years ago dr kenrick most known by an attack made by him on dr johnson the great in an  vo volume entituled lexiphonis took in hand the subject of the perpetual motion and on this subject read and afterwards published a few lectures of which the effect if any was to render the subject somewhat more obscure than he found it the object was to render probable the possibility of the existence of this rival of the philosophers stone one of the proofs consisted in some mention that was made of a certain mysterious wheel invented and manufactured by a person of the name of orphyonis by this wheel great were the wonders wrought but unhappily the instrument being with prudent caution kept constantly enclosed in an     opaque and welllocked box the invention died with the inventor and was thus lost for ever to the world not being known to the world by any other work the inventor orphyonis has somewhat the air of having been in the way of eponthesis derived from orpheus if any such wheel was ever made it may be affirmed without much danger of mistake that the principle upon which it was constructed was either the mercurial principle just explained or the magnetic of which the idea has been already given by the perpetual motion is designated a motion which how illgrounded soever has on various occasions been espoused by men not altogether unconversant either with the practice or with the principles of mechanics on this part of the field one true use of science is to render clear and hold up to view the delusiveness of all expectations entertained on this ground and thereby prevent the disappointments and pecuniary losses with which all such expectations can scarcely in the event of their being acted upon fail of being productive for any motion of any mass or masses of matter situated within the reach of human agency to be in the literal import of the word perpetual it would require that the masses of matter in question should be in every part indestructible and the particles of which they are composed unsusceptible of being any one of them by means of the motion or otherwise separated from any other a notion to any such effect being in opposition to universal and continual observation and experience can scarcely be supposed to have ever found admittance into any human breast but independently of the operation of any such manifestly and universally operating cause by the word friction as above explained is moreover designated a cause in which no imaginable motion from whichsoever of the above sources proceeding can fail of experiencing within a very short space of time unless renewed its inevitable death but in any case in which the motion can be said to be renewed the motion when the case is more clearly looked into will be seen not to be one and the same it is a continually successive creation of fresh motions viz in the case of falling water falling earth or wind the motions of fresh and fresh parcels of matter receiving motion one after another though in the same direction in the case of motion produced by muscular exertion fresh and fresh exertions of the will and contraction of the same or other muscles produced in consequence if in the import of the words perpetual motion were included the idea of any internal source of motion by which different particles of matter after having in any neverinterrupted series been put successively in motion were so to continue without end then and in such case there would at all times be as many perpetual motions as there are distinguishable purely physical sources of motion meaning individual sources not species of sources operating and producing motion as above but in no one of the cases in which a perpetual motion has been said to be invented or said to be capable of being invented does any such state of things appear to have been in view appendix—no vi sketch of the field of technology to a course such as that here proposed a not unapt conclusion may it should seem be afforded by a view of what has been termed technology—general technology—the aggregate body of the several sorts of manual operations directed to the purposes of art and having for their common and ultimate end the production and preparation of the several necessaries and conveniences of life of a view of this art the amusiveness no less than the instructiveness will receive no small increase if to the exhibitive description accompanied as far as may be with the exhibition of the instruments and operations themselves be added an indication of the rationale of the several operations by the rationale is here meant an indication of the end most immediately in view and the considerations by which as between instrument and instrument or operation and operation the choice appears to have been determined by a familiar example what is here meant will it is believed be rendered sufficiently apparent for the purpose of making holes destined to give admission to threads employed     for the purpose of junction the instrument employed by the tailor is the needle that employed by the shoemaker the awl when the needle is employed the work it is evident may be made to go on with a degree of rapidity much beyond any that can be given to it by the awl why then in the case of shoemakers work employ the awl—answer because the habiliment fastened by the shoemaker—having for its principal object the exclusion of water to the action of which it is continually exposed at the same time that the material is of that sort which when a hole has been made in it has but little tendency to fill up the vacuity—could not if the needle were employed be made to answer the intended purpose the needle is capable of admitting the thread only by means of a slit called the eye made at the thickest end of the needle into which the thread is passed and therefore doubled the needle is a cone of which the transverse section is a circle the thread without being in some part of its length double cannot pass through the hole made by the needle without passing in the form of two cylinders enclosed both of them within the circle formed by the abovementioned section of the needle but in this way notwithstanding whatsoever elasticity may happen to be possessed by the substance into which the holes are made it cannot be but that a part and that a very considerable one of the circle will remain unfilled up and at this part if the habiliment be a shoe and the material leather the water will gain entrance on the other hand when for making the holes the instrument employed is the awl the thread is not attached to it the thread is a strip of leather the section of which is a square a form by which the hole will be more exactly filled up than by any other that could be given to it of this square the central part is occupied by a hogs bristle a cylinder which being comparatively inflexible and of a diameter smaller than that of the hole destined for the strip of leather in which it is imbedded a ready admission will be obtained into the hole as soon as the awl is drawn out of it for the purpose of such a conspectus a work of indubitable use would be a logical i e an analytical arrangement of the several manual operations employed and employable for the purposes of the several arts considered on this occasion and for this purpose in conjunction say therefore of art in general to any person by whom a work of this sort should be undertaken very useful hints would be found afforded by a work of bishop wilkins as a copy of that most ingenious work is not obtainable but by accident an extract from it containing as much as seemed applicable to the purpose in question will be found in the appendix to this present essay in the works of recent naturalists chemists and nosologists and in particular in the philosophia botannica of linnæus the father as he may be termed of somatological tactics much useful instruction many excellent patterns may be found applicable to such a work that in such a work these patterns or standards of reference cannot in any part be closely copied will be evident enough but that by the aid of analogy instruction in abundance will be derivable from them will be found equally indubitable from the consideration of the purpose together with other considerations subordinate to that leading one mechanical instruments and operations and their results or products may as well as plants or other natural bodies be arranged into classes those classes divided into orders and subdivided into genera and species between orders and genera other divisions if found necessary being interposed and to these several aggregates thus continued one within another names taken for distinction sake from one or other of the dead languages may be attached say for instance name of one of the genera of instruments terebræ—instruments employed for the boring of holes species—  the awl   the gimblet   the augur   the whimble c

by a systematical or say an analytical arrangement of this kind taking throughout for its leading principle the object or end in view it will form all along as the work proceeds a bond of connexion and as it were a channel of intercourse between art and art artists of all sorts how different soever the results and products of their respective arts may thus receive instruction from each others practice each may thus find his mind expanded—expanded in that direction in which being prepared for it by antecedent practice expansion will be most easy and pleasant for a work of this sort in the french   0 descriptions des arts et metiers materials will be found in abundance but conducted upon the systematic and allcomprehensive plan above brought to view it will possess a degree of utility beyond any to which that work so much as aimed of that work the compilers were philosophers and in that character something in this way might not unnaturally have been looked for at their hands but of so vast and diversified an aggregate of materials the collection and the arrangement—the arrangement in logical order such as is here in question was too much to look for not only from the same hands but perhaps from the same half century in a case such as this the particulars required had not only to be collected upon a most ample scale but compared and confronted one with another in an infinity of directions before the work of classification could be entered upon with any very promising prospect of lasting use bulky to a degree of unwieldiness is that justly celebrated work† but even with those ample additions which by english practice might doubtless be afforded to the stock of the materials it follows not that in point of bulk a systematical work of the kind here proposed need by a great length approach to the bulk of that vast and elaborate performance by apt aggregations infinite is the number of particulars which in such a case may be found superseded in different trades an instrument which in all these several instances is of precisely the same use an operation which in all of them is of precisely the same nature may stand designated by so many different names for a course of chrestomathic instruction as here proposed a work of this nature would form a necessary textbook by the indication of such a work in the character of a requisite the possibility of commencing such a course may seem at first view to be thrown forward to an immeasurable distance   but in the first place it is not till the very end of the proposed chrestomathic course—viz say for seven or eight years—that any such particular course is so much as proposed to be delivered   in the next place for a commencement an extempore work very far not only from the utmost attainable perfection but from the degree of perfection of which an idea can be formed at present will be of indubitable use and as such presents an undeniable claim to favourable acceptance be it ever so little ever so imperfect whatsoever will in this way have been done will be so much more than will ever have been done before   in the third place by any one by whom to the following sketch by the ingenious bishop a moderate share of attention will in this case be bestowed no inconsiderable portion of that appearance of extraordinary difficulty which the subject may at first view have presented will it is believed be seen to vanish appendix—no vii hints towards a system and course of technology from bishop wilkins logical work published by the royal society a°      under the title of an essay towards a real character and a philosophical language—pp        in the character of a practical project fit for use this work with all its ingenuity failed in its design being written before the discoveries made in the field of pscychology by locke it seems not likely that by the formation of a new language the difficulties and inconveniences attendant on the use of the collection of signs at present employed in the registration and communication of ideas would be diminished in no other way than through the medium of some existing language with which he is already acquainted could any person be made to learn any such new formed language the difficulty of learning this new language in which at the outset not so much as one book could be found would therefore be a new created difficulty in compensation for which it does not appear how or where any preponderant or equivalent facility would be to be found enriched partly by analogy from its own stores partly by importation from foreign languages dead and living some one of the existing european languages would it should seem be found better adapted to the purposes of an universal language than any new one which in the nature of the case could be framed moreover in his explanations the ingenious author began at the wrong end not observing that it is from our corporeal ideas that all our mental ideas are derived and that accordingly as far as the means of tracing them have been within our reach all words now employed in giving expression to incorporeal ideas were originally employed in giving expression to corporeal ideas words now employed for giving expression to incorporeal ideas are those which he begins with thus putting the cart before the horse at the time when this essay was written the discoveries made by locke in the field of psychology had not been published if they had been known to this ingenious author this book of his would either not have been written or would have appeared in a form considerably different in the complete failure of the main design may perhaps be seen the cause why it is at present so little known and why for this it is believed is the fact that notwithstanding     the patronage and recommendation of the royal society of which this bishop was one of the most respectable members it never saw a second edition but in other respects it would be

success to the elementary branches the following principles not having any particular connexion with the new system nor having been included in the attestation given in favour of that system by extensive experience could not present a sufficient title to be included in the table in the character of candidates for examination they are however submitted to the consideration of the competent authorities it will at the same time be a question for learners and adepts in the science to answer to themselves whether in this same method additional promptitude may not be found as well as positive facilities for the arranging of geometrical ideas in their minds and aiding the communication of them upon occasion to others whether in the character of learners or adepts i principles with

     mode of performing this exercise without the aid of any diagram and consequently without the use of any of those signs such as the letters of the alphabet which as often as for bringing to mind the figure in question a diagram or delineation of it is employed are necessary for designating and distinguishing from each other the parts of the figure a proposition in the geometrical sense of the word and consequently the figure which is the subject of it is expressed in words alone which words will of course be such that every proposition using the word proposition in the logical and grammatical     sense which they serve to constitute will be what is called a general proposition having for its subject not merely an individual object but a class genus or sort of objects without the aid of any diagram any such description can it then be given in such manner as to be intelligible from his own experience—from experiments made at his suggestion in the instance of three persons at two widely distant points of time—the writer of these pages is enabled to answer in the affirmative in the instance of two of them the experiment began with euclids elements and went no farther than the first six books in the instance of the other person it began with one of the most copious and at that time best approved institutional works on conic sections and was continued if he misrecollects not to the very end in both instances the papers in which the descriptions in question are contained are in his possession though at this moment not accessible in all three instances the learners were of a selfdirecting age what was done was done purely for the satisfaction as well as instruction of the operators themselves and not in the way of exercise for the satisfaction of a teacher for except the learners themselves in no one of the three instances was there any teacher in the case in the case of the conic sections though he himself neither did at that time read nor since then has ever read so much as a page of what was written yet so it was that the whole of it was written in his presence and well does he remember the tokens of selfsatisfaction as well as promptitude and velocity with which the performance of the selfimposed task continued as it was during a course of some months was accompanied—symptoms which for such a length of time nothing but the full sense of continual success could assuredly have produced but without a perfect conception or at any rate without the supposed consciousness of such perfect conception a task of this kind and of this length never could have been performed from first to last no diagram having been employed consequently no reference to any actually drawn diagram made it is only by words—by words of a purely general nature that the several relations borne by the several parts of the figures in question to each other that the ideas in question could have been expressed but in this way the ideas in question having actually been expressed how much superior in the character of an intellectual test this species of exercise cannot but have been in comparison with any other will it is hoped without entering into any diagrammatical exemplifications be found sufficiently intelligible for this purpose a particular mode of designation applicable to the several parts of a geometrical figure required to be devised and was devised and settled accordingly for example in order that such words of designation as right left top bottom and the like might be capable of being employed it was necessary that of the figure of which a description was to be given the position should be determined but once for all care was taken to declare and record that it was merely for the purpose of description and exemplification that so far as concerned position this declaration was made and that in whatsoever position the figure were placed the species it belonged to and the properties it possessed would be the same i enunciation or enunciative part—enunciative viz of the proposition to be demonstrated† ii demonstration or demonstrative part in every portion of discourse to the whole of which the term proposition—a proposition—is customarily applied by geometricians these two parts at least will be found to these will in most instances be found added what may be termed the direction—directive part or preparatively directive part viz the part by which direction is given for the operation to be performed and for necessary additions to be made to the originally exhibited or conceived figure for the purpose of preparing the ground for the demonstration in euclids elements without exception and for a considerable extent if not for the most part in other books in the higher branches of geometry in giving expression to the enunciation as above the mode of purely verbal designation here proposed for all the abovementioned parts is actually employed but so far as this practice is pursued the propositions taking the word proposition in the logical sense are all general the ideas conveyed by them are all general ideas and in this original state it is and without need of extension that in so far as they have place in the mind they lie there ready to be applied upon occasion to all such individual figures as are respectively comprehended within their import but now instead of being thus general suppose the mode of designating them such as to confine the application of them to the individual     figure exhibited by the diagram that accompanies them for example instead of saying a square having for its side the longest boundary of a right angled triangle is exactly equal to both the squares taken together which have for their sides respectively the two other boundaries of the same triangle suppose the proposition worded thus—in the triangle in question describing it by letters the square having for its side such boundary describing it again by letters is exactly equal to both the squares taken together which have for their sides respectively the two other boundary lines describing them also by letters by such a mode of expression or designation if it be supposed that no other more general mode is ever added or substituted to it what general ideas—what practically applicable instruction would be conveyed answer—surely not any for rendering the proposition susceptible of conveying any such instruction what would be the course necessary to be pursued answer—to substitute to this diagrammatical and individualizing mode of expression or designation the purely verbal and thence general mode of expression or designation here in the first place brought to view here then before any real acquisition in the way of science can be made there is an additional operation that must be performed—an additional operation requiring much greater exertion of mind to perform it as well as a much greater strength and maturity of mind to be able to perform it than the original one this general mode of expression or designation which to the purpose of useful and practically applicable intellection will in the case of the enunciation as above explained be acknowledged to be at least to a very considerable extent absolutely necessary will it is hoped in the case of the other two parts of the proposition be acknowledged to be at least useful useful viz on the supposition of its being practicable and that it is practicable hath as above been already proved by repeated experience without any contrary experience to oppose to it diagram occasionally discarding principle by the word occasionally thus inserted in the composition of this one of the names to be employed for the designation of this principle intimation is given that upon the diagrammatical i e the ordinary mode of designation no permanent exclusion is proposed to be put that it is in aid and not in lieu of that ordinary mode that the one proposed—the purely verbal mode—is proposed to be employed so far is any such constant exclusion of the diagrammatical mode from being intended that by the principle mentioned in the fourth place this diagrammatical mode is to some purposes by means of a set of adapted signs proposed to be employed by itself by itself and thereby to the occasional and temporary exclusion of the verbal mode that under the burthen imposed by the labour of forming by means of a description given in the purely verbal mode a conception of the figure meant to be presented to the mind considerable relief will very frequently be afforded by a glance at the figure cannot admit of doubt for facilitating conception in the first instance the verbal mode and the diagrammatical mode will thus be employed in conjunction in conjunction and so far perhaps with not very unequal advantage in comparison with the diagrammatical mode no mean advantages will it is believed be found attendant on the purely verbal mode   one is—the giving to the general ideas the presence of which in the mind is in every instance necessary to intellection a sort of perpetual and uniform fixation by means of a determinate set of words—thoroughly considered apposite and thereby sooner or later perfectly adequate words—instead of leaving these general ideas to be on each individual occasion in a hasty and therefore frequently in an inadequate manner caught up in the way of abstraction caught up without words for the fixation of them and therefore in case of error without possibility of correction there being no permanent or determinate object to which correction can apply   the other advantage is—the saving that will frequently be made of the expense of time and labour necessarily attached to the making out the several parts of the figure by means of the letters employed in the designation and moreover of the perplexity and as it were mental stammering with which the operation of ringing the changes upon these letters is especially in unpractised minds so apt to be attended sometimes it is true it may happen that in addition to the general glance taken of the figure recurrence to these letters may for the purpose of forming a conception of this or that part of it be found necessary but at other times it may happen that no such recurrence will be found necessary the need of it having been effectually superseded by the purely verbal description by means of the general words contained in it a question here presents itself as one which by any learner in geometry might not unaptly be put to the author of any institutional work by means of which he was occupied in teaching himself the directions and reasonings the only use of which is to convey so many general ideas why is it that for giving expression to them you have not while in the case of the enunciation made of the proposition to be demonstrated you actually have employed the correspondent general words these general words did you know where or how to find them then why is it that you have not found them and produced them with all its load of unavoidable and immoveable difficulty is not the task heavy enough for us must this additional this moveable difficulty be left pressing on us these same general     and only adequate words is it then that you have not been able to find them you to whom by so many years of study and so often continually repeated applications to practice the subject has been rendered so perfectly familiar—with what degree of consistency can you entertain any such expectation as that we to all of whom the subject is perfectly new and many of whom are in various degrees dull or inattentive or both should be able to accomplish at the moment and at every moment a work which our master has not been able to perform in so many years thus much will not it is believed be found open to dispute the only idea which in any case is conveyed by the individual figure in question as delineated in the diagram in question—the individual figure of which the parts are designated by the letters of reference—is an individual one but except in as far as by abstraction from these individual ideas general or specific ideas are formed from no number of such individual diagrams can any general ideas applicable to any practical purpose be deduced this process of generalization the learner in question is he competent to the performance of it if he is then proportioned and equal to the number of these acts of generalization that he is competent to and performs accordingly is the stock of mathematical science which he actually lays up at any rate for the time but in any given instance suppose a general idea thus formed and for the moment laid up note well the great disadvantage under which the operation is performed no precise form of general words has the learner before him by which this idea of his stands expressed and by which were he provided with it the idea might as it were be anchored in his mind if the occasion of making application of it recur with a certain degree of frequency he will notwithstanding the want of apt words for the expression of it retain it in a state fit for use but let it for a certain length of time be unemployed the words which should have held it fast being wanting the consequence is it drops out of his mind and as well might it never have been lodged there whatsoever form of words is necessary and sufficient to the giving expression to the general idea which the individual diagram with the letters which all along apply to it are intended to convey—now suppose it as in the case of euclids proposition as abovementioned ready provided and extended not only to the propositions but also to the demonstrations and the directions by which the preparatory additions to the figure are described things being in this state the idea from the very first presents itself to his mind in all its generality in the only garb and condition in which it is capable of being applied to use if then so it is that from the proposition in question demonstrations as above included he has succeeded in deducing any idea at all that idea is a general one an idea fit for use it is not a mere individual idea having for its necessary support the individual figure in that case employing the general words in question or others that are equivalent to them he will in addressing himself either to a teacher for the purpose of proving or to a learner for the purpose of communicating his proficiency find himself on the occasion of any line for instance which for the purpose of the demonstration requires to be drawn in a condition able to describe it by words designative of the relation which when drawn it will bear to the other parts of the figure he will not say draw a b or draw a c leaving it for the party addressed to make discovery of the place which the line when drawn will occupy a discovery which otherwise than by seeing the diagram and thereupon copying that part of the diagram he will for want of the general words in question find it impossible to make true it is that without actually having given either by word of month or in writing any such purely verbal description of it to have framed and entertained a clear correct and complete conception of the proposition in question be it what it may is altogether possible if it were not scarcely perhaps would so much as a single person be found by whom in relation to any such proposition any such conception had ever been entertained but not the less true is it that by one who upon being required were to find himself ultimately unable to give in relation to it that sort of purely verbal description no such clear correct and complete conception of it could really be entertained of the propositions themselves considered as distinct from the demonstrations and the introductory steps as above by euclid a description of the sort in question—a purely verbal description—has as in every instance been actually given but when he comes to the introductory steps preparatory additions then it is that as if to save the trouble of finding for his conceptions an adequate assistance of general expressions having given his diagram it is to the component parts of that individual diagram as indicated by the letters of the alphabet that he refers us draw the line a b or draw b c says the direction that he gives us but on what account was it that he required us to draw this line plainly on this account and no other viz on account of a certain relation which the line so drawn would when drawn be found to bear to the other parts of the figure it is only in virtue of some such relation that the lines when drawn can be applicable to the purpose but by the letters a b or b c is this relation in any degree expressed not it indeed that same instructive that same intellectionproving     and at the same time intellectionconveying mode of expression which he uniformly applied to his propositions—i e the mere grammatical sentence enunciative in each instance of the geometrical relation the existence of which is thereby undertaken to be demonstrated—how happened it that he did not continue the application of it to his demonstrations and the directions given for the preparatory steps had the question been put to him for despatch would probably have been his answer but for want of knowing very well how would not improbably have been the more correct answer and at any rate what should be not only a correct answer but moreover an addition to such effect as would have been necessary to the forming a complete one for the composition of a book of instruction upon that plan the human mind had not in his time made sufficient advance the mathematician is one sort of person the logician is another it is by generalization that all inventions are accomplished most discoveries made but generalization by wholesale generalization upon an allcomprehensive scale is the work of the logician it is by the same process performed upon a comparatively small scale—performed as it were by driblets—that the particular discoveries in mechanical philosophy in chemical philosophy and even in mathematics have been made but it is one thing to make progress in a certain track another thing to be able to give a description a clear and correct and complete and easily apprehensible description of the progress so made in that same track thus it is that in this as in so many other parts of the field of science infancy under the preposterous name of antiquity—infancy continues to set the law to maturity inexperience to experience in regard to this gap in the mass of requisite instruction ask for the reason of its existence if by the word reason be meant a productive cause having its root in the essential nature of the subject no such reason will be found but if by the word reason be meant a cause having its root in the nature of the human mind there is nothing in it but what in every part of the field of thought and action lies constantly under our eyes authority and habit—in these two words in as far as sinister interest is out of the question may be seen the cause of all deficiencies in the system of instruction which time for the operation not having been wanting continue unsupplied authority—the authority of great names habit—the habit of continuing to travel without reflection in the track in which with or without reflection men have begun or continued to travel already in the use of general terms for giving expression to the correspondent general relations between the correspondent sorts of figures and parts of figures euclid the father of geometry went not beyond the collection of words expressive of the purely enunciative part of the discourse called a proposition for the demonstrative part and the preparatory part he left it to the learner to deduce the general ideas from the individual objects presented by the individual diagram in company with the words of which by the reference made to it the import was in like manner individualized can there be any need of doing or so much as use in doing that which in the eyes of the father of the science was not fit or at least not necessary to be done the papers in question in and by which application was so long ago made of the purelyverbalexpressionmaximizing principle to a large portion of euclids elements not being immediately accessible an exemplification of it applied to the first proposition of these elements has by the writer of these pages been hastily formed for the purpose and will be found in the appendix to save recurrence to books along with it is given a reprint of the same proposition as exhibited in the customary form in mr professor playfairs elements of that science whether in any and if in any in what degree the conception of the subject is facilitated by the mode here proposed is a question to the answering of which an understanding matured and in other respects not ill furnished but by which little or no attention has happened to have been bestowed upon this branch of science will be in a particular degree well adapted mode of making the experiment to try the utility of the proposed mode so far as concerns facility of conception   try whether the purely verbal mode of designation is intelligible without a diagram for this purpose the diagram as given without the letters of reference and the diagram as given with the letters of reference should both be covered   if it be not perfectly or readily intelligible without a diagram uncover that diagram which has not any letter of reference   if it be not perfectly or readily intelligible even then uncover now the diagram which has the letters of reference as to the giving facilities to conception by this advantage should it in any way be found included among the effects of the proposed mode not only in the instance of each scholar would the labour be alleviated and expenditure of time diminished but in a greater degree than antecedently to experience would perhaps be expected the number of the scholars   0 reaping from this part of the instruction substantial benefit would be increased even in the grammar school under the old and still subsisting mode large according to an eminent and most amply experienced master is the proportion of scholars by whom at the end of a long series of years no efficient learning is obtained larger again by far among those by whom after years spent in the endeavour on one part to infuse learning in this shape on the other to imbibe it is the proportion by whom no efficient stock of it is obtained under the name of the asss bridge the  th proposition in the very first book of euclid is the known stumblingblock the ne plus ultra to many a labouring mind† why because to the purpose of clear conception to the purpose of efficient instruction the method traced out by euclid and followed blindfold for so many ages is lamentably incompetent in the chrestomathic school it may be presumed with some confidence there will be no asss bridge the asss bridge having thus presented itself to view the temptation of exhibiting this additional test of the utility of the purely verbalexpressionmaximizing principle was too strong to be resisted to the labour of giving expression in this mode to euclids first proposition has accordingly been added in the appendix the correspondinglike labour applied to the  th proposition called the asss bridge‡ to what length in the field of mathematics this substitution of ordinary and unabbreviated language to scientific and abbreviated is in the nature of the case capable of being carried with advantage can scarcely be determined antecedently to experiment what is certain is that in the details in the actual performance of algebraical operations i e on any other occasion or for any other purpose than that of explanation practised in the way of instruction it cannot be carried over the whole for in as far as pursued in detail the system of abbreviation is essentially necessary to the performance of the operations themselves when taken in the aggregate but for this assistance a long life might be consumed before more than a small part of those which have actually been performed could be perused and understood after their being respectively invented not to speak of the labour expended in the course of the invention but while the uses of ordinary language were confined to the giving expression to principles i e to propositions of so general and extensive a nature as that by each of them large bundles of details bundles more or less large and copious might be embraced whether a degree of progress considerable enough to be productive of sensible advantage might not thus be made is a matter to which experiment may be looked to for a determinate answer and in the meantime the conjectures in anticipative views taken of the subject by the learned for a provisional one in proportion as in the character of principles a number of these propositions all expressed in ordinary language are brought to view—and laid before the reader all of them in one view—such point of conformity and disconformity will it may be expected be found to have place among them as will enable the mind to bind a number of them together into bundles capable of being each of them designated by a term of more extensive import these bundles into still smaller bundles and so on at each step of this abstractive process the number of the bundles thus diminishing and the extent of each thus receiving increase to what length the nature of the case would suffer this process to be carried on the greatest adept would scarcely venture to predict but that the further it were carried on the more clear and complete would be the view thus rendered obtainable will hardly be regarded as matter of dispute that for this purpose changes would require to be made in the stock of expression afforded by ordinary language seems scarcely to admit of doubt some terms might require to be added others substituted to that part of the ordinary language which is applicable to the purpose but it is in the way of definition that the whole of this business might be despatched in these definitions in as far as the word had been already employed in different senses the object and effect of the operation would be to fix the import in as far as it was new to give to it for the first time an import applicable to the subject in all these cases in the first instance the defined word alone would be the word which would be foreign to the stock of the ordinary language to the ordinary language would belong all the words employed in the explanation of it true it is that when once a word in itself new and thence foreign to the ordinary language had thus received its explanation viz in ordinary language it then without inconvenience might be employed and of necessity would be employed in the explanations given of other such new words but in comparison with the perplexity produced by the introduction of an extensive system of new characters the utmost perplexity that would be produced by the introduction of new words supposing them to be in a moderate degree expressive and at the same time elucidated by explanations expressed in ordinary language would be inconsiderable indeed especially if the number of them was so insignificant as to admit of their being in the form of a synoptic table spread under the eye all together at one time     ii practicaluseindication maximizing or practicalapplication maximizing principle signal would be the service rendered to mankind if by some competent hand a line were to be drawn between those parts in the field of mathematics the contents of which are and those the contents of which are not susceptible of practically useful application   in some instances the whole contents of the field are of this useful kind and in respect of right practice absolutely necessary such is the case for example with the doctrine of probabilities so far at least as the application of it is confined to such events as besides being actually exemplified or liable to be exemplified are of a nature interesting to that is liable to be productive of pain or pleasure to mankind in these instances figure has no place to the field of arithmetic deloporic or adeloporic—simple or algebraical—manifestly expressive or nonmanifestly expressive—this class of instances is confined such again is the quantity added to any mass of money or moneys worth by allowance paid for it whether in the shape of interest or discount   another class of instances there is in which the whole contents of the field are of this useful and at the same necessary kind the field is the field of uranological geography or topography the field of astronomy in as far as the mass of art and science belonging to it is applicable to the ascertainment of the extent of portions or the relative position of single places or spots on the earths surface in this class of instances not only number but figure is a necessary object of regard the field to which they belong lies therefore within that portion of the field of mathematics which is common to geometry and arithmetic   in another class of instances the contents of the field are beyond question occasionally useful but without being constantly and in every part of it necessary this field is the field of mechanics taken in the largest sense in which that appellation is employed in this field the most general and intelligible use consists in the saving of what may be called fumbling viz experiment—first experiments or observations employed to ascertain some general matter of fact which by calculation alone—calculation grounded on existing experiments and observations might without the aid of fresh ones made on purpose have sufficed how great a quantity of labour and thereby of the matter of wealth and of time—and thereby of the matter of life which might have been saved by mathematical calculation has been wasted in fumbling may be more easily imagined than ascertained in this case too the field belongs to that portion of the field of mathematics which is common to algebra and geometry between what is susceptible of practically useful application and what is not susceptible of practically useful application why is it that this line ought to be drawn what is it that calls upon professional men engaged in the teaching of this branch of art and science to take this task upon themselves answer—that persons who either cannot afford or on any other account are not willing to bestow any part of their time upon any parts of the field from which no practical use can be reaped may not by ignorance of this distinction be drawn into any such misapplication of time and labour a moral transgression though unpunishable an injury analogous to the crime called fraudulent obtainment or obtainment of money on false pretences would be the act of that teacher who knowing that the purpose of the pupil was not to go beyond the productive part of the field should for want of the landmark or warningpost in question here called for lead him upon the irremediably barren part of the field of a proposition which in any shape has as above a physical use the use will be found exemplified either in some branch or branches of physical art and science i e of natural philosophy as it is so commonly though unaptly called or in the doctrine of probabilities of these branches see a list though not exactly a complete one in table i without having any immediate application to any branch of physics as above and therefore without having any immediate use a proposition may still have a practical use if it has this use may in this latter case be termed a preparatory use a proposition belonging to geometry suppose it to be itself not susceptible of application to any branch of physics but suppose it at the same time necessary to the demonstration of another which is susceptible of such application immediate use it has none but it has a preparatory use such preparatory use may by any number of degrees be removed from the immediate use a proposition is of no use but in respect of its being necessary to the demonstration of another that other is of no use but in respect of its being necessary to the demonstration of a third let a series of this sort be of any length if at the end of it we come to a proposition which has an immediate use every proposition in the series has its use for every one of them has a preparatory use in the chrestomathic school time will not allow of the giving admission to more than a comparatively small part of these mathematical propositions which are not only practically true but practically useful much less of the giving admission to any that possess not this essential requisite in so far as practicable it will therefore be highly useful that selection should be made for making the selection a principle of distinction has already just been pointed out and for the making application of it a process mainly mechanical is altogether obvious     in relation to each of the several branches of natural science as above look over some work or works the most correct and upon the whole the most complete that can be found in which to any part of the physical subject is question application has been made of mathematical and in particular of geometrical propositions in as far as this has been done the work is a work of what is called mixed mathematics in each of these works note under the occasions in which and the places in which use has been made of any proposition beginning at least if not ending with those for example of euclid from them make out a list or table headed with the names of these several propositions this done in any new edition published of that elementary work euclid under the head of each proposition make reference if not to the several instances at any rate to some of the most eminently useful of the instances in which application has thus been made of it ranging them under the head of the branch of physical science to which they respectively belong and referring to the work in which they have been found so in the case of those whose use is of the preparatory kind for labour whether of body or mind there exists not any more effectual sweetener than the indication of use that branch of useful art or science is scarcely to be found in which for the acquisition of the instruction it affords labour of mind so intense or in itself so irksome is necessary as in mathematics in the existing mode the manner of administering the instruction is pregnant with perplexity to the learner and no such indication as above is employed to sweeten it in the now proposed mode the manner in which the instruction is administered will be found much less perplexing and in the addition of the practical use the labour will find its natural edulceration the indication of the reward naturally attached to it by the humble and sincere desire of rendering himself useful to mankind by contribution made to an association which has for its object the giving extent in every sense of the word to useful instruction the writer of these pages finds and that not without very serious and unfeigned regret that he has fallen into a sort of system which at edinburgh and probably in many other seats of learning is deemed heretical for true it is that such is his fortune and in this respect his misfortune that he belongs to that school to which in      the late dr beddoes in      the present mr professor leslie not to speak of mr locke have been found to belong to this same school it was moreover his good or ill fortune to belong as from what is above stated may be suspected many years before the work of dr beddoes on this subject was published and perhaps before that ingenious philosopher belonged or had even been sent to any school to him it is not a matter of exultation but of regret not a pleasureable reflection but a painful one that if this his view of the matter should be found correct and useful if by means of institutional books composed upon the purelyverbalexpressionmaximizing principle geometry for example should be found to be learned at the same time either more easily or more thoroughly than in the present mode all the institutional books at present existing on this subject would be found comparatively useless and cease to be the subjects of purchase that without regret or even without displeasure such a state of things should be contemplated by persons interested either in respect of pecuniary matters or in respect of reputation in the existing stock of writers on this subject is not consistent with human nature and if in this instance that line of conduct should on the part of persons so circumstanced be pursued which in all other instances has been pursued the object of general research will be by what means the reputation of the idea and thence of him by whom it was advanced may most effectually be depressed but if by considerations of this sort men to whom it seemed that they had anything new and useful to offer had been induced to suppress them no improvement would ever have been made in any part of the field of art and science and in the present instance a circumstance fortunate to the heretic is that in no case could the resentment of orthodoxy fall lighter than in his of this school in as far as concerns mathematics the principle or principles may thus briefly be brought to view otherwise than in so far as it is applicable to physics mathematics except for amusement as chess is useful is neither useful nor so much as true   that except as excepted it is not useful is a proposition which when clearly understood will be seen to be identical a proposition disaffirming it would be a selfcontradictory one   that it is not so much as true will it is believed be found upon calm and careful reflection to be little if anything different from an identical proposition a proposition contradicting it little if anything different from a selfcontradictory one a proposition in mathematics geometry excepted what is it a proposition in which physical existences i e bodies and portions of space are considered in respect of their quantities and nothing else a proposition in geometry what is it a proposition in which physical existences as     above are considered in respect of their figure and thereby in respect of their quantity but in no other respect a proposition having for its subject the geometrical figure called a sphere is a proposition having for its subject all such bodies as can with propriety be termed spherical bodies as likewise all such individual portions of space as can with propriety be termed spherical spaces and so in the case of a cone a cube and so forth in as far as any such individual portions of matter and space are actually in existence the proposition is actually true in as far as any such portions of matter or space may be considered as likely to come into existence or as capable of coming into existence it may be considered as having a sort of potential truth which as soon as any such portions of matter or space come into existence would be converted into actual truth in point of fact no portion either of matter or space such as agrees exactly with the description given by mathematicians of the sort of figure called a sphere ever has come into existence there seems reason to believe but by this circumstance though in a strict sense—that is to the mere purpose of absolutely correct expression—the truth of all propositions concerning the sort of figure called a sphere is destroyed yet in no degree is the utility of any of them either destroyed or so much as lessened in no degree is the truth of them destroyed or lessened with reference to any useful purpose with reference to any purpose or in any sense other than a perfectly useless one a general proposition which has no individual object to which it is truly applicable is not a true one it is no more a true proposition than an army which has no soldier in it is a true army a fagot which has no stick in it a true fagot a mathematical proposition which has no individual portion of matter or space to which it is truly applicable is a general proposition which has no individual object to which it is truly applicable among the sorts of things which are the subjects of mathematical propositions there is not one which contains any individual objects which with strict truth can be said to belong to it there are however many which without any error attended with any practical inconvenience may be considered as belonging to it these then may without practical disadvantage and at the same time with great practical advantage be considered as having individuals belonging to them be considered in a word as true take any body—a billiard ball for example—that is intended to be spherical assuredly it is not exactly spherical of all the geometrical propositions which have the sphere for their subject there is not one of them that is exactly true when applied to it but it is so near to the being spherical that all these propositions may without any material error be applied to it among a number of billiard balls all perfectly capable of being applied to the use for which they were designed some will come nearer to an exactly spherical figure than others the nearer any one comes to this figure the nearer in that instance will these several propositions come to the being exactly true from the list of the applications and thereby of the uses made of the several propositions of pure mathematics the order of invention will follow as a sort of corollary amongst other things it may on that occasion be seen how in point of fact mathematical ideas—how all mathematical ideas—have their root in physical ones—in physical observations the actual applications thus made to practice—the indications thus afforded will be pregnant with immediate practical uses the general observations deduced as above in the way of inference from those observations of detail will be but matter of curiosity and theory curious as it may be it will not be very easy to find the class of persons to whom it will be acceptable to the nonmathematician it will be neither very interesting nor comprehensible to the mathematician it will not be very acceptable that before any such surface as a circular one had any existence all its radii were equal is in his creed as in montesquieus a fundamental article that fluxions and equations should have had their origin in so impure a source as matter is to an ardentminded mathematician an idea no more to be endured than by certain religionists it is that moral evil should have no other source than physical or by the sentimental poet the sentimental orator or the hypocritical politician it is that sympathy whether for the individual or the particular class of the communitypolitical body he belongs to the nation at large or the human race should have so unhonoured a parent or so despicable an antagonist as selfregard either in his own pure bosom or that of any of his friends in the construction of the sort of genealogical tables here brought to view the difference between the order of invention and the order of demonstration must not be out of view it is by observation made of the practical applications of which the several propositions have been found susceptible that the order of invention in as far as it is capable of being determined will be determined and for the benefit of posterity the secrets of inventive genius brought to light the path of genius in the intellectual world has been like that of a comet in the physical world to the eye of the ordinary observer few marks by which it can be discovered are visible in the spreading of this veil love of ease concurs with love of fame or what in dyslogistic language—language with the addition of disapprobation     attached to the practice—is the same thing pride and vanity concur with indolence in these circumstances may perhaps be found the causes of that obscurity in which from euclid through newton down to the present time the works of mathematicians have been so generally involved to display to the wondering and not unenvious eyes of the adept inventions and discoveries of a mans own in all their freshness is an operation not only more pleasant but less tedious than that of endeavouring to facilitate to the vulgar mind the conception of discoveries that whether they were or were not his are already become stale as in the order of time so in the order of dignity and reputation communication is preceded by invention but to communicate in the promptest easiest and most effectual manner what has already been invented and discovered is itself the work of inventive genius and the matter of an art—it is a branch of logic that commanding art of which invention to whatever subject applied constitutes one branch and no more than one iii genealogicaltable employing or synopticfiliation indicating principle viz of the sort of relation of which the propositions in geometry are susceptible in respect of use immediate or preparatory to one or other or both of these denominations will be referable the use of any proposition in mathematics that has any use in as far as in either way it has a use how to point out and in the most satisfactory not to say the only satisfactory way afford a demonstration of that use was shown under the last head in as far as the use is not only preparatory but mathematical—and between any two propositions of the last of which the use is ultimate while of the first of them the use is with reference to the last preparatory others connected with one another in a series or chain are interposed each being in like manner preparatory with reference to that which stands next to it—a chain or tree of this sort or whatever be the sensible image employed for elucidation will bear some resemblance to the chains or trees of which a genealogical table is composed the business is nothing more than to propose for consideration the composition of a table or set of tables in and by which these several relations may all of them stand exhibited at one view of this sort of matter what quantity will be capable of being in a commodious manner brought together so as to be presented in one view remains to be determined by experiment something will depend on the application which may be found capable of being made with advantage of the principle next mentioned for the giving connexion to these several elementary units use—practical use in its several modifications as above explained will show itself the strongest possible cementing principle a rope of sand is the emblem of a cluster of propositions for none of which be it ever so copious use in any shape is discernible how to construct a geometrical genealogicalfiliation table of this sort of table the one essential property is—that the more advanced the proposition is and thence the greater the number by which it is expressed the greater the number of the propositions on which the demonstration of it may depend thus in the case of proposition the first no proposition on which it has any dependence can have existence definitions and axioms are the only materials of which the foundation of it can be composed in the case of proposition second there exists one proposition but no more than one on which besides definitions and axioms it is possible for it to have dependence in the case of proposition third there may be two such supports and so on throughout the higher the proposition in question stands in the geometrical scale thus described the more numerous the list or string is capable of being the list or string of propositions on which it depends in any tabular or synoptic exhibition the demonstrative part or the corresponding diagram of the proposition in question being included in a graphical compartment of correspondent bulk and convenient form a circle an oval a square or a long square for example—a circle an oval or a pearshaped figure may be considered as the body of the sort of plaything by means of which franklin drew thunder from the sky called a kite of this kite the string of numbers which one below another give indication of the several sources or foundationstones of the proposition as above naturally may be so disposed as to represent the tail of this kite the higher the place of the proposition is in this scale of filiation the word descent cannot without a sort of verbal contradiction be employed the longer will naturally be this tail if therefore in this table the propositions are ranged in horizontal rows one above another according to their places in the scale the higher the proposition or kite stands the greater is the quantity of room which in a vertical direction will naturally be requisite to give lodgment to its tail in a tail of this sort over and above the series of propositions the axioms and definitions will require to be designated for the designation of the propositions convenience will require the employing of the arabic numerals if then for the designation of the axioms roman numerals in an upright form be employed and for the designation of the definitions the same numerals in a leaning     form—upon this plan the function of designation will be performed in the most simple and at the same time on the most familiar plan an explanation of the purpose to which these numerals are respectively applied might constitute part of the contents of a border with which a table of this sort might and should be garnished as to the postulates being but three in number and these of perpetual recurrence it seems questionable whether after the first use any repetition need be made of them and thence whether any particular numerals or other instruments of designation for them need be provided for the composition of the border other ingredients are—a list of the definitions and another of the axioms employed in the demonstration of the several propositions included in the table in the case of the definitions and the axioms what seems to render this concomitant exhibition necessary but not to the exclusion of the propositions is that in the case of the definitions and the axioms there exist no such means of elucidation as have place in the case of the propositions viz by means of the reciprocal exercises afforded by the purely verbal mode of designation in the one case and the purely diagrammatical in the other in some instances the same proposition will be susceptible of demonstration from two or more different sources wheresoever this multiplicity has place the kite will have the corresponding number of tails as to the border the string of axioms will be comparatively a short one a dozen or some such matter for the whole number of propositions contained in the geometrical scale be it ever so ample this small number will suffice much longer will be the number of definitions at every considerable step it will necessarily receive increase the same border might and should be inserted in both of the two corresponding filiation tables viz the verbally expressed and the diagrammatically expressed one the degree of closeness as between proposition and proposition in the several rows consequently the number capable of being inserted with convenience in each row and the inequalities if any in the distances between proposition and proposition in each row i e between kite and kite tail or tails included will depend upon the room if any necessary to be left in each inferior row for the tails belonging to the several kites ranged in the several superior rows for the construction of such a table the most convenient course it is believed that could be taken would be—having settled the scale of magnitude as determined i e by the size of the type form the several kites separately and then having ready a sheet of paper of the proposed size and dimensions attach them to it in order the mark of attachment temporary till everything is finally settled in respect of its contents a table of this sort shall it be confined to the propositions contained in euclids elements—to the propositions contained in euclids works at large—to the propositions contained in the sum of the works of the grecian geometers—or shall it as far as it goes comprise all such geometrical propositions as in any way present themselves as susceptible of practical use to all these questions surely the last suggests the only natural answer viz that which is implicitly contained in the last of them by a very simple expedient in the verbally expressed table a distinction might be made by a particular type between those of modern and those of ancient date in the elementary branch in which no curve but the circle is introduced let euclids propositions for example as constituting the main part of the work be in the ordinary roman type propositions found in the works of other ancients might be either in the same roman type with euclids or in another roman type of different suppose of inferior size if the type could not conveniently be diminished the black letter might answer the purpose another part of the abovementioned border might be composed of references to the original works in which the several propositions denoted by the number by which they are designated in the table have been found in this case as in every other the application made of the exercises with the placecapturing principle for their support will be determined by the nature of the particular object to be accomplished having for his guides a corresponding pair of tables viz one containing the propositions the enunciative parts verbally expressed the other with the same diagrammatically expressed both of them without any of the references by which the filiation is indicated the exercise is performed either by the extempore pronunciation or by the extempore writing of the references briefly thus given the kites required the tails by a system of exercitation thus conducted the object to the attainment of which the process of demonstration in form is directed would it is believed be not only attained but attained in a much more perfect degree by the form of demonstration what is brought to view is the connexion between that individual proposition and those on which it depends more immediately—that and nothing more but by this system of genealogy what is brought to view is the connexion between each such proposition and every other in the one case you have first one part by itself then another part by itself and so on in the other case all the parts are knit together into one connected whole at the outset at any rate an enunciative     part the preparatory part and the demonstrative part being distinguished as above in the demonstrative the forms of demonstration might and should be strictly observed in the preparative as well as the demonstrative part each distinguishable step being carefully distinguished from every other and for that purpose formed into a distinct paragraph but the mode of reasoning being once thoroughly understood sooner or later the former by which so much room is occupied might it is supposed without prejudice to intellection be discarded scarcely in the compass of a single table thus constructed could any very considerable part of the field of geometry be exhibited a number of such tables standing in succession would be found requisite any two or more of which might upon occasion by so simple an operation as juxtaposition be made into one iv specialvisiblesignemploymentmaximizing—purelydiagrammaticexpression occacasionallyemploying—verbalexpression ocsionallydiscarding principle special sign special in contradistinction to ordinary special in contradistinction to the ordinary signs of which language is composed arbitrary in contradistinction to imitative are moreover the signs to be understood to be in both cases by any of these special and arbitrary signs imitation being out of the question nothing can be intended to be expressed which is not capable of being expressed by the ordinary signs to the expression of which the signs of which ordinary language is composed are not capable of being applied but in this case as in every other the labour necessary to the faculty of making use of the ordinary signs of which language is composed has already been undergone and the faculty acquired whatsoever may be the special signs in question in the acquisition of the faculty of making use of them whatsoever labour requires to be employed is so much extra labour added to that which has been expended in the acquisition of the faculty of employing the ordinary signs in as far as any use is made of special signs here there is an account of profit and loss or say rather of loss and profit cost the labour necessarily expended in acquiring the faculty of making use of these signs profit the advantage whatever it be derived from the application made of these signs in lieu of or in addition to the ordinary signs to the purpose in question first in order of consideration comes the article of profit that being the final cause but for which the expenditure would not be made profit derivable from the employing of special signs or uses of special signs in mathematics i exemplification viz employing individual signs or assemblages of signs to serve as examples of the general propositions which compose the matter of mathematical language and by that means the more clearly and promptly to convey the general ideas of which they are intended to be the expression in as far however as it is to this use and no other that the assemblage of special signs in question is applied the epithet of unanalogous does not belong to them on the contrary they are imitative thus geometrical diagrams are a species of drawing and as in the case of a square table the draught of the whole table in proportion or otherwise is an imitation of the whole table so the diagram of a square is an imitation of the principal part of it ii to the head of abbreviation or say condensation will be found referable whatsoever useful effect is producible by this means ordinary language is the sort of vehicle and the only sort of vehicle which is in possession of the employment of conveying ideas to the mind in as far as any other sign or set of signs shares in this employment—in as far as this function is performed by any special set of signs—it is only through the medium of those ordinary signs those ordinary signs not the ideas themselves which they are employed to denote are the objects immediately presented to the mind by any fresh special signs unless they present spoken words i e the sounds in question in a shorter compass than the shortest in which they can with an equal degree of conspicuousness be presented by the ordinary signs or characters of which written language is composed the effect if any of special signs must necessarily be to retard not to accelerate conception for first they have to bring to view the ordinary signs and when they have so done then it is     that they are in respect of promptitude upon a par and no more than upon a par with those ordinary signs as to the first named of these uses what is certain is that for a length of time more or less considerable it cannot take place or so much as begin to take place every new sign of this kind is part and parcel of a new language and of no new language can any part or parcel be ever learned without a proportionable expense in the article of time all this is so much loss when once the portion in question of the new language has been learned i e when between the thing meant to be signified and the new sign an association has been sufficiently formed then and not till then if there be a profit comes the profit in the instance of each such sign taken by itself if between the thing signified and the sign there be any analogy the closer the analogy the less will be the cost the more frequently the occasion occurs for putting the sign to use the greater will be the profit thence taking the whole number of the signs together the aggregate number of the occasions in which they can be employed being given the profit will be the greater the less the number of the signs in algebra in contradistinction to and almost to the exclusion of geometry has the employment thus given to this principle been most copious of the signs of which this language is composed the number even absolutely taken is very small the number of the occasions on which they are employed being even in a work of a very moderate scope immense relatively taken its smallness is still more conspicuous it is however to the second head to speak shortly in the way of abridgment that in algebra any part of the advantages derived from the use therein made of peculiar signs can be referred the effect produced by them is neither more nor less than the presenting in a smaller compass the same ideas as those which are produced by the corresponding portion of ordinary language by the cross employed to signify addition the effect is neither more nor less than that which would be produced by the word addition together with such other words as may be necessary to complete the sentence—the grammatical or logical proposition for which this one simple sign is capable of being employed and is commonly made to serve as a substitute of this sort of calculation the importance as well as the nature may be not uninstructively illustrated by an instance in which by a scientific person of no mean note ingenuity labour time and expense typographic expense in no small quantity were actually thrown away on the publication of the then new system of chemistry which bears the name of lavoisier the business was divided among three hands the contrivance of a new set of characters termed chemical characters adapted to the new theory being at that time regarded as constituting the subject of a necessary part of that business was announced as having fallen exclusively to the lot of one of these three hands since that time so different in many parts as well as so much more extensive is the culture received by the field of chemistry that even had the principle of the contrivance been good the application given to it could no longer have continued useful without having undergone in every shape such alteration as would have rendered it hardly recognisable but it was bad in principle the new signs were characters or signs to which every imaginable exertion was made to give what analogy could be given to them to the things signified but had these exertions been even much more successful than they were these special and newly published characters would never have presented to the mind especially to the mind of a learner the ideas of the respective chemical substances with the same perfection much less with the like certainty as that with which they come presented by the corresponding set of names as expressed by those already and commonly adopted general characters of which ordinary written language is composed in the way of facility afforded to conception whatsover effect they were productive of was wholly on the side of disadvantage in respect of abbreviation or condensation it was not productive of any advantage for giving lodgment to each one of these signs a receptacle of the same form for each was as in the case of a genealogical table it is believed or at any rate for illustration may be conceived to have been provided but within every such receptacle the name of the substance in question expressed in ordinary letterpress might have been included and in such form and size as to be altogether as conspicuous as readily apprehensible as the new sign for the giving lodgment to which it was employed of the notion of this mode of expression what was the source imitation imitation without sufficient thought in the infancy of chemistry when as yet she was little better than a slave to the impostor alchemy a set of special signs were employed for the designation of such of the metals as were then known together with some others of the simple or supposed simple substances then known or supposed to be known but the design in pursuance of which these characters were framed was of a mixed character made up of the opposite ingredients divulgation and concealment and entertained by minds in which in sharers of power perpetually varying and perpetually unascertainable credulity and imposture maintained a     conjunct sway by an effort of economy as whimsical as it was elaborate the same set of seven signs served for a set of chemical substances namely metals and the same number of heavenly bodies at the same time that the use might be the more profound and the adepts including or not including the inventor himself the more effectually deluded at the same time that by the pair of selfteaching learners application as above was made of the purely verbal expression maximizing principle by the same persons was application made of the principle which there corresponds to and contrasts with it viz this same verbal expression occasionally discarding principle or purely diagrammatical expression employing principle what the signs had for their immediate purpose was to convey to the mind by these means alone without the use of words a conception in the first place of the enunciative part of the proposition in the next place of the several operations which in the preparatory part were required to be performed and lastly of the several assertions contained in so many distinct steps of the demonstrative part what in relation to this head is recollected of them is as follows—  the signs employed were or at least were endeavoured to be made analogous i e naturally expressive if for example on the occasion of the first step in the preparatory part—on the occasion of the first operation required by it to be performed—a line of a certain description was at a certain part of the figure exhibited in conformity to the enunciative part or representation of the subject of it required to be drawn—in this case immediately after this original figure or diagram came another in which it was copied with the addition of the thus prescribed line and so on for every fresh step a fresh figure so again when on the occasion of the demonstrative part expression came to be given to the first step a set of marks of which a small number was found sufficient were employed for distinguishing those parts whether lines or angles which were the subjects of that part of the demonstration from the succeeding ones and so on as above another condition necessary to usefulness is that taken together the collection of signs employed should not be too bulky for use—should not occupy so great a quantity of space as not to be capable in a number sufficient for instruction of being brought together into one table neither was this condition it is believed altogether unfulfilled in the ordinary mode of designation a circumstance which necessitates the allotting to each figure a larger space than would otherwise be necessary is the affording room enough for the letters of reference these letters large enough to be clearly distinguishable and so placed as that no doubt should exist in regard to the part which in each instance they were employed to designate but in the proposed plan these arbitrary and naturally inexpressive marks would have no place in some such way would the matter stand in regard to the several propositions separately taken in regard to the genealogical tables abovementioned on this occasion each proposition taken by itself being supposed to be already understood having by the means already mentioned been rendered intelligible in a table of this sort all that could require to be exhibited would be the diagrams or figures representative of the enunciative parts of the several propositions for showing in relation to each subsequent proposition what were the preceding propositions on which it is grounded and which in the demonstrative part were accordingly referred to nothing more would be necessary than a cypher or cyphers expressive of the numbers by which in the same table those propositions stand respectively designated the diagrams expressive of the several propositions being included in similar compartments circular suppose or quadrangular and those compartments ranged in lines descending from the top to the bottom of the table an equal number on each line the eye would thus be conducted to them with instantaneous rapidity for this purpose the order of the numbers should from first to last in the whole series of the propositions be the order of the names upon the table whether in each proposition the order of the propositions being the same as in euclid to the number expressive of its place in the series should or should not be added the two sets of numbers expressive of the book to which it belonged in euclid and the place of it in that book experiment would soon determine in the case when the same proposition is capable of being demonstrated from any one of several sets of antecedent propositions sets of cyphers expressive of them might be inserted each set being distinguished from every other by the word or or by a simple line of separation in respect of promptitude of conception could any additional facility be afforded by a set of lines drawn issuing from the succeeding proposition to the several antecedent ones by means of which it has been or might be demonstrated the negative seems most probable confusion rather than elucidation presenting itself as the most probable result of a tissue or piece of network thus irregular and thus complicated to the propositions that are in euclid shall not all such others be added by which equally useful instruction relative to the same class of figures promises to be afforded and this too in the same table yes unless propagation     of superstitious and delusive errors be preferred to propagation of useful knowledge but in the character of a certificate of acknowledged truth the authority of euclid being naturally more extensively received than any other propositions derived from other sources might be distinguished from those of euclid by some mark common to them all and immediately discernible suppose for example by different colours or what would be much less expensive by being included in somewhat smaller compartments that in the instance of the pair of selfteachers abovementioned after a few general hints received from their distantly situated adviser the carrying into effect these little devices was a matter of no small instruction as well as amusement is perfectly remembered that in the instance of other learners by whom no part in the pleasure of invention would be shared any real profit either in the way of amusement or of instruction would be reaped does not absolutely follow one consideration however does present itself as promising to turn the scale in favour of the affirmative side this is the applicability of the two correspondent and opposite modes of expression to the purpose of affording a test of intellection and such a test as admits of the application of the placecapturing principle—table ii no  0 the correspondent exercises will consist of two correspondent and opposite translations one the recitative the other the organic exercise in the case of a proposition taken by itself the scholar having before him the process expressed in the purely diagrammatic mode repeats by the help of it the same process in its several steps as expressed in the purely verbal mode in this way is performed one of the two the simple recitative exercises at another time having before him the process expressed in the purely verbal mode he delineates on the spot the same process as expressed in the purely diagrammatic mode in this way is performed the organic exercise in a similar manner might the corresponding pair of reciprocal translation exercises be grounded on a pair of genealogical geometrical tables suppose one of these tables expressed in the purely verbal the other in the purely diagrammatic mode in this case the same correspondent exercises might be performed as have been just described another exercise might have either of these tables for its ground the figures of reference arithmetical numbers by which the genealogy of the proposition is in each instance expressed being suppressed or concealed for the occasion the exercise consists in the giving an indication of that analogy viz either by the mere naming or writing of the numbers by the pronouncing or writing the lines or purport of the proposition as expressed in the purely verbal mode or by delineating it as expressed in the purely diagrammatic mode v keypresenting or special contrivanceindicating principle key viz to the expedient by which the demonstration is effected and by which accordingly in many instances the entire proposition whether theorem or problem was first suggested this principle will be found applicable as well to algebra as to geometry of the sort of intellectual instrument here in view as applied to geometry the appendix presents two specimens one applied to euclids first proposition which is a problem the other to his fifth proposition which is a theorem in both instances this part termed the key forms the second of the four points exemplified in these two propositions as expressed upon the purely verbal expressionmaximizing principle of the use of this sort of instrument the effect it is believed will be found to be the letting the learner into the secret as it were of the invention by showing him what on the occasion of the invention passed in the inventors mind in these two instances each individual proposition has its own key the key which belongs to the one will not be found to apply exactly to the other but should all the propositions delivered by euclid together with such others as it might be found practicable and useful to add to them come to have been exhibited upon this same proposed principle some circumstances common to a number of them will probably be brought to view by means of which they will be found distinguishable with advantage into so many classes and in that case what will probably be found is that in addition to or in lieu of the keys belonging to the individual propositions a key will be found applicable to the whole class out of these classes may perhaps be found compoundable other more extensive classes—say perhaps of the second order—each such class with its key as before of the sort of instrument of elucidation for the designation of which the word key is here ventured to be employed happily for the science and the learners examples even now are not altogether wanting in the works of mathematicians and as far as concerns the purpose of instruction at least howsoever it may be in regard to further discovery and advancement it will scarcely be denied that the greater the number of these keys supposing them equally well constructed that the work affords the better adapted it is to the purpose one example which of itself is worth a multitude is afforded by montucla in his histoire des mathématiques tom i lib iii note b pp     0    0 in it the several peculiar figures three in number capable of being produced by the cutting of a cone or rather a pair of cones are brought together are confronted with each other and their principal characteristic properties viz those in which they agree with and those in which they differ from each other are placed together in one view—all in the compass of no more than four though it must be acknowledged closely printed quarto pages a circumstance which renders this example the better adapted to the present purpose is that on this occasion nothing more is given than the enunciative parts of the several propositions preceded by such definitions no more than six in number as were judged necessary total number of propositions according to the numerical figures no more than    though if it be considered that in most of them the three species of conic sections in question are comprised that number may in that respect be required to be nearly tripled in this explanation use it is true as could not but be expected is made of diagrams for reference to which alphabetical letters are in the usual way employed consequently neither the purely diagrammatic mode in any part nor the purely verbal mode of expression except here or there are or can be employed but to no inconsiderable extent upon the whole sometimes for five or six lines together the purely verbal mode is employed taken together therefore in the hands of a liberal minded and unprejudiced institutionalist out of these four pages upon the plan here proposed might be made an admirable and most instructive set of exercises for the geometrical section of the proposed chrestomathic school few perhaps if any institutional books are in use in which keys of this sort in greater or less abundance may not be found in particular wherever anything is seen in form of a note search may be made for an implement of this kind with considerable probability of success to the natural aridity of the subject more or less of humectation may be expected to be afforded from the springs of criticism neither in the case of algebra as above announced will this same principle it is believed be found inapplicable in the branch of mathematics called algebra—viz in such problems and such only as have no direct relation to figure—in which figure is not as such taken into the account two sorts of operations in themselves perfectly distinct may be distinguished viz the mode of designation or expression and the contrivance or species of investigation employed in the resolution of problems the system of abbreviation and the system of contrivance for the purpose of performing the several particular operations for the facilitation of which the same system of abbreviation is throughout employed betweenthese two the relation is that between the means and the end the mode of expression the means the resolution of problems the end as to the mode of designation the object which it has in view the advantage which in comparison with common arithmetic it affords may be expressed in a word abbreviation room labour and time all these precious objects are saved by it it is a particular species of shorthand differing only from the sort commonly designated by that name in two particulars   in its application it is confined to that sort of discourse which has quantity for its subject   within its field of action the degree of power which it exercises is much greater than any that is exercised by ordinary shorthand all that shorthand does is the employing for the giving expression to each word strokes in less number or more easily and quickly described than those which are employed in ordinary hand the mode pursued in writing before the invention of printing and in printing itself for some time afterwards—in a word the system of contractions was a species of shorthand multifarious as well as great are the savings made by the mode of notation employed in algebra as far as it goes the following may serve as a specimen   in the room of a number of single words being those of most frequent occurrence such as those of addition subtraction c it employs so many marks in a great degree more simple   of an assemblage of figures i e the common arabic characters expressive of the names of numbers—characters which of themselves constitute a species of shorthand—of an assemblage of this sort however long and complicated it performs the office by a single letter of the alphabet   where the assemblage of these abridgments of abridgments present themselves as susceptible of ulterior abridgment of a line of any length composed of letters with or without figures it performs the office it expresses the import by means of a single letter and so toties quoties from this function of algebra the other the efficient it may be termed which consists in the solution of problems in the performance of tasks proposed in the rendering of services requested or demanded is as has been shown above altogether different to the last mentioned the former bears the relation of a means to an end by means of the relation which it bears to some quantity or quantities already known to make known some quantity which as yet is unknown—to this one problem may be referred all problems whatsoever to which the name of algebraical can be applied for the accomplishment of this purpose on different occasions different contrivances over and above those which consist in nothing more than an abbreviated mode of expression have suggested themselves to persons conversant     with this art in no instance perhaps certainly not in every instance to the giving expression to these contrivances are the modes of abridgment employed in algebra considered as a species of shorthand indispensably necessary as yet not even in algebraical that abbreviated and technical language has any mathematician it is believed unfolded or so much as endeavoured to unfold for the boy what may accordingly still be called the secrets of his art not even in abbreviated and technical language do we possess any such key constructed out of unabbreviated and ordinary language as to the abbreviative principle algebra is not the only branch of the mathematics in which the abbreviative system or method is applicable with advantage though not in its whole extent nor to anything near its whole extent it is to a part of that extent applicable and with like if not altogether equal advantage to geometry in paynes geometry not to look for others application is accordingly made of it and with very considerable advantage if abbreviation were the only use of the function here distinguished by the appellation of abbreviative it would follow that in the performance of the essential function everything which at present is not only customarily but exclusively expressed by the exercise of the abbreviative function is capable of being expressed without it—may be expressed in a word in ordinary language to any such purpose as the practice of the art what is plain enough is that by no such substitution could any advantage be gained on the contrary it would by the amount of the whole of its effect be disadvantageous instruction is the only purpose to which it could be made serviceable but that to this purpose it might be rendered eminently in a very high degree serviceable seems sufficiently evident in this case the same substitution of signs immediately expressive of general ideas to signs immediately expressive of none but individual ones would be the result as has been already shown to be the result in the case of geometry and in respect of intellection and command of the subject that result would be attended with the same advantages in this case the whole method of the art might be explained and taught—the whole secrets of the art laid open to an intelligent mind without its being subjected to any part of that hard labour which must so unavoidably be bestowed upon the subject before the signs and modes of proceeding by means of which the abbreviation is performed have been learned but supposing this done the number of persons more or less acquainted with the principles of this art might be increased—increased by the whole number of those who at present are repelled from it by the formidable apparatus of magical characters now employed by means of which the abbreviative function of it is performed and when the principle of each distinguishable contrivance was held up to view in ordinary language each principle characterized and fixed by an appropriate name with a definition annexed even the adepts themselves might in the clearness and expressive generality of the language find facilities according to the nature of the case either for the invention of new contrivances or for showing if such were the case and as soon as it came to be the case that the nature of the case admitted not of any others an observation which it is believed will be found general among mathematicians is that by the use of different inventions contrivances and expedients from the number of years which even in the case of an amateur of this branch of art and science would be necessary to carry him over the whole field of it several years have been struck off principally by the ingenuity of the french mathematicians these applications of inventive genius what then are they to this question—and the whole field of the science cannot present a more important one—an answer might if what is said above be correct be given in ordinary language in the case of algebra fluxions included elucidation if so it may be termed though the same in respect of its end will in respect of the description of the means requisite to be taken for the accomplishment of that end be somewhat different from what it has been seen to be in the case of geometry in the case of geometry the enunciative parts of the proposition excepted nor even they throughout the whole of the field—the language is particular being by the want of general terms confined in respect of the subject to the individual figures and parts of figures exhibited by the individual diagrams and designated—not by any indication given of their intrinsic and permanent relations one to another but—by the arbitrary and unexplanatory denomination given to them by means of so many combinations of the letters of the alphabet in this case one great instrument of elucidation therefore consists in the substitution of terms expressive of general ideas being those of so many sorts of relation to denominations thus individual and unexpressive but in the case of algebra the terms employed abbreviated and to those to whom the use of them is not familiar obscure and perplexing are as general as it would be in the power of words—of words at length and unabbreviated to make them for generalizing designation in the character of a new and as yet unknown instrument of elucidation no room is left in algebra but though of the application of the purely verbal expression employing principle the effect is not in algebra to add in any respect to the generality of the language that even in algebra it is capable of being made to act and with very considerable effect in the character     of an instrument of elucidation seems scarcely to admit of doubt it consists in simply forbearing to employ the algebraic formulæ or forms while those explanations are going on by which the rationale of the art and science is brought to view in the algebraic branch of mathematics in idea at least two sorts of operations as above pointed out may be distinguished—the abbreviative or condensative and the effective or efficient the abbreviative are but a species of shorthand they perform on the occasion of discourse applied to this particular subject though with a degree of efficiency incomparaably superior the sort of function which the characters of which shorthand is composed in relation to discourse at large perform in as far as this is the case it follows that in the exercise of this art every particular contrivance which does not consist in the mere employment of this general system of abbreviation may as effectually and intelligibly be expressed in ordinary characters and without this particular species of shorthand as any other subject of discourse may be expressed in these same ordinary characters and without the use of that species of shorthand commonly called shorthand the use of which is applicable to every subject of discourse in regard to these abbreviative contrivances what may very well happen is that some apply principally or exclusively to this or that subject to the solution of this or that particular problem or group of problems and in so far the invention of the mode of abbreviation is the invention of the mode of solving the problem and thus the abbreviative part and the efficient part are in a manner confounded but at any rate it is not in every instance that this sort of confusion has place and on the other hand a number there are of these contrivances for condensation which are employed on all occasions alike true it is that on the explanation given of the several substitutions by which the condensation is performed the characters the instruments themselves by which it is performed cannot but be brought to view but for this particular purpose no one of them need be brought to view more than once or some other small and limited number of times and between this use of them for the mere purpose of explanation and the constant use of them through the whole of every page how great the difference cannot but be to the mind of a young scholar is sufficiently obvious by one passage or some other small number of passages consisting of the abbreviative forms or characters every contrivance that belongs to the head of abbreviation may be explained and even without so much as one such assemblage of uncouth forms every contrivance which does not operate as an instrument of abbreviation or in so far as it operates otherwise than as an instrument of abbreviation may be explained prodigious would be the relief thus afforded to the uninitiated juvenile learners mind made by the indulgence thus afforded to his love of ease under the head of languagelearning the dark spot produced by every hard word by every word which being derived from a foreign language has no relative belonging to it in the vernacular language has already been brought to view to an uninitiated eye a page of algebra is a surface covered almost wholly with the like dark spots true it is that for the explanation of the different contrivances words in no small number that to the learner will be new some of them already in use others which it may be necessary to coin for the particular purpose here proposed would be found requisite and these new words will be so many hard words so many dark spots but no sooner would one of these new words present itself than a definition or explanation composed either purely of common words or partly of common words and partly of such peculiar words as had already in this same way received their explanation would be subjoined no sooner has the dark spot made its appearance than the requisite light will have been thrown upon it and how much more thickly darkened a portion of discourse is by unknown characters than even by hard words expressed in familiar characters few but must have experienced in the case of geometry the word key was confined in its application to such explanations as were annexed to particular propositions or groups of propositions over and above such explanations as in the case of the demonstrative and preparatory parts of the several propositions could not but result from the translation of the individualizing modes of designation employed in so far as diagrams are employed with letters of reference into the general expressions of which purely verbal discourse is composed in the case of algebra every paragraph in which the use of forms and characters were abstained from would in so far as it were instructive operate as a key for it would have as its object either the explanation of the several contrivances of abbreviation or of the several contrivances whereby these instruments of condensation were applied to practice and endeavoured to be put to use of no other sort of matter could it be composed for to the solution of the several problems unless it be in a few instances as above for illustration the use of these forms would of course be necessary     in this case as in that of geometry an additional instrument of elucidation would be afforded by the application of the use indicationprescribing principle by the indication of the use the practical use derivable from the solution of the several sorts of problems for the solution of which the algebraic language is wont to be employed on this occasion it is not by any application which may be or that has been made of them that in the sense here in view they could with propriety be said to be put to use only in so far as it had been or was capable of being made subservient either to some security or comfort in the business of ordinary life whether immediately or through the medium of this or that spot in the field of art and science is it that the application made could with propriety be termed a useful one take for instance the collection of articles intituled praxes or questions for praxis subjoined to the english translation of eulers algebra the number of them is     of this number a part more or less considerable consist of a sort of jokes named paradoxes having the excitation of wonder manifestly for their effect and perhaps for their only effect in every one of them application is made of the algebraic form to the solution of some problem but of these     problems it is not from every one that by any person benefit in any shape over and above the pleasure derivable from playing at this kind of game seems capable of being received the additional praxis therefore would be from this miscellaneous list to point out such as are in their nature applicable to beneficial use and by indication of the occasion to show in what shape they are respectively capable of being put to use to answer the purpose of elucidation in the completest manner—understand always with reference to the uninitiated—a key should not only have the effect of letting the reader into the heart so to speak of the contrivance by which the proposed object is effected the proposed advantage gained but in the production of this effect the purely verbal mode of expression alone unless it be with the sort of exception above hinted at should be employed the purely verbal mode viz in geometry to the exclusion of the diagrammatic in algebra to the exclusion of the algebraic characters and forms to what precise length it may be possible with any degree of net advantage to carry this principle of elucidation which consists in the temporary exclusion of peculiar signs is a question on which antecedently to experience it can never be within the reach of the most expert mathematician to pronounce thus much however may be asserted viz that the further the institutionalist can find means to carry on his system of instruction in this track the greater will be the number of the learners whom he will carry with him to geometry—as it seems pretty well agreed among the learned—to geometry to the exclusion of and in contradistinction to algebra including fluxions is confined what may be called the tonic or invigorative use of mathematics the service done to mental health and strength by a sort of exercise by which the process of close reasoning is carried on and to the performance of which close and unremitted attention is indispensable it is in consideration of this use that by some the algebraic form is held in a sort of contempt and that in the immense class of occasions in that vast portion of the mathematical field which belongs to geometry and algebra in common and on which the same conclusion may be arrived at by either track the same problem effected in the algebraic mode is considered as done in the way of makeshift and not productive of use or advantage in any shape over and above what may happen to be attached to the solution of the particular problem for the solution of which it is employed this being admitted although by the solution of a single problem in the algebraic mode no such service could be rendered to the mental frame as in manner above mentioned may be rendered to it by the solution of the same single problem in the geometrical mode yet by the indication of this or that particular contrivance by means of which this or that class of problems may be solved in the algebraic mode there seems little reason to doubt that to the mental frame a service might be rendered though not exactly of the same sort yet of a sort not to be absolutely neglected in the geometrical case it is to the judgment and the attention that the service would be rendered in the algebraical case it is to the conceptive and inventive faculty that the most immediate part of the service would be rendered the case of the uninitiated is here all along the only principal case in view but neither to the adepts does it seem that the mode of elucidation thus here proposed would be altogether without its use by the survey that would thus be made of the ground in a point of view so new it could scarcely happen but that in one way or other an increase of command would be acquired with reference to it and new discoveries made in it such as otherwise for a long time if ever might not have been made the sort of intellectual instrument the key thus proposed or rather the apparatus or collection of keys would be very far from being complete if in its purpose it did not include all the several fictions which in the framing of this branch of art and science have been invented and employed for illustration without looking any further two may here be mentioned viz the conversion of the algebraical method into geometrical and the contrivance called by its     first inventor newton and from him by british mathematicians the method of fluxions and by its second but not less original inventor leibnitz and from him by the mathematicians of all other countries the differential and integral calculus for the explanation of these fictions and indeed for the justification of the use so copiously made of them two operations would it should seem require to be performed one is the indication of the really exemplified state of things to which the fiction is now wont to be applied or is considered as applicable the other is the indication of the advantage derived from the use of this the fictitious language in contradistinction to the language by which the state of things in question would be expressed plainly and clearly without having recourse to fiction   as to the conversion of the forms of algebra into those of geometry or of the algebraic mode of expression into the geometrical if in a case in which figure has no place—as in a case where the quantity of money to be paid or received or given under the name of interest for the use of money during a certain time is the subject of investigation—the geometrical forms should be employed or the subject of investigation thereby represented in the character of a portion of matter or space exhibiting a certain figure here a fiction is employed figure is said to have place in a case where it really has no place   in cases where the geometrical form is the form in which the subject presents itself in the first instance and the translation which is made is a translation from this geometrical form into the algebraical here in this case no fiction has place here what is done may be done and is done without any recourse to fiction and as to the advantage looked for from this translation an obvious one that presents itself is the abbreviation which constitutes an essential character of the algebraic form in the opposite species of translation viz that from the algebraic form into the geometrical fiction is inseparable why—because when by the supposition figure does not form part of the case figure is stated as forming part of the case but when the translation is from the geometrical form into the algebraical neither in this nor in any other shape has fiction any place why—because though in the case as first stated figure has place yet if reference to the figure be not necessary to the finding the answer which is sought to the doing what is required or proposed to be done the particular nature of the figure is a circumstance which without fiction may be neglected and left out of the account so in the case of the method of fluxions which is but a particular species of algebra distinguished by that name take some question for the solution of which this new method is wont to be employed this question could it be solved by ordinary algebra or could it not if it could then why is it that this new method is employed i e what is the advantage resulting from the employment of it if it could not then what is the expedient which is supplied by fluxions and which could not be supplied by algebra in this method a fiction is employed a point or a line or a surface is said to have kept flowing where in truth there has been no flowing in the case with this falsehood how is it that mathematical truth spoken of as truth by excellence is compatible what is here meant is not that no such fictions ought to be employed but that to the purpose and on the occasion of instruction whenever they are employed the necessity or the use of them should be made known to say that in discourse fictitious language ought never on any occasion to be employed would be as much as to say that no discourse in the subject of which the operations or affections or other phenomena of the mind are included ought ever to be held for no ideas being ever to be found in it which have not their origin in sense matter is the only direct subject of any portion of verbal discourse on the occasion and for the purpose of the discourse the mind is all along considered and spoken of as if it were a mass of matter and it is only in the way of fiction that when applied to any operation or affection of the mind anything that is said is either true or false yet in as far as any such fictions are employed the necessity of them if as in the case just mentioned necessary or the use of them if simply useful should be made known why in the first place to prevent that perplexity which has place in the mind in as far as truth and falsehood being confounded that which is not true is supposed to be true in the next place by putting it as far as possible in the power of the learner to perceive and understand the use and value as well as the nature of the instruction communicated to him to lighten the burthen of the labour necessary to be employed in the acquisition of it when for purposes such as the above a survey comes to be taken of the field of mathematics another object or subject of inquiry may be whether in mathematics in general but more particularly in algebra fluxions included the language is in every instance as expressive as it ought to be antecedently to association with a very few exceptions for the designation of anything which is to be signified any one sign is as proper as another but when associations have once been formed this original indifference is at an end for the designation of any object some word or phrase should be looked out which in virtue of some meaning with which they have already been invested serve in some measure to lead the mind to the conception of the thing meant to be designated and in that respect are better adapted to the purpose than any words taken     at random than any words in short between which and the object which is to be designated no such relation has place thence it is that for the idea be the object what it may the choice of the words employed for the designation of it is never a matter of indifference nor will there perhaps ever exist the case in which a number of words or phrases may not be found all of them possessing in respect of the designation of the object in question so many different degrees in the scale of aptitude in the practice of mathematicians propositions of the geometrical cast and propositions of the algebraical cast are to an extent which seems not to have been as yet determined considered as interconvertible employed indifferently the one or the other and upon occasion translated into each other when in the particular subject to which they are respectively applied figure although it have place may without inconvenience in the shape of error or any other shape be laid out of consideration—in this case instead of geometry which in this case seems the more apposite and natural form algebra if employed is employed without fiction and may therefore be employed without production of obscurity without inconvenience in that shape and in proportion as the sought for result is arrived at with less labour and more promptitude with clear and peculiar and net advantage but if in a case in which figure cannot have place as in the case of calculation concerning degrees of probability as expressed by numbers if any proposition be clothed in the geometrical form so far will fiction have been employed and with it its neverfailing accompaniment—obscurity have been induced in the mind of him by whom they are employed when the natural and individual ideas in which they have their source and the individual or other particular objects from which those ideas were drawn are once lost sight of all extensive general expressions soon become empty sounds in the use made of algebra at any rate on the occasion of instruction given in this art to learners the particular application which either at the time in question was made or at any future time was proposed to be made of it should never be out of sight it is for want of this test of intellection—it is for want of this check that in books on algebra so many propositions that are selfcontradictory and thereby void of all real and intelligible import are to be found quantities that are negative which being interpreted means less than nothing and by the multiplying one of these quantities by another that is by adding together a certain number of these quantities—a number of quantities equal to the product and each of them greater than nothing generated algebraical language even where in the use made of it no fiction is involved is a sort of abbreviated or shorthand language so far and so far only as the abbreviated expressions which it employs are by him who employs them capable of being upon occasion translated into propositions delivered at length and in the form of ordinary language so far and so far only as in the room of every such fiction as it employs expressions by which nothing but the plain truth is asserted—expressions significative in a direct way of those ideas for the giving expression to which the fictitious language here employed—were capable of being substituted and accordingly are substituted so far and so far only are they in the mouth or pen of him by whom they are employed of him by whom or of him to whom they are addressed anything better than empty sounds it is for want of all regular recurrence to these sorts of intellection it is for want of this undiscontinued reference to unabbreviated and unsophisticated language that algebra is in so many minds a collection of signs unaccompanied by the things signified of words without import and therefore without use employed on a number of different occasions in so many different senses and without any clear indication of the difference or enumeration attempted to be made of these different occasions the tissue of fictions involved in the use made of the negative sign fills with obscurity the field of quantity as the fiction of a debt where there is no debt covers with obscurity the field of commercial arrangement and commercial intercourse see tab i stage v bookkeeping p    it was by an abstract consideration of the nature of the case i e by a metaphysical view of the subject as some mathematicians would incline to say or a logical as it might be more correct to say that this notion of the natural distinctness between the contrivances for abbreviation on the one hand and the contrivances for the actual solution of problems though with the assistance afforded by those abbreviative contrivances on the other were suggested to the writer of these pages it was with no small satisfaction that for this same idea he found afterwards a confirmation and a sort of sanction in the writings of two firstrate mathematicians viz a passage in euler adopted and quoted with applause by carnot—euler mémoires de lacademie de berlin année      reflexions sur la metaphysique du calcul infinitesimal paris      p  0  persons there are says he in whose view of this matter geometry and algebra la géomètrie et lanalyse do not require many reasonings raisonnemens in their view the rules les regles which these sciences prescribe to us include already the points of knowledge les connoissances necessary to conduct us to the solution so that all that we have to do is to perform the operations in     conformity to those rules without troubling ourselves with the reasonings on which those rules are grounded this opinion if it were wellgrounded would be strongly in opposition to that almost general opinion according to which geometry and algebra are regarded as the most appropriate instruments for cultivating the mental powers lesprit and giving exercise to the faculty of ratiocination la faculté de raisonner although the persons in question are not without a tincture of mathematical learning yet surely they can have been but little habituated to the solution of problems in which any considerable degree of difficulty is involved for soon would they have perceived that the mere habit of making application of those prescribed rules goes but a very little way towards enabling a man to resolve problems of this description and that before application is actually made of them it is necessary to bestow a very serious examination upon the several particular circumstances of the problem and on this ground to carry on reasonings of this sort in abundance faire ladessus quantité de raisonnemens before he is in a condition to apply to it those general rules in which are comprised that class of reasonings of which even during the time that occupied in the calculation we are reaping the benefit of them scarce any distinct perception has place in our minds this preparation necessary as it is that it should be before the operation of calculation is so much as begun—this preparation it is that requires very often a train of reasonings longer perhaps than is ever requisite in any other branch of science a train in the carrying on of which a man has this great advantage that he may all along make sure of their correctness while in every other branch of science he finds himself under the frequent necessity of taking up with such reasonings as are very far from being conclusive moreover the very process of calculation itself notwithstanding that by algebra the rules of it are ready made to his hands quoique lanalyse en préserve les règles requires throughout to have for its support a solid body of reasoning un raisonnement solide without which he is at every turn liable to fall into some mistakes the algebraist therefore le géomètre is the word but it is in his algebraic and not in his geometrical capacity that on the present occasion the mathematician is evidently meant to be brought to view the algebraist then concludes this grand master of the order finds on every part of the field occasion to keep his mind in exercise by the formation of those reasonings by which alone if the problem be a difficult one he can be conducted to the solution of it thus far this illustrious pair of mathematicians now these reasonings raisonnemens so often mentioned and always as so many works or operations perfectly distinct from those which consist in the mere application of the algebraic formulæ what are they plainly the very things for the designation of which the words contrivances for the coming at the solution of the problem or some such words have all along been employed thus much then is directly asserted viz that the operations which consist in the as it were mechanical application of this set of rules which for all cases is the same on the one hand and on the other hand those which consist in the other more particular contrivances for solving the particular problem or set of problems in question by the application of these same general rules are two classes of operations perfectly distinct from each other but moreover another thing which if not directly asserted seems all along to be implied is that to one or other of these two heads everything that is or can be done in the way of algebra is referable of the descriptions given of these different contrivances and sets of contrivances of this sort of materials it is that in as far as they apply to the algebraic not to speak here of the geometric method all these keys and sets of keys as employed by the hand of the mathematician will have to be composed but these contrivances being in themselves thus distinct from the general formulæ it follows that for the explanation of them language other than that in which these formulæ are delivered may consequently be employed other language viz —for there is no other that language which is in common use and thus it is that not only to geometry but to algebra may the purely verbal mode of designation be applied to give to the several quantities which have place in the problem such a mode of expression as by indicating the several relations they bear to each other shall prepare them for being taken for the subjects of that sort of operation which consists in the putting them in that point of view in which by means of those relations those quantities which at first were not known but which it is desired to know become known accordingly this when expressed in the most general terms of which it is susceptible will it is believed be found to be a tolerably correct account of the sort of operation which on each particular occasion must proceed no direct and as it were mechanical application of the set of general rules of what then is it that a sort of algebraic key or set of keys of the kind in question must be composed of a system of abbreviations or directions by which it shall be shown in what manner in the several cases to which it is applicable this sort of preliminary tactical operation may be performed and to the best advantage as these two intimately connected yet distinguishable operations viz the application of the useindicating no ii and that of the keypresenting principle went on together—the     order of invention i e the order in which the several propositions or groups of propositions come to be invented would in conjunction with the order of demonstration i e the order in which for the purpose of demonstration it is either necessary or most convenient that they should be presented be brought to light but in proportion as the order of invention came thus to be detected and displayed in that same proportion would it be rendered manifest that theory was formed and in what manner it was so formed by abstraction out of positive ideas more and more general out of particulars and in a word originally out of individual ones supposing the whole field of geometry or in a word of mathematics measured and delineated upon this plan what would in that case be signified by the word understanding in such phrases as these viz he understands plain elementary geometry he understands conic sections or in general he understands the subject would be a state of mind considerably different from that which at present is indicated by these same phrases and accordingly in the signification of the words learning and teaching as applied to the same subject the correspondent changes would be undergone vi field of mathematics—need of a general revision of it for the purpose of chrestomathic instruction should there be any person in whose eyes any of the observations above hazarded afford a prospect of their being conducive in any degree to the wished for purpose to that same person a general revision or survey of the whole field of the science with a view to the same purpose may perhaps present itself as a task neither altogether needless nor unpromising in this as in every other track of art and science invention and teaching what has already been invented are very different operations and for the performance of them to the best advantage talents in some respects different and at any rate different situations will in general be found necessary to the removal of the difficulties by which in the minds of the generality of learners progress is most apt to be impeded a strong and clear sense of them is at least useful if not indispensably necessary and the larger the possession a man has or that sort and strength of talent by which he is qualified for invention the less strong will be the impression left by any such difficulties on his mind placed on the threshold of the science upon crossing the track of it a little verbal inaccuracy which to the eyes and feet of an adept standing in the higher regions will like a thread of grossamer be an object altogether imperceptible will in the eyes of many a learner be if not an insurmountable bar a troublesome and for a long time a disheartening stumblingblock in this part as in so many others of the field of art and science dazzled not to say blinded by the splendour which encircles a great name professors have scarce suffered their eyes to be opened to see anything like an imperfection in the object of their admiration and hence it is that so long as it affects not the substance—the very vital part of the art and science inaccuracies by which though imperceptible to proficients learners are put to torture might if searched for by eyes wholly unprejudiced be found it is believed in greater numbers than is commonly so much as suspected for illustration and as far as they go even for demonstration the following examples taken from each of the three great divisions of mathematics viz geometry algebra and fluxions no one of them requiring for the conception of it any the smallest degree of proficiency in the science to which it belongs will it is believed be considered as neither irrelevant nor unsatisfactory euclid euler and newton—men of no less account than these will each of them be seen to afford an example of the sort of relation and hitherto imperceptible but not less operative sort of imperfection here in view euclid in geometry euler in algebra newton in the world of his own creation fluxions if in the greater number or in all these instances the seat of imperfection should appear to belong rather to logic or grammar than to mathematics neither the inconvenience to the learner nor consequently the demand for indication will by this circumstance be at all diminished in regard to geometry on the occasion of the exemplifications which have already been mentioned and for which reference has been made to the appendix three have already been brought to view but those which are seen are but three out of a much greater number of imperfections real or supposed which in the course of the inquiry already mentioned the pair of selfteaching learners detected or supposed themselves to have detected without an adequate motive no labour at all much less any course of labour so persevering as that which was here necessary was ever undertaken and on this occasion in the character of an adequate motive and efficient cause none presented itself as being so analogous or in all respects so promising as the sort of triumph which in every instance would follow upon the supposition of success many of these supposed triumphs the then adviser remembers to have been occasionally reported by these two pupils if on the ground of a few general hints furnished at the outset pupils they could be called and sometimes it was the grecian sage sometimes his disciple simpson sometimes     both the one and the other that were thus dragged in imagination at the tail of the audacious striplings car for one most lengthy and perplext proposition viz the enunciative part of it on the subject of proportions simpson who in his quality of modern could be treated with the less ceremony simpson it is perfectly remembered was not only drawn and quartered but gibbeted next as to algebra a seeming paradox not to say absurdity in which many a mind it is believed contrives even now to be entangled is the rule according to which the product of two negative quantities multiplied by each other each of them less than nothing for in that mystery this other is but included in part produce a positive quantity yea verily and that altogether as great as if they had both been positive in the third chapter and thirtythird article of his algebra euler when he has observed that by the multiplication of a positive by a negative or of a negative by a positive quantity the product is still negative and therefore if the product of two negative quantities were not positive it would be the same with these thinks he has made the matter sufficiently clear that the conception remaining in the mind of this adept after the utterance of these words was abundantly clear need not be doubted and no less clear would it have been whatever other words it had on this same occasion happened to him to employ but as to a learner taught by such a demonstration the chances seem many to one that his tongue would be silenced yet the chances seem at least as many that his mind would be rather darkened than enlightened fortunate it is on this occasion for the learner in algebra if being an englishman it is through the medium of the translations that have been made into his own language that he betakes himself for instruction to that celebrated work at the end of the first volume are inserted a number of notes some by a former translator of the work from german or latin into french—some by the translator into english in the second of these notes should perseverance have carried him thus far or fortune set him down at the place the learner will find what light the subject admits of thrown upon this the original darkness without employing the gloom of algebraic characters to throw again their darkness upon this first light a short passage or two extracted from two pages may suffice to afford to the intelligent though uninitiated unmathematical reader a clue which if not immediately will it is believed with the help of a little reflection lead to a solution of the paradox the taking of a negative quantity negatively destroys says the intelligent annotator the very property of negation and is the conversion of negative into positive numbers of the nonconception or misconception so apt to have place on this subject he thus points out the cause multiplication says he has been erroneously called a compendious method of performing addition which it might without impropriety be called when the quantities are both positive whereas continues he it is the taking or repeating of one given number as many times as the number by which it is to be multiplied contains units thus any number multiplied by onehalf   for instance multiplied by ½ means that it is to be taken half a time i e that of that same number the half is to be taken instead of the whole hence continues he a little further on it appears that numbers may be diminished by multiplication as well as increased in any given ratio which is wholly inconsistent with the nature of addition happy as the young algebraist may have reason to think himself if perseverance has thus carried him to the end of the first and longest of the two stages into which the road is divided it will have been still more fortunate for him if at the very place at which by the obscure exposition he has at the very threshold of the science been as above tormented it has by any means happened to him to be conducted to that other spot at which light is let into the subject and satisfaction substituted to perplexity true it is that drowned in a flood of algebra a figure of two being the same which is prefixt to the note may after the flood has been dragged upon a close inspection be found but in point of fact how stands the matter of reference it is by the note itself that the eye was conducted to the reference in the text by that reference it was not nor probably ever would have been conducted to the note here belongs a practice begun it is believed as well as continued in scotland and but too much copied in england—the throwing the matter of elucidation to a distance from the matter to be elucidated the consequence is that many at the suggestion of indolence refuse from first to last to go ahunting time after time in quest of the light thus proffered but at the same time hidden under a bushel while others groaning under a toil thus causelessly imposed upon them purchase or leave unpurchased at the humour of the moment the light with which without any additional expense to the writer they might have been accommodated without being thus made to pay for it lastly as to fluxions a modification of the algebraic form—a mode of calculating invented under that name by newton—under the name of the differential and integral calculus by leibnitz whose denomination is employed in every language but the english the original work of newton is not at present within reach but the word employed on this occasion in english being in all english books the same no such suspicion can arise as     that in the use of so elementary and radical an expression any departure from the language of the great master can have had place in a logical and grammatical point of view this word is not exactly the word which the object intended to be denoted required for the expression of it instead of the clear idea meant to be conveyed to an unpractised mind the idea presented is very apt to be a confused one a confusion by which the very first steps taken on this ground are but too apt to be involved by a word or two of explanation this confusion might have been effectually dispelled but nowhere is any such explanation to be found the agent or operating instrument of action and the product or result of it in as far as the operation is effective on every occasion both these entities are as necessary as they are distinct and distinguishable from each other but owing to the poverty of the language or to the want of clear discernment on the part of the generality of those who begun and of those who continue to use it the two last of these objects are apt to be confounded under one name to the above examples though in this case on particular great name no individual mathematician can be brought to view that no branch of mathematics may want its exemplification may be added a source of confused conception observable in the lowest field of mathematics viz arithmetic square root cube root of the objects which these expressions are employed to signify that in the head of many a student the ideas obtained remain from first to last in a state of confusion is a proposition the truth of which would it is believed be upon inquiry but too abundantly exemplified squareroot i e root of the square just as we say fountainhead housetop in a book of instruction suppose an explanation to this effect were subjoined upon the first mention of this compound appellative many a scholars mind it is believed would be saved from a load of perplexity and confusion under which at present it has to struggle or without the explanation short and simple as it is suppose the hyphen and no more inserted as above between the two elements of this compounded appellative this if it had not of itself afforded a complete solution of the enigma would in many instances have afforded a clue to it accordingly sometimes though not constantly this simple though of itself inadequate instrument of explanation is inserted for want of such an explanation of the two adjuncts viz square and cube thus applied what in many a mind is at present the effect square root and cube root two different roots belonging to the same imaginary plant square root as being that one of the two which is of the most frequent occurrence a root such as that of the common radish which runs out into length made square viz as it might be by four strokes of a knife made in proper situations and directions cube root a root of another shape such as that for instance of a turnip radish brought into the shape of a cube or die by four such strokes as the above with the addition of two others viz at the top and bottom of the radish matter is infinitely divisible matter is not infinitely divisible—both these propositions cannot be true one of them must be true which of them is true it is scarce possible to prove for the present purpose let the latter be supposed to be true true or not true it is rather more distinctly conceivable than the other and for the present purpose the only one that can serve for the present purpose then let it be supposed true on this supposition all matter is composed of atoms and all of them of the same size these smallest existing atoms suppose them all or some of them cubes—so many perfect dice these dice may be conceived to be composed each of them of a determinate number of particles of the same form which though never in fact separated may as easily be conceived to be separable and separated as if they really were so these component particles call them points and let the number of them be exactly     ranged in a column regular eight of these points make a line the lines being all of them straight and ranged in appropriate order one above another eight of them each containing eight points make a surface—a surface of a square form such as that exhibited by a chessboard and ranged again in a correspondent order eight of these chessboard surfaces compose the atomic cube or die the sixtyfour points first mentioned points which thus placed in the due and correspondent order—in the order adapted to the purpose exhibit the superficial figure called a square the square composed of these sixtyfour stands upon and placed in any direction has for each of its sides of which the square placed in a certain position may be called the base the line composed of eight of these points the whole atom is composed of eight of these squares piled one upon another constituting a cube having for its base the square first mentioned the number contained in the cube is then with relation to each of the lines of each of these squares a cube containing eight times as many of these points as any one of the squares contains each such square containing eight times as many points as any one of its component lines contains eight the number of the points in each of   0 these lines is the cube root of     the whole solid composed of     such points the whole number of the points contained in the solid atom the form of which is by the supposition that of a cube or die eight this same number eight is at the same time the square root of sixtyfour which is the number of the points contained in each of the surfaces by which that atom is bounded the form of each of which is by the supposition the form of a square as often as in any institutional work in mathematics an explanation of these terms square root and cube root is undertaken to be given the figure of a square at least is it is believed exhibited and for the representation of it a number of points or lines are employed but nowhere it is believed is the explanation so full as above nor in the giving it are the points put together in such a manner as to present the idea of a cube yet this cube being of all the entities in question the only one which in a separate state has in the nature of things its exemplification the ideas of a surface a line and a point having respectively been deduced from the idea of this solid in the way of abstraction the consequence seems to be that when images come to be exhibited the image of a cube ought no more to have been omitted than the image of a square neither is it very distinctly explained why or how one of the surfaces by which a cube or die is bounded comes to be considered as constituting the root of it nor why or how one of the lines by which one of these surfaces is bounded comes to be considered as constituting the root of that surface supposing these matters to admit of explanation the explanation it is believed will be to some such effect as this take a die and set it down upon a table resting on any one of its faces or surfaces—suppose that which is marked with one spot—then suppose the die to be a plant that surface may naturally enough be considered as representing the root of the plant of any figure approaching to that of a die true it is that no plant has ever yet been found but of a figure approaching very nearly to that of a hemisphere such as that which might on all sides be contained exactly within the compass of a die of correspondent dimensions plants have actually been found witness a species of the genus cactus in like manner in a vertical position at right angles to the table set up a chess board composed as above of the rows of squares of which it this square figure is composed the lowest i e that which is in contact with the table represents that boundary which in geometrical language is frequently called the base of the square and which in the language of arithmetic as above may be termed the root of it bearing as it does the same relation to the number of lines contained in the whole surface as the number of lines contained in the whole surface bears to the number of lines contained in the whole solid termed as above a cube or die simple as the above explanation is and useful at least as it seems to be for the obviating confused conceptions and misconceptions such as those of which the above exemplifications may serve as a sample no such explanation will it is believed be as yet to be found in any institutional book unfortunately coupled as it is with the expressions used for the designating of the other objects that are so closely related to and inseparably connected with it the word root considering the material image which it cannot fail to present and which if it did not present it would be altogether insignificant and inexpressive seems not very happily suited to the purpose in correspondency with the word root is employed the word power root being in a certain proposition indicative of decrease power in the same proportion of increase here with no other difference than that between decrease and increase the objects themselves match exactly but the symbols that are thus employed for the designation of those same objects very badly do they match with each other   no image correspondent in any way to that which is exhibited by the word root is exhibited by the word power with the correspondent idea for the expression of which the word root is employed it has no analogy it does not match with it of itself neither of them has any tendency to call up to mind the other   on the other hand power has the advantage and an indispensable one it is of carrying the increase to any number of degrees and consequently the length say also the height to any extent that can be desired on the other hand when for expressing decrease and thus in the scale of magnitude descent you employ the word root at the first step in the line of descent you have the square root at the next the cube root but there your stock of roots of different species of roots each less and running down lower than the preceding one is at an end in one point of view and that the main one power it is true is not ill adapted to present the ideas that belong to the subject the idea of power includes in it the idea of the effect produced or producible by the operation or action of that power and the greater the quantity of power the greater will be expected to be the quantity of the effect whatsoever be the number in question by the quantity expressed by the term the third power of that same number the effect producible be it of what nature it will will be greater than the effect producible by the quantity expressed by the term the second power of that same number taken in this point of view of two numbers employed for giving expression to two powers of different magnitude the greater will therefore be expressive of the greater power     but taken in another sense—as resulting from another of the sorts of occasions on which it is wont to be employed—another sense and that to many minds a more familiar one of any increase of the number attached to the word power the result will be the idea not of increase but of decrease apply it for example to statistics what is meant by the first power in europe is it not that which is capable of producing the greatest effects what is meant by the second power in europe is it not that which is not capable of producing any effects but such as will be less than those producible by the first power and so on the greater the number the less the power indicated by it though as above in itself and of itself were no correspondent and apposite idea required to be expressed along with it power might have been not altogether ill adapted to the purpose yet this incapacity of finding its match in any other word is such an objection to it as seems insuperable and conclusive retaining the word root for giving expression to decrease in quantity and descent in altitude suppose that for giving expression to increase and ascent in the same proposition the word branch were employed branches ascending in the sky we might have as many as powers descending roots we might have as many as branches roots—not square roots and cube roots indeed—after which our stock of roots would be exhausted but first roots and second roots and third roots and so on down to the centre of the earth exactly as many as branches for every branch a root wherever a root were wanted for every root a branch wherever a branch were wanted the plain and standard number neither multiplied by itself nor divided neither increased nor diminished shall it be root or branch or both or neither keeping still to the same figure shall it not be trunk second root will then be to trunk what trunk will be to second branch in this case as in the case of logarithms there are points which would require to be settled to the use of the word branch an objection not unanalogous to that which as above applied to the word power does it must be confessed present itself in the ascending series of branches the greater the number employed in giving expression to any term in the series—in a word to any branch—the greater should be the effect of any portion of matter taken in that number repeated the number of times indicated by that numerical denomination the effect producible by the third branch of the number should be greater than the effect producible by the second branch of the same number and so on but in the case of the class of material beings from the sensible properties of which the image is deduced in the case of a tree for example the higher the branch is it is not the stronger the more powerful but the weaker the less powerful and it is by the greater number that the higher branch will be presented to view and in particular no branch can fail to present itself as being in a greater or less degree weaker instead of stronger than the trunk here then applying to the word branch is an objection analogous to that which we have seen applying to the word power analogous to it and perhaps equal to it but when the one objection is set against the other there remains in favour of the word branch the circumstance of its being analogous to the word root—the word already in use to designate in corresponding propositions the correspondent and opposite effect what must be confessed is that supposing the superior aptitude of the proposed new terms when compared with the old established terms were ever so unquestionable the utility of any such undertaking as that of substituting in any institutional work or scheme of oral instruction the new to the old would still be very questionable it is in the terms now in use for the designating of the ideas in question that all the existing works on the subject stand expressed these works could therefore no further be understood than in as far as the terms here in question are understood but how conclusive soever this consideration may be in the character of an objection to any such attempt as that of substituting these new terms to the old established ones it applies not in the character of an objection to the adding in a scheme of instruction to an explanation of the old an explanation of the new if therefore the ideas presented by the proposed new terms should in any instance be found clearer than the ideas presented by the old here will so much new light be thrown upon the subject without any of the inconveniences so frequently if not constantly attached to change nor would the preferable use of the new language be altogether incompatible with the reaping the instruction contained in the books in which the old terms are employed all along since the days of newton and leibnitz while in the english school the terms fluent and fluxion with their appendages have been employed—by the german and french schools for the conveyance of the same ideas the terms integral and differential with their appendages have been employed a principle of nomenclature so inadequate—a principle by which neither multiplication nor division could be carried on more than two stages how came it to be adopted to what cause shall it be ascribed obviously enough to this viz the continual conversion of the algebraical and the geometrical forms into each other in geometry when from your point you laid down a line when from your line you had erected your square and on your square you had erected your solid in the form of a cube then you found yourself at a stand     no other ulterior dimensions did the nature of things afford so much as to the scale of increase so on the other hand in regard to roots in the square you possessed a figure of which the metaphorical root represented by any of its boundaries might be found in the cube you possessed another figure for which a still deeper root viz the same by which the root of the square had been represented might be found but the nature of things not affording anything more solid or substantial than a cube there ended also the corresponding line of roots so much as to the scale of decrease for in the number called a square number in other words in the second power of that the correspondent number or in the first branch of that same number considered in the character of a branch geometry affords an image capable in some sort of representing it so likewise in the number called a cube number but at that point the representation and consequently the interconvertibility ends at that next point you come to the third power or the second branch of the number in question and to that the stores of geometry afford not any correspondent image here then may perhaps be seen the cause of this obscure and imperfect portion of nomenclature but by the indication thus given of the cause of the imperfection the inconvenience resulting from it is not by any means diminished nor therefore the demand for the application of such remedy as the nature of the case admits of in the case of this science as in the case of so many other branches of art and science the knowledge which the artist or man of science possesses in relation to the subject is derived from the several particulars of detail which belong to the subject from the acquaintance which continual practice has given him with these several particulars the ideas which from these several particulars it has happened to him to derive and store his mind with are perhaps without exception clear ones on the several occasions on which these particulars have been brought to view and spoken of spoken of in language which in the mind of him by whom it has been employed has all along had clear ideas for its accompaniment—the language attached to the subject by usage has of course been all along employed in the mind of this artist or man of science by whom this current language is employed it is all along conjoined with clear ideas the conclusion which very naturally however erroneously he forms in his own mind—forms all along as a matter of course and in such a manner as he would move his legs in walking almost without thinking of it—is that in the minds of other persons in the minds of learners ideas similarly if not altogether equally clear will be attached to this same language but in the minds of persons in general and of young scholars in particular the phrases in question have no such accompaniment with the particulars belonging to the science they have no such already formed acquaintance when therefore without sufficient warning perhaps without any warning at all of the impropriety of the application thus made of them the phrases in question are by the teachers in question through which soever of the two modes of conveying his instruction viz discourse scriptitiously or discourse orally delivered employed in the delivery of instruction in relation to the art or science the consequence is that instead of ascribing to them the latent and multifarious meaning which by long practice and acquaintance with particulars the teacher has learned to attach to them the meaning which he the learner attaches to them is no other than that which has been attached to them by the usage of ordinary language when with the assurance so naturally attached to the possessor of acknowledged and undisputed infallibility he is told that every number which is brought to view to which the sign called the negative sign is prefixed is expressive of a quantity which is and exactly by so much as the figure indicates less than nothing the belief of the existence of an infinite number of quantities each of them less than nothing is thus added to his creed when again after having been required to take one of these quantities that are by so much less than nothing and multiply it by another of these quantities that are less than nothing—two for example by three—the product is composed of a number of quantities all of them greater than nothing viz six in number being exactly the same number of quantities all greater than nothing that would have been the result if instead of quantities all of them less than nothing an equal number of quantities all of them greater than nothing is employed what is the consequence we remain astonished and confounded but the more astonishing the matter of science thus imbibed the greater the glory attached in the acquisition of it and to comfort the learner under his confusion is the use and benefit of this glory the glory of having by dint of hard labour succeeded in treasuring up in his mind under the name of science this mass of palpable nonsense a determination suppose is taken to substitute on this ground the language of simple truth for the language of scientific falsehood and thereby to substitute light for darkness for the production of this effect what is the course that a man will have to take on the occasion of every sort of transaction operation event or state of things in which this sort of fictitious language is in use to be employed he will have to bring to view the nature of the transaction operation event or state of things and at the same time to bring to view the effect which the supposed existence of some supposed negative quantity is productive of of this transaction operation event     or state of things having given an indicative description employing in so far as susceptible of application to the subject the terms of ordinary language he will thereupon in the like language give an indication of the effect so produced by the negative quantity as above so far as this mode of explanation shall have been made to extend so far and no farther will the science have been brought and put into that state in which it ought to be put for the instruction of the young beginner into which it must be put before it can have been fitted for rendering more than a very small part of that quantity of service which in its own nature it is capable of rendering to mankind in what circumstances shall we look for the cause of so apparently extraordinary a phenomenon such flagrant impropriety inappositeness falsity and thence so thick a veil of factitious obscurity in the language of science of inappositeness impropriety falsity in that science of all others which reckons infallibility in the number of its pretensions of which infallibility is commonly regarded as the unquestionable and exclusive attribute in as far as language which on ordinary occasions is used in one sense is on the occasion of scientific instruction used in another an effect similar to that which by the species of secret discourse called cypher is produced in any mind which is not in possession of the key is produced in the mind to which instruction in the science has lately begun to be communicated to him who is in possession of the key the language of the cypher obscure mysterious and perhaps nonsensical as to the conception of this very person it would be otherwise is clear correct and instructive but does it ever happen to him to entertain any such expectation that to any person who is not a possessor of that necessary instrument it should present itself in that more satisfactory character so soon as any such persuasion to any such effect were entertained by him so soon would an assurance equally strong be possessed by him that the purpose for which alone the language had with so much pains been devised was already defeated to the experienced instructor the particulars which he has been accustomed to have in view on the occasion of which the technical and inapposite language in question which and which alone in speaking of the subject it has been usual to him to employ and have employed is the cypher to this cypher the particulars which on these same occasions it has been usual for him to have in view compose the key what wonder if among those to whom while not yet in possession of the key the cypher comes to be pored over the number of those to whose minds the words of the cypher have imparted clear ideas is comparatively so inconsiderable by a comparatively small number of privileged minds to the constitution of which the subject happens to be in a peculiar degree adapted at the end of a certain number of years thus employed an acquaintance with the science—an acquaintance more or less clear correct and extensive—comes to have been attained attained but how by means of the cypher by means of the inapposite the illconstructed the fictitious language no but in spite of it instead of being left to be drawn by abstraction like truth out of her well from the bottom of an ocean of perturbers had the key been conveyed in the first instance and terms of compact texture constructed out of apposite familiar and unfictitious language a small part of the time so unprofitably employed would have sufficed for extracting from the subject a set of conceptions much more clear correct and extensive than those obtained by a process so full of perplexity and inquietude to no man can any truth or set of truths the effect of which is to prove and expose the vanity of any part of that treasure of science real or pretended in which he has been accustomed to place any part of his title to the expectation of distinction and respect be naturally expected to be otherwise than unacceptable in no better light than that of an enemy can the author of so unwelcome an importation be regarded by the feeling of the uneasiness thus produced the passion of anger directing itself toward the immediate author of the uneasiness will be produced and with it the appetite for vengeance to the gratification of this appetite the readiest instrument which the nature of the case will generally speaking be found to present will be the imputation of ignorance matter by which an imputation of this sort may be fixed will of course be looked out for and never does it fail to be looked out for with a diligence correspondent to the provocation given and the temper of the individual to whom it has been given ingenuity is set to work to devise by what means the dart cast at the mind may be rendered most sharp the wound deepest and most afflictive but by no such artifices will the mind of a judicious reader be led astray from the view of the proffered benefit by the means indicated or by any other means is the art of teaching as applied to the branch of art and science in question susceptible of being improved if so whether on the part of him by whom any useful and practically applicable means of improvement have been suggested the marks of ignorance be more or less palpable or more or less numerous are questions not worth a thought to the man of science in whose breast the predominant affection is not the selfregarding love of reputation and desire of intellectual fame but the social affection of philanthropy observations which have for their tendency as well as their object to put him on his guard against those different propensities which with     more or less power and effect operate in every human breast will be regarded not as an injury but as a service will be received not with anger at least not with any durable emotion of that kind but rather with complacency and thankfulness he will find himself thus put upon his guard against an intestine against a latent and insidious enemy on the occasion of propounding any extensive plan of useful instruction—in this as in every other walk of useful art and science the lover of mankind will propose to himself two main objects the one to maximize the quantity of use capable of being derived from it the other to maximize the facility and thence the promptitude with which each given portion or degree of it may be rendered obtainable usefulness and facility by these two words may be expressed the main objects of his regard long after these the advancement in as far as that is distinct from usefulness long after these though still not as an object to be neglected will the mere extension of science that science being but a speculative one rank in his estimation and endeavours vii interconversion of geometry and algebra in speaking of geometry and algebra—of geometry in the first place of algebra in the next place—thus far it has been necessary to speak of these two objects as if they were so many distinct branches of mathematical art and science one of them and that alone applicable to one sort of subject or occasion another and that alone to another but to his surprise not improbably and to his no small annoyance certainly the learner will sooner or later have occasion to observe that in point of practice no such separation has place and that for the obtaining of one and the same result for the solution of one and the same problem for the finding an answer to one and the same question for the demonstrating the truth of one and the same assertion for instance in the way the problem in question has been solved both these branches of mathematical art and science have been employed at once and that for the arriving at no more than one conclusion he will have to feel his way through the two distinct sorts of labyrinths the labyrinth constructed out of the capitals of the letterpress alphabet or the field of geometry and the labyrinth constructed out of the small letters of the same alphabet in the field of algebra with dots put over some of them in the upper quarter of it if in the part occupied by the newtonians and ds put before as many of them if in the part occupied by the leibnitzian corps accordingly when after leaving out a swarm of other lines he has learned that for the designation of the line which in the first place he is in search of two of these capital letters have been appointed a supposition which he will naturally be led to make is that now he has formed with it that sort of acquaintance which will be sufficient for the purpose not he indeed for too soon whenever it is for his peace will he find it snatched out of his hands and thrown into the algebraic mill out of which it will not come without having stamped upon it a new name made out of a single letter of the alphabet and that a small one and so with regard to all the other geometric personages for giving names to some of which nothing less than three or even more than three of these letters apiece will suffice of so troublesome a repetition of labour especially on a branch of the field of art and science of which by means of the abbreviative and condensative forms saving of labour is acknowledged to be the grand instrument wherein consists the use to what cause is the usage that has taken place in this matter to be ascribed to find any answer to this question the new search that has been made in the works of mathematicians has not been attended with success one effect seems inseparably to follow of course from the very nature of the two modes and that is that the mode of expression which in the geometrical mode is by the references to the individual diagram confined to that individual diagram and thus reduced down narrowed to the minimum or maximum shall we call it of narrowness is in the algebraic mode and for the opposite reason generalized or to use an expression more conformable to the language of logicians universalized and to this circumstance without our being always if ever fully aware of it may frequently perhaps be found the cause not less real how imperfectly soever perceived of the trouble taken to translate the preparatory and demonstrative part of the proposition out of the geometrical form into the algebraic then why not translate it at once into the ordinary unabbreviated language in answer to this question several reasons may be given none of them unapt   of one of the most obvious of them intimation is already conveyed by the word unabbreviated abbreviation is the main characteristic of the algebraic mode of notation as distinguished from the simply arithmetical applied in so many cases where it was in a prodigious degree beneficent habit would suffice to cause it to be applied to other cases in which the employment of it would not be attended with any such advantages   be it of what kind it may an instrument which after much trouble a man has at length succeeded in rendering himself expert in the use of he is naturally fond of playing with love of power and love of admiration—both these appetites find their gratification in it   by this symbolical in contradistinction     to the purely verbal mode of designation much embarrassment and difficulty is saved and in lieu of a variable an invariable mode of expression is employed for framing the expression in the purely verbal mode how much more effectually soever if framed by a masterly hand instructive to the scholar at first entrance a much fuller and clearer comprehension of the subject will commonly be necessary than every one is able to attain as well as much more labour than every one is willing to bestow for the giving expression to the same matter in the purely verbal mode it is impossible to say how many forms all more or less different from one another some more apt some less apt whether in respect of choice of words or arrangement might be capable of being employed expressed in the symbolical mode all these variants are reduced to one to the reader great whatsoever be the subject is the advantage derived in the shape of clearness of conception from this unity and simplicity in the mode of expression to the writer it moreover affords though a different a correspondent advantage reducing all styles to one it places the most inexpert grammarian upon a level with the most expert appendix no ix hints towards the composition of an elementary treatise on universal grammar on a new principle on which that branch of art and science may it is supposed be capable of being taught and learned with advantage and facility towards the close of a chrestomathic course introduction the purposes for which grammar as applied to languages other than the vernacular one is proposed to be included in the chrestomathic course have already been brought to view with a view to these same purposes it is supposed that now in the present state of the field of art and science to the leading principles of what is called universal grammar admission might in this same seminary be given and that with sufficient facility and adequate practical advantage of a plan of the kind in question the general principles of mathematics will it is taken for granted be universally recognised as forming a proper part but it is confidently anticipated that with the rules of particular grammar to afford explanation to them the general principles of universal grammar will not on the part of the student require either more labour or a greater maturity of intellect than the general principles of mathematics while on the other hand by the more extensive command which will thus be given to him over the powers of his mind the use derived from a given quantity of labour will in this case be at least equal to any that can reasonably be expected to have place in that other case a consideration from which this expectation has received additional strength is that upon the plan in question to the exposition of the leading principles of the art and science of universal grammar upon the plan in question the exposition of a correspondent part of the principles of logic would be necessary considerations of the logical cast forming all along the basis of such considerations of the grammatical cast as would be brought to view if by this connexion the access to an acquaintance with so much of the connected matter as belongs to the head of grammar would be clogged with difficulty and the progress retarded here would pro tanto be an objection but the notion is that from the two branches of art and science in question mutual light would by each other be reflected and that by means of the conjunction a given degree of acquaintance with both would be attained with less labour than supposing separation practicable would be necessary to the attainment of an equal degree of acquaintance with no more than one the circumstance by which at the present time in particular the prospect of being able in relation to this at present abstruse branch of art and science to administer instruction on terms of hitherto unprecedented advantage is the discovery made by horne tooke—that discovery by which the relation which has place between certain till then incomprehensible parts of speech on the one part and certain of the better understood parts of speech on the other part has been brought to view—by which the import of certain till then incomprehensible parts of speech was made known by showing their identity with other parts of speech the import of which was not thus abstruse the explanation of this discovery of his having been left by him in an unfinished state may perhaps in some measure have been the cause why no new system of universal grammar constructed with the lights thrown on the subject by that discovery hath as yet been given to the world but to the purpose here in question to any one who will be at the pains of availing himself of them the light afforded by that discovery will it is believed be found quite sufficient should the expectations here spoken of be sanctioned by the event two results one theoretical the other practical both of them in a more particular degree gratifying to an english heart will it is believed be found deducible from the branch of instruction here proposed the theoretical one is that to all the purposes of discourse taken together latin and     greek not excepted the english language is better adapted than any other language the practical result is that in the seminary which so much to the honour of this country is at work for the training up of young persons to be sent abroad in the character of missionaries in the hope of that glory which is to be reaped from the propagation of christianity and civilisation among barbarous nations by whom when taken in the aggregate a prodigiously diversified multitude of languages afford respectively the only medium they have through which instruction can be transmitted to them by the generosity of their intended benefactors—an institutional treatise on the principles of universal grammar would if grounded on the foundation here in question be found a useful assistant substracting at the same time from the quantity of the correspondent part of such their literary labour and at the same time in respect of strength of mind and mastery of the subject making addition to their capacity for it section i of language a communication made by language is either simple or complex it is simple when the matter of thought communicated by it is no more than what is contained in one proposition—one logical proposition complex if any more for the making of any communication—in other words for the framing a proposition if every necessary part of it be expressed—no part of it understood as the phrase is i e left to be supplied by the person addressed—several parts called words or terms are necessary or at any rate if no more than a single word be employed and the import of an entire proposition be expressed by it it is because by means of a certain letter or letters forming part of that word an import is given to it the same as that for the expression of which more words than one are in other cases employed viz without making any addition to the sense of it every complex communication is resolvable into two or more simple ones every complex proposition is resolvable into two or more simple ones every simple proposition if the expression given to it be complete contains in it the import of at least three different sorts of words the import of each of them bearing a particular relation to that of the rest to the import for the expression of which three words are necessary and sufficient if the import of any other word having a separate import of its own be added the import of this additional word is expressible by and when fully expressed equivalent to that of an entire proposition for the giving expression to the different propositions of which discourse is or is capable of being composed different sets of words different sets of sounds together with correspondently different sets of visible signs employed for presenting to the sense of sight or that of touch the import of those sounds with or without the sounds themselves are employed by different portions of the human population of this earth each set of sounds forming a separate language but for giving expression to all the different sorts of relations† which for the composition of discourse i e of every possible assemblage of propositions simple and complex the sorts of words necessary and sufficient are the same in every language these different sorts of words are what are called the parts of speech into the import of a simple proposition of the most simple sort of proposition three different sorts of words as already stated must enter these are—   the name of the subject of the discourse of the communication made by it—   the name of some attribute attributed or ascribed to the same subject   the name of the copula—the attributive copula by which the attribution is performed of language the primary use is by means of expression to make communication of thought by the necessity of making this communication it was that the original demand for language was created of the nature of language no clear correct and instructive account can be given but with reference to thought but the arrangement which on this occasion and for this purpose is given to the materials may have all along a view to and be such as is prescribed by the arrangement that seems requisite to be given to the materials of language the origin of language being the demand created for it by the need men found themselves under of making communication of their thoughts the next consideration is that of the modifications of which that demand is susceptible here comes the inquiry in what ways by language in general and by the different known languages in particular or rather by particular languages and thence by language     in general satisfaction has been given to that demand all along it will be matter not less of instruction than of curiosity and amusement to go back and in the remaining fragments as in exuviæ of lost species of plants and animals to observe the features of language and languages in their earliest state throughout the whole field of language two languages as it were run all along in a state of parallelism to each other—the one material the other immaterial—the material all along the basis of the immaterial the same stock of words serves for each—each word serving or being capable of serving in both senses—at any rate every word originally employed in a material sense is capable of being employed in an immaterial sense saving the class of real entities distinguished by the appellation of inferential the entities of which the words of the immaterial language are designative are all fictitious entities fictitious entities may be distributed according to the branch of art and science for the purpose of which the names of them require to be employed thus we have   somatic or somatological fictitious entities   noological fictitious entities   ethical fictitious entities all language is employed in announcing the existence absolute or conditional past present or future of some event or state of things or say of some state of things quiescent or moving real or imaginary i e meant to be represented as real or meant to be represented as imaginary in this case the distinction between reality and imaginariness may apply as well to the things themselves as to the state whether of motion or rest in which they are represented as existing no state of things can have been in existence but in some place and some time—in some portion of the field of space and in some portion of the field of time place and time are accordingly both of them adjuncts to all existence existence is a field or ocean which spreads itself at once over both these subjacent fields the field of space and the field of time but though in fact neither space nor time can in any instance fail to be the actual accompaniments of existence yet by language expression may on any occasion be given to existence without being given either to place or to time or at any rate without being given to both the ideas in the designation of which language is employed are reducible to two heads—  ideas of subjects i e of entities real or fictitious considered as subjects and   ideas of relations—of relations between subject and subject for the designation of ideas of relations adjuncts and modifications attached to the principal idea—the idea of the subject—two modes are employed in language viz—  separate accessory words   modifications of the signs of the principal idea or subject—the principal word for the giving an account of these different modifications of ideas the most commodious of all languages will be that in which the greatest use is made of separate words why because in this case for the separate designation of each such modification there is a separate and apposite word already provided by the language† the more of these separate words a language possesses the less the demand it has for and naturally the less the number it will have of the abovementioned verbal modifications these modifications have by grammarians been termed inflections in proportion as the number which it furnishes of these modifications or inflections is small the language may be said to be a sparingly inflected—in the opposite case a copiously inflected language section ii systematical sketch of the parts of speech under the universally applying appellation of parts of speech are included the whole number of the words of which the language in question is composed classed and denominated according to the several relations which they bear or are capable of bearing one to another in the composition of a grammatical sentence a sentence in the language of grammar is not the same thing with a proposition in the language of logic a sentence when all the words belonging to it are inserted cannot contain less than an entire proposition but it may contain any number of propositions the different species of relations which for the purposes of discourse have need of so many different classes of words for giving expression to them are the same in all languages the parts of speech are therefore the same in all languages the scantiest and most inconveniently constructed as well as the richest and most cultivated—the hottentot and chinese as well as the greek and english universal grammar is that sort of grammar which treats of those relations in so far as they are common to all languages when upon a correct foundation an allcomprehensive institute of universal grammar has once been formed supposing it framed with that degree of skill which has been exemplified in so many particular grammars it will serve as a common standard of comparison and as a source of explanation for all     languages and as a foundationmodel for the several particular grammars which take for their respective subjects these same languages without and therefore before the discoveries made by horne tooke no such universal grammar it will be seen could have been formed by him the way has been prepared for a work of this sort but for the framing of it one of the requisites has been a clear view of that logic in which when taken in its most extended sense grammar even universal grammar has its foundation and so it has happened that no professed grammarian seems as yet to have given himself this qualification an acquaintance with universal grammar as abovedescribed will naturally be among the acquisitions to be made in a chrestomathic school so far from adding to it will substract from the quantity of labour necessary to the acquisition of a given degree of acquaintance with the particular languages therein proposed to be taught words are the signs of thoughts—proportioned only to the degree of correctness and completeness with which thoughts themselves have been conceived and arranged can be the degree of correctness and completeness given to their respective signs of speech though the correction extension and improvement of thought be and that to a prodigious degree a consequence yet the more immediate and only universally regarded object is but the communication of thought but by anything less than an entire proposition i e the import of an entire proposition no communication can have place in language therefore the integer to be looked for is an entire proposition—that which logicians mean by the term logical proposition of this integer no one part of speech not even that which is most significant is anything more than a fragment and in this respect in the manyworded appellative part of speech the word part is instructive by it an intimation to look out for the integer of which it is a part may be considered as conveyed a word is to a proposition what a letter is to a word a sentence—in that which by grammarians is meant by the word sentence—the matter either of no more than a single proposition or that of any number of propositions may be contained not unfrequently by no more than a single word the import of an entire proposition is expressed but the case in which this happens is that in which as to all that is not supplied by modification as above that omission of words of which at the same time it is necessary that the import should be present to the mind that omission which by grammarians is called ellipsis has place of the existence of an ellipsis or any omission the test is this—look out for the words the import of which though the terms themselves are not inserted is supposed to be intended to be conveyed in so far as this is the case then so it is that by the insertion of these words no addition will appear to have been made to the sense without a gap in the sense an ellipsis can no otherwise be left than in so far as by the nature of the subject or of the context i e the words of which the circumjacent proposition are composed the import of the words omitted is suggested arranged in the order of simplicity and conceptibility and denominated by their usual names the several parts of speech that are essentially different from one another and not included any one of them under any other will stand as follows   substantive nounsubstantive   adjective nounadjective   verb verbsubstantive called also the copula   preposition   conjunction if considered as distinct from all the above and not including in itself the import of several of them the interjection does not form a part of organized language it is no more than part and parcel of that unorganized language which is common to man and the inferior animals in the above list the word substantive must be considered as unfurnished with those several additaments and other modifications by which the relations designated by the words gender number and case are expressed so likewise the nounadjective so likewise the verb as distinct from those by which the relations designated by the words person number moods and tense are expressed the pronounsubstantive will be found to coincide in its import and properties with the nounsubstantive and that as perfectly as any one nounsubstantive with another common substantive that is the sort of relation it bears to the several other parts of speech is the same the pronounadjective will in like manner be found to coincide in its import and properties with the nounadjective the article whether definite or indefinite will be found in like manner to be but a species of nounadjective a part of speech is either   aplonoctic—simple in its import or   syncraticonoctic—composite in its import a part of speech simple in its import is either   significant by itself or   not significant by itself the only part of speech which is perfectly simple in its import and at the same time integrally significant is the nounsubstantive the nounsubstantive not as it exists in greek and latin complicated with literal modifications indicative of logical relations such as gender number and case but such as it exists in english as in the words man woman horse     a nounsubstantive is a name as in the latin the word noun truly imports the entity of which it is the name belongs either to the class of real entities or to the class of fictitious entities incorporeal as well as corporeal substances being included real entities are those alone which belong to that universal class designated by the logicians by the name of substances substances are divided by them into corporeal and incorporeal under the name of corporeal are included all masses of matter howsoever circumstanced in respect of form bulk and place of corporeal substances the existence is made known to us by sense of incorporeal no otherwise than by ratiocination—they may on that account be termed inferential to the class of inferential entities belong   the soul of man in a state of separation from the body   god   all other and inferior spiritual entities substantives are either proper names or common names a proper name is a sign by which some individual object is alone signified a common name is a name by which some class of objects is signified in the order of time the use of proper names cannot but have preceded the use of common names common names cannot have been formed without a course of experience whereby the identity or resemblance of properties or qualities as between individual and individual among all such individuals as belong to the class so constituted and designated has been made known the import of a proper name is intelligible to the inferior animals to all animals for example who for the purpose of their being fed are accustomed to be called if it be never addressed on any other occasion or for any other purpose the sound by which it is called becomes in the animals mind the animals name to the animal it is but a proper name howsoever to the man who on that occasion uses it it may be a common name to the man who intending to give food to a cat cries puss puss may be a common name and be accordingly applied to the purpose of feeding several cats at once but to each respective cat it is but a proper name—what each cat understands is that itself is named by it what no cat understands is that any other cat is named by it among names of fictitious entities the foremost and those the designation of which is of most immediate necessity to mindexpressing converse are qualities† taking the word proposition in its simplest acceptation by every proposition the existence of some quality in some subject is asserted a proposition is any portion of discourse by which the existence of some quality in some subject is asserted the name of the substance is the nounsubstantive the name of the quality is the nounadjective the word by which the relation between the quality and the substance is indicated viz the existence of the one in the other is by logicians called the copula by grammarians on some of the occasions on which by logicians the term copula is employed the term verb is employed but it would not by any means be true to say that the word copula and the word verb are synonymous—interconvertible—indicative of precisely the same object and nothing more by the word copula no more than one single class of words is indicated viz the class of words by which intimation is conveyed that in the opinion of the speaker the quality named by him exists in the subject the name of which is pronounced by him at the same time by the word verb is indicated the cluster of objects the names of which are by grammarians put together and spoken of as constituting all of them together but one verb the import of the word copula is the same in all languages the import of the word verb is different in different languages in the copiously inflected languages it includes a much greater number of words than in the sparingly inflected languages in the import of the copula is included nothing more than the one idea just brought to view in the language of grammarians one verb is by the name of the verbsubstantive distinguished from all others—it may be termed the verb in which are contained indications of simple existence in latin the verb sum in english the verb to be for in latin one of the many species of conjugates included under that complex denomination in english another of those species of conjugates is employed as the name of the whole aggregate in every other verb throughout all its modifications to the import of the copula is added the import of some name of a quality in the verbsubstantive no such additament has place unless the objects designated by the words person number mood tense be regarded as   0 capable of being included under and designated by the word quality the following are the accessory ideas of which the principal ones expressed by the several parts of speech in question must be divested why answer—because of these several accessory ideas the several signs will be found to be equivalent to the import of so many entire propositions i nounsubstantive accessory ideas attached to it in some languages the ideas designated by the words   gender   number   case† ii nounadjective the same iii verb accessory ideas attached to it as above in some languages‡   person relation had to the speaker and the being spoken to   number   mood or mode which is either   absolute or   conditional   tense i e the sign of time i gender proposition involved in the import of the termination by which gender i e sex is designated   the person in question viz the person in the designation of whom the nounsubstantive to which the termination is attached is employed is of the sex thus designated—either male or female applied to human and most other animated beings the proposition thus expressed may always be true   the thing in question is of the sex so designated applied to unorganized beings this is never true and so among organized beings with few exceptions if applied to vegetables by this absurd falsehood useless complication to a vast amount and conception not only erroneous but pernicious to a considerable amount are infused into the composition of the languages in which this excrescence is contained and in particular the latin the greek and the modern languages of which these ancient languages form respectively the main roots ii number proposition involved in the import of the termination by which number is designated objects of the same kind more than one are meant to be indicated by the nounsubstantive to which with or without the addition of the nounadjective the termination in question is attached in the same way may be brought to view the propositions respectively indicated by the terminations or other modifications expressive of case mood or mode and tense two cases there are in and by the import of which no such adscititions and accessory idea is necessarily involved there are   the nominative   the accusative in these cases there is not any proposition of the import of which the designation is added to that of the import of the noun to which the termination or other modification is attached those in the instances of which there is always some proposition of the import of which the designation is always involved in that of the termination in question are   the genitive   the dative   the ablative in certain sparingly inflected languages the import of the genitive is indeed expressed by a termination but in those same languages it is in every instance expressed also by a proposition in every language in which it has place the substitution made of terminations or other inseparable modifications to separate words such for example as prepositions is on several accounts a great blemish   it is a source of prodigious complication—the whole of it useless   it is a most copious source of ambiguity one such modification being in these copiously inflected languages applied of necessity to convey indiscriminately a multitude of different imports which being essentially different present a correspondently urgent demand for these instruments of distinction of which so correct and complete a stock is afforded by the sparingly inflected languages   from the multitude of these separate adjuncts which in the sparingly inflected languages are capable of being conjoined with the same principal part of speech and the multitude of the changes capable of being rung upon them by arranging them in different orders may be seen a copious source of energy variety and thence of beauty of which the copiously inflected languages are not susceptible section iii properties desirable in language the properties desirable in the case of any particular language will be correspondent to and dependent on the properties desirable in all language or discourse taken in the aggregate different properties are in different degrees desirable in a human discourse on different     occasions the properties desirable in a mass of discourse will in some degree as to some of them depend on the nature of the discourse that is on the sort of end which it has in view and the occasion on which—the state of things—the conjuncture in which it is uttered the properties desirable in language in general will then be the sum of all the properties which can be desirable in it on the sum of all the different occasions that are capable of having place one allcomprehensive property may therefore be stated as desirable in any particular language viz the capacity of being according to the nature of each occasion endowed with all the several properties which on that particular occasion are desirable in language—would be desired by would be serviceable to any and every person who on that occasion should have need to employ the faculty of discourse properties of the first order or primary properties—properties of the second order or secondary properties under these different heads may be ranked all the several properties desirable in language or discourse taken at large by properties of the first order understand all such properties as in a direct way are respectively conducive to one or other of all the several sorts of ends to the accomplishment of which language is in any part of it on any occasion capable of being employed and directed and which supposing them possessed need not for that purpose the intervention or addition of any other properties by properties of the second order understand such properties as are indeed conducive to the same ends but no farther nor any otherwise than as being respectively contributory to the endowing of the language with one or more of the properties above designated and distinguished by the appellation of properties of the first order the several properties of the first order which with reference to all ends and on all occasions taken together are desirable in language may be thus enumerated—   clearness   correctness   copiousness   completeness   nonredundance   conciseness   pronounciability   melodiousness   discibility  0 docibility    meliorability    impressiveness    dignity    patheticalness the several properties of the second order which in respect of their conduciveness to the same ends but through the medium each of them of one or more of the particulars standing in the above list of primary properties are desirable in language may be thus enumerated   the relations expressed by it expressed as much as may be by distinct words in contradistinction to modifications of other words in proportion as it is endowed with this property a language may be termed a sparingly inflected language a word being assumed as the basis or root of these several modifications they will consist either of additions to substractions from or changes of some one or more of the letters of the fundamental or radical word these may be made   at the beginning   at the end   at any intermediate part all such modifications may be termed inflections in proportion to the multitude of these modifications it may be called a copiously inflected language         a fragment on ontology now first published from the manuscripts of jeremy bentham note by the editor if the term ontology be considered as it generally is synonymous with that of metaphysics and be held to embrace all that is brought together by the english writers on that science the following tract will be found to illustrate but a very small branch of the subject the original mss have indeed all the appearance of being purely fragmentary and it is probable that the author intended to incorporate them in the great system of mental philosophy of a design to prepare which he has left so many traces and of which the works on logic language and grammar which follow this may be considered as portions although thus limited in extent it was thought best to publish these pages in the form of a separate work as the analysis and classification of the matter of thought and language which they contain form what may be called the elements of the authors psychical system and are understood or more briefly repeated in all his examinations of the operations of the mind the philosophical reader will perhaps find in them a key to many of the difficulties that created the controversy between the realists and the nominalists and they undoubtedly throw considerable light on that dispute the reader who wishes to follow out this subject will find farther elucidations of it in the tract on logic at pp         and in that on language at p     the mss from which this tract is edited bear date           and              introduction the most general that is the most extensive propositions belonging to physics to somatology the only branch of physics that comes under the cognisance of sense are considered as forming a separate branch of art and science under the very uncharacteristic name of mathematics the most general and extensive propositions belonging to physics in the largest sense of the word including somatology and psychology† taken together have been considered as forming in like manner a separate discipline to which the name of ontology has been assigned the field of ontology or as it may otherwise be termed the field of supremely abstract entities is a yet untrodden labyrinth—a wilderness never hitherto explored in the endeavour to bring these entities to view and place them under the readers eye in such sort that to each of their names ideas as clear correct and complete as possible may by every reader who will take the trouble be annexed and remain attached the following is the course that will be pursued those of which the conception is most simple will all along precede those of which the conception is less simple in other words those words to the understanding of which neither any other word nor the import of any other word will be necessary will be brought to view in the first place and before any of those which in their import bear a necessary and more or less explicit or implied reference to the ideas attached to this or that other word chapter i classification of entities section i division of entities an entity is a denomination in the import of which every subject matter of discourse for the designation of which the grammatical part of speech called a nounsubstantive is employed may be comprised entities may be distinguished into perceptible and inferential an entity whether perceptible or inferential is either real or fictitious section ii of perceptible entities a perceptible entity is every entity the existence of which is made known to human beings by the immediate testimony of their senses without reasoning i e without reflection a perceptible real entity is in one word a body‡ the name body is the name of the genus generalissimum of that class of real entities under this genus generalissimum a system of divisions which has for its limit the aggregate of all distinguishable individual bodies may be pursued through as many stages as are found conducive to the purposes of discourse at any such stage and at any number of such stages the mode of division may be bifurcate§ and exhaustive i e allcomprehensive the division according to which bodies are spoken of as subjects of one or other of the three physical kingdoms viz animal vegetable and mineral is a trifurcate division by substituting to this one stage of division two stages each of them bifurcate the division may be rendered or rather shown to be exhaustive as thus— a body is either endued with life or not endued with life a body endued with life is either endued with sensitive life or with life not sensitive a body endued with sensitive life is an animal a body endued with a life not sensitive is a vegetable a body not endued with life is a mineral section iii of inferential entities an inferential entity is an entity which in these times at least is not made known to human beings in general by the testimony of sense but of the existence of which the persuasion is produced by reflection—is inferred from a chain of reasoning an inferential entity is either   human or   superhuman       a human inferential entity is the soul considered as existing in a state of separation from the body of a human soul existing in a state of separation from the body no man living will it is believed be found ready to aver himself to have had perception of any individual example or at any rate no man who upon due and apposite interrogation would be able to obtain credence considered as existing and visiting any part of our earth in a state of separation from the body a human soul would be a ghost and at this time of day custom scarcely does fashion certainly does not command us to believe in ghosts of this description of beings the reality not being in any instance attested by perception cannot therefore be considered any otherwise than as a matter of inference   a superhuman entity is either supreme or subordinate the supreme superhuman inferential entity is god sanctioned by revelation sanctioned by the religion of jesus as delivered by the apostle paul is the proposition that no man hath seen god at any time if this proposition be correct god not being consistently with the imperfection of the human senses capable of being referred to the class of perceptible real entities cannot in consequence of the imperfection under which human reason labours cannot any more than the soul of man considered as existing in a separate state be referred by it to any other class than that of inferential real entities as above described† a subordinate superhuman entity is either good or bad a good subordinate superhuman inferential entity is an angel a bad subordinate superhuman inferential entity is a devil by the learner as well as by the teacher of logic all these subjects of ontology may without much detriment it is believed to any other useful art or any other useful science be left in the places in which they are found section iv of real entities a real entity is an entity to which on the occasion and for the purpose of discourse existence is really meant to be ascribed under the head of perceptible real entities may be placed without difficulty individual perceptions of all sorts‡ the impressions produced in groups by the application of sensible objects to the organs of sense the ideas brought to view by the recollection of those same objects the new ideas produced under the influence of the imagination by the decomposition and recomposition of those groups—to none of these can the character the denomination of real entities be refused faculties powers of the mind dispositions all these are unreal all these are but so many fictitious entities when a view of them comes to be given it will be seen how perfectly distinguishable among psychical entities are those which are recognised in the character of real from those which are here referred to the class of fictitious entities to some it may seem matter of doubt whether to a perception of any kind the appellation of a real entity can with propriety be applied certain it is that it cannot if either solidity or permanence be regarded as a quality belonging to the essence of reality but in neither of these instances can it is believed any sufficient or just reason be assigned why the field of reality should be regarded as confined within the limits which on that supposition would be applied to it whatsoever title an object belonging to the class of bodies may be considered as possessing to the attribute of reality i e of existence every object belonging to the class of perceptions will be found to possess in still higher degree a title established by more immediate evidence it is only by the evidence afforded by perceptions that the reality of a body of any kind can be established of ideas our perception is still more direct and immediate than that which we have of corporeal substances of their existence our persuasion is more necessary and irresistible than that which we have of the existence of corporeal substances speaking of entities ideas might perhaps accordingly be spoken of as the sole perceptible ones substances those of the corporeal class being with reference and in contradistinction to them no other than inferential ones but if substances themselves be the subject of the division and for the designation of the two branches of the division the words perceptible and inferential be employed it is to corporeal     substances that the characteristic and differential attribute perceptible cannot but be applied the term inferential being thereupon employed for the designation of incorporeal ones the more correct and complete the consideration bestowed the more clearly will it be perceived that from the existence of perceptions viz of sensible ones the inference whereby the existence of corporeal entities viz the bodies from which those perceptions are respectively derived is much stronger more necessary and more irresistible than the inference whereby the existence of incorporeal entities is inferred from the existence of perceptible entities alias corporeal substances alias bodies suppose the nonexistence of corporeal substances of any hard corporeal substance that stands opposite to you make this supposition and as soon as you have made it act upon it pain the perception of pain will at once bear witness against you and that by your punishment your condign punishment suppose the nonexistence of any inferential incorporeal substances of any one of them or of all of them and the supposition made act upon it accordingly—be the supposition conformable or not conformable to the truth of the case at any rate no such immediate counterevidence no such immediate punishment will follow section v of fictitious entities a fictitious entity is an entity to which though by the grammatical form of the discourse employed in speaking of it existence be ascribed yet in truth and reality existence is not meant to be ascribed every nounsubstantive which is not the name of a real entity perceptible or inferential is the name of a fictitious entity every fictitious entity bears some relation to some real entity and can no otherwise be understood than in so far as that relation is perceived—a conception of that relation is obtained reckoning from the real entity to which it bears relation a fictitious entity may be styled a fictitious entity of the first remove a fictitious entity of the second remove and so on a fictitious entity of the first remove is a fictitious entity a conception of which may be obtained by the consideration of the relation borne by it to a real entity without need of considering the relation borne by it to any other fictitious entity a fictitious entity of the second remove is a fictitious entity for obtaining a conception of which it is necessary to take into consideration some fictitious entity of the first remove considered at any two contiguous points of time every real entity is either in motion or at rest now when a real entity is said to be at rest it is said to be so with reference to some other particular real entity or aggregate of real entities for so far as any part of the system of the universe is perceived by us we at all times perceive it not to be at rest such at least is the case not only with the bodies called planets but with one or more of the bodies called fixed stars and by analogy we infer this to be the case with all the rest this premised considered with reference to any two contiguous points of time past every perceptible real entity was during that time either in motion or not in motion if not in motion it was at rest here then we have two correspondent and opposite fictitious entities of the first remove viz a motion and a rest a motion is a mode of speech commonly employed a rest is a mode of speech not so commonly employed to be spoken of at all every fictitious entity must be spoken of as if it were real this it will be seen is the case with the abovementioned pair of fictitious entities of the first remove a body is said to be in motion this taken in the literal sense is as much as to say here is a larger body called a motion in this larger body the other body namely the really existing body is contained so in regard to rest to say this body is at rest is as much as to say here is a body and it will naturally be supposed a fixed body and here is another body meaning the real existing body which is at that firstmentioned body i e attached to it as if the fictitious body were a stake and the real body a beast tied to it an instance of a fictitious entity of the second remove is a quality there are qualities that are qualities of real entities there are qualities that are qualities of the abovementioned fictitious entities of the first remove for example of motion rectilinearity curvilinearity slowness quickness and so on†     section vi uses of this distinction between names of real and names of fictitious entities these uses are   attaching in the only way in which they can be attached clear ideas to the several allcomprehensive and leading terms in question   obviating and excluding the multitudinous errors and disputes of which the want of such clear ideas has been the source disputes which in many instances have not terminated in words but through words have produced antipathy and through antipathy war with all its miseries fictitious entity says some one—of such a locution where can be the sense or use by the word entity cannot but be represented something that has existence—apply to the same subject the adjunct fictitious the effect is to give instruction that it has not any existence this then is a contradiction in terms a species of locution from which in proportion as it has any employment confusion and that alone cannot but be the effect entities are either real or fictitious what can that mean what but that of entities there are two species or sorts viz one which is itself and another which is neither itself nor anything else instead of fictitious entity or as synonymous with fictitious entity why not here say nonentity answer—altogether inevitable will this seeming contradiction be found the root of it is in the nature of language that instrument without which though of itself it be nothing nothing can be said and scarcely can anything be done of the nature of that instrument of the various forms under which it has been seen to present itself among different tribes of men of the indispensable parts i e parts of speech which may be seen to belong to it under every one of those forms actual or possible of the qualities desirable on the part of the collection of signs of which under all these several forms it is composed—under all these several heads sketches will be endeavoured to be given in another place all this while antecedently to the stage at which these topics will present themselves use is however making as it could not but be made of this same instrument at that future stage it will not only be the instrument but the subject also of inquiry at present and until then employing it in the character of an instrument we must be content to take it in hand and make use of it in the state in which we find it in like manner the several operations which by the help of language and under the direction of logic are performed by human minds upon language and thereby upon minds such as distinction division definition and the several other modes of exposition including those of methodization must be performed at and from the very outset of a work on logic antecedently to the stage at which the task of examining into their nature and origination will be entered upon and come to be performed to language then—to language alone—it is that fictitious entities owe their existence—their impossible yet indispensable existence† in language the words which present themselves and are employed in the character of names are some of them names of real entities—others names of fictitious entities and to one or other of these classes may all words which are employed in the character of names be referred what will moreover be seen is that the fiction—the mode of representation by which the fictitious entities thus created in so far as fictitious entities can be created are dressed up in the garb and placed upon the level of real ones is a contrivance but for which language or at any rate language in any form superior to that of the language of the brute creation could not have existence and now perhaps may be seen the difference between a fictitious entity and a nonentity or to speak more strictly the difference between the import of the two words—a difference such that when with propriety and use the one is the other cannot be employed in the house designated by such a number naming it in such a street in such a town lives a being called the devil having a head body and limbs like a mans—horns like a goats—wings like a bats and a tail like a monkeys—suppose this assertion made the observation naturally might be that the devil as thus described is a nonentity the averment made of it is that an object of that description really exists of that averment if seriously made the object or end in view cannot but be to produce in the minds to which communication is thus made a serious persuasion of the existence of an object conformable to the description thus expressed thus much concerning a nonentity very different is the notion here meant to be presented by the term fictitious entity by this term is here meant to be designated one of those sorts of objects which in every language must for the purpose of discourse be spoken of as existing—be spoken of in the like manner as those objects which really have existence and to which existence is seriously meant to be ascribed are spoken of but without any such danger as that of producing any such persuasion as that of their possessing each for itself any separate or strictly speaking any real existence take for instances the words motion relation faculty power and the like     real entities being the objects for the designation of which in the first place at the earliest stage of human intercourse and in virtue of the most urgent necessity words in the character of names were employed—between the idea of a name and that of the reality of the object to which it was applied an association being thus formed from a connexion thus intimate sprung a very natural propensity viz that of attributing reality to every object thus designated—in a word of ascribing reality to the objects designated by words which upon due examination would be found to be nothing but so many names of so many fictitious entities to distinguish them from those fictitious entities which so long as language is in use among human beings never can be spared fabulous may be the name employed for the designation of the other class of unreal entities of fictitious entities whatsoever is predicated is not consistently with strict truth predicated it then appears of anything but their respective names but forasmuch as by reason of its length and compoundedness the use of the compound denomination name of a fictitious entity would frequently be found attended with inconvenience for the avoidance of this inconvenience instead of this long denomination the less long though unhappily still compound denomination fictitious entity will commonly after the above warning be employed of nothing that has place or passes in our minds can we give any account any otherwise than by speaking of it as if it were a portion of space with portions of matter some of them at rest others moving in it of nothing therefore that has place or passes in our mind can we speak or so much as think otherwise than in the way of fiction to this word fiction we must not attach either those sentiments of pleasure or those sentiments of displeasure which with so much propriety attach themselves to it on the occasion in which it is most commonly in use very different in respect of purpose and necessity very different is this logical species of fiction from the poetical and political—very different the fiction of the logician from the fictions of poets priests and lawyers for their object and effect the fictions with which the logician is conversant without having been the author of them have had neither more nor less than the carrying on of human converse such communication and interchange of thought as is capable of having place between man and man the fictions of the poet whether in his character of historic fabulist or dramatic fabulist putting or not putting the words of his discourse in metrical form are pure of insincerity and neither for their object nor for their effect have anything but to amuse unless it be in some cases to excite to action—to action in this or that particular direction for this or that particular purpose by the priest and the lawyer in whatsoever shape fiction has been employed it has had for its object or effect or both to deceive and by deception to govern and by governing to promote the interest real or supposed of the party addressing at the expense of the party addressed in the mind of all fiction in the logical sense has been the coin of necessity—in that of poets of amusement—in that of the priest and the lawyer of mischievous immorality in the shape of mischievous ambition—and too often both priest and lawyer have framed or made in part this instrument chapter ii fictitious entities classified section i names of physical fictitious entities to this class belong all those entities which will be found included in aristotles list—included in his ten predicaments the first excepted in the order in which he has placed and considered them they stand as follows—  substance   quantity   quality   relation   places   time   situation   possession   action  0 passion or suffering from this list of aristotles—the list of names of physical entities will as here presented be found to be in a considerable degree different viz in the first place in respect of the particulars of which it is composed in the next place in respect of the order in which they are brought to view of these differences the grounds will successively be brought to view as they arise   quantity—quantity cannot exist without some substance of which it is the quantity of substance no species no individual can exist without existing in some certain quantity   quality—quality cannot exist without some substance of which it is the quality of substance no species can exist without being of some quality of a multitude of qualities of which the number is in every instance indeterminate capable of receiving increase and that to an indefinite degree according to the purposes for which and the occasions on which the several substances of which they are qualities may come to be considered   place—of place the notion cannot be entertained without the notion of some substance considered as placed or capable of existing or as we say being placed in it place may be considered as absolute or relative  00 supposing but one substance in existence that substance would be in some place—that place would be absolute place—relative place there could be none suppose two substances—then in addition to its own absolute place each substance would have a relative place—a place constituted by the position occupied by it in relation to the other of no individual substance is any notion commonly entertained without some notion of a place—a relative place as being occupied by it the place considered as occupied by an individual substance is different according to the purpose for which and the occasion on which the substance is taken into consideration expressive of the notion of place in their original physical archetypal signification are the several words termed prepositions of place and adverbs of place these are— in on or upon under at above below round around out—out of from above from under from   time—time is as it were on an ulterior and double account a fictitious entity—its denominations so many names of fictitious entities compared with substance and in particular with body place is as hath been seen a fictitious entity without some body placed in it or considered as being capable of being placed in it place would have no existence or what with reference to use would amount to the same thing there would be no purpose for which—no occasion on which it could be considered as having existence but if putting substance out of consideration place be a fiction time is so to speak a still more fictitious fiction having nothing more substantial to lean upon than the fiction of place to be capable of being spoken of time itself must be cannot but be spoken of as a modification of space witness the prepositions in and at in such a portion of time—at such a portion of time in an hour—at    oclock in such a year month day at such an hour at so many minutes after such an hour—at so many seconds after such a minute in such an hour witness again the common expressions—a short time a long time a space of time by a line it is that every portion of time every particular time is conceived represented and spoken of—by a line i e a body of which the length alone without breadth or depth is considered   motion   rest   action   passion at every step the subject of consideration becomes more and more complicated rest is the absence or negation of motion every body is either in motion or at rest here place i e relative space is still the archetype motion is a thing an imaginary an involuntarily imagined substance in which the body is conceived as being placed rest a like body at which the real body is considered as being placed in the idea of motion that of time is moreover involved and again that of place as being that in which the idea of time is by the like necessity involved in motion a body cannot have been but it must have been in two different places at or in two different which is as much as to say in two successive portions of time for the space of time in question i e for a portion of time composed of those same portions which were operative in the case of motion the body has been at rest in so far as in all that space or length of time it has not changed its place with reference to any others taken in the aggregate in so far as can be concluded either from observation or from analogy in the way of inference no body whatsoever is or ever has been or ever will be absolutely in a state of rest i e without being in motion with reference to some other body or bodies the earth which we inhabit is not at rest the sun himself about which she moves is not at rest the stars called fixed being but so many suns are themselves no more at rest than is he considered as a whole the parts of our earth are as far as appears with reference to one another the greater part of them always at rest—others especially those near the surface many of them occasionally in motion and so in regard to the several separate bodies consisting of such portions of the matter of which the earth is composed as are detached and separate from one another each of them having between itself and every other with the exception of the base on which it stands and upon which by the principle of attraction under the several forms under which it operates it is kept at that place certain portions of intervening space of such of them as are in a state of solidity rest relative rest rest with relation to each other in so far as they are in that state is the naturally constant state in motion they are not put but by some supervening accident operating from without of such of them as are in a state of fluidity liquidity and gaseosity included motion relative motion is in every instance a natural state exemplified to a greater or lesser extent depending partly on the particular qualities of the several fluids partly upon the accidents ab extra to which individually taken they happen to have been exposed in addition to the idea of motion in the ideas of action and passion the idea of causation or causality is involved the body f is in motion—of such motion what is the cause answer the action of another body the body s which by the influence or correspondent power which it possesses becomes productive of that effect  0  in themselves the two fictitious entities action and passion are not only correspondent but inseparable no action without passion—no passion without action—no action on the one part without passion on the other in the case of action and thereupon on the part of one of two bodies motion perceptible motion—on the part of the other body is relative motion in every instance a never failing consequence to judge from analogy the probability seems to be in the affirmative in so far as on the part of one of the two alone any motion is perceptible on the part of the other no motion being perceptible the one of which the motion is perceptible is most commonly spoken of as the agent the other as the patient a state of motion is the state in which the former is said to be in a state of passion the state in which the other is said to be in   relation—under this head such is its amplitude several of the others seem totally or partially to be included—viz   quantity all quantities bear some relation or other to each other   quality† section ii absolute fictitious entities of the first order   matter   form   quantity   space no substance can exist but it must be itself matter be of a certain determinate form be or exist in a certain determinate quantity and were there but one substance in existence all these three attributes would belong to it matter at first sight may naturally enough be considered as exactly synonymous to the word substance it may undoubtedly be with propriety employed instead of substance on many of the occasions on which the word substance may with equal propriety be employed but there are occasions on which while substance may matter cannot with propriety be employed by the word substance substances incorporeal as well as corporeal are wont to be designated the word matter is wont to be employed to designate corporeal to the exclusion of incorporeal substances on the other hand neither are occasions wanting in which while the word matter may the word substance cannot with propriety be employed matter is wont to be employed in contradistinction to form and that on occasions in which the word substance cannot with propriety be employed thus in considering substance any individual substance consideration may be had of its matter without any consideration had of its form and so vice versa of its form without its matter thus it is that taken in that sense which is peculiar to it the idea attached to the word matter cannot by means of that word be brought to view without bringing to view along with it the idea of another entity called form and this is the reason why along with form it has been considered as composing a group of entities distinct from the sort of entity for the designation of which the word substance has been employed the word substance is the name of a class of real entities of the only class which has in it any corporeal entities the word matter is but the name of a class of fictitious entities springing out of the sort of real entity distinguished by the word substance and so it is in regard to the word form the ideas respectively designated by these corresponding words are fractional results produced from the decomposition of the word substance every real physical entity every corporeal substance every sort of body has its matter and form and this its matter and this its form are entities totally different from each other these names of entities possess both of them the characteristic properties of fictitious entities it is by means of propositions designative of place and by that means of a fictitious material image that their images are connected with the name of the real entity substance in that substance exists such and such matter behold the matter of that substance behold all this matter from that substance here substance is a receptacle matter a fictitious entity spoken of in one of these occasions as if it were a real entity contained within that receptacle in the others as one that had proceeded from it behold the form in which that substance presents itself behold the form the figure the shape the configuration of that substance figure configuration shape in these several words may be seen so many synonyms or almost synonyms to the word form quantity has been distinguished into continuous and discrete discrete quantity it is commonly said is number it should rather be said is composed of numbers viz of numbers more than one of separate entities it is only by means of discrete quantity i e number that continuous quantity can be measured by the mind that any precise idea of any particular quantity can be formed to form an idea of any continuous quantity i e of a body as existing in a certain quantity one of two courses must be taken or conceived to be taken in relation to it it must be divided  0  or conceived to be divided into parts i e into a determinate number of parts or together with other similar bodies made up into a new and artificial and compounded whole to divide a body or conceive a body to be divided into parts it suffices not to divide it or conceive it divided into its constituent bodies into any such smaller bodies as are contained in it either the entire body itself or its parts respectively must by the mind be conceived to be divided into its several dimensions be the body what it may not being boundless it cannot but have some bound or bounds if one it is a surface these bounds if there be more than one are surfaces these surfaces again not being boundless have their bounds—these bounds are lines the only bodies that have each of them but one uniform surface are spheres bodies are real entities surfaces and lines are but fictitious entities a surface without depth a line without thickness was never seen by any man no nor can any conception be seriously formed of its existence space is the negation or absence of body of any determinate individual portion of space as clear an idea is capable of being formed as of any body or of any portion of any body and besides being equally determinate as that of body the idea of space is much more simple to space it is difficult either to ascribe or to deny existence without a contradiction in terms to consider it as nothing or as distinct from nothing of body—that is of all bodies whatsoever—the annihilation may be conceived without difficulty why because in whatsoever place—that is within whatsoever portion of space within whatsoever receptacle composed of mere space any body is at any given time conceived to be it may thenceforward be conceived to be removed from that place and so successively from any and every other portion of space of space—that is of all portions of space whatever indeed of so much as any one portion of space the annihilation cannot easily be conceived why because in mere space there is nothing to remove nothing that can be conceived capable of being removed in so far as matter is annihilated there is less matter than there was before but suppose space to be annihilated is there less space than there was before hence taken in the aggregate no bounds no limits can be assigned to space so neither can any form or any quantity it cannot be removed it cannot be moved for there is nothing of it or in it to remove there is no place to which it can be removed so much for space taken in the aggregate but take this or that individual portion of space the properties of it are very different conceive it as in innumerable instances it really is enclosed in bodies immediately it is and unavoidably you conceive it to be endowed with many of the properties of bodies of limits it is susceptible as body is in point of fact it has limits and having these limits it thereby has not only form but quantity it not only has limits as truly as body has limits but it has the same limits having limits it thereby has form quantity and even motion along with the terraqueous globe—i e with the whole matter of it—all the portions of space enclosed in that matter describe round the sun and with the sun their continually repeated and ever varied round substance being a real physical entity—perceptions real psychical entities—matter form quantity and so on so many fictitious entities both descriptions being in part applicable to space neither of them applicable entirely—space may be regarded and spoken of as a semireal entity section iii absolute fictitious entities of the second order   quality   modification matter form quantity—all these are susceptible of quality matter every portion of it is capable of having its qualities independently of those of its form and those of its quantity a body is said to be of such a quality such or such a quality is said to be in it resident inherent in it the matter the form the quantity of this body—in any one of these fictitious entities may this secondary fictitious entity be said to be resident to be inherent between quantity and quality a sort of reciprocation a sort of reciprocal intercommunion may be observed to have place as we have the quality of a quantity—two qualities for instance vastness minuteness c—so has a quality its quantities the quantity of a quality is termed a degree the term modification is nearly synonymous to the term quality of modification it seems scarcely proper to speak as constituting or being a fictitious entity different and distinct from quality the difference between them is rather of a grammatical than of a logical nature yet of the cases in which the word quality may be employed there are some in which the word modification can scarcely without impropriety be employed we may speak of a modification of this or that body or of the matter form or quantity as well as of a quality of that same body but we can scarcely without impropriety speak of a modification as being a thing resident or inherent in that same body by the word quality it is that are expressed all particulars whereby the condition  0  of the body or other object in question is rendered similar or dissimilar—in the first place to that of itself at different times in the next place to that of other bodies or objects whether at a different or at the same time goodness and badness of all qualities experienced or imaginable these are the very first that would present themselves to notice these are the very first that would obtain names interest i e desire of pleasure and of exemption from pain being in some shape or other the source of every thought as well as the cause of every action and in particular amongst others of every action by which names are employed in the designation of persons and of things—names plainly and immediately expressive of the two opposite modes of relation in which those objects would be continually bearing relation to each mans interest as above explained would be among the very earliest to which the faculty of discourse would give existence synonyms or quasi synonyms to quality—in this character may be mentioned—  nature   sort   kind   mode   complexion   description   character   shape viz in a sense somewhat less extensive than that in which it is as above synonymous with form section iv fictitious entities connected with relation enumerated no two entities of any kind can present themselves simultaneously to the mind no nor can so much as the same object present itself at different times without presenting the idea of relation for relation is a fictitious entity which is produced and has place as often as the mind having perception of any one object obtains at the same or at any immediately succeeding instant perception of any other object or even of that same object if the perception be accompanied with the perception of its being the same dirersity is in the one case the name of the relation identity in the other case but as identity is but the negation of diversity thence if on no occasion diversity had ever been neither on any occasion would any such idea as that of identity have come into existence whatsoever two entities real or fictitious come to receive names and thus to receive their nominal existence relation would be the third for between the two they being by the supposition different and both of them actual objects of perception the relation of difference or diversity would also become an object of perception and in the character of a fictitious entity a production of the acts of abstraction and denomination acquire its nominal existence next after matter and form the fictitiousentity relation or the class of fictitious entities called relations might therefore have been brought to view but not only between matter and form but also between the one and the other respectively and the fictitious entities designated by the words quantity space and quality so close seemed the connexion as not to be without sensible inconvenience broken by the interposition of any other once introduced upon the carpet the fictitious entity called relation swells into an extent such as to swallow up all the others every other fictitious entity is seen to be but a mode of this the most extensive and in its conception simple of all relations i e of all modes or modifications of the fictitious entity denominated relation is that of place with its submodifications next to that in the order of simplicity comes the modification of time with its submodifications next to them come successively the relations designated by the several words motion rest action passion subalternation viz logical subalternation opposition and connexion or the relation between cause and effect existence with its several modifications or correspondent fictitious entities nonexistence futurity actuality potentiality necessity possibility and impossibility will with most convenience close the rear though still more extensive than even relation they could not be brought to view before it being applicable to all other relations—to relations of all sorts and in a word to entities whether fictitious or real of all sorts—no complete or so much as correct view of their nature and character could be given till these less extensive ones had been brought to view section v simple fictitious entities connected with relation place—of the species of relation designated by the word place the most perfect conception may be easily formed by taking into the account the species of relation designated by the word time necessary altogether is the relation which the species of fictitious entity called place has on the one hand to the fictitious entity called body on the other hand to the fictitious entity called space space may be distinguished into absolute and relative to absolute space there are no concervable bounds to relative space i e to portions of space separated from one or other by bodies there are in every instance bounds and those determinate ones as to the word place whether it be considered as the name of a real entity or as the name of a fictitious entity would be a question of words barely worth explanation and not at all worth debate considered as a modification of space it would like that stand upon the footing of the name of a real entity considered as a species  0  of relation it would stand upon the footing of a fictitious entity but in this latter case comes an objection viz that the relations which on that occasion are in question are not place itself or places themselves but such relations as belong to place be this as it may place is a relative portion of space considered either as actually occupied or as capable of being occupied by some real entity of the class of bodies portions of the earths surface are considered and denominated each of them a place but in this case the term place is used in the physical and geographical sense of the word not in an ontological sense whether in a physical sense place be or be not the name of a fictitious entity that in every psychical sense it is so seems manifest beyond dispute take for example the place occupied by such or such an idea in the mind by such or such a transaction in a narrative time—be it as it may in regard to place that the entity designated by the word time is but a fictitious entity will it is believed be sufficiently manifest different altogether from each other are the perceptions or ideas presented by the word place and the word time yet as often as time is spoken of it is spoken of as if it were a modification of or the same thing as place like place time or at least any given portion of time is spoken of in the character of a receptacle—as in such or such a place things are done in such or such a time things are done portions of space or place are long or short great or small—so are portions of time in the same sense we say a quantity of time or a space of time as bodies are spoken of as going to or from such or such a place so operations are spoken of as going on from and to such or such a portion of time but of every receptacle all the several parts are coexistent of any portion of time no two parts how small soever are coexistent of any given portion of time no two of the parts are coexistent with relation to each all are successive in the very import of the term coexistent the idea of unity is implied in respect of the portion of time supposed to be occupied in the import of the term succession that of diversity is of necessity implied motion—that the entity designated by the word motion is a fictitious entity seems at least equally beyond dispute a body the body in question is in motion here unless in motion be considered as an abbreviated expression substituted for in a state of motion as we say in a state of rest motion is a receptacle in which the body is considered as stationed the motion of this body is slow or is retrograde here the body is a stationary object—a station or startingpost of or from which the motion is considered as proceeding necessarily included in the idea of motion is the idea of place and time a body has been in motion—when in what case when having at or in one point of time been in any one place at another point of time it has been in any other of any and every corporeal real entity a similitude is capable of being exhibited as well in the form of a body for instance a model as in the form of a surface—as in painting or drawing or engraving which in every case is like the object represented a stationary permanent and unless by internal decay or external force an unchanging and unmoving object but by no such graphical similitude by no picture by no model by no stationary object can any motion be represented a representation of the body as it appeared in the place occupied by it at a point of time anterior to that at which the motion commenced a representation of the same body as it appeared in the place occupied by it at a point of time posterior to that at which the motion commenced in these two representations conjoined or separate may be seen all that can be done towards the representation of motion by any permanent imitative work even on the table of the mind in imagination in idea in no other way can any motion be represented there not being any real entity to represent the entity cannot be any other than fictitious the name employed for the purpose of representation cannot therefore be anything else than the name of a fictitious entity action—in the idea of action the idea of motion is an essential ingredient but to actual action actual motion can scarcely be regarded as necessary action is either motion itself or the tendency to motion under the term action besides motion a tendency though so it be without actual motion seems to be included held back by strings a magnet and a bar of iron suspended at a certain distance from each other remain both of them without motion cut the strings of either of them it moves till it comes in contact with the other but for the state of mutual action which preceded the cutting of the strings no such motion would have taken place passion reaction—among all the bodies large and small with which we have any the slightest acquaintance no instance it is believed can be found of action without passion nor of passion without reaction but without either of these accompaniments a conception of action may be entertained at any rate attention may be applied to it but if on either of two objects attention be capable of being bestowed without being bestowed upon the other the separate lot of attention thus bestowed affords sufficient foundation for a separate name here then are two more fictitious entities most nearly related and intimately connected with the fictitious entities action and motion having all of them for their common archetype  0  the same image or set of images viz that of a nutshell and nut a startingpost and a goal the representation of which is performed by the prepositions in of from c employed in connexion with their respective names section vi fictitious entities considered and denominated in respect of their concomitancy object subject end in view in the idea of an object the idea of some action or at any rate some motion seems to be constantly and essentially involved where the object is a corporeal entity it is a body towards which the body in motion moves this body whether permanently or momentarily stands objected i e cast before that other body which moves even in the case of vision in the instance of an object of sight the relation is naturally the same the only difference is that in the case of vision the moving bodies being the rays of light the object instead of being the body towards which is the body from which the motion takes place in the picture the tracing of which is the effect of the terms here in question the object is either on the same level with the source of motion or above it the subject as in its literal sense the word subject imports is below and under it in the case of human action—a motion real or fictitious considered as being produced by an exercise of the faculty of the will on the part of a sensitive being—this action has in every instance for its cause the desire and expectation of some good i e of some pleasure or exemption from some pain and the entity the good by which this desire has been produced is in this case if not the only object an object and indeed the ultimate object the attainment of which is in the performance of the action aimed at of entities thus intimately connected it is not to be wondered at if the conceptions formed and the names bestowed in consequence should frequently be indistinct in the designation of the same entity in the designation of which the word subject is employed the word object is at other times employed and so also in the designation of the same entity in the designation of which the words end in view are employed the word object is frequently also employed if in a case by which a demand is presented for the mention of a subject and an object so it happen that for the designation of the subject you employ the word object then so it will be that for the designation of that which may with propriety be termed the object but cannot with propriety be termed the subject finding the only proper word preoccupied you will naturally feel yourself at a loss in a case where the faculty of the will is not considered as having any part the designation of the end in view is a function in which any occasion for the employment of the word object cannot have place in this case therefore neither has the uncertainty which as above is liable to be produced by that word in a case where the will is supposed to be employed and in which there is accordingly an end in view one single end to the attainment of which by the power and under the orders of the will the action is directed in any such case what may very well happen is that there shall be other entities to which in the course of the action though not in the characters of ends in view it may happen to the attention to be directed here then besides an object which may be will be other objects no one of which can commodiously be designated by the compound appellation end in view in regard to the word subject as well as the word object one convenience is that it may be used in the plural number this convenience belongs to them in contradistinction to the word field for a group of numerous and comparatively small entities the word field will not either in the singular or in the plural conveniently serve but to this same purpose the word subject if employed in the plural is perfectly well adapted if beneath the imagined line of action you have need to bring to view not merely one extensive fictitious immoveable body but a multitude of smaller moveable bodies lying on it here comes an occasion for the use of both these terms viz field and subject or subjects the field is the extensive immoveable entity the subjects the comparatively numerous and less extensive bodies fixed or lying loose upon the surface of it in the place of the word field as well as in place of the word subject the words subjectmatter may be employed so also the plural subjectmatters but if in addition to an extensive surface you have to bring to view a multitude of smaller bodies stationed on it if in that case instead of the word field you employ the words subjectmatters you will find that you cannot commodiously after laying down your subjectmatter have subjects stationed on it in the case where the action in question is a physical a corporeal one a question might perhaps arise whether the entities respectively designated by the words subject and object belong to the class of real or fictitious entities a platform on which you stand to shoot an arrow a butt at which you shoot your arrow to these could not be refused the appellation of real entities but in so far as upon the platform you superinduce the character designated by the word subject and upon the butt the character designated by the word object of this subject and this object it might be insisted that they are but so many names of fictitious entities not that for any practical purpose a question  0  thus turning upon mere words would be in any considerable degree worthy of regard be this as it may in the case in which the action in question is an incorporeal a psychical action having no other field than the mind or than what is in the mind—in this case the title of the words subject and object as well as of the word field to the appellation of fictitious entities will be seen to be clear of doubt section vii concomitant fictitious entities resulting from the process of logical aggregation and division and subalternation it will be seen further on more at large how it is that when contemplating the qualities exhibited by individuals by abstracting the attention successively from them quality after quality let the group of individuals present past and future contingent included be ever so vast and multitudinous there will at last be left some quality or assemblage of qualities which being found all of them existing in a certain assemblage of individuals and not in any other may serve for the foundation of a name by which that whole assemblage may be designated without including in the designation any individual not included in that assemblage the words mineral vegetable animal may serve for examples wherever any such aggregate number of individuals can be found so connected with one another—so distinguished from all others and for the designation of the aggregate the fictitious unit composed of that multitude a name or appellation has been employed and appropriated by use the fictitious unit thus formed will be found capable of being divided by the imagination into lesser component aggregates or units—these again each of them into others and in this way the largest and first divided allcomprehensive aggregate will be found capable of being divided and subdivided into any number of aggregates not greater than the whole number of individuals actual and conceivable contained in the original factitious and fictitious whole—the name of each one of these component aggregates constituting as it were a box for containing and keeping together the several aggregates comprised in it the entire aggregate contained in each such box being characterized by some quality or qualities in respect of which being agreed with one another at the same time they disagree with and are thereby distinguished from all others kingdom class order genus species variety have been the names given to these boxes—to these factitious receptacles that it is to the class of fictitious and not to the class of real entities that these imaginary however really useful receptacles appertain is at this time of day sufficiently clear but the time has been when they have been mistaken for realities section viii political and quasi political fictitious entities i effects—  obligation   right   exemption   power   privilege   prerogative   possession—physical   possession—legal   property ii causes—  command   prohibition inhibition c   punishment   pardon   license   warrant   judgment   division all these have for their efficient causes pleasure and pain but principally pain in whatsoever shape and from which soever of the five sanctions or sources of pleasure or pain derived or expected viz—  the physical sanction   the sympathetic sanction or sanction of sympathy   the popular or moral sanction   the political including the legal sanction   the religious sanction† obligation is the root out of which all these other fictitious entities take their rise of all the sanctions or sources of pleasure and pain above brought to view the political sanction being susceptible of being the strongest and surest in its operation and accordingly the obligation derived from it the strongest and most effective this is the sanction which it seems advisable to take for consideration in the first instance the correspondent obligations of the same name which may be considered as emanating from these other fictitious entities being in the instance of some of these sanctions of too weak a nature to act with any sufficient force capable of giving to any of those other productions any practical value an obligation—understand here that sort of obligation which through the medium of the will operates on the active faculty—takes its nature from some act to which it applies itself it is an obligation to perform or to abstain from performing a certain act a legal obligation to perform the act in question is said to attach upon a man to be incumbent upon him in so far as in the event of his performing the act understand both at the time and place in question he will not suffer any pain but in the event of his not performing it he will suffer a certain pain viz the pain that corresponds to it and by the virtue of which applying itself eventually as above the obligation is created section ix fictitious entities appertaining to relation as between cause and effect in the idea of causation—in the idea of  0  the relation as between cause and effect—in the idea of the operation or state of things by which that relation is produced in which that relation takes its rise the idea of motion is inseparably involved take away motion no causation can have place—no result no effect no anything can be produced in the idea of motion the idea of a moving body is with equal necessity implied of the cases in which the existence of motion relative motion is reported to us by our senses there are some in which the commencement of the motion is others in which it is not manifest to our senses endless and terminating under one or other of these denominations may all motions observed or observable be included endless motions are those which have place among the bodies each of them considered in its totality of which the visible universe is composed to the class of terminating or terminative motions belong all those which have place in our planet and to judge from analogy all those which have place in any other of the celestial bodies so far as the motions in question belong to the endless class so far no such distinction and therefore no such relation as that of cause and effect seems to have place each body attracts towards it all the rest and were it to have place singly the attraction thus exercised might be considered as if it operated in the character of a cause but each body is attracted by every other and were it to have place singly the attraction thus suffered might be considered in the character of an effect but in fact the two words are but two different names for one and the same effect in the case of motions that have place among the distinct bodies with which the surface of our earth is covered action and causation are the phenomena exhibited by different bodies in the character of agents and patients in the case of the celestial bodies considered each in its totality no such distinction has place no such character as that of agent—no such character as that of patient belongs separately to any one they are each one of them agent and patient at the same time no one exhibits more of agency no one more of patiency than any other suppose that all these several bodies having been created out of nothing at one and the same instant each with the same quantity of matter and thence with the same attractive power that appears to belong to it at present an impulse in a certain rectilinear direction were to be given to each of them at the same time on this hypothesis it has been rendered it is said matter of demonstration that the sort of intermediate motions which would be the result would be exactly those which these same bodies are found by observation to exhibit here then we should have a beginning but even here we should not have an end in the beginning at a determinate point of time we should have a motion operating in the character of a cause but at no determinate point of time to the exclusion of any other should we have either a motion or a new order of things resulting from it and produced by it in the character of an effect thelematic and athelematic—to one or other of these denominations will all motions of the terminative class be found referable thelematic those in the production of which volition the mind of a sentient and selfmoving being is seen to be concerned athelematic those in the production of which volition is not seen to have place in the case of a motion of the thelematic class you have for the cause of the motion—meaning the prime cause of whatsoever motion happens in consequence to take place the psychical act the act of the will of the person by whose will the motion is produced you have that same person for the agent fruitful or unfruitful or say ergastic or unergastic—to one or other of these denominations will all the motions of the thelematic class be found referable ergastic or fruitful all those which have for their termination and result the production of a work unergastic or unfruitful all those which are not attended with any such result between these two classes the line of separation it will be manifest enough cannot in the nature of the case be determinate a work has reference to human interests and exigencies when in consequence of a motion or set of motions of the thelematic kind in the body or among the bodies in which the motion has terminated or those to which it has in the whole or in any part been communicated any such change of condition has place by which for any considerable portion of time they are or are not regarded as being rendered in any fresh shape subservient to human use a work is spoken of as having thereby been produced in so far as a work is considered as having been produced any agent who in respect of his active talent is regarded as having borne the principal part in the production of the work is wont to be spoken of under the appellation of an author or the author in this same case any body which is regarded as having in consequence of the motion communicated to it been rendered contributory to the production of the work is wont to be spoken of in the character and by the name of an instrument—any body viz inasmuch as considered as inanimate—an instrument in the physical sense if animated or considered as animated and in particular if regarded as rational—in the psychical sense if regarded as simple a tool or implement if regarded as complex an engine a machine—a system of machinery to the case and to that alone in which the  0  motion or motions being of the thelematic and therein moreover of the ergastic kind have had for their prime mover or principal agent concerned a rational or at least a sentient being belong the words end operation means design of the word end and its synonym the compound term end in view the exposition has been already given it consists in the idea of some good i e pleasure or exemption from pain in this or that shape or shapes as about eventually to result to the agent in question from the proposed act in question operation is a name given to any action in so far as it is considered as having been performed in the endeavour to produce a work the word means is a term alike applicable with propriety to the designation of body considered in the character of an instrument or any action or motion considered in the character of an operation tending to the production of a work or any good looked to in the character of an end productive and unproductive—under one or other of these denominations as the case may be may be referred the action in question in so far as where being of the thelematic and moreover of the ergastic kind it has for its end in view the bringing into existence any intended result in the character of a work productive and unproductive whether in actual result or only in tendency under one or other of these denominations may also be referred every motion or set of motions of the athelematic kind every motion or set of motions produced in by and upon such agents as are of the purely physical kind this distinction is applicable to all the three physical kingdoms but on the mention of it the two living kingdoms the vegetable and the animal will be most apt to present themselves in the use frequently made of the word cause may be seen an ambiguity which in respect of its incompatibility with any correct and clear view of the relation between cause and effect there may be a practical use in endeavouring to remove from the field of thought and language on the one hand a motion an action an operation on the other hand an agent an operator an author to the designation of both these in themselves perfectly distinct objects the words are wont to be indiscriminately applied take for example the questions that used to be agitated in the logical schools is the moon says one of them the cause or a cause of the flux and reflux of the sea here the moon here the word cause is employed to designate a corporeal being considered in the character of an agent the cause says a position of which frequent use was made in the same theatres of disputation the cause is always proportioned to its effect but between the moon itself and the tide i e the flux and reflux of the sea there cannot be any proportion they are disparate entities the one the moon a real entity the other the flux and reflux i e the motions of the sea are but fictitious entities between the moon itself and the water moved by it i e between the quantity of both proportion may have place between the motion and thence the action of the moon and the motion of the waters a proportion may have place but between the moon a body and the flux and reflux of the sea no proportion can have place neither can either be larger or smaller than the other in speaking of god it has been common to speak of that inferential being by such names as the cause of all things the great the universal cause in this instance the same sort of confusion the same sort of indistinctness in the expression the same consequent confusion in mens conception as in the case mentioned is apt to have place the act of god the will of god—these are the entities to the designation of which and which alone the term cause can in the case in question with propriety and consistently with analogy be employed these on the one hand and the word cause on the other are alike names of fictitious entities author and creator—these alone and not the word cause can with propriety be employed in speaking of god these as well as god are names of real entities not names of fictitious entities author a name applicable to man or in a word to any being considered as susceptible of design creator a term exclusively appropriated to the designation of god considered with reference to his works in the use commonly made of the terms work cause effect instrument and in the habit of prefixing to them respectively the definitive article the seems to be implied a notion of which the more closely it is examined the more plainly will the incorrectness be made to appear—this is that where the effect is considered as one there exists some one object and no more than one which with propriety can be considered as its cause of the exemplification and verification of this supposition there exists not perhaps so much as a single instance take in the first place an effect any effect of the physical kind—no effect of this kind can it is believed be assigned that is not the result of a multitude of influencing circumstances some always in different ways contributing to the production of it viz in the character of promoting and cooperating causes others frequently contributing to the nonproduction of it in the character of obstacles in relation to the result in question considered in the character of an effect suppose at pleasure any one body to be the prime or principal mover or agent and the motion the action or the operation of it to be the prime or principal cause  0  in no instance can any such cause be in operation but it will happen to it to be on all sides encompassed and surrounded by circumstances those circumstances will consist of the state of the contiguous and surrounding bodies in respect of motion or rest form colour quantity and the like among these some will appear to be exercising on the result a material operative influence others not to be exercising such influence influential and influencing circumstances uninfluential or uninfluencing circumstances in one or other of these two classes of circumstances taken together will every circumstance by which it can happen to the principal agent or agents to be encompassed be comprised promotive or obstructive—under one or other of these denominations may the whole assemblage of influential circumstances be comprised any circumstances that act that are considered as acting in the character of obstructive circumstances are termed in one word obstacles purely natural purely factitious and mixed—to one or other of these heads may every motion be referred considered with reference to the part which the human will is capable of bearing in the production of it solid liquid or gaseous—in one or other of these states at the time of the motion will the moving body be found the internal constitution of the moving body the internal constitution of the unmoveable or nonmoving bodies with which it comes in contact and the configuration of these same bodies—upon all these several circumstances or rather groups of circumstances must the nature of the ultimate effect produced by the motion be dependent—whether that effect be a purely physical result or a human work in so far then as by the term cause nothing more is meant to be designated than one alone of all those sets of cooperating circumstances be the effect what it may the cause can never of itself be adequate to the production of it nor between the quantum of the effect and the quantum of the cause can any determinate proportion have place but of the case in which in the extent given to the import attributed to the word cause the whole assemblage of these influencing circumstances is taken into the account and comprised it seems questionable whether so much as a single example would be to be found unless the above observations be altogether incorrect it will appear but too manifest that in the notions commonly attached to the word cause much deficiency in respect of clearness and correctness as well as completeness cannot but have place and that in the inferences made from either the one to the other whether it be the cause that is deduced or supposed to be deduced from the effect or the effect that is deduced or supposed to be deduced from the cause much uncertainty and inconclusiveness cannot but be a frequent not to say an almost constant and continual result seldom indeed does it happen that of the coinfluencing circumstances the collection made for the purpose is complete nor is it always that in such a collection so much as the principally influencing circumstances are included in those cases in which the several influencing circumstances are all of them subject not only to the observation but to the powers of human agency any such miscalculations and errors as from time to time happen to be made may when perceived from time to time be corrected thus it is for example in the case of observations that have for their field the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals thus it is moreover with little exception in the instance of the practical applications made of the respective theories of chemistry and mechanics the influencing circumstances being for the most part or even altogether subject and that at all times not only to our observations but to our command the cases in which our inferences from supposed causes to supposed effects and from supposed effects to supposed causes seem most precarious and exposed to error are—on the one hand cases belonging to the field of medicine on the other hand cases belonging to the field of naval architecture in cases belonging to the field of medicine the influencing circumstances belonging principally to the class of chemical phenomena—to those phenomena by which particular sorts of bodies are distinguished from each other lie in a great degree out of the reach of our observation in cases belonging to the field of naval architecture the influencing circumstances belonging principally to the class of mechanical phenomena—to those phenomena which belong in common to bodies in general may perhaps in specie be without much difficulty comprehended in their totality by observation but in respect of their quantity lie in a great measure beyond even the reach of observation and in a still greater degree are out of the reach of command prone as is the human mind to the making of hasty and imperfectlygrounded inductions on the field of physical science it cannot but be much more so in the fields of psychology and ethics in which is included the field of politics commonly not only is the collection made of influencing circumstances incomplete but uninfluencing circumstances and even obstacles are placed in the station of and held up to view in the character of principally or even exclusively operating causes thus superior is the density of the clouds which overhang the relation between cause and effect in the field of morals as compared with the field of physics two concurring   0 considerations may help us to account for this difference—  the elements of calculation being in so large a proportion of the phychical class—such as intentions affections and motives—are in a proportional degree situated out of the reach of direct observation   in the making of the calculation the judgment is in a peculiar degree liable to be disturbed and led astray by the several sources of illusion—by original intellectual weakness by sinister interest by interestbegotten prejudice and by adopted prejudice material formal efficient final—by these terms in the language of the aristotelian schools—by these terms in the higher forms of common language so many different species of causes are considered as designated neither incapable of being applied to practice nor of being ever applied with advantage these distinctions present in this place a just claim to notice the relation they bear to the foregoing exposition will now be brought to view matter and form—both these it has been seen are necessary to existence—meaning to real and that physical existence—the existence of a physical body   by material cause is indicated the matter of the body in question considered in so far as it is regarded as contributing to the production of the effect in question   by formal cause the form of the same body   by efficient cause must be understood in so far as any clear and distinct idea is attached to the term the matter of some body or bodies what is meant to be distinguished by it may in general be supposed to be the motion of that body or assemblage of bodies which is regarded as the principal motion—the motion which has the principal share in the production of the effect but to the production of the effect—meaning a physical effect—whatsoever it be a correspondent and suitable disposition of the circumjacent nonmoving bodies is not it has been seen less necessary than a correspondent and suitable motion or aggregate of motions on the part of the moving body to the designation of the matter and of the form that concurs in the production of the effect the language here in question is therefore we see adequate but to the designation of the other influencing circumstances we see how far it is from being adequate   by final cause is meant the end which the agent had in view meaning as hath been seen by the end if anything at all be meant by it the good to the attainment of which the act was directed—the good i e the pleasure or pleasures the exemption or security from such or such pain or pains it is therefore only in so far as the effect is the result of design on the part of a sensitive being a being susceptible of pains and pleasures—of those sensations which by us are experienced and known by the names of pleasures and pains that the species of cause here called final can have place the doctrine of final causes supposes therefore on the part of the agent in question the experience of pleasure and pain of pleasures and pains the same as those of which we have experience—for to us there are no others employed in any such attempt as that of designating and bringing to view the idea of any others they would be employed in designating and bringing to view so many nonentities section x existence and the classes of fictitious entities related to it existence is a quality the most extensively applicable and at the same time the most simple of all qualities actual or imaginable take away all other qualities this remains to speak more strictly take any entity whatsoever real or fictitious—abstract the attention from whatsoever other qualities may have been found belonging to it this will still be left existence is predicable of naked substance opposite to the idea of existence is that of nonexistence nonexistence is the negation of existence of every other entity real or fictitious either existence or nonexistence is at all times predicable whether such other entity be real or fictitious its existence is of course a fictitious entity i e the word existence is in all cases the name of a fictitious entity the idea of nonexistence is the idea of absence extended take any place and therewith any real entity—any body existing in that place suppose it no longer existing in that place you suppose its absence its relative nonexistence expel it in like manner from every from all place you suppose its absolute nonexistence it is through the medium of absence the familiar and continually recurring idea of absence that the idea of nonexistence the terrific the transcendant the awful and imposing idea of nonexistence is attained existence being as above a species of quality is itself a fictitious entity—it is in every real entity—every real entity is in it in it the man the object of whose appetite is the sublime and he the object of whose appetite is the ridiculous may here find matter for their respective banquets nothing has been laughed at to satiety the punster who has played with nothing till he is tired may renew the game with existence and nonexistence at any point of time in any place whatsoever take any entity any real entity whatsoever between its existence in that place and its nonexistence in that same place there is not any alternative there is not any medium whatsoever necessity impossibility certainty uncertainty     probability improbability actuality potentiality—whatsoever there is of reality correspondent to any of these names is nothing more or less than a disposition a persuasion of the mind on the part of him by whom these words are employed in relation to the state of things or the event or events to which these qualities are ascribed down to the present time whatsoever be this present time whether the time of writing this or the time of any ones reading it whatsoever has existed has had existence—whatsoever has not existed has not had existence at this time whatsoever does exist has existence—whatsoever does not exist has not existence and so at any and every future point of time throughout the whole expanse of time past present and future put together where will room be found for anything real to answer to any of these names quality itself is but a fictitious entity but these are all of them so many fictitious qualities they do not as real qualities—they do not like gravity solidity roundness hardness belong to the objects themselves to which they are ascribed—in the character of attributes of the objects to which they are ascribed they are mere chimeras mere creatures of the imagination—nonentities yet nonentities as they are but too real is the mischief of which some of them and in particular the word necessity has been productive—antipathy strife persecution murder upon a national upon an international scale the persuasion expressed by the word certainty has for its foundation the event itself simply the persuasion indicated by the word necessity has for its object not only that event but an infinity of other events and states of things out of number from the beginning of time in the character of its causes certainty necessity impossibility exhibited seriously in any other character than that of expressions of the degree of the persuasion entertained in relation to the subject in question by him whose words they are in the use of these words is virtually involved the assumption of omniscience all things that are possible are within my knowledge—this is not upon the list such being interpreted is the phrase this thing is impossible the sort of occasion on which without any such assumption these terms can be applied is that of a contradiction in terms—a selfcontradictory proposition or two mutually contradictory propositions issuing at the same time from the same mouth or the same pen but here the objects to which these attributes are with propriety applicable are not the objects for the designation of which the propositions are applied but the propositions themselves propositions thus contradictory and incompatible cannot with propriety be applied to the same object it is impossible that they should i e inconsistent with the notions entertained by the person in question in relation to what is proper and what improper in language it is impossible that among a multitude of bodies all equal to one another four taken together should not be greater than two taken together why because by the word four has by every person been designated a number greater than by the word two yet in affirmance of the truth of a proposition thus impossible persuasion rising to the highest pitch of intensity has been entertained why because the human mind having it in its power to apply itself to any object or to forbear to apply itself at pleasure the person in question has exercised this power in relation to the import of the words in question as above i e to the import which according to his experience all persons by whom they have been employed have been constantly in the habit of annexing to them but against an object which the mind has contrived to exclude out of the field of its attention no objection can in that same field be seen to bear whatsoever therefore were the considerations by which he was engaged to endeavour to persuade himself of the truth of the selfcontradictory and therefore impossible propositions remain without anything to counteract their force         essay on logic now first published from the manuscripts of jeremy bentham     note by the editor logic according to the acceptation in which the author seems to view the term evidently embraces a far wider range of subjects than can come under the general notion entertained of it—as a formal science having cognizance of the laws of thought to the exclusion of its matter of the extent of field which the author intended to embrace in a treatise on the subject—supposing him to have completed such a work according to his original conception of it—some idea may be formed from a perusal of chapter i the traces of an intention to fill up this great project in all its particulars may be found in several of the works published as separate essays—those on language and grammar for instance—where the word logic is written on the margin of the original ms in company with the more immediate subject of discussion as if it had been in the authors view after having severally completed these departments to unite the whole into a complete system of psychology the work which immediately follows is thus far from being complete it in short consists merely of those parts of the scattered materials which were most homogeneous and had the most direct bearing on logic as the author has defined it the art which has for its object the giving direction to the mind in pursuit of its purposes independently on the one hand of that examination of the powers of the human mind on which it might be founded and on the other of its application to the various purposes to which it may be used in some places a system of arrangement had been adopted by the author as to others there was internal evidence of the order he intended on some occasions however there were no means of discovering the order intended to be followed and an arrangement purely empirical was of necessity adopted from the dates marked on the mss the author seems to have devoted himself to his psychological works at four distinct periods in      from      to      in      and so lately as      it was not his practice in resuming a subject to revise what he had already written for the purpose of connecting with it the additions he might make to this circumstance must be attributed many of the abrupt transitions and the occasional repetitions which the reader may encounter with regard to the writers whose works were the received authorities on the subject of logic at the time when he wrote it was evidently far from the authors wish to give an exposition or a criticism on their method of treating the subject or even to profess any general acquaintance with logical literature his object was simply to give the world the results of his own ratiocination on the subject of logic according to the meaning he attached to the word there are a few criticisms on the aristotelian system which the reader must keep in view are made on the version of sanderson only and do not profess to embody any direct exposition of aristotles system part of the riches of these mss have already been given to the world in the outline of a new system of logic with a critical examination of dr whateleys elements of logic by george bentham esq the nephew of the philosopher it was benthams wish that his psychological works should be edited by his nephew and from the attention he has paid to the subject it is to be regretted that circumstances interfered to prevent that gentleman from complying with the request         introduction of this work the parent hints were drawn from the logic of aristotle viz bishop sandersons compend of it in the years    0 or      to      or      when the author was a youth or rather a child at queens college in the university of oxford of the notions therein exhibited some he found continually applicable and applicable with advantage to ordinary practice these treasured themselves up in his mind aristotle—the works of his predecessors in the same line though the existence of them has by frequent incidental allusion of his been made known to us being lost is with reference to us the father of the art called logic the sole fountain of everything that has ever been presented or ever can be presented to our minds under that imposing name in such accounts as will here be given of this art considered in the state in which it has been found by the present work it may naturally enough be expected that the text of aristotle should from first to last be the object of reference but with a view to use in relation to this as in relation to every other art the material and only material question is what is that which is written not who is he that wrote it two thousand years and more have already elapsed since the works of aristotle and in particular those which have taken for their subject the field of logic were made public in all that length of time unless the last century or century and a half be regarded as constituting an exception the making the most and the best of this art and of the labours of the ingenious founder of it has afforded occupation to some of the acutest minds that england or europe has produced by many of them if not much has been added to the quantity of matter elaborated by aristotle not a little has been done towards the rendering it plainer and more easily comprehensible by the pupil in the instance of this as of any other branch of art for use it is to the most instructive work which the field happens to afford and not the most ancient that a man whose wish is to make himself more or less acquainted with it will if his mind be not absolutely enslaved by prejudice always betake himself it is to the works of davy or dalton or thomson that a man will betake himself for instruction in chemistry not to those of van helmont or paracelsus in the british isles not a few are the works which at different times have been published with the professed design of serving for compendiums of instruction in this art in the university of oxford queens college used to be and for aught the author of these pages has heard to the contrary continues to be regarded as the college in which it has been cultivated with greatest success in this college the compendium written in latin by sanderson who in the days of charles the first and second was bishop of lincoln used to be and it is supposed continues to be the classical work—the work which was taken for the text by the tutor on the occasion of his lectures to his pupils considered as a methodical abridgment of what aristotle and his earliest commentators the greek logicians have left us on this subject it is at any rate the most copious it is supposed to be the most correct complete and upon the whole the most instructive in relation to this or that point suppose the account given by sanderson be not a perfectly exact copy of that delivered by aristotle what matters it if it be not exactly the same the presumption is that it is better at the end of so many centuries employed in the endeavour to render the account given of this art better than the account given by aristotle the expectation is it in regard to any point a natural one that instead of being better it will be found worse sandersons compendium is accordingly the work to which as often as the question may happen to present itself what on this point has been said by aristotle and by the school of aristotle reference will be made sandersons compendium is accordingly the work from which should any supposed imperfections be found in that system the exemplification and proof of such imperfection will be deduced meantime what is far from impossible is that in this or that instance an imperfection which in this way through the medium of this his english disciple comes to be imputed to the master would if justly chargeable be found chargeable not on the master but only on this disciple but should this sort of injustice such as it is chance now and then to be committed—not that this is any more than a mere supposition for the purpose of the argument—what would it matter where would be the practical mischief for one who for instruction resorts all along or even to any considerable extent to the original some dozen or some     score will never look further than to this or some other—most probably to this the most instructive—compendium taking the original for its subject the strictest comment would be a comment not on the art but on the language if on the occasion of any such imperfections reference were made not to the greek original but to this or that greek or latin commentator or abridger volumes and volumes might thus be written and none of them of any use in the sense above brought to view the logic of aristotle may be said to have formed the basis of this work in that storehouse of instruction the author found at any rate a considerable number of the tools or instruments which he has had to work with but though such was the assistance derived from the great philosopher of old the author—never at any time never in any instance did it occur to him to consider the opinion or discourse of that philosopher any more than of any one else as the standard or criterion of truth the human mind viz his own mind—that being the only mind open to any mans immediate observation—was the source from which aristotle drew the instruction for which we are indebted to his ingenious labours his own mind was in like manner the source whence the author of the present work drew those notions which it is the object and the endeavour of this work to communicate to and tranfuse into such other minds as may find themselves disposed to receive it truth is never capable of being so clearly or strongly impressed when considered by itself as it is capable of being when illustrated by a view of any opposite error or errors by which its place has been wont to be occupied this system of aristotle is the system by and according to which whatsoever has been taught under the name of logic has now for upwards of two thousand years been taught and through by far the greater part of that time it has been considered as being in a state of absolute perfection little if at all capable of receiving improvement and not in any degree susceptible of amendment—of amendment in any of its three modes viz omission addition and substitution by whomsoever the present sketch is looked into and considered if aristotles system of logic in so far as it is delivered in the first chapter of bishop sandersons compendium of that art and science be looked into at the same time and compared with it very different to a considerable extent will the two volumes be seen to be at the very first glance the account which in this work is given of logic in regard to its nature and business is before the reader if the extent given to it in that account be not in a considerable part improper and irrelevant the extent given to it by the aristotelians will be seen to be incomplete of the topics that presented themselves as appertaining to the art appertaining to it in such sort that supposing any one omitted the account would pro tanto have been incomplete the list is before the reader if this list be a correct one that given by the aristotelians will be seen to be an incongruous one on the one hand deficient on the other hand redurdant in the art and science of logic two branches may be distinguished the tactical and the dialectic the tactical that which teaches the arrangement which for whatsoever purpose requires to be given to ideas the dialectic that which for a particular purpose gives arrangement to them in their quality of materials of discourse to wit of the disputatious kind in the works of aristotle the fountain whence all ideas respecting logic have been hitherto derived the tactic was scarcely considered in any other light than that of an instrument employed in carrying on the disputatious branch—the war of words being a sort of interlude by which men of superior minds amused themselves in the intermission of the war of arms of late years and by no means without reason the dialectic has been as to the greater part of it an object of neglect the tactic being the main instrument in the hands of art of invention to whatsoever subjectmatter applied can never deservedly be so so long as man is man on the present occasion the precedence as between the two may be determined by these observations in the first place will come the tactical branch in the next will come the application made of it on occasion of the exercise given to the dialectic in speaking of logic as an art according to the definition of the aristotelians i find myself obliged to add to the word art the word science for the truth is that howsoever clearly distinguishable in idea the two objects art and science in themselves are not in any instance found separate in no place is anything to be done but in the same place there is something to be known in no place is anything to be known but in the same place there is something to be done to the presenting in conjunction with each other as well as either of them without the other the idea which the word art is employed to signify and the idea which the word science is employed to signify the latin word discipline is correctly and admirably well adapted unfortunately though so perfectly coincident in respect of its original and so near to perfect coincidence in sound and appearance yet in respect of its established and at present customary import the correspondent english word discipline presents no equal aptitude†     great however would be the convenience strong the light thrown upon the whole field of human power if instead of the composite and frequently perplexing locution art and science or science and art the men of modern times could prevail upon themselves to employ the simple as well as classical term discipline discipline would then be the name of the genus art and science the name of the species included in it chapter i logic—what section i definition here given of logic—its amplitude justified logic in the sense in which the word will throughout the whole tenor of this work be employed may be defined the art which has for its object or end in view the giving to the best advantage direction to the human mind and thence to the human frame in its pursuit of any object or purpose to the attainment of which it is capable of being applied that of all definitions that have been or can be given of this art this is the most extensive seems upon the face of it to be sufficiently manifest that it is the most useful will it is believed be no less so for it is in this modern definition alone and not in any preceding one that its relation to practical use in any shape has been directly held up to view that it is the most proper will at the same time appear from the account given of logic by those who were the first to hold it up to view in the character of an art and that an attainable one in a word by its inventors viz aristotle and his followers not to speak of his at present almost unknown predecessors for to the extent to be given to an art a more unexceptionable standard of propriety can scarcely be found than that if any which has been ascribed to it by its inventors in the present instance true it is that in the definition given of it in form the extent assigned to it falls considerably short of the extent here assigned to it as above but as will also be seen in the course of an observation by which that definition is immediately followed the deficiency is made up an extent is assigned to it much more ample than that which is given to it by their definition an extent little if anything short of that extent ascribed to it as above in the present work according to this account of it it may here naturally enough be objected an institute of the art of logic and a complete encyclopædia—at any rate if the encyclopædia be a methodical one—are one and the same thing this work if it be what it professes to be is therefore an encyclopædia and that a complete as well as a methodical one answer—to entitle itself to the appellation of a complete one true it is that any institute of logic and therefore this cannot have left altogether unvisited any portion whatever of the field of art and science no nor of the whole field of human thought and action but of every part of that field an encyclopædia may with perfect propriety give a complete survey whereas that which in relation to that same field comes within the purview of the present work consists of no more than a general outline including together with its principal divisions here and there a hint such as may happen to be suggested by a comparative and birdseye view and thence in some sort a commanding view for the more advantageous culture of it in relation to some of the principal points in company with the view here given of the art will be presented those which have been left to us by the aristotelians in this way mutual light it is hoped will be thrown upon each other by the two sketches and the extent as well as direction of the progress made should any be found to have been made by the modern one will be the more clearly discernible as to its field or subject the subject on which its operations are performed it is neither more nor less than the entire field of human thought and action in it is accordingly included the whole field of art and science in it is moreover included the field of ordinary i e unscientific thought and ordinary i e unartificial action or say practice including together with the whole contents of these respective fields—viz all the subjects not only of human action but of human thought—all entities not only real but fictitious not only all real entities but all fictitious ones that have ever been feigned or remain capable of being feigned fictitious entities those necessary products of the imagination without which unreal as they are discourse could not scarcely even could thought be carried on and which by being embodied as it were in names and thus put upon a footing with real ones have been so apt to be mistaken for real ones on the one hand artificial action or practice and scientific thought on the other hand ordinary unartificial practice and ordinary or unscientific thought under these two divisions taken together the whole field of human thought as well as the whole field of   0 human action cannot it is evident fail of being included what distinguishes this art and science from every other branch of art and science is that in its field of action are contained the several fields of action of all those other branches of art and science in the field of action of this discipline are included the several fields of action of all those other disciplines by its generality its amplitude and nothing else does it stand distinguished from the aggregate of those same disciplines of the observations which respectively apply to the subject of those several disciplines those which are most general may be referred to the head of logic in no quarter therefore are those boundaries fixed by which the field of logic is separated from the respective fields of those several other and subject disciplines thus in government the territorial field of the dominion of the sovereign is composed of the territorial fields of the dominion of the several individual and particular landowners section ii norrower and more common acceptations of the word logic of the field of exercise belonging to this masterart the allcomprehensiveness on the supposition that the definition above given of it is a proper one will upon examination it is believed be sufficiently manifest in it will be found comprehended not only all science and every art that can go by the name of art or science but every other subject of contemplation or occupation to which it is possible for the human faculties under the guidance of human reason to be applied every occupation including the most common and unartificial as well as the most extraordinary of those occupations by which the measure of human life is filled up in no such comprehensive nor indeed in any steady point of view does it appear to have ever hitherto been considered by the aristotelians it has been described in the same breath as comprehending the field of science alone and as comprehending that same field with the addition of the field of art in the narrowest of all the acceptations in which it has been employed it is neither more nor less than the art of disputing in mood and figure in a somewhat more enlarged sense it has been employed to denote the art of disputation in whatsoever manner carried on when to the whole art this amplitude is assigned that which has just been mentioned has been considered as a modification of it and has been styled the logic of the schools or school logic meaning by schools those which in the middle ages were kept for the teaching of this art according to the principles laid down by aristotle in general by those who employ it a signification considerably more extensive but still undeterminate is frequently attributed to it arrangement for example—arrangement and definition appear commonly enough to be considered as belonging to it in so far as these operations—operations thus extensively useful have been considered as belonging to it it could not but have been considered as ministering or at least capable of being made to minister to the occasions of science in general and even of art not to speak of those of common life but forasmuch as by the followers of aristotle if not by aristotle himself the art of disputing in mood and figure seems to have been considered as the ultimate object of pursuit and study—arrangement definition and in general all other portions of the art and applications made or capable of being made of it being considered and represented as no more than accessory and ministerial to that principal and in those days practical use hence it is that if the amplitude ascribed to it by the above definition be not excessive and unwarrantable the most extensive conception which as yet it has been usual to form of it may be stated to be inadequate section iii relation as between logic and metaphysics whatever were said of logic would be not simply but perniciously imperfect if in conjunction with it something were not said of metaphysics between the imports that have been respectively given to these two words no one to whose cognisance they have ever presented themselves can be unapprized that there exists a very near relation by no one it is believed has any endeavour been employed for exhibiting any correct idea of what that relation is of the word metaphysics the origin is still to be seen in aristotle in his works what it was employed to denote was not the nature of this branch of art or science to which it gave a name but merely the relation in respect of priority and posteriority which in the collection of his works the work in which he treated of this branch of art or science happened to bear to the works in which he treated of physics another meaning and though recondite rather a more characteristic one may have been—the branch of art or science upon which the mind will not in any natural course have entered until it have touched upon that which is called physics nor indeed without having passed over or at least passed through that branch when looked at that treatise turns out to have for its subject neither more nor less than a few terms of the most general i e most extensive and at the same time the most frequently exemplified import of any which language affords existence contingency possibility necessity may serve as examples upon this view of the matter it turns out     that in its original import this branch of art or science was neither more nor less than a sprig and that but a small one of the branch termed logic forming but a minute portion of it not only according to the extent ascribed to it as above in the present work but according to the so much narrower extent ascribed to it as above by the aristotelians within this last century or two the word has received an import of which it may in general terms be said that it is much more extensive but which is in the highest degree vague and indeterminate it seems difficult to know what account to give of it otherwise than from the various reproaches which from divers and various classes of writers have been cast upon it religionists lawyers politicians fashionable sentimentalists and poets have under the name of metaphysics found something which has appeared to them to thwart their views opinions interests or prejudices and against which they have accordingly used their endeavours to cover it with reproach and bring it into disrepute of the art or science of logic one and that one the most immediate use is the establishment of clear and determinate ideas in relation to whatsoever discourse we employ on any subject of importance the taking care that to such discourse the ideas we attach shall be clear and determinate ones and in so far as in the language employed in the course of their converse with us by others any deficiency in this essential quality becomes observable to employ our endeavours by apt questions to clear it from whatever clouds of obscurity or ambiguity it may happen to be involved the words employed and the compounds formed of them in the shape of propositions—in one or other of these classes of objects may be seen the source of every instance of error or perplexity—every cause of deception to which discourse can give rise if it be in the structure of the propositions or in the sort of connexion given to them that the imperfection has or is supposed to have its source logic in which grammar may be considered as included is the name of the art or science by which alone the remedy if obtainable can be obtained if it be in the import attached to the words taken singly sometimes it is to logic sometimes it is to metaphysics that any endeavours to remedy it are referred voluntary or involuntary—whosoever harbours a favourite error which it would pain him to see exposed beholds in logic or metaphysics or both an object of antipathy and terror from the adverse current of these affections logic being under that its name defended not only by the authority of the most admired of the philosophers of antiquity but of those reverend persons from whose lips instruction in its highest and most polished forms is imbibed—metaphysics is commonly the butt against which the chief force of these hostile affections is directed chapter ii logic its characteristics section i general view of the characteristics   aristotles list—in the character of an appendage to the definition of the word logic the aristotelians have brought to view a cluster of abstract terms which had presented themselves as in some way or other appertaining to it and as promising to contribute to the explanation of the nature of the art defined by it præcognita de naturâ logicæ is the title prefixed to the first chapter in the compendium of sanderson in which the definition of logic with these explanations subjoined to it is contained though taken in detail the mode of execution has appeared as will be seen susceptible of considerable amendments the design has been regarded as highly useful and of the sketch therein contained that which here follows though not a copy will be seen to be an imitation or at any rate a sketch executed on a plan of which the general idea and some of the principal lines were derived from that source   uses utilitates   end in view finis   functions officia   object objectum   subject subjectum as exhibited in six modifications   parts partes of which three in number are brought to view such is the list of the characteristics of logic as exhibited by sanderson and other compendialists exhibited though not under that or any other common appellative unless the word præcognita things foreknown be taken for that appellative   general end in view the attainment of which the art of logic keeps or ought to keep in view   field of exercise appertaining to this art   operations to which it is capable of giving direction and assistance   faculties to which it gives direction and assistance   instrument viz language employed in giving direction and assistance to these same faculties in the performance of these same operations   functions to the exercise of which in relation to other arts and sciences it is capable of giving direction and assistance   uses to which it is applicable such is the list of the articles which under that same name of the characteristics of the art will by means of the explanations respectively given in relation to them be under these same denominations employed in the explanation of it section ii characteristic the first end in view or ultimate object of logic the pursuit of every art being a course of action and in the instance of man as in that     of every other sensitive creature wellbeing being in some shape or other the end of every action it is not in the nature of the case that for the ultimate end the particular art here in question should not have this for its object wellbeing which considered as having existence during any given portion of past time will always have been directly as the magnitude of the aggregate of the pleasures of all sorts experienced during that portion of time and inversely as the magnitude of the aggregate of pains of all sorts experienced during that same portion of time such is the explanation which how premature soever it may seem it seemed advisable to give lest though it were but for a moment any the least cloud should hang over the import of so important an appellative wellbeing but is not this it may be asked the end in view the ultimate as well as direct and immediate object of another and very different branch of art or science distinguished by a separate and a different name viz ethics undoubtedly but by being the object the ultimate object of that other art it is not the less truly and properly so of the one in question as every action whatsoever so must every art for art is but an aggregate of actions have this for its object—have this same common result viz wellbeing for its ultimate object if ethics have this for its object so has medicine for example—so has cookery and this same result logic in so far as it can with propriety be said to be of any use may likewise with equal propriety be said to have for its object meaning for its ultimate object if in the pursuit of wellbeing it be the province of ethics to take the direction of human conduct in that same pursuit it is the province of logic to take the command and give direction to the course of ethics itself from having his generals under him the commanderinchief has not the less command of the army committed to his care logic like every other branch of art and science in a word like everything else is not any otherwise nor any further deserving of regard than in so far as it is capable of being of use but of use in any intelligible sense neither can this nor anything else ultimately be any further than it has been or is capable of being conducive to the diminution of pain in some shape or other or to the increase of pleasure be that as it may assuredly it is not on any other account that it will ever be taken for the subject of consideration in any part of the present work in this instance as in every other the usefulness and value of art and science in every shape depending altogether upon their conduciveness and subserviency to this universal end so in the comprehensive sketch which will further on be given of the field of art and science it is from this tendency to a common end that the connecting principle or common bond of relation by which the several arts and sciences are connected with each other will be viewed and from this common bond of connexion will be deduced such a plan of encyclopædical arrangement as should naturally be more instructive and as such more interesting than any which has hitherto made its appearance after a sketch taken upon this principle if dryness and uninterestingness continue to be as hitherto they seem to have been generally numbered among the properties of this art it will at any rate be not in respect of the end to which it is directed but in respect to the principles and plan observed in treating of it section iii characteristic the second field of exercise appertaining to this art the definition of this art being given as above the field of its exercise has been already given within it is contained the field of every other art the field of every science the field in a word of every occupation such alone excepted if such there be to the exercise of which in the most advantageous manner no exertion of mental power is either necessary or in any way conducive the word field having to the purposes of logic been found of special and superior use while at the same time other terms there are which have also been employed to these same purposes a few words to show the title it has to preference here may perhaps not be found altogether ill bestowed sphere circle subjectmatter subject—in these four will be found comprehended it is believed a complete list of these its rivals as to the word sphere on many occasions it may no doubt be employed without much difference in the article of convenience it labours however under considerable disadvantages   being borrowed from astronomy it is apt to present to view as often as employed the idea of that abstruse and irrelevant science and thereby to diffuse over every subject in which it is employed a considerable degree of abstractness and add difficulty to difficulty—thickening the obscurity which unavoidably and perpetually overhangs the nomenclature of logic which is sufficiently thick without any additional shade to thicken it   a field is susceptible of corners and in a word of every variety of shape and to the number of describable sources of division according to which it is capable of being parcelled out there is no limit a sphere has no corners     and to the number of sources of division according to which it is capable of being subjected to division there are determinate limits   the fields of the several arts and sciences parcel of the general field of art and science and of the still more complex field of human occupation are with reference to one another contiguous and mutually coincident and may upon some if not upon all occasions be considered as situated on the same level but amongst the objects presented to view by the word sphere there cannot be any such mutual coincidence or contiguity and when spoken of on the same occasion some are higher others are lower or inferior   the field of art and science is capable of extension and is continually receiving it and the greater the extension it receives the greater there seems reason to believe—the greater cæteris paribus—is the quantity of wellbeing possessed by the aggregate of mankind of no such property as extension in particular parts is a sphere susceptible—if it be so extended it ceases to be spherical a circle is a word that is more or less exposed to the same inconveniences to the last of them in a more practically pernicious degree the circle of the sciences is a phrase to which in former days much importance was attached and which continues in frequent use of the emblem thus employed what are the practical inferences that in the track of science no advance can be made that by every foot that enters upon the circle the track taken can be no other than that which was travelled in by its predecessors—that a man may go round and round and when he has gone as far as it is possible for him to go he will find himself at the point from which he set out subjectmatters and subjects—as to these expressions they are not pregnant with any such delusive allusions as above but they do not come up to the purpose in question and there is another purpose for which they are in demand field is wanted for the designation of the whole of the expanse fields in the plural are seldom wanted subjectmatter and subject are wanted for the expression of this or that particular article considered as situated on or within the compass of this or that field accordingly in the plural number as well as in the singular there is a continual demand for these words by the word subject the idea conveyed is that of a moveable solid capable of being viewed and handled in all imaginable directions—by the word field that of a portion of an immoveable whole of which the surface alone is capable of being thus dealt with real entities and fictitious entities—to one or other of these denominations will be found referable everything which with reference to this art can be considered as comprised under the denomination of a subject section iv characteristic the third operations to the performance of which logic is capable of affording direction and assistance relation of this characteristic to the preceding ones as to the several operations which the human mind is capable of performing in that field in pursuit of the abovementioned general end or any of its modifications and therein in pursuit of any subordinate ends considered as capable of serving in relation to it in the character of a means—whatsoever be the subject in relation to which action is required the following operations will be found capable of being performed in relation to it—operations all of them contributing or tending to the attainment of the abovementioned general end in so far as the discipline the art or the science the practice or act in question is in its nature in any shape applicable to that end when these are considered as so many species of operations to the due and apt and successful performance of which the art called logic is capable of being rendered subservient this topic—the topic of mental operations—is considered as susceptible of being applied to the several subjects of the same art as abovementioned and in that respect is considered in what in opposition to abstracted or abstract has been called a concrete or practical point of view a different point of view which under the name of abstract has this instant been spoken of is that in which the operations performable are considered as corresponding to so many faculties of the human frame by or by means of which they are performable on which occasion the same denomination is capable of serving and accordingly has in great measure been made to serve for the operation itself and the faculty—the fictitious part or member of the mind—by or by means of which the operation has been considered as being and to be performed these operations being so many modes or species of action which is itself but a mode of motion possess a sort of half reality and the names of them belong accordingly to a class of names which regard being had to names of substances—the only real entities—may as will be observed in another place stand distinguished by the names of semireal entities but as to the several correspondent faculties these belong to the class of purely fictitious entities feigned in virtue of an irresistible demand for the purposes of discourse a motion has a something next to real that corresponds to it and of which indication is given by its name viz the path taken by the moving body at the time during which it is said to be in motion considered as distinct     from the mind itself a faculty is an object manifestly altogether void of real existence the name of it is the name of a purely nominal and fictitious object framed for the purpose of holding up to view the imaginary cause or productive instrument of some real effect the word which is the name of it is not indicative of anything but the operation which when called into exercise it performs if it be an active faculty or the impressions which if it be a passive faculty it receives of the several distinguishable mental operations to which the art of logic may in one way or other be found capable of affording direction and assistance so great is the multitude of the whole number of operations in which the human mind is capable of bearing a part there not being one to which from this source direction and assistance is not in one way or other capable of being lent so ample is the number and so great the variety that for bringing to view the points in which they agree together with those in which they disagree and thus presenting a clear and distinct idea of the nature and differential character of each it will be necessary to distribute them into distinct groups or classes which in the course of the following pages will be brought to view placing first those which being most simple require not for their explanation anything to be said of the others and so on mental operations class i—operations in the performance of which the subject is considered as being regarded entirely i e in an entire state and at the same time singly i e not in conjunction with others without regard to past or future time and without regard to any person other than the person himself by whom the operation is considered as performed   perception conception apprehension when perception has place the source or perceptible object from which it is derived being an individual portion of matter or real corporeal entity—a body coming under the denomination of body—of a body—impressions are at the time in question made on sense—on some one or more of all of the senses to the cognizance of which the object stands exposed of the perception thereupon obtained these impressions are the immediate object and subject the body itself i e the existence of it is but in a secondary and comparatively remote way the object or subject of perception of this supposed source of the perceptions that are experienced the existence is strictly speaking rather a subject of inference than of perception of inference judgment ratiocination which is liable to be erroneous and in experience is very frequently found to be so scarcely does a perception take place but it is accompanied—accompanied generally without any consciousness of because without any reflection on without any attention paid to it—by a correspondent judgment or act of the judgment faculty at the time when the perception takes place the mind may either be more or less active or purely passive in relation to it it is only in so far as it is more or less active that any operation can with propriety be said to be performed if the mind be purely passive the perception is the work of the simply perceptive a branch of the intellectual faculty if in any mode or degree the mind be active in so far the will—the volitional faculty bears a part in the production of it conception is a word which is frequently employed to express the same import as the word perception would be employed to express in common usage the distinction is altogether indeterminate where any purposed distinction is observed it is to the word conception that the largest and most complex sense seems commonly to be assigned while impressions only are considered as the objects of perception conception is considered as having for its objects ideas simple ideas the copies of these impressions—the things signified by the signs of which discourse is composed ex gr the import of entire propositions—of a discourse composed of such propositions in any multitude or even that of single words in this word intimation is given of a certain degree of complexity in the object denoted by it by the natural effect of the first syllable by the word apprehension at least if its etymology be considered intimation is conveyed not only of action activity but of some certain degree of exertion of effort prehendo—apprehendo to lay hold of   attention—this operation as the etymology of the word intimates has place in so far as by an act by a more or less continued exertion of the will and the psychological active faculty its servant the mind is as it were fastened upon the object or subject from which a perception or conception is derived to it tendo to stretch—attendo to stretch upon mental operations class ii—operations in the performance of which the subject whether taken entire or not—taken in conjunction with others or not and whether with or without regard to any person other than the person himself by whom the operation is considered as performed is considered with regard to past time   remembrance   retention   recollection   recalling or revocation to memory   reminiscence these words are either synonymous or want little of being so the slight shades of difference by which they may be found to be distinguishable are not for the present purpose worth attending to the sort of fictitious psychological entity called the memory is regarded as a kind of receptacle in which perceptions of all sorts that     have ever been experienced are in any number lodged as likewise whatsoever thoughts have by composition or decomposition been formed out of these materials are capable of finding a place so long as on the occasion of the entrance of the object in question into this receptacle or of its continuance therein or recession out of or reemanation from it no effort on the part of the volitional faculty is considered as taking place no such word as operation can with propriety be employed in speaking of it mental operations class iii—operations in the performance of which objects or subjects more than one are considered as being at the same time present to the mind   judgment   decision   determination   comparison   examination when upon and after examination and comparison made of any two or more of the objects that have presented themselves to the mind any inference is made or conclusion come to in relation to them by it a judgment is thereby said to have been formed and passed—an act of the judicial faculty exercised—an operation of the judicial faculty performed decision and determination are with no less frequency and propriety applied to operations of the volitional than to those of the judicial faculty decision from decido compounded of de off and cædo to cut—is a word that represents the mind as if cutting off at a certain point the thread of examination and thereby cutting short the intellectual process determination from de off and terminus a term or boundary intimates that with reference to the object in question whatever chain of examination has been carried on has been brought to an end as to judgment when the word is employed to designate an operation considered by itself the operation is not an act of any other than the judicial faculty it is not an act of the volitional faculty but the giving expression to this or to any other act of the judicial faculty is an act of the volitional faculty—even the applying to the subject or subjects in question the faculty of attention for the purpose of forming a judgment on or in relation to them this is an act of the volitional faculty another object which the word judgment is in use to be employed to signify is the discourse whatsoever it be which on the occasion in question has been the product of the operation so performed by the faculty so denominated as to examination a notion that may be apt to present itself on the subject of this word is that on the occasion of the operation expressed by it the presence of more than one object in the mind at the same time is not necessary applied to an object considered as entire the observation may be correct but an examination of any object can hardly it should seem with propriety be spoken of as made unless the mind have applied itself to the parts of the object or some of them it is only in this way that the import of the word examination can be distinguished from that of the word attention mental operations class iv—operations in the performance of which the subject being such as presents a number of perceptions viz impressions or ideas or both together in conjunction the mind in the first place decomposes what it finds thus composed taking for consideration from the group any one or more of its component elements presenting them to itself or not presenting them to itself at any subsequent point of time either by themselves or in an order and mode of conjunction different from that in which as above they presented themselves in the first instance   abstraction in or by this operation among the impressions or ideas presented in conjunction by an object whether present to sense or only present to recollection and accordingly presenting a group of impressions or presenting nothing more than a group of ideas corresponding to and derived from the group of impressions presented by it while present the mind by its apprehensive faculty lays hold of some one alone or some other part of the whole number leaving the rest unnoticed thus for instance in the case of an apple applied to the touch alone the impressions and ideas it gives birth to are those of the external configuration the degree of smoothness or roughness the consistence in respect of hardness and softness presented to the eye the impressions and ideas it gives birth to are those of shape as before with the addition of colour to the smelling those of the particular odour of the fruit to the taste the particular flavour in so far as any one of these impressions or ideas is rendered present to the mind and becomes the subject or object of perception or thought or attention without being accompanied with the rest the mental operation called abstraction has place   imagination in so far as a number of these fragmentitious ideas formed by abstraction are put together by the mind and formed into new compounds into compounds which either do not exist in nature or have not as yet presented themselves to the mind of the person in question in and by the means of a body already existing in nature the operation whereby this effect is produced is styled imagination and in consideration and in respect of it a correspondent faculty is considered as having existence—a faculty termed the imaginative faculty or more shortly by the same name as that given to the operation itself—viz imagination thus taking from the fruit of the appletree its shape and at the same time from any piece of the metal called gold its weight colour and consistency imagination formed the golden     apple the produce of the garden of the hesperides   invention—in so far as any product formed as above by the imagination has received or is considered as receiving a fixed description or as serving as a guide to active talent or practice in such sort as in the pursuit of some particular end to produce effects either new or produced in any respect to greater advantage than before the operation is called invention mental operations class v—operations on the occasion of which a number of entire objects whether masses of matter or assemblages of ideas are present to the mind at the same time   designation—simple or individual denomination for the performance of this operation the conjunct presence of a number of objects not greater than two suffices the object to which a name is to be attached and the name which is to be attached the designand or object which is considered as requiring to be denominated and the designation or sign which—when sufficiently associated and connected with it when lodged in the mind in contact with it for a sufficient length of time and thus called up in conjunction with it with a sufficient degree of frequency—is found by experience to contract as it were a sort of adhesion to it in such sort that when by the person in question the sign being called up out of the memory is detained by the attention the idea of the object signified is thereby rendered present and is continued in that state so long as the sign is present in that same state a sign of this sort by which one individual object and no more is designated is what has been termed by grammarians a proper name   denomination—or say commoncollective or generic denomination in so far as the sort of operation thus designated and denominated has place the same sign is made to designate and upon occasion render present to the mind two or any greater number of individual objects two or any greater number of individual objects by whichsoever of the two faculties of the mind the memory or the imagination are rendered present to it thus while the human species contained but one individual viz adam individual designation was the only operation of this class which an intelligent and conversing being such as an angel or devil having occasion to designate him could have occasion to employ in the designation of him but no sooner had eve received a separate existence than the occasion for denomination i e collective designation or denomination came into existence a name such as should be capable of designating the species which by the addition of this second individual was now formed one species was then already in existence at the same time the two sorts of subordinate species or rather two species at once viz the two species formed together by the difference in respect of sex received already a sort of potential existence—were already formed in potentia at the birth of cain the species corresponding to the male sex received an actual existence adam and cain the individuals on the birth of cains eldest sister the species corresponding to the female sex received the like existence eve and her anonymous daughter whoever she were the individuals   methodization or arrangement of this operation as will be seen more particularly further on under a separate head thus denominated there are two distinguishable modes for the designation of one of which the words collective or cumulative of the other the word lineal may be employed or instead of the lineal mode of methodization the term methodization by means of procedure may be employed to collective or cumulative methodization the use of one of the operations above designated by the term denomination viz collective denomination seems to be an altogether indispensable requisite a general name is the common the necessary tie by which a number of general or abstract ideas are fixed and fastened together in the mind in what respect then is collective methodization distinct from collective denomination in this only that when the word methodization is employed a multitude of groups or collections of general ideas are considered as being at the same time formed or bound together and at the same time so constituted and disposed of that two or more each having its collective name or denomination are connected together by and comprehended within some common name some name which being common to them both and not applied to any other serves at the same time to distinguish them from all objects to which different names have been applied the new and larger group thus formed being at the same time in company with some other group or groups formed in the same manner formed into still more capacious multitudinous groups and so on through any number of groups of ulterior aggregation the course by which lineal methodization or arrangement is performed is this of the several subjects in the present instance the several denominations on which as on its subjects it is performed some one presents itself before any other has presented itself to the mind next to that some other and so on throughout the whole number and thus in this same order one after another they all present themselves to effect and secure the accomplishment of this object the words or visible signs by which     these several groups are respectively represented and presented to the mind are so placed as to present themselves to the eye of every reader in the course or order thus appointed as above from this masteroperation all the other operations in some way or other several of them directly are wont to receive direction and assistance the operation of communication of ideas as performed by its peculiar instrument discourse or language will come in the next and last place to be considered to this operation that of methodization will be found capable of rendering the most essential and in some measure indispensable assistance but antecedently to this so and in an immediate and manifestly visible way will it be found capable of rendering assistance to the operations of retention judicial decision and invention and the larger the scale upon which it happens to them respectively to be performed the greater the assistance mental operations class vi—operations by the performance of which by means of the operations of designation and expression communication of the ideas formed in one mind is made to and those ideas are transferred into another mind   discourse or discoursing   expression in the course of this operation ideas having been in one mind formed or lodged and therein associated with and as it were attached and fastened to certain of the signs of which discourse or language is composed are out of that mind expressed i e pressed out for the purpose of their being received into or say finding reception in another   signs by means of which the operation is performed   minds to which and modes in which application is made of these signs—from these two sources taken together may the operation be seen to receive whatsoever modification it admits of   signs by means of which the operation of discourse is performed a difference in the nature of the signs capable of being employed is produced by a correspondent difference in the nature of that one of the five senses to which the discourse is made to address itself the hearing its organ the ear the sight its organ the eye the touch its organ the skin and more particularly the skin of the hand—to all these senses has what is called discourse been made to address itself audible visible and tangible such accordingly has respectively been the nature of the signs of which in these several cases this organ of the mind has been composed till a comparatively late point in the time of human existence of all these sorts of signs those which address themselves to the ear were almost the only ones in actual existence to the infinite multitude and variety of these the few that as yet in those days addressed themselves immediately to the eye found but a feeble supplement and a still more feeble and inadequate succedaneum through the medium of the french word langue a tongue—language in french langage the discourse of the tongue is derived from the latin lingua a tongue when addressed to the ear it is from the tongue that the discourse addresses itself for discourse for the product of the operation called discourse in the form in which it addresses itself to the eye as contradistinguished from that in which it addresses itself to the ear neither the french nor the latin nor the english affords any proper appellative french or english language—french or english tongue if applied to the contents of a manuscript or a printed book—a solecism a palpable contradiction and inconsistency will upon consideration be found involved in any one of these expressions yet for these solecisms however palpable the demand is frequent and so urgent as scarcely to be resisted writing including its comparatively recent improvements such as printing engraving c is in every case discourse addressed to the eye to this organ discourse in this form has been capable of addressing itself in either of two ways—  in a remote way through the medium and intervention of discourse addressed to the ear i e of articulate sounds   in an immediate way without the intervention of discourse in that or any other form in the first case the audible sounds are the immediate signs of thought and it is of these audible signs that the visible characters are the signs and it is only in this comparatively remote way that the function of signs of thought is performed by the visible characters in the other case the function of signs of thought is somehow or other performed in an immediate way by the visible characters of these two modes the former is the only one familiar to the generality of civilized nations the other is exemplified in the vast empire of china in the empire of japan and in some of the states subject to the dominion or ascendancy of the chinese a remarkable circumstance is that the japanese whose audible instrument of discourse is not the same with that of the chinese—has little or no affinity with that of the chinese employ the same visible instrument the same characters and so in the case of some of those other inferior states in that part of the world compared with the footing on which it is in european practice great must be the incommodiousness of the instrument of discourse as employed in these eastern nations and accordingly the more particularly it is seen into and the nature of it understood the more manifest do the imperfections under which it labours become but for the consideration of these imperfections in the instrument of discourse     and the consequent imperfections in the state of human thought the proper place will be under the head of language in the meantime concerning this inaudible and purely visible instrument of discourse thus much is certain viz that of the characters of which it is composed there is not one that can ever be spoken of but through the medium of an audible sign but if on the occasion of its being spoken of each visible sign is provided with a correspondent audible one it has thereby a distinct name and in this way and thus far the chinese instrument of discourse is placed upon a footing with that of europe a name therefore in a word an audible name every such visible character cannot but have in whatsoever nation employed—the chinese for example or the japanese but what is possible is that in one nation a given character has one audible name in another nation another and this is as reported actually the state of the case the touch has been mentioned above as one of the three senses through the medium of which the operations of discourse are capable of being performed this accordingly is a medium through which in the case of the blind by the help of modern ingenuity it is customarily carried on but where this is the one of the three conversible senses employed it is never any otherwise than in a remote way viz through the intervention of one of the other two conversible ones if such they may be called in the case even of a blind person this medium may be composed not only of the ordinary audible but of the ordinary visible signs if so it be that he was once in possession of the sense of sight and at that time made an acquaintance with the use and import of the ordinary visible characters of late years the faculty of discourse has even been communicated to persons who from their birth were deaf and from that cause or any other at the same time dumb—but in all these cases such persons have been in possession of the sense of sight and thereby have been rendered susceptible of discourse and conversed by means of visible characters should a human being ever be found unfortunate enough to be from his birth destitute of the sense of sight as well as of that of hearing to communicate to him the faculty of converse or discourse in any degree or to any purpose will it seems evident be necessarily found altogether impracticable in the same deplorable case will any person be who being born deaf and dumb shall lose his sight without having as yet received in any competent degree that sort of instruction intellectual and literary of which persons labouring under that complicated imperfection are susceptible thus much for the present as to the signs by means of which the operations denoted by the collective appellation discourse are carried on and the correspondent faculty exercised the different classes called parts of speech into which in each and every particular language these signs have been distributed or found distributable the mode and order in respect of priority in which these signs appear to have been formed—these are topics which will be found in our way at an ulterior stage of our progress   minds to which—modes in which application is made of these signs—of the signs of which discourse or language is composed the mind to which on any occasion application is made of these signs is either the mind of that person alone by whom they are employed or the mind of some other person in the latter case the use made of them may be styled the transitive use in the other case the intransitive† thus it is that how intimately soever connected designation simple designation and discoursing are different operations without designation discoursing it is true could not have taken place but without discoursing designation may and it frequently does to a great extent take place not that had it not been for the purpose of discourse designation there seems reason to think would ever have taken place it is accordingly as it should seem to its intransitive use that discourse or language is indebted for its existence so much more conspicuous is the transitive use of discourse or language that in comparison with it the intransitive seems scarcely to have obtained notice‡ in importance however it is second only to the transitive use by its transitive use the collection of these signs is only the vehicle of thought by its intransitive use it is an instrument employed in the creation and fixation of thought itself unclothed as yet in words or stripped of them thoughts are but dreams like the shifting clouds of the sky they float     in the mind one moment and vanish out of it the next but for these fixed and fixative signs nothing that ever bore the name of art or science could ever have come into existence whatsoever may have been the more remote and recondite causes it is to the superior amplitude to which in respect of the use made of it in his own mind man has been able to extend the mass of his language that as much as to anything else man it should seem stands more immediately indebted for whatsoever superiority in the scale of perfection and intelligence he possesses as compared with those animals who come nearest to him in this scale without language not only would men have been incapable of communicating each man his thoughts to other men but compared with what he actually possesses the stock of his own ideas would in point of number have been as nothing while each of them taken by itself would have been as flitting and indeterminate as those of the animals which he deals with at his pleasure of the seven or more distinguishable mental operations to the performance of each language now that it is formed is instrumental and subservient—viz   perception   recollection   attention c   abstraction whence imagination and invention   judication   designation and   converse or communication of ideas this of communication of ideas is but one look back upon these others and you will see there is scarcely one of them to which in respect of this its intransitive use to which in the character of a spring as well as a regulator of thoughts language if not indispensably necessary is not in an eminent degree subservient of this proposition the truth will appear in a still stronger and stronger light as the thread of the present discourse advances so far as depends on the personal use of each individual independently of those uses which depend on the communication of his thoughts to other individuals at pleasure for giving determinateness and in some degree permanence to the matter of thought—language even of the partly audible kind—language even though destitute of the further help afforded by those visible signs which in their nature are susceptible of a duration equal to that of the whole human race affords of itself no inconsiderable assistance but in comparison with the determinateness the permanence and thence the improvement of which even in the mind of though it be but a single individual language is susceptible by the means of visible signs of improvement in itself not to speak of subserviency to improvement in other objects the utmost which it is capable of deriving from audible signs alone is but inconsiderable indeed by being thrown into measure composed of an appropriate mixture of syllables such as with reference to each other shall require a comparatively long and a comparatively short portion of time for their utterance by means of the additional association thus formed between import and sound and by that means between import and import by this means or instead of or along with these modifications by means of the regular recurrence after periods of limited and determinate length of similar sounds—in a word by rhythm or by rhyme or both—additional permanence or rather additional chance of permanency is and at a very early stage in the progress of society and language amongst most nations has been given to audible language but after the utmost aid that can in this way be given has been given that which has been or can be given in this way to the improvement—that is to the clearness correctness and extent of thought—always has been nor in the nature of the case would or can ever fail of being universally inconsiderable in comparison with that which has already been given—not to speak of what further may remain capable of being given by visible that is by permanent language section v characteristic the fourth faculties to which logic gives direction and assistance the faculties which it may occasionally belong to logic to call forth into exercise and give direction and assistance to are neither more nor fewer than the whole number of the faculties distinguishable in the human frame if there be any to which it will be seen not to apply in so immediate and constant a way as it does to the rest yet neither can these any more than those fail to fall on this or that occasion for this or that purpose within the field of its cognizance of the faculties of the human frame the following may be considered as the proximate division passive and active—in one or other of these two divisions may every faculty distinguishable in the human frame be considered as included physically passive and psychically passive—under the one or other of these appellations may be included whatsoever faculties belong to the class of sensitively passive ones physically passive those sensitively passive faculties by which man is enabled and made to experience such sensations as present themselves as having their seat in some determinate part of the body psychically passive the sensitively passive faculties by which man is enabled and made to experience such sensations as not presenting themselves as having their seat in any determinate part of the body—spring up to all appearance immediately and in the first instance in the mind pathematically passive and apathematically passive—under one or other of these appellations   0 may be included whatsoever faculties belong to the class of physically passive ones pathematically passive corresponding to those corporeal impressions which are accompanied either with pleasure or pain apathematically passive corresponding to those impressions which are unaccompanied either with pleasure or pain—with feelings of the pleasant or with feelings of the unpleasant class while with the appetite of thirst upon him a man drinks—the liquid being for example water a liquid destitute of all exhilirating as well as of all sapid properties—so long as the appetite is not yet completely satisfied a sensation of the pleasureable kind continues—when the appetite is completely satisfied the operation may continue some little time without being productive of pain any more than of pleasure but continued for a certain ulterior length of time it becomes productive of the sort of pain applied to the purpose of extracting confessorial evidence under the romano gallic romano batavian and other modifications of the romano imperial law pathematically passive and apathematically passive—to impressions made immediately on the mental part without passing otherwise than by the intervention of those signs of which discourse is composed through the corporeal part of the human frame may this same distinction be found to apply with no less propriety and use than in the case just mentioned in the presence of three persons a b and c an article in a newspaper respecting the death of a person therein mentioned happens to be read to a the deceased was altogether unknown to b he was an useful friend to c a troublesome enemy in the mind of a the intelligence produces no sensation at all in that of b an unpleasant one in that of c perhaps a pleasant one originally active and derivately active—under one or other of these appellations may be comprised every distinguishable modification of the active faculty of the human frame to the head of the originally active faculty may be referred every exercise of the will or determination of the will—or say volitional faculty when considered apart from any act or operation performed in consequence and pursuance of it an instance of the exercise of the originally active faculty is—a mere wish for the gratification of which whether by reason of consciousness of want of power or at the suggestion of prudence or through any other cause nothing is done no act is performed physically active and psychically active—under one or other of these appellations may be comprised every modification of the derivatively active faculty to the head of the physically active branch may be referred every human act in so far as any corporeal organ is employed in the exercise of it to the psychically active branch every human act in so far as the mind is employed in the exercise of it the observation made of and consideration bestowed upon these distinctions are exercises of the psychically active branch of the derivatively active faculty of the mind in the instance of him by whom these pages are composed the committing to paper the signs of them in the form of a written discourse was an exercise of the physically active branch of the same derivatively active faculty antecedently to the performance of these several operations the determination to perform them was an exercise of the originally active faculty the volitional descending lower and lower into the region of particulars with logic for its guide sooner or later the mind would come to that list of faculties which as already intimated correspond not only in nature but with little exception even in name with the articles already brought to view under the general name of operations—so many operations so many faculties corresponding to each operation a faculty considered and spoken of as if enabling a man to perform that same operation section vi characteristic the fifth main instrument of logic the grand instrument of thought in general and of thought directed to the purposes of logic in particular is the faculty of discourse including the faculty of speech under the head of operations in or to the performance of which logic is capable of being rendered serviceable mention was made of the faculty of expression of discourse of converse correspondent to this as to any other operation a demand may exist and at any rate in the present instance does exist for the mention of a correspondent faculty say the faculty of giving expression to thought the faculty of carrying on discourse the faculty of holding converse with other persons or say more concisely the faculty of discourse the faculty of converse of which the faculty of speech is but a modification and no more than one out of several modifications by means of this faculty by the performance of the correspondent operations a correspondent product has in every nation in every tribe or group of human beings howsoever barbarous and uninstructed been brought into existence numberless are the shapes in which the product has among different assemblages and races of men made its appearance in whatsoever of these shapes it has made its appearance one general appellation language—a language is applicable for the designation of the collection of audible signs of which with or without a correspondent collection of visible signs or characters it is composed so many different collections of these signs employed by so many different tribes in the designation of the same collection of ideas so many different languages     of the sort of product thus everywhere formed so great is the importance so universally extensive the use that for all sorts of purposes there may be convenience in considering it and speaking of it in the character of an instrument in the hand of the mind and more particularly in the hand of logic that language is an instrument of discourse of converse of communication between one mind and another that it is the product of the sort of operation called expression discourse converse—the work of the correspondent faculty to speak of it in any such way is but tautology but as has already been noticed it is an instrument not only of discourse but of thought itself an instrument by which not only are perceptions and ideas communicated but ideas are formed—an instrument without the aid of which a man would neither be able to communicate to other minds any part of the thoughts of which the stock of his own mind consisted but without which the greatest stock of those possessions which it would be possible to accumulate in his mind would be but in an inconsiderable degree more ample than that with which the mind of the species of animal be it what it may which in the scale of perfection approaches the nearest to his own is commonly provided accordingly while on the present occasion for the purpose of being held up to view in the character of an instrument an instrument of thought as well as converse it is at the same time taken for the subject of converse it has moreover first in the character of an instrument of thought then in the character of an instrument of converse been employed and operated with section vii characteristic the sixth functions of logic or functions to the performance or exercise of which in relation to other arts and sciences logic gives direction and assistance by the word functions if it be not considered as exactly synonymous to the word operations the mind will naturally be led to the idea of the sort of person expressed by its conjugate functionary—a functionary considered in the character of a person by whom in virtue of some special engagement taken or task undertaken by him these several operations will in the prosecution of some special design or other in relation to this or that subject or subjectmatter come to be performed   learning   using practising employing or applying   teaching   improving—viz the acquirement the art the science in question to one or other of these heads may be referred whatsoever course of operations considered as having for their ideal subjectmatter any branch of art or science have been in use to be considered as capable of being designated by the name of functions any or all of them capable of being at the same or at different times exercised by the same hand but all of them capable of being considered as the work of so many different hands or of the same hands at different points of time of the courses or modes of action for the designation of which the word operation was employed some there may be that may be found preeminently or even exclusively applicable to this or that branch of art or science inapplicable to this or that other of the more extensive courses of action for the designation of which the word function is here employed there is not one that is not alike applicable without exception or distinction to every branch of art and science section viii characteristic the seventh uses of logic or uses to which logic is applicable in this case as in every other in the instance of this art as in regard to any other a use is either a modification of the universal end i e wellbeing or a subordinate and subservient end i e a means capable of being employed in contributing towards that same universal end be the thing be the object what it may if it neither perform nor contribute to the performance of service in either of these shapes it is of no use—real use it has none if it have anything belonging to it that can with propriety and intelligibility be termed use it must be either by giving increase in a direct way to the aggregate mass of pleasure or by applying defalcation to the aggregate mass of pain or else by contributing or tending to contribute in some way or other to the production of one or other or both of those ever desirable and ultimately only desirable effects of the field of exercise of this art a sketch has already been given above the aggregate of its uses is coextensive with that field operations faculties maininstrument functions—the relation borne by logic to all these articles has just been brought to view by the art of logic assistance and direction is given to the mind in the carrying on of all these its various operations in the exercise of these its faculties in the giving employment to that main instrument in the performance of these its functions thus extensive and diversified are its uses always remembered that on each occasion it is only in so far as in and by the direction and assistance so given by it increase     is in some shape or other given to the balance on the side of happiness that any use that can be made of this or any other instrument can be of any real value chapter iii præcognita or preliminary and general indications concerning logic according to the aristotelians section i definition of logic according to the aristotelians an instrumental art directing our mind into the cognition of all things that are intelligible such according to sanderson is the definition of logic as given by the school of aristotle before the above in the semblance of a definition comes this short locution—logic is the art of reason for recollection this short phrase may not impossibly have its use for instruction for original instruction it is not in the nature of it to serve by this art—such according to the account thus given of it is its nature—the human mind is directed good for so it is said to be by any other art by every one of those fictitious entities that bear the name of art directed—but into and in what—into knowledge—knowledge of all things intelligible the only things capable of being known subjectible to the dominion of knowledge into knowledge but into nothing else meantime unfortunately of the field which nature has thrown open to the dominion of logic but over no more than one part out of two nor that the most useful did the grecian philosopher in so far as this account of what he did is the true one cast forth his shoe in point of use of real utility and thence in point of real worth and true dignity in so far as things are separate or separable knowledge is inferior to art so much so that separated from art all the knowledge which the human mind is capable of containing would be of no use according to their own showing the logic of the aristotelians is but an useless which is as much as to say a worthless art and so in respect of no small part though not the whole of it will it be found even before the first sort of vague and uninstructive definition is completed comes a parenthesis by which of the narrowness of the extent attributed to the art by these its cultivators intimation is given logic says the bishops compendium which according to the figure of synecdoche is also called dialectica the figure of synecdoche is that figure of rhetoric by which the part is put instead of the whole a very inauspicious commencement this for a treatise on an art which as to one of its most useful branches is the art of correct expression and true representation before so much as the definition of it is completed in comes a formulary taken from that art which with little impropriety might be termed the art of misrepresentation again the art called logic is the same art say they as the art called dialectics which being interpreted is the art of disputation viz in mood and figure what is true of the art of logic is that this art of disputation forms part and parcel of it but is it thence also true that logic and the art of disputation are one and the same object—that these names are names for one and the same thing if so then is a tree and a branch of that same tree the same things again logic according to the definition given of it by aristotle and his followers is an art the effect or at least the aim of which is to lead a man to the knowledge of all things intelligible by aristotle and the greek philosophers in general knowledge taken in the aggregate was an object on which to judge from the comparative degree of attention paid to it and from the comparative quantity of discourse bestowed upon it a greater value was set then upon happiness itself and as to its connexion with happiness either it was regarded as something more valuable than happiness or as something from the possession of which in whatever part or shape at least an equal quantity of happiness would follow as of course knowledge or something that with them passed for knowledge was the prerogative possession of these teachers and their disciples for happiness at least in so far as it was composed of pleasures and exemptions from pains a capacity at least was shared with them by the vulgar herd hence the transcendent and independent value ascribed by them to everything that went by the name of knowledge or afforded anything like a promise or prospect of leading to it but happiness including everything that for its own sake is worth having everything that in itself is of any value logic to be of any value must in some way or other be in every part conducive to and it is only in so far as it is so conducive that it is worth knowing—that an acquaintance with it is of any value section ii uses of logic—utilitates according to the aristotelians as to the uses of logic—viz of their logic—none though this topic has been brought to view by them have the aristotelians been able to find practice they say will bring them to view but if practice will as they     are pleased to find it convenient to suppose bring them to the view of the learner why not to that of the teacher and if so it be that to his view it have brought them why not specify them here at once as he has done in the case of all the other topics indistinct indeed must have been the notions attached by these logicians to the word utilitas else instead of referring under the name of practice to the casual observation of each scholar how could they have avoided referring to the indication which they themselves had but that instant been giving necessary is this art say they to the acquisition of every discipline i e of everything that is or can be the subject of instruction by which if they mean anything they mean everything that is or can be the subject of anything that ever did go or ever can go by any such name as either that of art or that of science so many disciplines so many uses—for each discipline a distinct intelligible and undeniable use—subsequently to which in relation to each such discipline might have come the inquiry into the particular mode in which it administers to wellbeing how much more instructive and satisfactory would this indication have been how much more commensurate with the truth how much more honourable to the art would have been such an indication of the uses than the vague and selfhumiliating put off—go look for them—what they are we cannot tell you if you have good luck sometime or other you may find some of them yourselves section iii end of logic—finis according to the aristotelians after the topic of the uses of logic—the utilitates and not before comes in that list the topic of the end finis ejus scilicet logicæ i e the general end but of logic as of anything else what are the uses but either so many modifications of the general the universal end or so many means tending to the attainment of it if so first should have come the end after that the uses first the genus then and not till then the species this end of logic this end when it does come what is it is it the universal the sole universal end—actually as well as fitly and properly the universal end—wellbeing i e the maximum of pleasures alloyed by the minimum of pains not it indeed no such amplitude does it possess it is confined in the first place to mere knowledge but except and in so far as in some shape or other it leads to and is productive of wellbeing—a balance on the side of happiness what is all the knowledge in the world worth just nothing in the next place though the whole of knowledge it might be and still be worth nothing it is not so much as the whole of knowledge persons and things—under one or other of these heads may be comprised the subjects of knowledge of the two persons a man would be apt to think the most interesting but to persons to what belongs to persons it does not so much as profess to extend it confines itself and most pointedly to things finis vero unicus coqnitio scilicet rerum knowledge of things viz either scientific alone or at least scientific with the addition of unscientific knowledge of things coqnitio rerum beyond this even the pretensions of the aristotelians at any rate any distinct and explicit pretensions do not extend far indeed however were their actual attainments far even their actual researches from coming up to these pretensions the knowledge of words viz the import of words—this was the utmost point within this field was contained the sumtotal of their researches a certain sort of coincidence to exhibit a demonstration so they termed it was with them the great work the object and if attained the fruit of all their ingenuity and of all them labours this demonstration when exhibited what did it amount to—an indication of a certain mode and degree of coincidence between the import of two words and nothing more but this exploit what did it require it required that to all the several words employed the same import should have been annexed by the disputing parties suppose this identity to have place then if the demonstration were correct the opponent could not deny it without falling into a contradiction of terms but this necessary condition suppose it in any part wanting in this case no demonstration could take place not so much as this faint semblance of and spurious substitute for knowledge experience observation and experiment these were the only processes by which real knowledge could be obtained and by the boasted art of logical demonstration to what extent soever employed not a particle of knowledge was obtained through any one of these sources of this assuming science thus worthless was the end in truth it was not simply worthless it was positively pernicious it was pernicious by drawing aside and keeping mankind for so many ages out of the only instructive track of study as abovementioned into and in this uninstructive one but out of an illdirected pursuit it will sometimes happen that useful results may collaterally and as it were by a sidewind be brought to light though of all the propositions thus demonstrated or demonstrable the value was is and ever will be equal to 0 though logical demonstration the fruit of all this labour was and is delusion yet of the operations which had no other object than the formation and maturation     of this fruit many there are which have been and will ever continue to be found applicable to and continually applied to real and most important uses the demonstration of the aristotelian may in this respect be compared to the philosophers stone the stone was a nonentity but in seeking for this nonentity real entities pregnant with real and important uses were discovered in no inconsiderable numbers for though the stone was never discovered multitudes of substances applicable to the purposes of medicine and the arts were brought to light section iv functions of logic—officia according to the aristotelians of these no unapt description is given it is by these functions as by so many means that logic operates towards the attainment of its end according to this account these officia—these functions seem to coincide with sufficient exactness at least as far as they extend with the articles herein above brought to view by the name of operations—operations of the human mind or rather of the whole human frame mind and body together to all which in some way or other logic is or is capable of being rendered subservient—all of them in some way or other directed to and leading to the universal end to which by the guidance it is capable of affording to them logic itself may be and ought to be made to lead thus much for the general nature of these functions these means these operations but a list the particular list any particular list—anything approaching or so much as pretending itself to be or to lead to the finding or formation of anything approaching to a complete list where shall it be found assuredly not in the custody or power of these philosophers of these functions some there are—what or so much as how many they cannot tell three however but no more than three are what they know of viz definition division and ratiocination concerning these several functions of logic or mental operations how indistinct and inadequate were the notions of these logicians will be seen in another place section v object matter and subjects according to the aristotelians of this first chapter in sanderson the remainder consists of strings of words to which no intelligible meaning has ever been attached and of which no use no intelligible no sensible use has ever been made or been attempted to be made which without any the smallest loss and with no small advantage if saving of time and labour be an advantage the reader may well spare himself the study of primary object the mind secondary object language subjectmatter viz being and nonbeing formal reason the second intention logical instruments so many second notions—all these so many other subjects words more and more confusion thicker and thicker a wood in which the further a man proceeds or attempts to proceed the more inextricably he will be bewildered greek as usual called in and why—that a meaning which is not to be found in the latin may be supposed to be in the greek the subject of logic—a subject of information of operation or of tractation the subject of information primarily the human mind—secondarily discourse or language the subject of operation the material subject alias a theme or the theme alias an intelligible question alias a πᾶγ γοητὸγ—a warming pan a dripping pan or a patty pan would have been equally instructive the subject of tractation the formal subject which if total and adequate is a or the second intention if principal a syllogism or more specially a demonstration in all this heap of words will anything useful or so much as intelligible ever be found chapter iv of aristotles predicaments and postpredicaments section i of the ten predicaments aristotles ten predicaments are all of them either names of real entities or names of fictitious entities       substance the first upon the list is a name of a real entity—of a species of real entity—the only species of real entity that is perceptible that belongs to the class of perceptible ones the nine names of fictitious entities are distinguishable into two groups   and   group the first quantity and quality both these are affections of substance i e of substances of bodies—of the bodies the existence of which is made known to us by our senses according to the sort of fiction which in these instances is necessary to the purpose of discourse quantity is as it were a smaller body which is in the substance in question or a larger body in which the substance in question is quality is also as it were a small body in which the substance in question is or it is a sort of object of i e from which the substance of which it is the affection is considered as issuing—a man is said to be of a quality in neither of these two cases does any object necessarily come in question other than the substance or body real or fictitious of which they are respectively the affections   in the instance of all the remaining predicaments seven in number the predicament is the name of a relation in the fourth instance relation is itself the name of the predicament and this name is the generic name with reference to which all the remaining predicaments are specific ones they are all of them so many species of relation of a relation it is the essential character to suppose the existence of two objects between which the relation is spoken of as subsisting of this sort is the image the sort of fictitious picture which the mind presents to itself two objects—two bodies of any sort a and b—between them an interval of space in that interval the fictitious body the relation is conceived as placed—for such is the picture exhibited to the mind by the word between as often as it is applied to two bodies—to two substances of any kind   and   by the words actio and passio are brought to view two of these fictitious bodies between which the particular species of relation respectively denominated by them are considered and represented as subsisting or having place passio passion cannot be conceived of without actio action concerning actio action the truth of that proposition if it be true seems not quite so clear suppose a body moving along in space true it is that it has no other body on which it acts but it seems too much to say that it does not act to move is it not to act every motion is it not a species of action   and   by the word ubi may be considered as designated place with the several modifications and relations of which it is susceptible by the word situs site position is on other occasions designated the same object place or at any rate the mode of being of the body or portion of matter in question with reference to place i e with reference to its distance from other bodies in sandersons compendium a distich is inserted in and by which exemplification of all these several predicaments is exhibited in the explanation thus given stabo i shall stand is given as the exemplification of the word situs standing at any rate upon the face of the exemplification as it stands in these two verses in question is a posture of the body of the human body but a posture—that of standing—what is it it is the result of the position or situation of the situs of the several parts of the body in question with reference to each other here then is a predicament situs which is but a modification of and has accordingly already been brought to view by and under a former predicament ubi   two other incongruities are moreover here observable—   in the first place in company and on a level with the eight other names of predicaments which names are all of them as it was fit they should be so many names of objects—nouns substantives come a pair of adverbs viz ubi where and quando when   in the next place comes an instance of disorder between the two words here employed to designate place viz ubi and situs comes the word quando employed to designate time  0 habitus vesture human clothing for such is the intimation given by the corresponding portion of the illustrative distich nec tunicatus ero but clothing human clothing is it not a substance here then we have given in the character of the name of a predicament distinct from all the rest an article included under one of them viz the first clothing a predicament distinct from substance on equal ground might additional predicaments in any number be stated as having existence as being entitled to a place upon the list many of them perhaps most a better title a curious predicament a predicament the exemplification of which is mere matter of contingency a predicament which at one time had no existence which in one place has in another place has not existence at this present time before eating of the fatal apple neither adam nor eve his wife had any clothing—had possession or so much as any idea of any such predicament in fact it had not any     exemplification or any existence at the very instant of its being placed the first fig leaf that was ever placed gave birth to this predicament gave birth to the first individual from which the species such as it is pregnant with all the individuals that ever belonged to it took its rise section iii of aristotles postpredicaments taken together aristotles ten predicaments were to include everything whatsoever yet after this list of predicaments comes presently a list of five other articles under the name of postpredicaments these five how come they to be separated from the ten for the designation of them how happened it that a separate and different plan has been adopted look at them and you will see out of the five one viz the last employed to signify a mixture altogether incongruous the other four present as good a title as any of the original ten to admittance into the learned language motion though in this appendixious list it occupies a place no earlier than the fourth out of the five has not merely as good a title to a place upon the principal list as one of those original ones which are the only ones to whom a share in this general appellative is allowed but as will be seen below a better title to be there   oppositio opposition this is manifestly a species of relation of opposition the aristotelians distinguish four different modes   prioritas priority this again is another species of relation   simultas simultaneity—another relation viz that which takes place between two objects which with reference to each other are contemporary i e exist in or during the same point or length of time   motus motion in the field of thought and action this is an object of the most important and most extensive use of all the ten predicaments there is not one substantia excepted whose title to a place upon the list seems so uncontrovertible as that of this article it is as well as substance matter body among the objects of which quantity and quality are predicable like substance it ought to have preceded these predicaments actio action the fifth of the predicaments is but a species of motion related to motion as a species to its superordinate for its nonadmittance into the list of predicaments what possible reason can have presented itself   fifth and last of these postpredicaments habere in english—to have the discourse has at this period fallen off into nonsense or something very near of kin to it in the instance of the ten predicaments in the instance of the four first of these postpredicaments determinate ideas and not mere words were brought to view a word is now introduced in the character of the name of a postpredicament and to the word no determinate idea is attached in the way of specification what is given is not the modification of an idea but a multitude or number of significations or senses in which it has happened to this same word to have been employed eight in number are these specifications—eight according to a statement in a succeeding chapter is the number of these its different significations two and no more were the different significations included in the predicament termed habitus habit these two form two out of the eight significations ascribed to habere to have this last of the postpredicaments chapter v mode of discussion section i aristotelian and socratic modes—their difference to inform to be informed to persuade to expose to aversion or contempt under one or other of these heads may be comprised it is supposed the supposed good the advantage whatever it be which in the character of an object or end in view a man can have on the occasion of his spontaneously joining in discourse in so far as to inform or be informed is the whole of the object in view the seat of what passes is in the understanding—in so far as persuasion or exposure are in view it is in the affections—the affections which when excited to a considerable degree of intensity are termed the passions† great are the eulogiums that have been passed upon the mode of disputation that bears the name of socrates compared with that of aristotle—what is the real merit i e the real use of it thus much all possible modes of argumentation consequently these among the rest have in common viz from some proposition to which assent is given on both sides an endeavour on the part of the comparatively active collocutor to draw from the comparatively passive collocutor an assent to a proposition to which the assent of the active collocutor has already been attached but to which the assent of the passive collocutor has not been or at least is not by the active collocutor     supposed to be as yet attached—whether it be that the mind of the passive collocutor has not as yet taken its side or that having taken its side the side it has taken is the opposite side attaching its dissent to the side to which the mind of the active collocutor has attached its assent—its assent to that to which the mind of the active collocutor has attached its dissent in any form of argumentation this sort of opposition is if not in actuality at least in probability an essential feature—from first to last the existence of it is in contemplation—from first to last on the part of the active collocutor the object and design of his discourse is to exclude it and if not to drive it out to prevent it from taking place for the production of this effect what are the means employed—what are the means which the nature of the case furnishes this will presently be visible on the part of the passive collocutor the state of his mind with reference to that of the active collocutor is as far as can be collected from his discourse either negative or neutral for simplicity sake suppose it according to the customary supposition negative in this case the discourse the discussion is termed a controversy a debate the debate is carried on either with or without the privity of a third person or third persons according to the customary supposition it is carried on not only with the privity but in the presence of third persons in an indefinite number of the forms employed by the aristotelians in their disputations the function or immediate object is to designate the several propositions which it is proposed to exhibit to the other interlocutor say the adversary for the purpose of his attaching to them successively and respectively the sign of his assent or dissent of his concession or negation the denomination given to the proposition for the purpose of the argument is one by which the sort of relation which it bears or is designed to bear to the other propositions with which it is accompanied and connected is indicated or intended to be indicated when in consequence or in the course of debate one of the two collocutors passes over to the opinion of the other a sort of superiority is by such transition ascribed to the one with reference to and at the charge of the other—ascribed to the one whose declared opinion remains fixed at the charge of him in the state of whose opinion a change has been produced—a sort of superiority viz in the scale of wisdom or knowledge or intelligence—on the part of the superior the existence of power—a source of enjoyment—is testified to exist on the part of the inferior weakness—a source of suffering in regard to power—not only is power itself a source of enjoyment but so likewise is the reputation of it i e the state and condition of him who is reputed to possess it so on the other hand in regard to weakness not only is weakness itself a source of suffering but so likewise is the reputation of it when reputation is mentioned simply i e without addition it is understood to be reputation of something desirable of something of which the tendency is to produce enjoyment to him who possesses it when a debate takes place a contest for superiority—for the reputation of superiority—a contest whether avowed or not not the less real the side on which the superiority is understood to take place is the side of that one of the collocutors to which side the other passes the side on which the inferiority is understood to take place is the side of him who from his own side passes over to the opposite one from this source any more than from any other a man will not subject or expose himself to suffering in any shape but for the avoidance of some apparently greater suffering or for the obtainment of some apparently more than equivalent enjoyment rather than as above acknowledge inferiority he would continue uttering discourse to any effect or if that would serve the purpose have recourse to silence but by silence no such purpose can on such an occasion be served on the contrary the opposite effect is produced it is only by action that superiority can be displayed or exercised—by inaction whether in the shape of silence or in any other on any occasion on which action is necessary to the display of superiority nothing but inferiority and weakness is displayed remains in and for the sole refuge discourse but what discourse discourse by which in the debate in question the reputation of superiority is capable of being obtained—discourse by which the reputation—the imputation of inferiority is capable of being avoided is by the supposition not to be found but all discourse not conducive to that desirable end is either irrelevant i e unimportant or erroneous now it is only by such discourse as is at the same time pertinent and correct that on the occasion of a debate the imputation of weakness can be avoided in proportion as in case of irrelevancy the irrelevancy—in the case of erroneousness the erroneousness is manifest and glaring absurdity is the quality universally ascribed to the discourse—absurdity is the character ascribed to the mind of him by whom it is uttered of debate in whatever form carried on what then is the object of him the course taken by him by whom an active part is taken in it answer so to shape his discourse that on return to it the adversary shall for the avoidance of a still more afflictive humiliation submit to the humiliation of coming over to his side but such will be the effect if in return to the discourse whatever it be     which is uttered by the more active of the two debaters the discourse uttered by the other is of such a nature as to be in the eyes of all competent judges either palpably irrelevant or palpably erroneous a case in which irrelevancy is carried to as high a pitch as possible is that of nonsensicalness for discourse which has or propositions that have not any meaning at all cannot with reference to any discourse that has a meaning be relevant what does the socratic method of disputation the socratic method employs not any such determinate mode and figure as that which is employed by the aristotelian nor in a word any mode or figure except in so far as the use of a modification of what the grammarians call the imperative mood may be styled as it is by the rhetoricians a figure in the aristotelian method the person by whom is borne the principal part in the debate advances himself the propositions that are brought forward now then as to the difference between the aristotelian method of disputation or debate and the socratic what does the aristotelian answer in bringing up his arguments the object and endeavour of the active collocutor is previously so to frame and marshal them that at the issue the adversary shall not be able to express his dissent from the proposition or string of propositions advanced by him without advancing a proposition palpably erroneous or irrelevant in this view all the propositions which for the reduction of the adversary to this unwelcome dilemma can be necessary are so framed that while without error as supposed dissent cannot in relation to the last link in the chain be expressed without absurdity the expression either of dissent or assent in which last case the proselytism is acknowledged cannot be refused† section ii the disputative branch of aristotles logic—in what respects it failed in respect of miscarriage and success the character and lot of the art of logic as taught by aristotle may be considered as a sort of prototype of the art of alchemy as taught by the searchers after the universal medicine the universal solvent and the philosophers stone in both instances in respect of the ultimate object a complete failure was the result but in both instances in the course and in consesequence of the inquiry particular discoveries of no small use and importance were brought to light of the art of logic according to the profession made by the aristotelians the professed object was the communication in which was necessarily implied the attainment of knowledge correct and complete knowledge a perfect acquaintance with relation to everything knowable by human faculties knowledge and that not slight superficial and imperfect but correct and complete viz such as it was in the nature of the instrument called demonstration to produce so much for profession now for the result for about two thousand years little more or less the precepts of this art have been before us and the result is that of the whole amount of things knowable there is not a single one concerning which the smallest particle of knowledge has been found obtainable by means of it on the contrary the nature of it is now or may now be seen to be such that by means of it of no one thing can any sort or degree of knowledge at any time by any possibility be obtained experience observation experiment reflection or the results of each and of all together these are the means these are the instruments by which knowledge such as is within the power of man is picked up put together and treasured up and of no one of these in the whole mass of the aristotelian logic is so much as a syllable to be found the import of words—in this short expression will in truth be found the subject the only subject of it in such or such a manner the import of this or that word agrees or disagrees with the import of this or that other on this occasion—a notion and that an erroneous one—a proposition and that a false one—was all along involved this is that to each word was an import naturally inherent that the connexion between the sign and the thing signified was altogether the work of nature what is now pretty generally and at the same time pretty clearly understood is that the connexion between a word and its import is altogether arbitrary the result of tacit convention and longcontinued usage and of the truth of this proposition the short proof is the infinite diversity of languages—the infinite multitude of signs by which in the different languages the same object has been found represented the case is that so firmly connected by habit are the connexions between these signs and the things which they have respectively been employed to signify and present to the mind that in aristotles time men had not learned sufficiently to distinguish them from one another and of this inability one consequence and thereby one proof was their aptitude as often as they observed a word which in its grammatical form purported to be the name of a thing that form being the form that had been given to such words as were     really and in truth respectively the names of things to infer the existence of a particular sort of real thing corresponding to that word the observation not having been as yet made that the purposes of human converse could not in any instance have been attained unless to such words as are names of real entities a mixture and that a large one had been added of words which are but so many names of so many purely fictitious entities section iii of useful instruction how much and what has been obtained and obtainable from it thus completely it has been seen has the disputative branch of this art that which was regarded as the main and crowning branch failed in the accomplishment of its promise but besides that as hath been observed in and by the precedent and supposed subservient branches of the same system of instruction—many and very useful helps to instruction helps to the human mind in its labours in the field of art and science and even in that of ordinary discourse and converse were afforded—so it is that neither has this part of the system notwithstanding the completeness of its failure so far as concerns its principal object been altogether without its use of this use the following description may perhaps serve to convey a general though antecedently to explanation not perhaps a very determinate idea the use of the aristotelian logic consists in the furnishing to discourse a certain form whereby if any two parties agree in the employment of it it will in relation to any topic of discourse at pleasure all along be seen in what if in any particulars they agree and in what if in any they disagree it operates to borrow an image from chemistry as a sort of menstruum or agent whereby the portion of discourse placed in it is decomposed and that part if any in which they agree is lodged in one place that part if any in which they disagree in another place such of this instrument has been found the effect such as above and in so far as the instrument has been employed has been found to be the effect but the means the means by which this effect has been produced what it may naturally be asked have they been the answer appears to be twofold   this form being a received and acknowledged test of truth shame keeps men of sense from refusing to subject their discourse to it   it cannot serve but in proportion as the same ideas have been generally annexed to the same signs but in so far as this notorious shame keeps men from denying and questioning it chapter vi relation of logic to the business of human life in general and therein to arts and sciences i e to disciplines section i distinction between disciplines and occupations at large its indeterminateness disciplines are arts or sciences—distinction between art and science its indeterminateness by what is it that the exercise of arts and the acquisition of sciences are distinguished from occupations at large by what is it that the field of art and that of science are distinguished from each other on these several topics clear conceptions must be formed and entertained or the view taken of the field of thought and action on the one hand and the relation borne to it by the art of logic on the other hand will be unsteady and confused on these several topics clear conceptions must be formed and entertained or it cannot be understood what an art is what a science is on these several topics clear conceptions must be formed and entertained or it cannot be understood what is the proper matter for a work bearing the name of an encyclopedia where its subject begins and where it ends as often as the words arts and sciences are pronounced a natural and it is believed a very general not to say universal supposition is—that in the first place arts and sciences taken together are different and distinguishable from whatever is neither art nor science in the next place that art and science are no less clearly different and distinguishable from each other a supposition to this effect how could it fail either to have been found or to have been generally entertained wheresoever a difference in name presents itself to view a correspondent difference in nature is of course inferred what can be more natural than such an inference and in general more reasonable than such an inference the marking of correspondent differences in nature is the very purpose for which differences in nomenclature were invented and established thus much is indeed undeniable unfortunately besides that while distinctions in name without correspondent differences in nature are not without example an inconvenience much more frequently exemplified is that of the classes or aggregates for the designation of which these names are employed the limits are far from being determinate as yet throughout the whole field of language which is as much as to say throughout the whole field of thought and action imperfections such as these are to be found in but too great abundance little by little from industry guided by discernment they may   0 however expect a cure in so far as conceptions are already distinct apt denominations will find the public mind already disposed and prepared to receive and employ them at the first word and thus the imperfection will be remedied before the existence of it has been so much as noticed but where conceptions are still confused and discordant the imperfections may still be capable of receiving a remedy at the hands of individual industry but before men can be induced to receive and make use of the remedy it will in general be necessary that the existence of the imperfection with its attendant inconveniences should first be held up to view the plain truth of the matter seems to be this—between the field of art and science and the remainder of the field of thought and action there exists not any assignable difference correspondent to these denominations what there exists in the case is a difference in the state of the mind of those by whom the part in question of that field is cultivated where the nature of the case requires an operation to be performed and of that operation the performance is regarded as requiring study i e a certain degree of attention and a certain degree of labour employed in fixing it then it is that in speaking of the operation done the word science or the word art or both together are employed in so far as whether with or without a view to further action so it is that in the receipt and collection of the ideas belonging to the subject perceptible labour is employed then it is that the word science is employed and such portion whatever it be of the field of thought and action to which the labour is applied is considered as a portion of the field of science in so far as a determinate object in the character of an end being in view operation in the particular direction is recurred to for the attainment of that end—that portion be it what it may of the field of thought and action to which the labour is applied is considered as part and parcel of the field of art section ii of the business of human life in general and hence of arts sciences and disciplines an occupation the performance of which is considered as not requiring study—an occupation the performance of which is considered as requiring study i e a course of labour viz mental alone or mental and bodily together in the endeavour to perform it in a manner conducive to the end in view under one or other of these descriptions may every sort of occupation which was is or ever can be exercised by any human being be comprised occupations of the studious kind consisting in the acquiring or endeavouring to acquire what is called knowledge i e the obtaining correct conceptions and judgments in relation to the subject in question but without action in any shape except that which is exerted or employed in the attainment of those conceptions and the formations of those judgments may be called speculative the acquisition of science is the result or object of occupations of the speculative class in the exercise of occupations which consist in the performance of some operation consists the exercise of art to the number of the disciplines—the arts and sciences taken together—the nature of the case admits not of any fixed limit at any given period suppose the actual number of them to be what it may for adding to that number the nature of things will always furnish two courses one is logical decomposition taking in hand any discipline that at present has a name considering the name of it as a generic name and giving a particular name to some species now for the first time distinguished from all other species contained under that generic name and now for the first time fitted out with a particular name for itself the other is taking out of the waste field of ordinary and undenominated practice a mode of operation and transplanting it into the enclosed and cultivated field of disciplines of arts and sciences of things capable of being known there is not anything that may not be considered as the subject of a science of things capable of being done there is not anything that may not be considered as the subject or object of an art among things capable of being known between such as are considered as subjects of science and any which are considered as not being subjects of science the only distinction that can be assigned is this—viz that in the one case the thing is supposed to be capable of being known without effort exertion study in the other case not—effort viz either when it is considered in and by itself or when it is considered in respect of some relation to other things without the knowledge of which relation it is regarded as not being properly speaking capable of being known—the relation being such as is considered as not being capable of being known without effort but by this account of it every such distinction it is seen cannot but be an indeterminate one efforts vary in degree down to 0 and on the occasion of the knowledge of that object to the knowledge of which effort is in the instance of this or that individual necessary in the instance of this or that other individual no perceptible effort will be necessary in so far as among an assemblage of things there exists such a relation as has the effect of causing such assemblage to be considered as constituting a whole if in so far as in the case of the class of men in question that whole be of such a nature as that the knowledge of that whole or any considerable portion     of it is considered as requiring a considerable degree of effort for the obtaining of it this whole will naturally be considered as constituting the object of a science and so in the case of anything which by a man has occasion to be done to a considerable extent different assemblages of these noscenda and facienda of these subjects or objects of disciplines have received names—separate and specific names and in some of these instances the discipline has been commonly spoken of and considered as a science in others as an art where the effort considered as necessary to the knowing what is to be known is considered as greater than the effort considered necessary to the knowing what is to be done the discipline has been put upon the list of sciences in the opposite case upon the list of arts the use of these observations is to obviate perplexing doubts and useless and interminable disputations doubts and disputes the effect of which is so far and so long as they have place to keep involved in clouds the whole field of intellection including not only the whole field of art and science but the whole field of ordinary life and conversation the several disciplines being each of them a means of happiness or wellbeing considered with relation to mankind taken in the aggregate the thing to be desired with a view to their happiness is that the quantity of disciplines should at all times be as great as possible say for shortness—subservient to the maximum of happiness is the maximum of disciplines but each portion of discipline requiring for the acquisition of it a corresponding portion of time and various disciplines being of such a nature that the acquisition of them requires in the character of a condition precedent and sine quâ non the possession of a particular situation in life such that the number of those within whose reach the faculty of occupying it is comparatively inconsiderable hence it is that to no one individual is the possession of this maximum of disciplines at any point of time possible section iii relation to wellbeing the most instructive bond of connexion to all arts and sciences logic say the aristotelians is the art by which the mind of man is conducted to the tabernacle of knowledge let us now add—in its road to the temple of happiness in this route then happiness is the polar star by which our steps will be guided—the test to which the several portions of knowledge will be subjected—the standard by which their value will be tried by the relation which the respective disciplines bear to happiness the relation they bear to each other will be indicated and brought to view and in this manner a new mode of training will be applied to the celebrated encyclopedical tree cultivated with so much ingenuity and success by bacon and dalembert handmaid or rather governess to each individual art and science logic beholds comprehended within her all comprehensive domain the particular domain of each section iv application of logic to advancement in the other branches of art and science by one single memento as much may be done towards advancement in all the several branches of art and science as by everything put together that can follow it on the occasion of every art and science place before you continually the use or uses capable of being made of it always with reference to happiness in so far as capable of being influenced by it for shortness say look out for the end in view more shortly still and for strengthening the impression borrowing an ancient and foreign language—aspice finem only by attention to the end—only in so far as attention is paid to the end can improvement in any shape be made only with reference to use understand always to the augmentation of happiness in some shape or other has knowledge how consummate soever any claim to attention—only by its subserviency to practice has knowledge any use—only by its subserviency to art is science in any shape of any use by science we mean knowledge considered in respect of the attention employed in or requisite to the attainment of it such being the course recommended with a view to advancement whether in respect of the mode of learning and teaching the art and science in its present state or by giving extension to the quantity of knowledge possessed and the success with which the art is practised at present—of this memento what is the use and need—whence does it arise answer it arises from the fact—that the course commonly pursued is a different one it consists in proceeding in the track in which others have proceeded eyes directed constantly to the investigation of that track never turned directly to the end in view blind imitation track—goose track—sheep track—geese follow the first that starts—sheep follow the bellwether the track that presents itself as leading to the end in view is the track pointed out by reason—the track that others have travelled in or are supposed to have travelled in is the track pointed out by custom changing the metaphor—let reason be fruitful custom barren so preached bacon but hitherto with comparatively small effect—with     small effect in comparison with what the reasonableness of the instruction upon the face of it would lead us to expect to preserve the image the fruitfulness of reason has been that of the foumart—of custom that of a doerabbit so little frequented is this only reasonable course that whoso in the study of any science or practice of the corresponding art is seen to pursue or suspected to pursue it is in such sort and to such a degree thereby distinguished from the general run of the cultivators of that same art and science as to be regarded as standing alone and affecting singularity and as such becomes the object of a mixture of contempt and jealousy and envy—of contempt in so far as this practice of his is regarded as indicative of folly—of jealousy in so far as his success and thereby his chance of superiority with reference to the person thus occupied in making observation of him is an object of apprehension—of envy in so far as it is a subject matter of conviction and belief innovation is the word by the use and application of which expression is given to the sentiment of displeasure towards the person in speaking of the practice of the practice and by reason of it the practiser it is made known that they are sources and objects of a sentiment of displeasure in the breast of the person by whom the word innovation is thus applied chapter vii clearness in discourse how to produce it and hence of exposition section i seats of unclearness—the words or their connexion—exposition what a sentence in the grammatical sense of the word sentence consists either of a single proposition in the logical sense of the word proposition or of a number of such propositions if of one only it may be termed a simple sentence—if of more than one a compound sentence a proposition is clear in proportion as it is clear—that is free—at the same time from ambiguity and obscurity clearness is on every occasion relative—relation being had to the person considered in the character of hearer or reader there exists not nor ever will exist any proposition that is perfectly clear to every hearer and reader there exist but too many that neither will be nor ever have been to any one—not so much as to those by whom they were respectively framed instances are not however uncommon where ideas which in the mind of him by whom the discourse meant for the communication of them was uttered were perfectly clear are expressed in such a manner as not to be clear to any one else clear in the conception—clear in the expression—clear in neither—clear in the conception alone not in the expression if in the conception a set of ideas were not clear it is not natural that they should be clear in the expression yet by accident it may happen to them so to be where unclearness why not unclearness as well as uncleanness has place in a discourse the seat of it will be either in the words or in the syntax—in some one word or number of words each taken singly i e without regard to the mode of their connexion or in that mode itself in the state of their mutual relations with reference to the import of each other in so far as the seat of the unclearness is in the words taken singly—clearness has for its instrument exposition exposition is a name which may with propriety be applied to the designation of every operation which has for its object or end in view the exclusion or expulsion of unclearness in any shape—to the operation and thereby for such on the present occasion is the poverty and thence the ambiguity of language to the portion of discourse by which the end is endeavoured to be accomplished and by which the operation of accomplishing it is considered as performed section ii subjects to which exposition is applicable be the exposition itself what it may a subject it cannot but have—a subject to which it is applicable this subject—what may it be what are the diversifications of which it is susceptible questions to which in the first place an answer must be provided why because on the nature of the subject will depend the nature of the mode of exposition of which it is susceptible in relation to the subject of this instrument of clearness two observations require to be brought to view in the first place   the subject of exposition viz the immediate and only immediate subject is in every case a word   that word is in every case a name ie a word considered in the character of a name exposition supposes thought—a word is a sign of thought how imperfectly soever—in a manner how deficient soever in respect of clearness—thought it is true may be expressed by signs other than words—by inarticulate sounds—by gestures—by deportment but as often as any object has been considered in the character of a subject of or for exposition that object has been a word—the immediate     subject of exposition has been a word—whatsoever else may have been brought to view the signification of a word—of the word in question has been brought to view—the word is not only a subject but the only physically sensible subject upon and in relation to which the operation called exposition has been performed of the two cases which follow for the purpose of this inquiry convenience seems to require that the first place should be allotted to the case where the exposition takes for its subject an object proposed to be expounded as well as the word with the assistance of which in the character of its sign the object is proposed to be expounded—the second place to the case where without reference to any particular object or class of objects the exposition takes for its subject a word considered in the character of a sign which for the designation of some object or class of objects is wont to be employed section iii mode of exposition where the thing which is the subject is an individual—individuation—individual and generic thus much being premised the word in question is either the name of an individual object or the name of a species or sort of objects if it be the name of an individual object individuation is the general name by which the only mode of exposition of which regard being had at the same time to the subject the name of an individual object is susceptible individual individualization or say individuation—generic or specific individuation—by these two denominations may be distinguished two modes of individuation which for practical purposes may require to be distinguished individual individuation is where in relation to an individual object an indication is endeavoured to be given whereby or by the help of which an individual object may be distinguished from any or all other individual obects wherewith it is regarded as being liable to be confounded take for instance on the surface of the earth the designation of the several distinguishable portions which it contains and into which physically or psychically speaking it is capable of being divided in so far as the portion in question is considered as relatively large geography is the portion of art and science to which with the help of astronomy the individuation of the object is considered as appertaining—topography in so far as it is considered as relatively small from geography will be sought on the surface of the terraqueous globe the portion distinguished by the name of europe from geography again in europe england—in england london and westminster from topography in london and westminster queens square westminster and queens square place generic or specific individuation—by this appellative may be distinguished the operation which has place in the case where regard being had to a genus of objects as distinguished by a generic name instructions are given having for their object the causing men to be agreed in determining within what limits or bounds an individual when designated by and under that name shall be considered as limited so as to be distinguished from all objects which are regarded as liable to be confounded with it—or in relation to any individual aggregate likely to be considered as designated by that name of what elements that aggregate shall be considered as composed the field of law is the field in which the demand for this mode of individuation for this mode of exposition is most copious and most urgent and the use of it most conspicuous and incontestable in the individuation of moveable physical objects the instruments are conjunct portions of time and space—axiom no two portions of matter can exist at the same portion of time in the same portion of space section iv mode of exposition where the teacher and learner have no common language   representation—if all words were significative of real entities and if these were all objects which might at all times be brought within the reach of the perception both of the learner and the teacher exposition would be easy and consist in the pointing to the object in question and pronouncing at the same time the word which it is wished to attach to it as its name this is exposition by signs and may be termed representation among persons who have no common language by which they can communicate their ideas this is at first the only practicable method and we see it continually exemplified when a child is taught to speak or a foreigner who understands no words with which we are acquainted or who cannot make use of dictionaries or any other written explanations of our words is instructed in our language     next to these names of real entities perceptible and present those which are the most readily expounded by representation are names of collective fictitious entities by representing successively a number of objects comprehended in the collective fictitious entities—book plant c we may easily succeed in attaching to those words in the learners mind a general idea of the sense we attach to them and which though at first very vague and imperfect will at any rate serve as the groundwork of the discourse by which a clearer and more correct exposition may subsequently be given a generic idea once formed the meaning of words indicative of specific differences may be deduced from it still by mere representation not perhaps the substantive names of that class of fictitious entities called relations but those abbreviate words called adjectives which designate at once the relation or property and the fact of its being attributed to the object represented a great book a little book a yellow flower a red flower c may be thus expounded whilst the explanation of the words greatness and smallness colour c may require one or other of the species of discourse which are comprehended among the other modes of exposition as yet however we have but substantives and adjectives and without verbs no discourse can be held—no farther exposition given and consequently no clear ideas communicated we must again have recourse to representation but in a manner far more complicated taking verbs expressive of operations as the most simple it will be necessary to repeat the operation in question within the reach of the senses of the learner a number of times more or less considerable according to his intellectual powers before we can have any security for his attaching to the word the idea we wish to convey thus by taking successively a variety of things and alternately putting them in motion and pointing to them whilst at rest and pronouncing on each occasion either the words i move naming the thing whatever it may be or the name of the thing with the words at rest the constant repetition of the same word will soon cause the mind of the learner to attach to it the idea required a phenomenon which appears to depend particularly on that passive property of the mind which may be designated by the name of habit it is evident however that great mistakes may frequently occur in the learners mind in these cases—if for instance all the things represented as being in motion happen to be red and all these which are spoken of as being at rest are white he may just as well attach to the words i move the meaning red and to these at rest the meaning white as the signification intended to be conveyed the exposition by representation of the substantive verbs to be and to have and of prepositions and other expletives necessary in the composition of discourse must then be undertaken but it will in most cases be still more complicated and consequently still more liable to misconception as soon however as any tolerable degree of certainty is obtained of the having conveyed a sufficiently adequate idea of the signification of these several classes of words extensive enough to form a connected discourse a more exact exposition may then be undertaken in that one of the other modes which may be found most suited to the object in question section v modes of exposition by comparison with words intelligible to both teacher and learner the two modes comprehended under this head are translation and etymologization   translation—exposition by translation is performed by mentioning a word already known to and understood by the learner and by giving it as expressive of the same idea or image of the one represented by the word to be expounded the proposition man is what you a spaniard call hombre oxide of hyrodgen is what you in ordinary conversation call water are expositions by translation of the words man and oxide of hydrogen this operation supposes the ideas represented by the word in question to be equally wellknown to both learner and teacher and in that case only will this mode suffice if the idea entertained by the learner with reference to the words hombre or water be not exactly the same as that of the teacher as will frequently be the case a further exposition is necessary by some other mode from the two examples given above it may be inferred that exposition by translation may be usefully employed for two distinct purposes  st for teaching words in the same language more convenient for particular purposes because they are those made use of by this author or that practitioner with whom it is the learners interest to become conversant or  dly because the word is more convenient for use than the one the learner is already acquainted with sets of words thus translated for the use of particular classes of learners and arranged in an order convenient for reference are compiled under the name of dictionaries of languages dictionaries of technical terms dictionaries of synonyms and may furnish examples of the very extensive use of the mode of exposition in the case of the two latter dictionaries however very few expositions are by mere explanation particularly in the case of synonyms this name having been unfortunately     given sometimes to words which have exactly the same meaning sometimes to those which have nearly the same meaning an inconvenience which i shall more fully expose under the head of synonymation in physical sciences where the use of exact exposition has been so much felt of late the word synonym has retained its correct signification and the name of synonomy is given to a collection of results of translation and may serve as an excellent example of this mode of exposition applied to the second of its two abovementioned purposes a similar synonomy or translation of the leading words of many ethical noological or pathological works would throw a singular light upon many subjects of controversy between authors hitherto irreconcileable   etymologization—by etymologization i do not mean to indicate that long and uncertain investigation of the various changes and transformations of sense and sound which a word has undergone in the course of time—that search after etymology which leads into so many blunders and which though sometimes productive of a certain degree of advantage to the study of some sciences is more frequently of no other use than mere momentary amusement the operation i have now in view is the exposition of inflected words and conjugates by the exhibition of the root from which they are derived the distinction between inflection and conjugation will be more fully given when we come to the analysis of language in the meantime for the understanding of the above definition i shall only mention that i comprehend under the terms inflected words and conjugates all such words as are modified in part so as to change their signification corresponding modifications being applicable with the same effect to a number of other words the original words thus to be modified go under the name of roots thus from the root rego are derived the several inflected words and conjugates rexi rectum regnans regnum interregnum rex regalis c c in all cases where each inflection has a particular name which as well as the root is equally well understood by both learner and teacher exposition by etymologization will suffice and should be preferred to any of the succeeding ones as being next in simplicity to translation thus the expression rexi is the first person singular perfect tense and indicative mood of the verb rego childrens is the genitive case plural number of the substantive child—reader is the name of the operator that relates to the operation to read—will immediately give a clear and correct idea of their meaning to one who understands already the names of the classes of inflection first person plural number perfect tense indicative mood genitive case operator relating to an operation and of the roots rego child to read whenever this is not the case etymologization will not suffice but even then whenever an inflected word occurs it is almost always more advantageous to reduce it to its root to expound that root and to explain the class to which the inflection belongs as a general rule we may say that exposition by etymologization as well as by translation should be given whenever the case admits of it either alone or in conjunction with any of the other modes section vi modes of exposition where the subject is a class   definition meaning the sort of operation and correspondent work ordinarily understood by that name   operations and works incidentally employed as preliminary and preparatory to that of definition say preparatory operations   operations incidentally employed as subsequential and supplementary to that of definition say supplementary operations   operations which in certain cases in which the purpose cannot be accomplished by definition—understand by definition in that same form require to be performed in lieu of it—say succedaneous operations by one or other of these subordinate appellations may the operation of exposition in every shape of which it is susceptible it is believed be designated to define a word is to give indication of some aggregate in which the object of which it is the sign is comprehended together with an indication of some quality or property which is possessed by that same object but is not possessed by any other object included in that same aggregate elliptically but more familiarly to define a word is to expound it by indication of the genus and the difference—per genus et differentiam say the aristotelians in this account of the matter two things it may be observed are howsoever inexplicitly assumed viz   that the object in question belongs to some nest of aggregates   that it is not itself the highest the most capacious the allcomprehending aggregate of the nest in other terms that the word is not of the number of those the import of which is not included in the import of any other of the words employed in giving names to aggregates that it belongs to some nest of aggregates and that it is not itself the most comprehensive and allcomprehensive aggregate of the nest the genus represented by a word which is the name of that aggregate in which all the other aggregates of the nest to which it belongs are contained and included has no genus which is superior to it it is therefore in its nature incapable of receiving a definition meaning always that mode of exposition which in modern practice seems to be universally understood by that name†     meantime the class of words which are in this sense of the word incapable of receiving exposition in that shape are among those in the instance of which the demand for exposition is the most imperious for these then that mode of exposition is necessary to which by the description of succedaneous modes of exposition reference has just been made and of which an account will presently be endeavoured to be rendered yet of these words which are all of them incapable of receiving a definition in effect definitions are very generally not to say universally wont to be given with a degree of unconcern and confidence not inferior to that with which the operation is attended when the subject upon which it is performed is with the strictest propriety susceptible of operation in that mode section vii of exposition by paraphrasis with its subsidiary operations viz phraseoplerosis and archetypation bisection   explanation of these modes of exposition and of the case in which they are necessary paraphrasis is that mode of exposition which is the only instructive mode where the thing expressed being the name of a fictitious entity has not any superior in the scale of logical subalternation connected and that necessarily with paraphrasis is an operation for the designation of which the word phraseoplerosis i e the filling up of the phrase may be employed by the word paraphrasis may be designated that sort of exposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition having for its subject some real entity a proposition which has not for its subject any other than a fictitious entity nothing has no properties a fictitious entity being as this its name imports being by the very supposition a mere nothing cannot of itself have any properties no proposition by which any property is ascribed to it can therefore be in itself and of itself a true one nor therefore an instructive one whatsoever of truth is capable of belonging to it cannot belong to it in any other character than that of the representative—of the intended and supposed equivalent and adequate succedaneum of some proposition having for its subject some real entity of any such fictitious entity or fictitious entities the real entity with which the import of their respective appellatives is connected and on the import of which their import depends may be termed the real source efficient cause or connecting principle in every proposition by which a property or affection of any kind is ascribed to an entity of any kind real or fictitious three parts or members are necessarily either expressly or virtually included viz   a subject being the name of the real or fictitious entity in question—  a predicate by which is designated the property or affection attributed or ascribed to that subject and   the copula or sign of the act of the mind by which the attribution or ascription is performed by the sort of proposition here in question viz a proposition which has for its subject some fictitious entity and for its predicate the name of an attribute attributed to that fictitious entity some sort of image—the image of some real action or state of things in every instance is presented to the mind this image may be termed the archetype emblem or archetypal image appertaining to the fictitious proposition of which the name of the characteristic fictitious entity coustitutes a part in so far as of this emblematic image indication is given the act or operation by which such indication is given may by termed archetypation to a considerable extent archetypation i e the origin of the psychological in some physical idea is often in a manner lost—its physical marks being more or less obliterated by the frequency of its use on psychological ground while it is little if at all in use on the original physical ground such psychological expressions of which as above the physical origin is lost are the most commodious for psychological use why—because in proportion as it is put out of sight two psychological expressions derived from two disparate and incongruous physical sources are capable of being conjoined without bringing the incongruity to view when the expression applied to a psychological purpose is one of which the physical origin remains still prominent and conspicuous it presents itself to view in the character of a     figurative expression—for instance a metaphor carried for any considerable length through its connexions and dependencies the metaphor becomes an allegory—a figure of speech the unsuitableness of which to serious and instructive discourse is generally recognised but the great inconvenience is that it is seldom that for any considerable length of time if any the physical idea can be moulded and adapted to the psychological purpose in the case of a fictitious proposition which for the exposition of it requires a paraphrasis having for its subject a real entity which paraphrasis when exhibited performs in relation to the name of the fictitious subject the same sort of office which for the name of a real entity is performed by a definition of the ordinary stamp viz a definition per genus et differentiam—the name forms but a part of the fictitious proposition for the explanation of which the sort of proposition having for its subject a real entity is in the character of a paraphrasticallyexpository proposition required to compose and constitute such a proposition as shall be ripe and qualified for the receiving for itself and thereby for its subject an exposition by paraphrasis the addition of other matter is required viz besides the name of the subject the name of the predicate together with some sign performing the office of the copula—the operation by which this completion of the phrase is performed may be termed phraseoplerosis phraseoplerosis is thus another of the operations connected with and subservient to the main or principal operation paraphrasis bisection   exemplification in the case of the fictitious entity obligation for exposition and explanation of paraphrasis and of the other modes connected with it and subsidiary to it that which presents itself as the most instructive of all examples which the nature of the case affords is that which is afforded by the group of ethical fictitious entities viz obligations rights and the other advantages dependent on obligation the fictitious entities which compose this group have all of them for their real source one and the same sort of real entity viz sensation the word being taken in that sense in which it is significative not merely of perception but of perception considered as productive of pain alone of pleasure alone or of both pain it is here to be observed may have for its equivalent loss of pleasure pleasure again may have for its equivalent exemption from pain an obligation viz the obligation of conducting himself in a certain manner is incumbent on a man i e is spoken of as incumbent on a man in so far as in the event of his failing to conduct himself in that manner pain or loss of pleasure is considered as about to be experienced by him in this example—   the exponend or say the word to be expounded is an obligation   it being the name not of a real but only of a fictitious entity and that fictitious entity not having any superior genus it is considered as not susceptible of a definition in the ordinary shape per genus et differentiam but only of an exposition in the way of paraphrasis   to fit it for receiving exposition in this shape it is in the character of the subject of a proposition by the help of the requisite compliments made up into a fictitious proposition these compliments are   the predicate incumbent on a man   the copula is and of these when thus added to the name of the subject viz obligation the fictitious proposition which requires to be expounded by paraphrasis viz the proposition—an obligation is incumbent on a man is composed   taking the name of the subject for the basis by the addition of this predicate incumbent on a man and the copula is the phrase is completed the operation called phraseoplerosis i e completion of the phrase is performed   the source of the explanation thus given by paraphrasis is the idea of eventual sensation as expressed by the names of the different and opposite modes of sensation viz pain and pleasure with their respective equivalents and the designation of the event on the happening of which such sensation is considered as being about to take place   for the formation of the variety of fictitious propositions of which the fictitious entity in question viz obligation or an obligation is in use to constitute the subject the emblematical or archetypal image is that of a man lying down with a heavy body pressing upon him to wit in such sort as either to prevent him from acting at all or so ordering matters that if so it be that he does act it cannot be in any other direction or manner than the direction or manner in question—the direction or manner requisite the several distinguishable sources from any or all of which the pain and pleasure constitutive of the obligation in question may be expected to be received viz the several sanctions distinguished by the names of the physical sanction the popular or moral sanction the political including the legal sanction and the religious sanction—these particulars belong to another part of the field and have received explanation in another place† to that other place it also belongs to bring     to view the causes by which the attention and perception of mankind have to so great an extent been kept averted from the only true and intelligible source of obligation—from the only true and intelligible explanation of its nature as thus indicated on the exposition thus given of the term obligation may be built those other expositions of which it will form the basis viz of rights quasi rights or advantages analagous to rights and their respective modifications as well as of the several modifications of which the fictitious entity obligation is itself susceptible section viii of modes of exposition subsidiary to definition and paraphrasis   synonymation—indication of some other word or words the import of which coincides or agrees with the term to be expounded more or less correctly the use to be derived from the employment of synonymation consists in maximizing the number of the persons by whom conception clear of obscurity and ambiguity and incorrectness may on each occasion be collected from the several expressions it is not however without great danger of error that any two words can be stated as synonymous   antithesis—indication of some other word or words the import of which is opposite to that of the word in question   illustration—bringing to view some word or words by which in any one or more of the above ways or in any other way or ways light may be thrown upon the import of the word in question i e the import of it may in some way or other be rendered clearer i e more surely clear as well of obscurity as of ambiguity   exemplification—indication of some individual or of some lesser aggregate as being included in the name of the aggregate in question without any difference or at any rate without any difference worth remarking all these subsidiary modes of exposition seem capable of being applied with equal propriety and utility whether the main mode of exposition be in the form of a definition or in the form of a paraphrasis   description is a detailed exposition of those properties the exhibition of which is not necessary in order to distinguish the object in question from all such which are not designated by the same name it may accordingly be more and more ample to an indefinite degree a definition is a concise description a description is an enlarged definition description may be considered as referring to an individual in which case it may be termed individual description or as referring to the name of a collective entity in which case it may be termed specific the differences in use and importance between individual and collective description are analogous to those which distinguish the corresponding operations of individuation and definition definition applies to an indefinite number of individuals connected together only by those properties exhibited by that operation and therefore by means of it whensoever any individual is brought to view a decision may be formed whether it does or does not belong to the aggregate in question the individual characterized by individuation is unique being unique every property described as belonging to him must have belonged to him at the time and place of his individuation but the greater the number of properties enumerated the less chance is there of their aggregate being possessed in common by other individuals or of their not having undergone any change other than such as may be accounted for and calculated upon during the change from the time and place fixed by the individuation description therefore though itself uncertain as to answering the purpose intended is the only mode of exposition which can efficiently be adopted in such cases   parallelism is the pointing out of certain particular properties of a thing with a view to the showing the resemblance it has to some other thing its use is to resolve any doubts which may arise either from imperfect conception or imperfect expression whether the object in question does or does not belong to the class of objects expounded comparison is an act by which distinction and parallelism may be indifferently carried on   enumeration is the exhibiting the nature of the class of things characterized by any name by bringing to view the names of certain subordinate sorts of things or even certain individual things which it is meant to signify it may be complete or incomplete enumeration is arithmetical or systematical systematical enumeration is by division or rather is accompanied with and performed by division it is the gathering up and naming of the parts which result from the division of the whole   ampliation is the declaring concerning any word that it has been or that it is intended that it should be understood to have a more extensive meaning than on certain occasions people it is supposed might be likely to attribute to it—that is to comprehend such and such objects over and above those objects which they it is supposed would be apt to understand it to comprehend   restriction is the declaring concerning any word that it has been or that it is intended it should be understood not to have so extensive a meaning as on certain occasions people it is supposed might be likely to attribute to it—that is not to comprehend such and such objects of the number of these which they it is supposed would be apt to understand it to comprehend     section ix distinction and disambiguation what—in what cases employed distinction or real antithesis is the pointing out of certain particular properties of a thing with the view of showing its dissimilarity to some other particular thing with which it is apprehended it may be confounded in such manner as to be deemed either the same with it or more similar to it than it is in reality distinction precedes division in the scale distinction exhibits the relation of the object to the equally ample objects its congeners division breaks it down into its component species distinction is a fragment of a supposed preceding division of an ampler term bearing the ratio of a genus to that in question disambiguation is distinction applied to words such is the imperfection of language instances are numerous in which the same words have the same audible with their attendant visible signs and in the same language have been employed to designate objects that have nothing in common be the word what it may if so it be that it is wont to be employed in more senses than one between or among which no coincidence either total or partial is perceptible when at the same time while by one person it is received in one sense by another person it is received in another different sense—an operation necessarily preliminary to definition is distinction or disambiguation in other words when so it happens that the word in question has been employed in the character of a sign for the designation of several objects insomuch that without further explanation it may happen to it to be taken as indicative of one object when by the author of the discourse it was meant to be indicative not of that but of a different one what for the exclusion of such misconception may every now and then be necessary is—an intimation making known which of all these several objects the word is in the case in question meant to designate and what other or others it is not meant to designate take for example the english word church this english word is uniformly considered and employed as the correct and complete representative of the latin word ecclesia which in other letters somewhat different in appearance serves for the designation of the same sound as the correspondent greek word in french eglise   among the greeks in its original acceptation ecclesia was employed to signifiy an assembly of any kind it was manifestly from the union of two words εχ and ϰαλεω which signified to call out viz for the purpose of a joint meeting and more particularly of a joint meeting for a public for a political purpose   thence among such of the first christians whose language was greek it came to signify in particular such assemblies as were held by these religionists as such whether for the purpose of devotion or conjunct economical management   in an association of this kind there was commonly at least one member whose occupation consisted in taking the lead in their common exercises of divine worship and by the exposition of that book or collection of books which by all of them was recognized as constituting the standard of their faith and action to administer instruction to the rest the operations thus performed being considered as serviceable with reference to the persons at whose desire they were performed the persons by whom they were performed were accordingly sometimes designated in consideration of such their services ministers the latin word for servants sometimes in consideration of their age presbyters from πϱεσβυτεϱοι which was the greek word for elders i e for men of any description when advanced in age from which word presbyter the french word prestre and the english word priest sometimes in consideration of their acting as overseers or overlookers overlooking and overseeing in relation to deportment the behaviour of their disciples the members of the association at large επιςϰοποι episcopi whence the english word bishop in process of time those members of the association whose occupation originally with or without pay consisted on the occasion in question in acting as the servants of all came to act as rulers over the members at large at first on this or that particular occasion at length upon all occasions at this time besides the other senses of which mention will require to be made presently the word church came to signify according to the purpose which by those who were employing it it was designed to serve three very different assemblages of persons viz   the whole body of the persons thus governed   the whole body of the persons thus employed in the government of the rest and   the allcomprehensive body or grand total composed of governed and governors taken together when the persons in question were to be spoken of in the character of persons bound to pay obedience then by the word church was meant to be designated these subordinate subjectmembers of the association in a word the subject many when the persons in question were to be spoken of in the character of persons to whom the others were bound to pay obedience then by the same word were designated the ruling few when for the purpose   0 of securing in favour of both parties and especially of the ruling few the affections of respect and fear then would the import of the word open itself and to such an extent as to include under one denomination the two parties whose situations and interests were thus opposite   from designating first the act of calling together an assembly then the assembly composed of all persons and no other than all persons actually assembled together at one and the same time in a particular place and then all the persons who were regarded as entitled so to assemble at that place it came also to be employed to designate the place itself at or in which such assembly was wont to be held the place consisting of the soil the portion of the earths surface on which for containing and protecting the assembly from the occasional injuries of the weather a building was erected and such building itself when erected such as above being the purpose for which the sort of building in question was erected viz the paying homage to god god although present at all times in all places was regarded as being in a more particular manner present at and in all places of this sort attentive to whatsoever was passing at all other places but still more attentive to whatsoever was passing in these places being thus as it were the dwellingplaces of god these places became to the members of the association objects of particular awe and reverence of a mixture of respect and terror—they became in one word holy whereupon by an easy and insensible transition this mixture of respect and terror came to extend itself to upon and to the benefit of the class of persons in whose hands was reposed the management of whatsoever was done in these holy places holy functions made holy places holy places and holy functions made holy persons on the score of beauty admiration on the score of kindness and tenderness love on the score of fitness for domestic management and rule respect these affections are in use to find their joint object in the character or relation designated by the word mother admiration love and respect on the one part all these are on the other part so many instruments of governance the servants of the subject many had their assemblies for acting in such their capacity and securing to themselves the faculty of continuing so to do of these assemblies the members were some young some middleaged some elderly men upon contemplating themselves altogether in the mirror of rhetoric it was found that of all these males put together was composed one beautiful female the worthy object of the associated affections of admiration love and respect—the holy mother church besides this this holy female was seen to possess a still greater quantity of holiness than could have entered into the composition of the aggregate mass of holiness composed of the separate holinesses of the several holy males of which she was composed had they not in the abovementioned holy place been thus assembled and met together by ordinances issued by this holy female a greater and surer measure of admiration respect and consequent obedience was obtained than would have been obtained by the assembly in its plain and original character of an assembly of males notwithstanding all their holiness by this combination thus happily accomplished an effect no less felicitous and convenient than it was holy was produced in the holy compound while all the perfections of which both sexes are susceptible were found united all imperfection as if by chemical precipitation were found to have been excluded the holy men might notwithstanding their holiness have remained fallible the holy mother was found to be infallible her title to implicit confidence and its naturally inseparable consequence implicit obedience became at once placed upon the firmest ground and raised to the highest pitch great is the scandal great to all welldisposed eyes the offence if to her own children or any of them a mother has been an object of contempt proportioned to the enormity of the offence is the indignation of all welldisposed spectators the magnitude of the punishment which they are content to see inflicted on the score of it and the alacrity with which they are ready to concur in promoting the infliction of such punishment how much more intense that indignation should any such indignity be offered to that holy character should her servants or even her ordinances be violated flowing from the maternity of this holy this sanctified this sacred character—to all these epithets the same venerated import belongs they deserve the same respect how convenient and useful the result when an edifice of the holy class has been erected and duly consecrated proportioned to the holiness the sanctity the sacredness bestowed upon it in and by its consecration is the enormity of any offence by which it has been profaned and its sanctity violated when again an edifice of the holy class has been erected and duly consecrated the more sumptuous the more magnificent the more lofty the more admirable the more venerable the structure the greater the calamity the wider the ruin the more intense the shock arising from its being subverted the more intolerable the apprehension of the danger of its being subverted the more intense and implacable the indignation excited towards and pointed against all persons regarded or considered as capable of being the authors or promoters of so shocking a catastrophe already has been seen the advantage derivable and derived by and to the rulers of the church themselves being that church by     the creation of a church capable of being violated here may now be seen the advantage producible and produced by and to the same rulers of the church from the creation of a church themselves being that church capable of being subverted by any unholy person is this holy will in any particular opposed or threatened to be opposed—that same sacrilegious unholy profane unbelieving infidel miscreant reprobate person is already a violater and in intention a subverter of the church worthy of all indignation all horror all punishment all vengeance which it is in the power of any dutiful and worthy son of the church to contribute to pour down upon his devoted head in the above example may be seen an instance of that impracticability which is liable to have place—the impracticability of exhibiting a definition of the term in question where the import of the term is such that antecedently to any such operation a division of the contents of such its import requires to be made its imports being in such sort compound and diverse that no one exposition which shall at the same time be complete and correct can be given of it in the particular instance here in question although before any correct definition could be given it was necessary that an apt division should be made yet when once such division has been made the need of any ulterior exposition in the shape of a definition may perhaps be seen or supposed to be pretty effectually superseded other instances might perhaps be found in which such ulterior exposition might still be requisite beard—do you mean the beard of a man beard—do you mean the beard of a plant—for example barley or wheat by these questions division is already made and then for the instruction of any one to whom he being acquainted with other sorts of wheat it had not happened to him to have heard of the sort called bearded wheat some sort of an exposition in the shape of a definition might be necessary in the above instance the imports how widely and materially soever different might however be seen to be connected with each other by a principle or chain of association but the more important especially in respect of practical purposes the difference is as also the more liable the several senses are to be mistaken for each other and that which in one sense is not true however in another sense it may be true to be understood in the sense in which it is not true the more material is it that whatsoever distinction has place should be brought to light and held up to view in all matters relative to the church in so far as concerns the interests of the members of the church the good of the church ought to be the object pursued in preference to any other by each of two persons this proposition may with perfect sincerity have been subscribed but according as to the word church the one or other of two very different and in respect of practical consequences opposite imports has been annexed their conduct may on every occasion be with perfect consistency exactly opposite one meaning by the word church the subject many—the other by the same word the ruling few at the same time the number of pronounceable changes of which the letters of the alphabet are susceptible being how ample soever not altogether unlimited instances cannot but have place in which to one and the same word divers imports altogether uninterconnected by any such bond of association may have happened to be attached many however are the instances in which of two or more in appearance widely different imports the connexion though real may not be generally perceptible in french by one and the same word worms and verses are designated between two objects so widely dissimilar in any mind would there have existed any principle of connexion—possibly not in this instance possibly no such connexion has had place but neither is the contrary impossible the french vers is from the latin versus a verse but in latin vermes is the name of a worm in the same language verto is to turn and who can say but that of versus and vermes this verb verto may have been the common root tread upon a worm and it will turn says an english proverb and in the construction of verses how much of turning the stock of words of which the language is composed requires is no secret to any person by whom a copy of verses has ever been made or read section x modes of exposition employed by the aristotelians in the preceding sections we have seen what the species of discourse called an exposition is and of what modifications it is susceptible of some of these no conception appears to have been entertained by the aristotelians others it will now be seen have been noticed by them and stand comprised under the head of definitio definition of these modes by far the most important is the one styled in the language of ancient logic definitio per genus et differentiam it consists in an indication given of a certain class of objects to which the object in question is declared to belong that class being designated by a denomination styled a generic name but the case being such that the object in question is not the only object which belongs to that class some mark is at the same time attached as indicative of some property which is possessed by the object in question and not possessed by any other individual     or subclass of objects included in that same class here then it may be seen already to what a degree the ancient logic—for these  000 years the only logic—has in this by far the most useful track of it the tactic branch been all this while deficient its defectiveness of arrangement forms a sort of counterpart to its defectiveness in respect of argument as exemplified in its list of fallacies† to objects in general the system of division has never yet been applied though towards exhibiting the indefinite chain of divisions one other advance it is true had been made by the ancient logic this advance consists in the use of the term genus generalissimum by this term intimation how obscure soever was given of these links—of the three highest links in this chain by the term genus generalissimum was designated the first class by the genus which was not the genus generalissimum but of narrower extent and comprised within it the next class and by the term species a class which was to the genus what the genus was to the genus generalissimum—a bisubclass assigning the appropriate genus being one of the two operations included in the idea of a definition according to this exclusively common acceptation of the word the consequence was that whatsoever names were of such sort that no genus in the import of which the classes respectively indicated by them were contained were afforded by the language in use of the words so circumstanced no such exposition as a definition properly so called could be furnished susceptible of receiving a definition in this usual and indeed only sense of the word definition a term cannot be unless it belong to and form a step in some assignable scale of aggregates related to each other in the way of logical subalternation this word definition has in many cases been used as the collective designation for all modes of exposition sanderson does not however appear to have fallen into this error he always using definitio alone as the name of the genus and definitio per genus et differentiam as the name of the particular species in the foregoing chapter his example in this respect has not been followed both on account of the difficulty there would be in finding a more appropriate singleworded denomination for the species and on account of the more expressive nature of the word exposition as the name of the genus the bishop has certainly not succeeded so well in the very first exposition he had occasion to give in his chapter on the subject of the very word definition‡—definitio he says est definiti explicatio and what we may ask is explicatio the answer might with equal clearness be explicatio est explicati definitio the words employed are synonymous and the one as easy to be understood as the other not one of the rules of exposition laid down in the next page are followed in this case in fact no new idea is at all conveyed if any tolerably correct conception can be formed of what he meant by definitio it must be gathered up from the subsequent enumeration of its species and not from this exposition his first division of the subject nearly coincides with its division into the exposition of words alone and of objects connected with words but he falls into an error by giving to the results of this division the designations of definitio nominis and definitio rei every exposition being the exposition of a name the difference consisting in this—that in one case we consider the name alone in the other the object in conjunction with that name without which we cannot speak nor perhaps think of any fictitious entity or of any real one which is not present to our perception no mention is made of exposition by representation—the only mode that can be employed where the parties in question have no common language the division of definitio nominis would appear to comprehend the modes of translation and etymologization whilst definitio rei may have been intended to mark the distinction made above into necessary and subsidiary modes of exposition by the first such properties only being exhibited as are necessary for exact exposition by the latter other properties being presented to view for the purpose of facilitating comprehension exposition by paraphrasis for want of a due conception of its nature is put into the latter class the genera generalissima and those fictitious entities to which that mode applies being designated as things not susceptible of a perfect exposition of definition they certainly are not susceptible but the exposition of them by paraphrasis may be quite as perfectly applied as definition to real entities of modes of description the enumeration or rather exemplification is very imperfect the first and last examples are alone applicable frui est uti cum voluptate is a definition sol est mundi oculus belongs to archetypation frigus est absentia caloris is mere translation the four canones definitionis correspond with the four properties desirable in discourse—  definitio verbis propriis perspicuis usitatis et ab omni ambiguitate liberis exprimatur refers to clearness of expression nihil contineat     superflui to conciseness nihil desit to completeness sit adequata definitio to correctness how far the author has himself followed these rules has already appeared in an instance derived from this chapter the modus investigandi rerum definitiones detailed in the fifth paragraph are sources of classification and belong to that head his division of definitio lib iii cap    refers also to that subject chapter viii of division section i of the different modes of division division is either systematical or unsystematical systematical division is the indication of the species without the assignment of their reciprocal differentiæ division may be complete or incomplete the following is an example of complete and exhaustive division—vitale est vel sensitivum i e animal vel non sensitivum i e planta sensitivum est vel rationale i e homo vel irrationale i e brutum strict division is bipartite loose division is multipartite division imports separation the separation has not been performed if the parcels are not distinct they are not distinct if any object which is included in the one is included in the other physical and psychical—under one or other of these two epithets may every possible mode of division be comprised physical where the subject matter to be divided—say the dividend—is a physical body or aggregate psychical where it is a psychical or say an ideal aggregate viz any aggregate of objects individually assignable or unassignable for the designation of which a common name or say appellation has been provided of these modes the first—the physical—is the only original and proper mode it is the archetype of the other the ideal aggregate is feigned to be—is considered as being a body a mass of matter any number of lesser aggregates into which they being contained in it it is considered as being capable of being resolved are considered as so many parts into which it is considered as capable of being divided of these two modes the psychical is the only one that belongs to the present design the only one employed in the exercise of the art of logic in an institute of that art the physical would not have had any title to a place had it not been for the light which it may serve to throw upon the explanation which it may serve to give of the psychical which has been deduced from it it is by arrangement in a line of subalternation in this mode and no other that the operation of division understand of psychical division can be performed in the character of a dividend a name constituting a receptacle of a comparatively larger content is assumed its contents the articles contained in it are lodged in two or more other receptacles so constituted in respect of extent as to contain all of them together the exact amount of the contents of the dividend or greater receptacle the aggregate contained in the greater receptacle being considered as divided the component articles or units of the aggregate mass are considered as distributed among the compartments which by such division have been created section ii of bipartite dichotomous or perfect division† be the subject of discourse and the purpose for which the subject is taken in hand what they may correctness and with reference to the end completeness—these are the two qualities which every man in proportion as it is his desire that the expression given to his thoughts should be at once true and useful would be desirous should be found to appertain to it for correctness at large not much instruction can be given without special reference all along made to the particular nature of the subject and the purpose in view i e the portion of the field of thought and action operated upon but be the purpose and the subject what they may correctness will in a considerable degree depend upon clearness correctness of conception on the one part upon clearness of expression on the other and in so far some instruction on the subject of correctness has already been endeavoured to be administered but a case may be brought to view nor that a narrow one in which correctness altogether depends upon completeness insomuch that if the discourse be incomplete it is certain to the exact amount of the degree of incompleteness to be likewise incorrect such it is evident is the case in so far as it has happened to a man to undertake whether for his own sake or for the sake of others that his view of the subject and accordingly the expression which he gives as the result of that view shall prove complete towards the accomplishment of an object at once so desirable and at the same time so much above the reach of human power logic may perhaps be seen to afford a sort of instrument or engine of greater power than might readily have been imagined this engine is the exhaustive mode of division     to answer its intention in the completest manner an analysis or division must always be throughout dichotomous the condividents says the logical compend ought to be distinct and opposite every division is a distribution of individuals—an assignment of distinct names simple or compound univocal or multivocal under which as if in ideal compartments these individuals may be found these compartments were marked out in the mind of him who distinguished them marked out by certain properties or qualities in such sort that an individual possessing such a property was deemed to belong to such a compartment an individual possessing such another property to such another compartment for the purposes of discourse these respective groups of individuals are distinguished by certain names corresponding to these properties—one name denoting that the individuals it is applied to the individuals comprisable within the compartment it denominates possess all of them such a property or set of properties another name that the individuals it is applied to possess another property or set of properties now the use of different names is to distinguish different individuals—to distinguish the individuals possessing one property or set of properties from the individuals possessing another property or set of properties—in so much that if on any occasion a man wish to be understood to say of any one individual or set of individuals what he wishes not to be understood to say of another he may have the means of making himself understood accordingly conceive then a group of individuals which are known apart and distinguished from other individuals by a certain name of a part of this whole number of individuals is it wished to say something which it is not wished to say of the remaining part in what way then is this to be done there is but one way that is by dividing in imagination the whole set into a certain number of lesser sets—in the present instance into two in other words by distributing the whole assemblage of individuals into two compartments in one of which shall be contained all the individuals to which it is wished to apply the proposition in the other all those to which it is not wished to apply it—and these compartments that they may be known wherever there is occasion to bring them to view must be characterized each by a peculiar name a division to answer this purpose must be exhaustive must comprise the whole of the subject call the parcel to be divided a instead of dividing it into two parcels only such as b and c divide it at once into three parcels b c and d is this division as satisfactory as it might be no it will probably be perceived that it is not though the reason may not be immediately perceived what then is the reason it is as follows—it exhibits all the discongruencies of the three parts or members but it does not exhibit all their congruencies let them be properly distributed and named that is so distributed and named that to no article to which one of the names is applied could either of the other two names be applied then no a that is a b is either a c or a d no a that is a c is either a b or a d and no a that is a d is either a b or a c the discongruencies between these several sets are sufficiently expressed—expressed by the circumstance of their being condivident members of the whole in question according to a plan of partition which is announced to be an exhaustive one but on the other hand there is a congruency between them which is not expressed—every a which is a b agrees with a c in this that is not a d—every a which is a c agrees with a d in this that it is not a b—and every a which is a d agrees with a b in this that it is not a c it is plain therefore that a instead of being divided into three parcels b c and d might always in the first instance be divided into two only b and c for of the three parcels any two may be consolidated into one having this property in common that no a that belongs to either of them belongs to a third and this plan of division is the more simple of the two first step—every a is either a b or a c second step—every b is either a d or an e in the first step the attention gets repose it has but two compartments to examine in order to see that every a belongs to one or the other of them—which is shown by the circumstance of their having for names the name a with an epithet and that no a that belongs to the one belongs to the other in the case of an aggregate of the physical kind the greatest number of integral parts into which it is capable of being divided is always a determinate number in a bushel of apples containing  00 apples— 00 is that number in a bushel of wheat containing  00000 grains of wheat— 00000 is that number in a garden containing every species of plants suppose       to be the number of each different species—      is that number these       plants each of them of a species distinguishable from every other species suppose it required so to divide into subordinate and lesser aggregates the universal or allcomprehensive aggregate of which by the supposition the word plant is the name—to divide it in such sort that by a series of successive divisions from the descriptions given of the products of these several divisions it should be made to appear in what points each of these       plants coincided with and in what points it disagreed with the description given of every other the following is the only mode of proceeding by which the object can be accomplished—divide the whole     aggregate into two equal parts or say divisions divide each of these divisions into others which call divisions of the second order—calling the two firstmentioned divisions divisions of the first order each of these divisions dividing always by two divide into divisions of the third order—the total number of divisions eight and go on dividing always by two until the whole number of the component aggregates thus formed comes to be       the assumed number of different species of plants this mode of division is termed from the greek dichotomous from the latin bifurcate—twoforked this mode of division is subservient to the obtaining of the properties of clearness and correctness in respect of the conceptions formed and entertained of the subject matter of consideration assured and altogether incontrovertible is its allcomprehensive or say exhaustive property—it has place at the very first step or stage of division—it has place at every other be they ever so numerous at every step one article of information it affords as equally incontestible—it shows a point of agreement and a point of difference between the two results which it brings to view—point of agreement the properties belonging to the genus of which they are species—point of difference some property which the one has the other has not still however of all the distinguishable species contained in the highest genus the genus generalissimum scarcely are there any limits to the number of those which may still remain unincluded at the same time still do there whatsoever be the number remain means of reaching them by fresh divisions from new sources this points to another resource for aiding the mind in the performance of this task when after a first division the allcomprehensive process has proceeded on in a course of subdivision till it have picked up as many of the objects belonging to the source as are found capable of being designated by it if any remain unarrested and unsorted look out for a fresh source of division and go on as far as that will carry you if any still remain behind unenlisted look out for another source of division and so on when in a number more or less considerable divers sources have thus been employed and exhausted take in hand the sources themselves apply to them the exhaustive mode of analysis their eventual points of agreement and difference will at any rate be elicited and if the articles that require to be taken up are not all of them enlisted some fresh means of enlistment may perhaps be brought to view section iii of the aristotelian rules of division by the aristotelians no division was recognised as legitimate or at any rate as perfect unless it were exhaustive the object to be divided being termed the dividendum the parts into which it is divided and which constitute the result of the operation the dividing or condivident members—follow according to sanderson under the name of canons of perfect division the following rules†   let the parts be such as that by their union the whole shall be recomposed membra absorbeant totum divisum   the dividend is greater in extent than any one of its members—it cannot but be equal to all of them when put together divisum esto say rather est latius singulis suis membris adæquatum universis   let the condivident members in their import be distinct from and opposite to each other—in such sort adds an explanation that they be not liable either in any point to be coincident or to be confounded membra condividentia sint contradistincta et opposita ita ut confundi nequeant vel coincidere   the members which are produced by each division let them be the nearest and immediate members and let the number of them be as small as may be divisio fiat in membra proxima et immediata et quam fieri commodè potest paucissima from the nearest result thus formed continues the text in the way of explanation to the more remote and minute portions descend by subdivisions a proximis porro ad remotiora et minutiora descendendum per subdivisiones the dichotomous mode of division it goes on to say is that which has been most approved of where it can conveniently be employed dichotomiæ dichotomies sunt laudatissimæ ubi commodè haberi possunt nor yet continues this explanation ought it to be everywhere hunted after too superstitiously and anxiously pursued as it is by the ramæans non tamen nimium superstitiosè et anxiè ubique venandæ quod faciunt ramæi an example unfortunately not a very unfrequent one of the conjunction of selfsufficiency and emptiness may be seen in the account of dichotomy as above delivered of the existence of a state of things in which dichotomy can be employed commodiously intimation is given and in that state of things says the instructor dichotomies are most praiseworthy things what is that state of things to any such question not so much as any the smallest endeavour and attempt is made to find an answer what renders the deficiency the more to be regretted is the danger which it seems there is of dichotomies being too superstitiously and     anxiously hunted after a danger which in the practice of the sort of persons here called ramæans meaning it should seem the followers of a certain peter ramus had actually been realized upon the whole however of two propositions relative to the matter in question viz the dichotomical or bifurcate mode of division intimation is hereby given viz   that there are certain cases in which this mode of division has its use—  that there are cases in which—forasmuch as in those cases it either has no use at all or none but what is outweighed by inconvenience—the practice of employing it may be considered as matter of abuse let us see whether some criterion may not be discernible whereby the one of these classes may be distinguished from the other section iv relation of synthesis to analysis psychical or say logical division supposes the antecedent existence of psychical aggregation a bushel of apples a bushel of wheat cannot be divided until it has been collected psychical division has no subject but the ideas commonly called general ideas these general ideas are all aggregate or say abstract ideas formed by aggregation and abstraction out of simple ones of the aggregate thus formed the extent is determined and measured by that of the import of the term the appellation employed for the expression of it if of this extent the amplitude be in a certain degree considerable the aggregate idea of which that appellative is the sign will hardly have been formed but that antecedently to its formation some other aggregate idea or ideas less ample in extent and in their whole contained within the one in question will also have been formed formed and by their respective appellatives designated and fixed thus in a country in which human society has in the scale of civilisation reached the pastoral state an appellative correspondent to the word animal will scarcely have been formed till after the two appellations corresponding respectively to the words man and sheep have been formed and brought into use by the observation of the properties which are possessed by all men and not possessed by any sheep the aggregate idea expressed by the word man will have been formed by the observation of those properties which are possessed by all sheep and not possessed by any man the aggregate idea expressed by the word sheep will have been formed in the instance of man the properties which are common to all men can never have been presented to the senses of any man but at the same time the properties by which the several different men that have come under observation have differed from each other have also and at the same time been presented to his senses the respective aggregates composed of the several simple ideas presented by each of these men respectively may be termed individual aggregates the aggregate composed of the several simple ideas drawn alike from the contemplation of all these several men and fixed and designated by the classical term man may be termed a classical aggregate† in the formation of the aggregate idea corresponding to the term man in the formation of the classical psychical aggregate termed man the attention has turned itself aside from all the several simple ideas that have alike been presented by the abovementioned individual aggregates turning itself at the same time and therefore confining itself to such of those simple ideas as have been presented by every individual belonging to that class comprehended under that appellative and those to which it has thus exclusively turned itself and confined itself it may be said by so doing to have abstracted i e drawn off from the rest it is thus that to the process or operation by which in this way classical aggregates are formed the term abstraction has been applied and to the classical aggregates themselves the term abstract ideas as well as general ideas these explanations premised the time may have come for observing that where of the name of a classical aggregate the extent is to a certain degree considerable it will scarcely have been formed but by repeated exercises of the process of abstraction a certain cluster of ideas having been first abstracted or as it were distilled from the cluster contained in the several individual ie physical aggregates and from the product of this first distillation others drawn off to compose what may be termed a classical aggregate of the second stage from the bottom from this product of the second distillation others again drawn off to compose an aggregate of the third stage from the bottom and so on by certain terms which in the description of this process have sometimes been employed viz synthesis and analysis it seems as if it had been taken for granted that the two operations thus denominated were each of them the exact counterpart and converse of the other that the stages passed over in the one process and in the other would everywhere and on all occasions be exactly the same consequently the number of those stages likewise and that whatsoever had by synthesis been put together the putting of that asunder—of all that     as far as they both went and no more than that—was the operation performed by analysis wide indeed from the truth of the case would any such conception however be found small has probably been the number of the successive operations of the kind in question—viz abstractions by which—correspondently small the number of the stages in passing in or through which the idea of the most amply extensive classical aggregate of which the mind is capable of forming to itself an idea has in this way been formed of this most extensive aggregate termed by the logicians of antiquity the genus generalissimum being or existence or entity is the name five or at the utmost six is the number of successive distillations by which this most sublimated and refined of all abstract ideas has as appears been formed five or at the utmost six has accordingly been the number of steps successively taken by the mind in its ascent towards this most exalted pinnacle five or at the utmost six the number of stages at which it has stopped of these abstractions these distillations these steps these stages the number corresponds to and is indicated by the number of the ramifications exhibited by the famous porphyrian tree and of these operations and their results indication has been given and at the same time recordation made by the names respectively employed for the designation of the classical aggregates of different amplitudes which have been their respective products far indeed from being thus limited is the number of aggregates of different orders capable of being formed by the decomposition of that allembracing aggregate division the first allcomprehensive—divide the aggregate of universal amplitude being or substance into its two aggregates immediately issuing from it you have corporeal beings and incorporeal for corporeal beings say in one word bodies as on the other hand for incorporeal beings in one word spirits division the second—divide the aggregate corporeal beings into its proximate component aggregates living and not living for its proximate component aggregates you have those endued with life and those not endued with life to which latter description belong mineral bodies division the third—divide the aggregate corporeal beings endued with life into its proximate component aggregates you have such as are endued with animal life with sensation as well as life say in one word animals and such as are not endued with sensation as well as life say in one word vegetables it was from the observation and contemplation of individual animals and from the observation made of a quality which such of them as were most exposed to observation had in common with one another and which was not observed or observable in vegetables viz the habitual act of respiration that the common name expressive of the faculty corresponding to the exercising of that act viz animal was first formed here then are four stages which have place alike in the ascending and the descending line but in the descending line between the psychical aggregate designated by the word animal and the individuals from the observation of which the existence was deduced of that faculty from which the classical appellative of that aggregate was deduced as above there has been framed a whole nest of physical aggregates one within another in a long chain or series of intussusceptions or enclosures and so in the case of vegetables another such series and so in the case of minerals another such each such box with its companions at the same distance from the allenclosing box being the result of a division which at that part had been made of the contents of that larger box within the limits of which they had all of them been contained though at a few of the highest stages the steps taken in the ascending line and the steps taken in the descending line are coincident agreeing with one another in number—in the line of ascent they were taken with the sevenleagued boots of fairy land assisted by the wings of the genius imagination in the line of descent they were taken by observation retarded at every step by reflection and discernment and in several tracks by experiment taken in their original acceptation synthesis and analysis the synthetic method and the analytic are packing and unpacking the latter operation being the exact converse or reverse and counterpart of the former the road the same the stages or stepping places the same the direction alone different and that opposite but very different it has been seen from a course thus simple in description is the course taken by the mind when occupied in working in the field of logical method instead therefore of the number of integral parts contained in a logical aggregate being a limited in a word a given a determinate or at any rate a determinable number as it would be were it not for the powers—the unlimited powers of decomposition and recomposition possessed by the human mind—of these powers one effect is to exclude as fruitless every possible attempt at circumscribing within any limited extent the number of such parts into which a logical whole is capable of being divided in the case of physical aggregates it may be done but not so in the case of logical ones take a bushel of apples the number of integrant parts of that aggregate each apple constituting one of those integrant parts will be     the number of apples that were put into the bushel neither more nor less some years ago the aggregate number of all the species of plants then known was estimated at  0000 suppose a garden and in it a specimen of every one of these  0000 species  0000 neither more nor less is in this case the exact number of integrant parts into which the aggregate here in question is capable of being divided but upon this supposition  0000 is not equal to the number of integrant parts called species into which the logical aggregate designated by the names of plant and vegetable is capable of being divided in this supposed case for every species there is one individual and no more for every individual one species and no more but as within the extent of one species an indefinite number of individuals may be and habitually are contained so from any one individual much more from a greater number of individuals an unlimited number of species may be deduced no new species it is true can be formed except so far as in description it is capable of being rendered different from every species which had been described before it had ever been described but in regard to any of the observable species of natural bodies taken as they come out of the hands of nature this is a condition of the failure of which no reasonable probability seems to present itself take for instance the  0000 different species of plants that having some years ago been said to be the number of those species already known to be in existence of these there exists not any one which has not some property or aggregate of properties which is not to be found in any of the others and which constitute that difference or say differential character whereby it stands distinguished from every other of these differences the ideas were respectively formed in the mind by the process of abstraction they were formed from the observations made of some individual plant or plants which at the time of observation were respectively considered as belonging to those same species on this occasion in the formation of any such species what was done was not to take for the character or essence of the species every mark whereby the individual in question the individual or individuals then and there observed was seen to differ from all individuals that had ever been observed before but only some one or other small number of these marks for in all the different species of plants that have thus been formed take any one whatsoever answerable to the description how ample and particular soever of that one species will be found individuals in a multitude absolutely inexhaustible no two of them so perfectly similar but that upon a simultaneous comparison differences perceptible and describable differences between them might be found hence it is that the denomination given to the operation by which the fictitious aggregates created by the joint powers of observation and imagination or by the imagination alone is abstraction out of an indefinite number of peculiar marks by which the several really existing individuals lying open to observation are distinguishable the mind fixes upon some one or other comparatively small number and leaving the others unnoticed and in this way separating them from these others makes its own use of them applies to the purpose in question the property or properties thus abstracted establishing them in the character of so many marks whereby the thus newformed species and as many individuals as will ever come to be included under it i e be found to exhibit marks of the same description are made to stand distinguished as supposed from all other species and individuals that are every have been or ever will be in existence section v misapplication of the terms synthesis and analysis to geometry and algebra expressing the difference between geometry and algebra is another of the purposes to which the opposite terms synthesis and analysis with the methods respectively denominated from them viz the synthetic method and the analytic method have been employed but between these two branches of science no such difference or distinction will be found as that of which intimation is given by that pair of correspondent and opposite appellatives     in geometry quantity is never considered but with relation to figure in algebra it never is considered with relation to figure of the difference between these two branches of mathematics this account is at once true short and clear and no other account that is in equal if in any degree at all endowed with these qualities will it is believed be found in algebra as well as in geometry—in geometry as well as in algebra—that which is unknown or supposed to be unknown is inferred from its relation to that which is known or supposed to be known in algebra unknown quantities as expressed by letters are made known by means of the relation they bear to known ones as expressed by figures in geometry unknown quantities as expressed by figure and supposed to exist as between figure and figure or parts of the same figure are made known by means of the relations they bear to known quantities as expressed by figure in geometry true it is that objects are put together quantities known and unknown are put together whereupon of such as are unknown a description is given and a conception conveyed by means of the relation they bear to certain known ones of geometry this is true nor is it less so when applied to algebra a quantity is mentioned to me of which i wish to know the amount it being as yet unknown to me by the amount in this case is always meant the amount in numbers for in truth the subject of algebra is number—numbers and nothing else suppose the number in question six—in answer to my question what is the number the number six is not mentioned by that name but i am told it is that number which is as great again as number three or half as great exactly as number twelve simple as they are either of these answers is already algebra and it is thus that by algebra the known and unknown quantities being put together a description of such as are unknown is given and a conception conveyed by means of the relation they bear to certain known ones chapter ix of methodization otherwise termed arrangement†‡ section i subjects to which it is applicable at the very first mention of the mental operation thus denominated a distinction requires to be brought to view a distinction respecting the nature of the subjects or objects to which it is applicable for according as it is considered in its application to the one or the other of the two very different subjects or classes to which it is applicable for the most part altogether different and disparate will be found to be any rules from which the application of it may be capable of receiving direction and assistance on the one hand a group of subjects or objects of any kind considered as distinct separate and detached from one another on the other hand the fictitious body entitled a discourse—a discourse of any kind a literary composition included—considered in respect of the mutual relations of which its several distinguishable parts are susceptible of the operation termed methodization or arrangement the fictitious object the fictitious receptacle called method is the fictitious result or produce when a number of objects are considered as methodized they are said to be put into a method method as applied to insulated objects method as applied to discourse by these two denominations may the distinction between the two branches of method resulting from the consideration of the two great fields to which   0 it is applicable be it is hoped commodiously brought to view the two species or modes of method thus constituted may be compared with and observed to bear some analogy to the principle of the fundamental division applied of old to the field of quantity viz that which corresponds to the distinction for the expression of which the terms discrete and continuous were employed by discrete—quantity number or rather numbers being designated by continuous quantity that which by the juxtaposition of its ultimate parts presents the idea expressed by the words form figure configuration conformation or shape for illustration and explanation take a discourse having for its field any portion of the field of natural history in this particular field will be comprised a portion more or less considerable of the whole number of distinct and distinguishable subjects belonging to that general field to the aggregate of these subjects the species and that the only species of method or methodization applicable will be that to the designation of which as above the compound denomination method as applied to insulated objects or more shortly to objects has been appropriated but of any discourse which has taken for its field any portion of the field thus brought to view any part in and by which the art of method is applied to these same objects will have constituted but one part how large soever in comparison with the whole and while for the guidance of the mind in the disposition to be made of these same objects one set of rules and observations will be adapted another and a very different set of rules and observations will be found requisite for its guidance in the task of putting together the ideal fabric termed a discourse section ii methodization as applied to objects—its two principles or modes principle of successive exhibition—principle of connected aggregation applied to subjects or objects methodization is an operation which in so far as it has any determinate and useful import attached to this its name bears an indispensable though not a very prominent nor in general sufficiently apparent relation to the particular end or purpose to which it is or ought to be regarded as subservient methodization supposes a multitude of articles on which in the quality of subjects it has to operate and in so far as it is apt and useful it is effected by making such a disposition of them as promises to render them as far as depends upon itself subservient to that purpose physical and psychical as in the instance of so many others so in the instance of the present subject this presents itself as the first distinction which the nature of the subject requires to be brought to view physical in so far as the articles to which this operation is applied are so many portions of matter psychical in so far as they are so many ideas creatures of the mind of the immaterial part of the human frame psychical entities i e ideas not being capable of being communicated or so much as fixed and rendered determinate otherwise than by means of the words employed to serve as signs of them hence in so far as psychical methodization is in question words will be the instruments by which whatsoever is done will all along be considered and spoken of as done in so far as in any number whatsoever any objects whatsoever are put together in a particular manner by design directed to a particular end the operation termed methodization or arrangement may be considered as performed and the objects so dealt with are said to be arranged or methodized disposition by means of succession or priority and posteriority—disposition without regard to succession or priority and posteriority—under one or other or both of these denominations will every possible mode of methodization be found comprehendible and with equal propriety it will be found applicable to arrangement in the physical and in the psychical sense priority and posteriority are relations that apply alike to place and time on this occasion of the two predicaments place is the one of which the conception is commonly the most simple why answer because where it is in respect of place that a number of objects are to be arranged they may be all of them designated at the same time in such sort as to be present to the view of the individual in question at the same time whereas if they are to be arranged with reference to time without being arranged with reference to place they cannot be brought to the view of the same individual at the same time audible signs are the only signs by means of which objects are capable of being arranged according to priority and posteriority in respect of time otherwise than by means of reference to priority and posteriority in respect of place by visible signs priority and posteriority in respect of time is no otherwise designated than by priority and posteriority in respect of place by tangible signs they may be designated in either of these ways to tangible signs the organs may be applied successively or all at once but if all at once the number to be distinguished must not be large methodized by means of priority and posteriority objects must be disposed in such manner as to exhibit altogether some conspicuous and familiar figure of all figures the most familiar is a right line objects disposed in such manner as to     exhibit a right line are said to be disposed in a row in that case if the position of the row be vertical the article to which priority is ascribed will be that one which stands highest if horizontal that one which is nearest to the position from which it is designed to be viewed methodized otherwise than by means of priority and posteriority objects may be said to be methodized by aggregation by simple and promiscuous aggregation by enclosure—by being shut up altogether as it were in a box to physical and psychical methodization this distinction is alike applicable fifty guineas disposed in a row are methodized by means of succession enclosed altogether in a rouleau—a sort of extempore paperbox—they are methodized by aggregation and enclosure or inclusion where the number is thus great the superior convenience of the principle of aggregation and enclosure as compared with the principle of succession has been experienced by the gamesters whose invention it was and of this convenience the existence is evidenced by their practice displayed in a row such a number would have required time and labour for the counting of it and more for the reunion recollection and redisplay of it disposed in a rouleau an aggregate in the instance of which the number of its elementary parts is known no counting no collection no redisplay is necessary in the psychical mode of methodization arrangement of the names of the objects in a determinate figure such as a line vertical or horizontal is arrangement on the principle of lineal succession arrangement of them under a common denomination is arrangement on the principle of aggregation and enclosure the name the common denomination is as it were the box the rouleau in which they are enclosed and by which they are kept together section iii methodization—its uses—purposes to which it is applicable in the whole field of the art of logic so large is the portion occupied by the art of methodization—so large and at the same time so difficult to confine within any certain determinate limits that the task of showing what it is that the art of method can do is scarcely distinguishable from the task of showing what the art of logic can itself do in all its totality of the several distinguishable mental operations to which it belongs to the art of logic to give direction and assistance a list supposed to be a complete one has already been brought to view in this list methodization is but one article in a multitude but in comparison with all these its associates such is its importance that they are all of them but as it were so many instruments in its hands no one is there to which the art of logic is not in some way or other capable of affording direction and assistance but neither is there any one of them to which the art of conducting this same operation termed arrangement or methodization is not in like manner capable of affording direction and assistance if in the style of poetry and rhetoric logic were to be termed a queen methodization method might be termed her primeminister method is not the same thing as invention for from method invention it will be seen as well as the other operations and their correspondent faculties is capable of receiving direction and assistance and a thing cannot be said to be an assistant to itself but method is itself the product of invention—one of the most difficult works that it was ever employed in the execution of in the investigation of the uses capable of being made of this operation or figuratively speaking of this instrument for clearness of conception it will be proper to be careful not to confound this operation with the aggregate of the operations of which logic is capable of taking the direction nor as some appear to have done with the art of literary composition to whatsoever subject applied† coacervation and successive exhibition—these and these alone are strictly and properly speaking the two branches of the art of methodization whatsoever assistance a different and distinguishable operation may be capable of receiving from methodization it is not to methodization alone that the work performed by means of that other operation can with propriety be referred great for example is the assistance which from this source invention has already drawn—still greater perhaps the assistance which it may yet be capable of deriving yet it is not by methodization alone that what has been performed in the way of invention has been performed to chance and to analogy great also have been its debts it has received much favour and assistance from this or that single and insulated analogy presented in some happy moment by the hand of chance functions applicable to any other branch of art and science—in relation to art and science without distinction teaching learning and improving—in relation to art practising in relation to the exercise of these functions method will in every branch of art and science     be found capable of affording useful direction and eminent assistance correctness and completeness in these intimately connected though still distinguishable qualities will be found so many properties desirable in relation to the view taken or the conception formed and retained of the matter of any branch whatsoever it be of science towards conferring on the conception these kindred qualities be the science what it may methodization taken as above in the strictest and narrowest sense of which the word is susceptible will be found rendering indisputably valuable assistance in relation to every other branch of art methodization considered in respect of its successivelocation branch indicates as the object which on the occasion of whatever is done or contrived in the practice of it should always occupy the first place—the characteristic end in view an object correspondent to the end in view is constituted by the properties desirable on the part of the sort of work whatsoever it be which the art in question has for its fruit section iv subjects of methodization by denomination—real entities—fictitious entities of methodization in so far as performed by denomination the subjects the immediate subjects are names and nothing more things yes but no otherwise than through the medium of their names it is only by means of names viz simple or compound that things are susceptible of arrangement understand of arrangement in the psychical sense in which sense strictly speaking it is only the ideas of the things in question that are the subjects of the arrangement not the things themselves of physical arrangement the subjects are the things themselves—the animals or the plants or the minerals disposed in a museum of psychical the names and through the names the ideas of those several objects viz as disposed in a systematic work on the subject of the correspondent branch of natural philosophy—on the subject of zoology botany or mineralogy if of this operation viz methodization by denomination things were the only subjects after names of persons names there would be none other than names of things but of names that are not names of things there are abundantly more than of names that are by things bodies are here meant portions of inanimate substance by this denomination we are led to the distinction the comprehensive and instructive distinction between real entities and fictitious entities or rather between their respective names names of real entities are masses of proper names—names of so many individual masses of matter of common names—names respectively of all such individual masses of matter as are of such or such a particular description which by these names is indicated or endeavoured to be indicated words—viz words employed to serve as names—being the only instruments by which in the absence of the things viz the substances themselves the ideas of them can be presented to the mind hence wheresoever a word is seen which to appearance is employed in the character of a name a natural and abundantly extensive consequence is—a propensity and disposition to suppose the existence the real existence of a correspondent object—of a correspondent thing—of the thing of which it is the name—of a thing to which it ministers in the character of a name yielded to without a sufficiently attentive caution this disposition is a frequent source of confusion—of temporary confusion and perplexity and not only so but even of permanent error the class of objects here meant to be designated by the appellation of names of fictitious entities require to be distinguished from names of fabulous entities for shortness say—fictitious require to be distinguished from fabulous entities to render whatsoever is said of them correctly and literally true the idea of a name requires all along to be inserted and the grammatical sentence composed and constructed in consequence fabulous entities are either fabulous persons or fabulous things fabulous entities whether persons or things are supposed material objects of which the separate existence is capable of becoming a subject of belief and of which accordingly the same sort of picture is capable of being drawn in and preserved in the mind as of any really existent object† of a fabulous object whether person or thing the idea i e the image delineated in the mind by the name and accompanying description may be just the same whether a corresponding object had or had not been in existence whether the object were a historical or a fabulous one fictitious entities viz the objects for the     description of which throughout the whole course of the present work this appellative is meant to be employed are such of which in a very ample proportion the mention and consequent fiction requires to be introduced for the purpose of discourse their names being employed in the same manner as names of substances are employed hence the character in which they present themselves is that of so many names of substances but these names of fictitious entities do not as do the abovementioned names of fabulous entities raise up in the mind any correspondent images follows a sort of commenced catalogue of these fictitious entities of these names of fictitious entities from which the common nature in which as above they all participate will presently become perceptible like the names of real and those of fabulous entities all these words it will be seen are in the language of grammarians nounsubstantives all these fictitious entities are accordingly so many fictitious substances the properties which for the purposes of discourse are attributed to them are so many properties of all substances that the properties belonging to substances to bodies in general are attributed to them—that they are spoken of as if possessed of such properties appears from the prepositions by which the import of their respective names is put in connexion with the import of the other words of which the sentence the grammatical sentence is composed physical and psychical—under one or other of these two denominations may all fictitious entities be comprised let us commence with physical i motion—motions—in the physical world in the order of approach to real existence next to matter comes motion but motion itself is spoken of as if it were matter and in truth because in no other way—such is the nature of language and such is the nature of things—in no other way could it have been spoken of a ball—the ball called the earth is said to be in motion by this word in what is it that is signified answer—what is signified is that motion is a receptacle i e a hollow substance and that in this hollow substance the ball called the earth is lodged a motion or the motion we say of a body the body is one portion of matter the motion is another which proceeds of that is from that substance of names of motions i e of names of species or modifications of motion—vast not to say infinite is the number and variety genus generalissimum is a term employed by the logicians of old to indicate the name of any one of those aggregates which is not contained in any other aggregate that hath as yet received a name the idea of motion necessarily supposes that of a moving body—a body which is in motion or in which the motion is necessarily supposes i e without the one idea at any rate without the one image the other cannot be entertained the idea of motion does not necessarily suppose that of another body or the idea of the motion of another body or the idea of another body from which or from the motion of which the motion in question proceeds or did proceed the planets that they are in motion is matter of observation—whence the motion took its rise is matter of inference or rather of vague conjecture on the earths surface we see various bodies in the act of deriving motion from various primum mobiles but the primum mobile if any from which the earth itself derived the motion in which it is at present what can we so much as conjecture in relation to it where a motion of any kind is considered as having place it is considered either with reference to some person who is regarded as the author of it or without such reference in the latter of these cases motion and nothing else is the word employed in the other case action or operation and in respect of it the author is termed agent or operator ii quantity—next to motion and motions come quantity and quantities quantity is applicable in the first place to matter in the next place to motion of and in are the prepositions in the company of which it is employed a quantity of ink is in the inkglass which stands before me here ink the real substance is one substance quantity the fictitious substance is another which is proceeding or has proceeded from ink the real one the ink which is in the inkglass exists there in a certain quantity here quantity is a fictitious substance—a fictitious receptacle and in this receptacle the ink the real substance is spoken of as if it were lodged in this word quantity may be seen the name of another genus generalissimum another aggregate than which there is no other more capacious in the same nest of aggregates when quantity is considered it may be considered either with or without regard to the relation between part and whole and if considered in one or other of these ways it cannot but be considered the division is therefore an exhaustive one when quantity is considered or at least attempted to be considered without regard to the relation between part and whole it is considered with reference to figure but if without regard to the relation between part and whole the idea of figure be indeed capable of being entertained it is indeterminate and confused quantity according to the logicians of old is either continuous or discrete by continuous quantity they mean quantity considered with regard to figure and without regard to the relation between part and whole by disorets     quantity they mean quantity considered with regard to the relation between part and whole and without regard to figure if the three branches of mathematical discipline be separately considered—continuous quantity is the subject of geometry discrete quantity the subject of arithmetic and algebra but it is only by arithmetic that either in relation to any proposition appertaining to geometry or in relation to any proposition in algebra any clear conception can be obtained divide a circle into any number of parts for instance those called degrees clear and distinct ideas are obtainable respecting the whole and those or any other parts into which it is capable of being divided or conceived to be divided refuse all such division the best idea you can obtain of a circle will have neither determinate form nor use iii quality—quality is applicable to matter to motion and to quantity of and in are the prepositions in the company of which it is employed qualities of bodies or say portions of matter animate or inanimate are good and bad viz with reference to mans use qualities of motion i e of motions are quick and slow high and low viz with reference to any object taken as a standard uninterrupted and interrupted c qualities of quantities are great and little determinate and indeterminate i e with reference to mans knowledge of them or conception concerning them qualities of quantities are qualities either of bodies i e portions of matter or of portions of space considered with reference to quantity to the exclusion of every other quality property is in one of the senses of the word synonymous or nearly so to quality as we speak of the quality of a quantity so do we of the quantity of a quality when men speak of the quantity of a quality instead of saying quantity of a quality they commonly say a degree—in a high degree in a low degree—instead of high we say sometimes in a great degree instead of low in a small degree degree in french degré is from the latin gradus a step or stair that which is said to be in a high degree is considered as situated upon the upper steps of a staircase scale in french echelle is from the latin scala a ladder whether the word be staircase or ladder the image is to the purpose here in question much the same iv form or figure—no mass of matter is without form no individual mass of matter but has its boundary lines and by the magnitude of those lines and their position with reference to one another the form the figure of the mass is constituted and determined but neither is any portion of space without its form form or figure or say to possess form or figure is therefore a property or quality of space as well as of matter it is a property common to matter and space a mass of matter may have throughout for its bounds or limits either another mass or other masses of matter or a portion of space or in some parts matter in others space a portion of space cannot in any part have for its bounds anything but matter a mass of matter is said to exist in a certain form to be of a certain form or figure to be changed from one form into or to another v relation—in so far as any two objects are regarded by the mind at the same time the mind for a greater or less length of time passing from the one to the other by this transition a fictitious entity termed relation—a relation is considered as produced the one of these objects—either of these objects is said to bear a relation to the other between the two objects a relation is said to exist or to have place the time during which the two objects are regarded or kept under consideration is as above for shortness spoken of as the same time it should seem however that with exactly the same degree of attention objects more than one cannot be regarded considered examined surveyed at exactly the same instant or smallest measurable portion of time but that on the occasion and for the purpose of comparison the mind is continually passing and repassing from the one to the other and back again i e vibrating viz after the manner of the pendulum of a clock this motion viz vibration the motion acquired by an elastic cylinder or prism in which the length is the prevalent dimension on its being suddenly dragged impelled or drawn and let go in a direction other than that of its length being the simplest of all recurrent motions is the sort of motion best suited or rather is the only sort of motion in any degree at all suited to the purpose of comparison hence it seems to be that in speaking of a relation any number of objects greater than two are not brought to view for on this occasion the preposition employed is always between never among by the preposition between the number of the objects in question is restricted to two restricted universally and uncontrovertibly hence it is that in methodical division the bifurcate mode is the only one that is completely satisfactory section v of the relation between genus and species from methodization on the principle of aggregation     follows the sort of relation that has place between genus and species the relation by means of which aggregates of different dimensions are lodged with reference to one another in the order called subalternation or introsusception it is from this order—that is from the practice of ranging ideas in this order by means of correspondent denomination that the logical operations called logical division and logical definition took their rise the order in which by the aristotelians the component elements of a system of subalternation are exhibited is the reverse of the historical order in which they made their appearance by these logicians an immense aggregate is held up to view the most extensive of which they were capable of conveying or framing a conception that aggregate is represented as divided or divisible into other aggregates these again each of them into others and so on till at last comes the last link in this sort of chain—a link consisting of an aggregate which not having within it any other aggregates is composed wholly of individuals which individuals must if those spiritual substances are excepted which on the occasion are commonly introduced of course consist of portions of matter being natural bodies or parts or portions of such bodies this order according to which the principle of methodization being in this respect the principle of priority and posteriority the object of largest dimension is that which presents itself in the first instance is called the analytic order or the order of analysis analysis from a greek word which signifies to melt or break down into a number of parts an object considered in the character of a whole the reverse of this is the order of priority as chalked out by the hand of nature sense is the fountain from which all ideas take their rise to sense no objects but individual ones ever present themselves the names first in use must accordingly have all of them been of the sort of names called proper names—names invented and employed for the designation of individual objects from the invention of proper names to the invention of common names must have been a very wide and ample step long may the race have continued before any instance of its being taken actually occurred as often as any separation to the eye happened to take place the first man desiring the presence of the first woman would have need to lift up his voice to give intimation to her of such his desire the sound thus uttered by him would if to any degree of constancy the same sound were repeated become her name in the same manner from the first woman would the first man receive his name in the same manner would the dog—the first dog between which and any part of the human species any intercourse established itself—receive and at the same time learn his name had adam and eve remained childless the human species would never have received at least from human lips a common name on that supposition himself and eve would have been all the human beings whom adam could have had need to speak of for any common name including these two still less for a common name including other human beings in an indefinite number could either of these our first parents have had any use in the language of the modern hebrews and even in the language of the hebrew scriptures the same word which is employed to designate the earliest individual of the human species is employed to designate the species likewise a name employed constantly by adam for designating himself to the exclusion of eve could never have been employed or pitched upon for designating both of them together it was taking a wide step the forming in this way an aggregate denomination and with it an aggregate idea in which the component individuals were determinate it was another and still wider step the forming such a denomination of this sort in which the component individuals were all or any of them indeterminate whether for an aggregate denomination the component individuals of which were determinate any effectual demand presented itself antecedently to a like demand for an aggregate denomination of which the component individuals were indeterminate would naturally depend in good measure upon the number of individuals naturally susceptible of the same denomination that happened at the same time to come within the cognizance of the interlocutors so long as the number of his sheep was small abel would have no need of finding for them an aggregate a specific denomination—the larger and larger it became the more and more urgent would be the demand for an allcomprehensive name of an aggregate composed of determinate individuals the idea and denomination being thus once formed it would not be long before the same denomination would have been found capable of serving for the designation of an aggregate composed of individuals some or all of which were indeterminate—between individual and individual the less wide to any practical purpose were the difference the sooner would the transition from the employment of an aggregate denomination of the more obvious nature to an aggregate denomination of the less obvious nature be made under the direction of an attentive observer geography serves in some sort for supplying the gaps left by history the description of nations exhibiting themselves on different levels in the scale of improvement or to speak more precisely having before them fields of observation of different extent serve when put together to exhibit a simultaneous view     of no inconsiderable portion of the history of the human race in this view the most curious and to the purpose of instruction the most valuable chapter in this sort of contemporary history would be composed of the vocabulary if a complete one could be obtained of a tribe the seat of which supposing it have all along been there was in the narrowest field as yet known in a small and thinly inhabited island or cluster of islands destitute of communication with any other inhabited portion of the globe at otaheite at the time of the discovery of that group of islands dogs and hogs being unless rats were an exception the only quadrupeds with which the human part of its inhabitants were acquainted they had we may be well assured no denomination answering in point of extent to our word quadruped still less to our word animal when to their astonished eyes a horse first presented itself it was classed by them with dogs—it was designated among them by the same common and aggregating name the hog species was as familiar to them as the dog but from its being the name of dog and not that of hog that by them was bestowed upon the first seen horse it appears that in their eyes it was to the dog and not to the hog species that the horse bore the closest resemblance section vi of the porphyrian tree the process or course by which setting out from individuals and these indeterminate men arrived at that level in the scale at which are seated the most extensive aggregates has received the name of generalization it has division logical or psychical division for its converse at this stage of the inquiry the justly celebrated logical instrument called the porphyrian tree presents its claim for notice it took this name from its inventor porphyrius a greek who four centuries after the days of aristotle enlisted himself under his banners as one of his disciples in the track of generalization such had among that ingenious people no one knows how long before the days of aristotle been the progress of generalization that he found rising one above another in that scale words in the greek language employed as the names of the following aggregates   man—  animal—  living thing—  body—  substance in addition to those objects the existence of which is made known to sense for designating other objects the idea of which is presented to us only by abstraction the work of imagination while their existence is pointed out to us by inference he found already in use a word corresponding to our word substance for exhibiting to the senses the relation between the objects standing on different levels of the scale thus composed he employed as an emblem the figure of a tree at the bottom in the place of and as serving to constitute the trunk with its continuation the root he stationed the most capacious of all these aggregates—the halfcorporeal halfideal name substance within the compass of this most capacious aggregate he beheld two lesser aggregates constituting the nearest and lowest branches of the tree one the aggregate composed of such substances as are of a corporeal the other of such as are of an incorporeal nature—those of a corporeal i e bodily nature were in one word bodies—those of an incorporeal nature were in one word spirits taking in hand the aggregate composed of bodies he observed that some had life in them others not—by which word life he designated as well the sort of life ascribed to plants viz vegetable life as the sort of life ascribed to animals viz animal life in these he found two ulterior branches for the corporeal branch of his ideal trunk and root one branch served for containing such bodies as had life in them—the other such as had no life in them leaving the vegetable world as before he had left the incorporeal world undivided he performed the operation of division in the same way with the animal world as he had proceeded with the corporeal—included in this aggregate he observed two ulterior aggregates one in which were included all animals endowed with reason viz human creatures—in the other all animals not endowed with that transcendant gift which last without further division or distinction he drove together in one flock under the name of brutes—and with these rational beings he peopled the one as with the irrational ones the other of the two extreme branches of this emblematical and instructive tree the branch to which he saw the brutes adhering he left as he had left the incorporeal and within it the vegetable world unnoticed as well as undivided brutes being but brutes were not worth distinguishing from each other in a word on no account had they any further claim to notice as to rational creatures they were human beings and in the largest sense of the word man they were men—these were worth distinguishing accordingly from this extreme branch arose a twig representing the aggregate composed of individuals and upon this distinguished by their several denominations which they being individuals were the sort of names called proper names sat perched as the representatives of their fellow beings some of the most distinguished of his contemporaries and their predecessors one defect one but too discernible had unfortunately this emblematic vegetable to the parts of which it is composed the     order of succession which it assigns in respect of priority and posteriority is not the real order in which they came into existence but the reverse of it for those parts of the system which possess in the largest measure the nature of substance viz body in the only shape in which it comes within the cognizance of our senses the station should be on terra firmâ but in the tree of porphyrius its place is aloft in the high and aerial region there it is that the illustrious persons taken for examples of individuals there it is that the socrates the platos and the aristotles are seen quivering upon the extremest twigs the parts from which by abstraction the properties of matter have one after another been drawn off till nothing but a bubble remains to these is appropriated the name of substance these in the altitude of the system occupy that place which in a real tree is in or in immediate contiguity with the earth take a small tree as it grows in a gardenpot continue it in its natural position it represents not the tree of porphyrius but the reverse of it—turn it topsyturvy the stem the bottom of the trunk this occupies the highest place the remotest and slenderest branches the lowest—and then it is if at all that it becomes the correct emblem and faithful portraiture of the tree of porphyrius section vii of scales of or in logical subalternation in the whole field of human thought and action so many aggregates as we have occasion to form and to distinguish in the character of genera generalissima so many are the different scales of logical subalternation in the aggregate which has entity for its name all other imaginable aggregates are comprehended entities are either physical or psychical physical are either real or fictitious psychical again are either real or fictitious real psychical are either present to sense perceptive i e impressions or present to memory i e ideas ideas are either single or say concrete simple or particular—formed without abstraction or general i e aggregate formed by abstraction psychical fictitious entities may be distinguished i e the aggregate composed of the entities termed psychical fictitious entities may be divided according to the faculties to which they respectively bear relation aggregates—any two aggregates which are completely included either of them within the other stand with reference to each other in the relation of logical subalternation and with reference to each other may be said to be commensurable divide the larger of the two you may sooner or later divide it into parts one of which will be the smaller aggregate aggregates no one of which is in any part included within the other may in like manner be said to be incommensurable any number of aggregates which are thus commensurable may be considered as belonging to constituting and may be said to constitute one scale and to belong to one and the same scale and thus we have scales of aggregates and scales of logical subalternation instead of scales of aggregates we may also in so far as the convenience of discourse may be found to require it say nests† of aggregates and speak of two or more aggregates as belonging to the same nest or belonging to different nests aggregates belonging to the same scale of logical subalternation are moreover said to be arranged with reference to one another in systematic order of two aggregates belonging to the same scale the larger may with reference to the smaller be termed superordinate the smaller with reference to the larger subordinate in this way the two only modes or principles of methodization are employed together the one which proceeds on the principle of succession or priority and posteriority being in the character of a type or emblem employed to represent that which proceeds on the principle of aggregation in all scales of logical subalternation there are two fixed points or levels viz that at or on which individuals stand i e the level of individuality or lowest level and that at or on which the genus generalissimum or most extensive and allcomprehensive aggregate stands i e the highest level between these two fixed points or degrees other degrees in any number are wont to be interposed according to the exigency of the case as determined by the nature of the scale and the use made of the aggregates or aggregate terms of which it is composed according to the nature of the art and science to the cognizance of which it has regard for the purpose of scientific arrangement physical entities are commonly considered as composed of three aggregates which or their respective fields are commonly spoken of by the appellation of kingdoms viz the animal the vegetable and the mineral the individuals belonging to the mineral kingdom being neither sensitive nor so much as vital those belonging to the vegetable kingdom vital but not sensitive those belonging to the animal kingdom vivacious and sensitive     in each of these kingdoms between the two points or levels viz the highest and the lowest degrees are placed in any number according to the demand constituted by the state and condition of the science in respect of cultivation and advancement for the formation and designation of these degrees the name of the kingdom constituting the name of the highest aggregate the course taken has usually been to begin with the highest i e the most capacious receptacle from this in order to obtain lesser and inferior aggregates stationed in so many lower levels it became necessary to have recourse to division division say psychical or logical division was the operation necessarily employed in every branch of art and science the use of definition is universally felt and acknowledged but to definition at any rate in the usual sense of the word division psychical or logical division is a necessary preliminary or accompaniment in that sense by definition is meant the indication of a larger aggregate in which the aggregate in question the aggregate for the name of which definition is required is comprised together with the indication of some property or properties by which the aggregate in question stands distinguished from whatsoever other aggregates are likewise comprised under that same larger aggregate distinguished to wit in this manner viz that the property so indicated does appertain to the lesser aggregate in question but does not appertain to those other lesser aggregates from which it is required to be distinguished take for example this definition of the species man man is a rational animal by the word animal indication is given of the larger aggregate within which the aggregate in question the aggregate indicated by the word man is comprehended by the word rational is indicated a quality or property which is considered as appertaining at birth at least and abstraction made of particular accidents to all individuals comprehended within the denomination of that lesser aggregate in question viz man and not appertaining to any other individuals comprised within the name of the aggregate animal but for this purpose and on this occasion and if not antecedently by this means here is a larger aggregate psychically or logically divided divided into two lesser and component aggregates to the one of these two aggregates a name viz the name man is given to the remaining aggregate no name is in and by this same operation given—it is left without a name thus intimately connected are the three logical operations subservient to instructive intercourse viz aggregative arrangement division and definition without previous aggregate arrangement there would be nothing to divide without division there would be no definition at least no definition in which the genus or aggregate referred to and employed for the purpose of explanation or instruction were of any less dimensions than the genus generalissimum the box in which all the other boxes belonging to that nest are included section viii of subalternation and psychical division and definition as applied or applicable to the three physical kingdoms viz   animal   vegetable   mineral since the revival of letters i e of intellectual culture the greater the length of time that has elapsed the greater the quantity of time and thence the greater the number of the persons that have been employed in the observation and examination of the subjects of these three portions of the intellectual world in each part the number of these objects of these sorts of objects all different and distinguishable from each other has received prodigious increase to reduce them to masses of a comprehensible manageable bulk means have necessarily been looked out for of breaking down each of these allcomprehensive aggregates into aggregates of less extent these again into others and so on downwards until under the name of species a range of aggregates were established all situate upon the same level no one of them containing any other aggregates every one of them having for its contents individuals and nothing but individuals for its contents individuals and those not in any number greater than what might without confusion and with sufficient observation of their several points of agreement and difference be contemplated by a scrutinizing eye and an attentive mind the labour whatsoever it be that was or is capable of being bestowed in this direction viz in the way of methodization upon the field of physical science had and has for its sole immediate object the solution of this one problem viz—in the instance of every individual object belonging to every one of the three kingdoms—of every such object in the state in which it is presented to mans view by the hand of nature to set upon it by verbal description only and without seeing it a mark of distinction     such whereby it may be effectually distinguished from every other such individual object except such as are possessed of exactly the same properties or at least of properties so nearly the same as to be capable of being employed instead of it without practical inconvenience long before the stock of physical knowledge had received any such considerable accessions the accomplishment of the solution of this problem with no other help than had been furnished by the language of aristotles logic would have been rendered impracticable the accomplishment of this problem was far indeed from being a work of mere barren speculation practice in every line of art and above all in the medical the most useful of all arts has ever been in no small degree dependent upon it on such or such an occasion an individual object—say an individual plant—has been found possessed of certain serviceable properties—has afforded to a man relief under disease the plant employed the disease appears to be cured but ere long the disease returns the healthrestoring plant is all consumed another plant presenting the same outward appearance might be expected to operate with the same inward efficacy—to be productive of the same happy effect discovery is accordingly made of another presenting to a first view the same appearance—employed in the same manner as the first instead of banishing the disease it exasperates it upon a sufficiently close observation the two plants might have been seen to present even in their outward configuration very material discernible differences—differences from which correspondent differences in respect of their effects on the human body would have been inferred or at least the supposition of their absolute identity disproved and banished but supposing even these outward differences discerned and the salutary inference deduced how minute and momentary would be the benefit the one individual person is for the moment at least put sufficiently upon his guard against the mischief but even himself perhaps on another occasion all others upon all occasions remain exposed to it in a degree more or less serious the like danger may be seen extending itself over the whole field of the three kingdoms for the obviating this danger the nature of the case affords no other means than the giving to the solution of the abovementioned problem an equal and coincident extent in these latter days so far as concerns the physical world comparatively speaking the grand problem wants not much of being accomplished but to the accomplishment of it the stock of methodical terms possessed by the aristotelians wanted much of being sufficient species and genus with the addition of a term floating in the clouds at an infinite and indeterminable distance above these other two composed the whole of it   system of nature the name of the allcomprehensive physical aggregate that divided into the three kingdoms   each kingdom divided into classes   these into orders   orders divided into divisions and   perhaps these into subdivisions by this list of terms is shown the addition made by linnæus section ix division of aggregates—linnæan nomenclature of the subdivisions in relation to the names employed for the designation of the aggregates of different dimensions which are regularly the result of the successive divisions performed in a system of logical subalternation what is to be wished is that in the instance of each intimation should be given in the first place of the number of nests or ranks of aggregates contained in the system secondly of the rank occupied by the aggregate of which the word in question is the name in such a system the most capacious of all the aggregates viz that in which all the others are contained will occupy the first rank those which constitute the result of the first act of division to which it is subjected the second rank those which are the result of the division to which the results of the first division are subjected the third rank the number of nests or ranks will be one more than the number of the acts of division to which the aggregate which occupies the most capacious highest and first rank has been subjected in the system of linnæus if the contents of the whole earth be taken for the first highest and allcomprehensive aggregate the number of nests or ranks of subordinate aggregates constituting the result of the successive divisions to which it has been subjected will when added to that first aggregate the original dividend be found to be seven the number of these successive acts of division being six viz   kingdom   classes   orders   genera   species   varieties for further explanation taking the class for the prime dividend to this prime dividend he applies as synonymous to it and explanatory of it the compound term genus summum highest genus to ordo order the compound term genus intermedium to genus kind the compound term genus proximum to species species nothing but that same appellative to varietas variety the term individuum   unfortunately in this illustration the prime dividend or the allcomprehensive aggregate is omitted so also the result of the first act of division the three physical kingdoms what is done for the purpose of illustration consists therefore in taking the term genus and with two different epithets or adjuncts necessarily latin employed for distinctions sake applying it as synonymous in the first place to class and then again to ordo   0   what is still more unfortunate in this additional tree designed for the illustration of the others he places individuum on the same level with varietas as if the two appellatives were with relation to one another synonymous and interconvertibly employable whereas varietas variety is the name of an aggregate and in that character employed even by himself   for further illustration he gives two other nests of aggregates—the one constituted by the divisions to which the territory of a political state has been found subjected the other by the divisions to which the military establishment has been found subjected unfortunately in both these instances the number of these successive acts of division and subdivision being altogether arbitrary has in different political states and in the same political state at different times been different and moreover as to the denominations which for the designation of them are employed by him the language in which this work of his is written being the latin language it is from that language that they were all of them unfortunately deduced but in neither of those instances does the latin language afford an adequate number of names of aggregates the relation of which to each other in respect of amplitude and capacity were or are found by him determinate the geographical or topographical aggregates which he employs and which are constituted by portions of the earths surface with their divisions and subdivisions are   provinciæ put as correspondent to classis and genus summum   territoria put as correspondent to ordo and genus intermedium   parœciæ put as correspondent to genus and genus proximum   pagi put as correspondent to species   domicilium put as correspondent to varietas and to individuum the political or political official names of aggregates which he employs are   legiones employed as correspondent to classis and to genus summum and to provinciæ   cohortes employed as correspondent to ordo and to genus intermedium and to territoria   manipuli as correspondent to genus and genus proximum and to parœciæ   contubernia to species and to pagi   miles to varietas to individuum and to domicilium   another imperfection varietas may without impropriety be employed as the name of an aggregate and in that character is accordingly in this work of his employed by himself so possibly with the help of explanation might domicilium for example if considered as an aggregate having individual chambers for its constituent parts but by no explanation can individuum be rendered a fit denomination for an aggregate by no explanation can it be rendered a fit denomination for anything but an individual and so in the case of miles section x rules of methodization as applied to objects viz for the performance of methodization by successive exhibition rule i independentia priora—when two words present themselves together for exposition examine and observe whether there be not between them such a relation that one of them and that one alone is capable of being explained while the other remains unexplained and not understood if so be careful that the explanation given of that one shall precede the explanation given of the other reason  —brought to view before the explanation the as yet unexplained article is brought to view without explanation but if without explanation it can be understood the explanation is of no use reason   where of that article in the explanation of which the mention of the other is requisite the explanation given is put first here will be an object more or less unknown and obscure perpetually floating about in the mind and intercepting whatsoever light in the course of the explanation might from any other quarter have been thrown upon the object to be explained and between the two the attention will be distracted and no clear view will be taken of either of them rule ii—qualis ab incepto procedat lucidus ordo unless for special reason in whatsoever order a list of articles announced as about to be treated of has in the first instance been brought to view preserve that same order in the treating of them otherwise thus when in the character of so many articles about to be treated of a list of articles has been brought to view be careful that unless for special reason to the contrary the order in which they are treated of be all along the same as that in which as above they were for the first time brought to view to borrow a phrase from the geometricians the articles     once laid down they should throughout be alike situated reason  —when the same order is thus uniformly observed the relations by which it was suggested are repeatedly and continually held up to view and thereby imprinted more and more strongly and firmly on the memory   while you thus preserve the same order the view which at the outset you took of the subject and the place suggested by that view appears to have been continually approved of and persevered in on the other hand if in the order any change takes place the change will be apt to be regarded as a sign that the view first taken of the subject has been regarded as incongruous that a plan more or less different has taken place of that which at first was meant to be pursued and that accordingly your conceptions of the subject were indistinct and fluctuating   another supposition may be—that instead of bearing in mind the order you had assigned and purposely changing them so it is that in the subsequent stage this order has escaped your memory by whatsoever advantage it was that the order of precedence first employed was suggested this advantage will in proportion to the degree in which that first appointed order is departed from be lost rule iii—include in the same receptacle those objects alone which are designed to receive the same destination shillings and halfpence should not be put up into a rouleau of guineas section xi of methodization as applied to the materials or parts of a discourse or literary composition in any literary composition or protracted mass of discourse such as is the whole such must of course be the parts that which all discourses have in common is the different species of words called the parts of speech and the sentences in different forms composed of those parts of speech and the paragraphs composed of those sentences if besides these parts there were any others that belonged to all discourses in common with one another methodization would be an operation susceptible of application to the parts of a discourse as well as to the entities which are the parts or elements of an aggregate considered as such but to discourses taken in the lump there belong no such common parts but a set of incidents to which discourse of all kinds stands exposed are certain vices or imperfections which in every shape it is liable to labour under   superfluity by irrelevancy   superfluity by repetition in terminis   superfluity by virtual repetition   verbosity   scantiness   inconsistency including selfcontradiction   ambiguity   obscurity   confusedness  0 desultoriness by these appellations are designated so many imperfections by which every modification and mass of discourse is liable to be stained many are the cases in which a suggestion which in the character of a precept of instruction or information would be generally nugatory may yet in the character of a memento not only have but be generally acknowledged to have a real usefulness in one single sentence might be contained a memento adequate to the purpose of putting the reader upon his guard in so far as by mementos inserted in a book men can be put sufficiently upon their guard against the falling into any of these vices if for separate paragraphs in number equal to that of the vices there can be any adequate demand the purpose will be the subjoining in each instance something by way of explanation or example repetition in terms as well as import or say literal repetition and repetition in import alone and not in terms or say virtual repetition the distinction thus expressed may it is believed be found to have its use repetition in terms is a vice into the practice of which a writer especially at this time of day is not it may naturally be imagined in any great danger of falling the most extraordinary example it is believed that ever was in print or even in manuscript is that which is exhibited in the koran in the compass of a moderatesized octavo volume the same proposition and that a nonsensical one is repeated several hundred times repetition in import is a vice that may be practised by a man to any extent and without his being aware of it and great accordingly is the extent to which the practice of it may be seen to be carried scantiness is an imputation which even in a case that affords just ground for it does not very easily find a determinate seat it is only in so far as a writer fails in the performance of what he has actually undertaken to perform that any deficiency in the quantity of matter delivered by him can be charged upon his discourse in any such character as that of an imperfection or a vice but if having expressedly or impliedly undertaken to cover by his discourse the whole of the field which he has taken in hand he leaves untouched any part of it that is known to have been already touched upon by any other writer he must not expect to be holden altogether guiltless by any person by whom the deficiency has been perceived†     in any list of articles—that list being expressly or impliedly given as a complete one—if any proposition article or articles that have a title to be considered as belonging to it be omitted the reproach of scantiness will naturally be more readily and clearly seen to have been incurred than where the spots omitted are such as correspond to so many longer and larger members or portions of the discourse section xii of methodization—its application to the assistance of the faculties of the mind   of the perceptive and conceptive faculties example numbers in general as disposed in the numeration table in which numbers as many as ever can be wanted for any purpose follow one another in an endless succession having all along at every step a unit or number one for their common difference the order in which they follow one another is an example of the regula antecessionis et consequentionis to form an idea of the use of the order thus given to them suppose any series of numbers though it were no more than a hundred instead of following one another in the order exhibited in the numeration table following one another in an order determined by lot how incomprehensible a labyrinth would be the mass composed of those numbers—how impracticable a task the obtaining any tolerable acquaintance with an art now so simple as that of common arithmetic every case of systematical arrangement performed by division and subdivision of aggregates or fictitious masses formed by abstraction is an exemplification of methodization performed in the aggregative or coacervative mode   of the memory or psychically retentive and recollective faculty the applying of this operation in the special view and design of affording assistance to the memory by expedients directed expressly to that object has been taken for the end in view of an appropriate branch of art termed from the greek mnemonics or the mnemonic art but language itself language the indispensable instrument of all the arts and all the sciences is itself an exemplification of the application of the power of method to the assistance of the memory it is by means of the several signs of which language is composed i e of words taken singly or in conjunction or composition that the ideas respectively signified by them are lodged in and upon occasion called up from that fictitious receptacle the memory   of the inventive faculty invention is an operation which has for its results every branch of art and every science which at the point of time in question is in existence but in some instances the accession thus made to the existing fund of art and science has been the result of design steadily directed to the acquisition of it in others it has been the fruit of accident design attention and labour not having had any part at all in the production of it or having taken no other part than what consisted in the endeavour to turn to account and as it were to give ripeness to the fruit which accident had been the first to bring to view for facilitating the assistance capable of being rendered by methodization to the art of invention viz of invention by design of purposed invention such rules as have presented themselves will be found in the chapter on invention†   of the imaginative faculty that without impropriety every instance of abstraction and every instance of invention are capable of being referred to the imaginative faculty has been seen already but where the subject of discourse is a work styled a work of imagination what is usually meant is a fictitious state of things or assemblage of events purely and commonly avowedly fictitious put together and commonly sent abroad for the purpose of affording what is called amusement amusement—viz an assemblage of pleasures of a particular sort commonly termed pleasures of the imagination the art in the practice of which the powers of the imaginative faculty are employed and directed to that end is termed the art of poetry     that in the production of the choicest fruits of this art accident has been thought to have borne no inconsiderable part is testified by the common adage poeta nascitur non fit but that the part borne by design is not an inconsiderable one and that from the art of method in particular it is in use to receive very considerable assistance is an opinion that seems not much exposed to dispute to attempt the rendering any assistance to the cultivators of this art is a task that will scarcely be deemed to come under the province of logic but for illustrations sake in the chapter allotted to the topic of invention an example will be brought to view of an operation whereby assistance might in measure at least have been lent to the labours of the poet viz by the collection and exhibition of groups of fictions from which by the help of analogy other fictions might be deduced   of methodization as applied to the assistance of the judgment or judicial faculty   of methodization as applied to the purpose of operating on the affections and passions section xiii of the aristotelian laws of method in the work of sanderson of any such distinction as that between method considered as applicable to unconnected aggregates of entities and method considered as applicable to the parts or members of a literary discourse no intimation is to be found but taking together in hand without distinction two topics thus disparate he exhibits under the appellation of the laws of method a string of rules in so many different chapters two sets of propositions are by him thus delivered under the name of laws in the  0th book iii containing five one set under the name of laws of method considered in genere in chapter    two sets under the name of laws of method considered in specie—in each set two of these laws one pair being exhibited as extensively applicable to works of science the other pair as extensively applicable to works of art i of his laws of method considered in genere the first is styled lex brevitatis though by this its title it professes not to bring to view any other virtue than this of brevity—to put men consequently upon their guard against any other vice than the vice or vices opposite to that virtue viz redundancy or superfluity yet by the explanation immediately after subjoined the design of it appears to have included the virtue which has for its opposite the vice of scantiness and it is with this unannounced virtue and vice that the explanation commences nihil in discipline desit aut redundet of any such distinction as that between repetition in terms and repetition in import and not in terms only no intimation is given under the one name of tautology both are confounded instead of irrelevancy and repetition to both of which ideas belong that are altogether determinate the word redundance is employed by which nothing more determinate is expressed than a sentiment of disapprobation attached by the person in question to the discourse in question in consideration of its quantity no determinate ground for that disapprobation being brought to view to these two vices thus denominated viz redundance and tautology a note of reprobation is applied the effect of them he says is to produce nausea after this would any one have expected to find a case in which he is seen recommending the practice of the vices thus denominated yet two such cases there are one is that which has place in so far as it is of examples the other that which has place in so far as it is of commentaries that the discourse in question is composed in both these cases such is the awkwardness of his expression though assuredly such was not his meaning—what he gives you to understand is that the more redundancy and tautology there is the better ii next comes a proposition styled the law of harmony lex harmoniæ by which when explained it appears that what is meant to be conveyed is neither more nor less than a warning against the vice of inconsistency a vice at the thought of which an expression of illhumour is let fly—doctrinæ singulæ partes inter se consentiant pessimè docet qui quod hic ponit alibi per incogitantiam evertit p    —bitter had it been apposite for its justice the reproach of inconsistency depends not upon success—not upon the comparative propriety of the two mutually contradictory propositions iii in the third place comes his lex unitatis sire homogeneæ in its import and effect another warning though a little more particular than before against irrelevancy thereupon comes the explanation and in it a premature distinction between the two impliedly supposed incompatible cases viz that in which the discourse has a subject and that in which it has an end—for that to any discourse there should be at the same time a subject and an end is a case the impossibility of which is virtually assumed but more of this a little further on nihil in doctrina præcipiatur quod non sit subjecto aut fini homogeneum dico subjecto     propter scientias—fini propter artes et prudentias damnat aristoteles merito transitum à genere ad genus iv in the fourth place comes his lex generalitatis sive antecessionis et consequentionis—law of generality or of precedence and subsequence follows an explanation of which after this double title there surely is no small need in teaching let that one of two things stand first without which the other cannot be understood while without the lastmentioned the firstmentioned may be understood præcedat in docendo id sine quo alterum intelligi nequit sed ipsum sine altero thereupon in guise of a reason comes an observation which under that guise is in fact nothing better than a petitio principii—a begging of the question for it is necessary continues he that those things which follow should receive light and strength from these things which go before—not these from those in substance and import of the law here in question the meaning it must already have been observed is neither more nor less than the rule herein above brought to view having the short title of independentia priora by the antecessiones et consequentiones intimation of this import is plainly enough given but over this apposite enough and expressive title precedence is given to the title lex generalitatis—law of generality than which a more inapposite one could scarcely have been found v fifth and last of the rules or laws as they are styled delivered in this chapter comes that which is called lex connexionis under which head are meant to be given as the explanation shows not one rule only but two or rather three which though in no case inconsistent are altogether different singulæ partes doctrinæ says the rule aptis transitionibus connectantur let all the several parts of the instruction be connected with one another by apt transitions thereupon comes the explanation in and by which though in a manner somewhat indirect and inexplicit no fewer as just observed than three distinguishable rules are indicated the first is to avoid desultoriness—the second to employ the requisite means for pointing out such connexions as have place among the parts of the discourse—the third is to give synoptic tables by frequent interruptions says he and very truly the conceptive and retentive faculties are disturbed—in this is implied the memento to avoid desultoriness—but by apt colligation continues he i e by apt ligaments both i e both conception and memory will be assisted and the reason of the method made manifest in what follows in the last place there seems to have been either some misprint or some defect in grammar—operæ facturus prœcium it should have been pretium qui docet methodi connexionem et rationem universam tabulâ aliquâ sive diagraphe compendiariâ discipulis repræsentabit to give to this proposition what seems to have been its intended import indeed to give it any import at all two words viz est and si appear to be necessary with these two words inserted in what seem to be the requisite places the sentence will stand thus—operæ facturus pretium est qui docet si methodi connexionem et rationem universam tabulâ aliquâ sive diagraphe compendiariâ discipulis representabit the teacher will find his labour well repaid if in some table or compendious draught he will exhibit to his pupils the connexion and universal reason of his method though by reason of the necessarily extreme generality of the ideas belonging to the subject and the rather more than necessary vagueness and indeterminateness of the words here employed for the giving expression to them the information thus given is not altogether so instructive and satisfactory as could be wished it may be however if attended to not altogether without its use here ends his thirtieth chapter entitled concerning order and method in general—de ordine et methodo in genere—follows the thirtyfirst entitled—concerning method in specie of the proficiency made by the instructor in the art which he is thus employed in teaching the specimen here exhibited must be confessed to be rather an unhappy one four propositions delivered all of them lest the name of rules should not be assuming enough under the name of laws and of these laws one is a repetition of the other and both of them denominated by the name lex generalitatis which in the last preceding chapter we have seen prefixed to another rule or law which has not so much as a word in common with them wherefore this repetition—what was the cause of it it was this of method he says there are two species extensively applicable—the one to science the other to art thereupon in the same terms the lex generalitatis of this chapter so different from the lex generalitatis of the former chapter which was there given as applicable to every kind of method is applied in the first place to method considered as applied to contemplative disciplines i e to science in the next place to method considered as applied to operative disciplines i e to prudences prudentiæ and arts let things more universal precede says he     those which are less universal magis universalia præcedant minus universalia remain the two quasi definitions so improperly selfstyled laws   the unity of a science says he depends on the unity of its subject—unitas scientiæ pendet a subjecti unitate   the unity of an operative discipline depends on the unity of the end—unitas disciplinæ operatricis pendet ab unitate finis another imperfection no less than an absolute selfcontradiction figures in this unhappy chapter to the species of method which he says applies to science and not to practical disciplines he gives the two synonymous appellatives—the one greek the other latin synthetic and compositive to the other species of method which he says applies to practical disciplines and not to sciences he gives two other synonymous appellatives greek and latin analytic and resolutive now to that word compositive on the one hand to the word resolutive on the other what were the ideas annexed in his mind—answer none at all signs they were but what was wanting to them was the thing designated for of this compositive species of method what is the second of its two rules it is this—let such things as are most universal come before such things as are less universal resolution not composition if either of the two is surely what is recommended by this rule had he but had condescension and patience enough to subjoin to each of his rules an example though it had been no more than one he in whose declared opinion examples cannot be too numerous would probably have escaped falling into this scrape but here may be seen a failing into which logicians the gravest of all writers as well as the most flowery are but too apt to fall into—their species have no individuals contained in them their nuts have no kernels unfortunate indeed have been from the earliest times known to us these two magnificent species of method the analytic and the synthetic a decompounding method which decompounds and a compounding method which instead of compounding decompounds likewise frequent indeed is it to see these two terms especially the word analytic and its conjugates analysis and analyse brought to view never it is believed from the supposed distinction from the supposed contrast has any light been diffused to the word analysis when standing by itself its proper meaning seems not unfrequently to be annexed but where as significative of the opposite meaning the word synthesis is introduced such is the effect—between the one and the other the meaning of the one and of the other are both wrapped in clouds in algebra quantity is considered without regard to figure in geometry not but with regard to figure the algebraical is termed the analytic method the geometrical the synthetic but in either of them what is there either of analysis or synthesis of decomposition or of composition more than in the other in both instances the ideas belonging to them are abstract general extensive in the extreme in the instance of algebra still more so than in geometry the idea of figure being laid out of the case and nothing left but that of quantity but still in either what is there of analysis more than of synthesis the parts of a geometrical proposition are put together and so are those of an algebraical investigation and here we have synthesis the parts of which they are respectively composed may be considered one after another in the one case and so may they in the other—and here we have analysis chapter x of the art of invention section i of invention in general to teach to learn and to invent—these are so many processes or operations applicable alike to every branch of art or science to practice is a sort of operation exclusively applicable to arts not applicable to any branch of discipline otherwise than in so far as some portion of art is contained in it between teaching and invention a sort of reciprocality is moreover observable among the subjects of the art of teaching may be the art of invention among the subjects of the art of invention may be the art of teaching as between these two—first in the order of existence must have come the art of invention since whatsoever comes to be taught must first have been invented before it could have been taught of this chapter the object is to afford such helps as by the powers of an individual mind—of the individual mind in question are capable of being given to invention—understand of course to invention in so far as it is useful—to invention in every quarter of the field of thought and action to which it can be applied a chapter which takes this for its subject may be compared to the work of the handicraft who having to make a utensil or instrument of new construction finds occasion in the first place to contrive and fabricate one or more of the tools or other instruments which he has to employ in making it invention supposes art the inventor of any branch of an art is the first individual by whom it is practised or if between conception and actual practice there be a difference insomuch as that of the art which a man was the first to practise not he himself but some     other individual had been the first to conceive the first individual by whom it had been conceived a new art or a new mode of practising an art already invented either of these may the invention have had for its subjects of this distinction the indication may for clearness sake be in this or that instance not altogether without its use although in many instances to draw the line between the two cases may be found a matter of such difficulty that in those instances the distinction may be seen to be rather a nominal or verbal than a real one the words not finding an individual case to which they can be applied with truth among the helps capable of being given to invention some will be seen alike applicable to all arts others to no other than this or that particular species of art inventions applicable to all arts are thereby applicable to all sciences of this proposition the truth depends upon and follows from that of a proposition already brought to view viz that between art and science there exists throughout the whole field of thought and action a constant conjunction for every science a correspondent art and for every art a correspondent science section ii helps applicable to arts in general without exception or distinction in this view a few rules present themselves as capable of being found to some minds in the way of original instruction to all minds in the way of memento or reminiscence not altogether without their use in some instances by affording positive helps in others by the indication of certain obstacles the force of which will be to be encountered which in any tract of the field of invention the labourer will find standing in his way and opposing his progress obstacles of the existence and force and operation of which it concerns him to be well apprized lest when the time comes they find him unprepared memento   whatever be the art which or in which you think to invent keep steadily in view the particular end at which it aims the effect the production of which it has for its object keep your eyes fixed upon the end in two latin words respice finem memento   beware of intellectual servility in other words take reason not custom for your guide the reason of the thing including the nature of the effect meant to be produced not confining yourself to the pursuing of the practice to the performance of those operations and those only by which alone the effect is as yet wont to be produced sit non mos sed ratio dux memento   be on your guard against the confederated enemies of all good and thereby of all new good viz   indigenous intellectual weakness   sinister interest   interestbegotten prejudice   adoptive prejudice when they cannot oppose by force these will oppose by discouragement discouraging by opinion and advice memento   in relation to every part of your subject and every object connected with it render your ideas as clear as possible lux undique fiat memento   for means and instruments employ analogy analogias undique indagato memento   in your lookout for analogies for surveying that quarter of the field of thought and action to which the art in question belongs employ the logical ladders the ladders made of nest of aggregates placed in logical subalternation in analogiarum indagatione scalis logicis utere memento   inquire and learn whatsoever for the production of the effect in question

special reason postrema exquirito memento   quodlibet cum quolibet to everything forget not to apply anything suppose that of an indefinite multitude of objects which in consideration of certain properties or qualities in respect of which they are found or supposed to agree and certain others in respect of which they have been found or supposed to disagree having all of them been placed in one or other of two classes some article belonging to the one class has with success ie with some new effect which either has been found to be or affords a prospect of being found to be advantageous been apapplied no matter in what manner nor to what purpose in particular to some article belonging to the other class in like manner frame a general resolution not to be departed from in any instance but for some special cause applying to that instance to apply to each article belonging to the one class every article belonging to the other the sort of special cause here in question will be one of these two viz   apparently preponderant probability of not producing any new result at all   apparently preponderant probability that the new result if any will instead of proving preponderantly advantageous prove preponderantly disadvantageous n b—among physical arts and sciences the branch of art and science to which this rule or memento is in a particular degree applicable is the chemical including in so far as they belong to it the several subordinate and practical branches of art and science which come under its department e g cookery pharmacy agriculture architecture in so far as concerns materials memento  0 in taking a survey of practice distinguish in it as many distinguishable points as the nature of the case appears to afford and on each of these points try its utility and propriety by its relation to the end     examples—the field of medical practice is a field in which many examples indicative of the utility of this rule might be collected in the comparatively ancient system of pharmacy may be found medicines in the composition of which there were drugs to the amount of twenty or thirty different sorts of which by comparatively recent observation experience and experiment all but two or three have been found either wholly inoperative or unconducive to the end in every part of the field of practice in which the practice has not yet been thus directed and its several distinguishable parts or points confronted with the proper end uninfluencing circumstances and even obstructive circumstances i e obstacles may be seen confounded with promotive causes and the result be it what it may ascribed without distinction to their conjunct agency and in this way the character of promotive causes ascribed to uninfluencing and even to obstructive causes of this mode of confusion examples will naturally be to be found in abundance in the system of government established in every country and in particular in that branch which regards constitutional law of whatsoever degree of prosperity the state may be supposed to be in the enjoyment of as many abuses and imperfections as in the theory or practice of it have place will by all those who profit by them be of course placed more or less confidently and explicitly upon the list of promotive causes on the subject of each of these mementos a few observations present themselves as capable of having their use in the course of them it will it is believed be seen that of all of them howsoever at first view the contrary might in some instances be supposed there is not one that is not in a manner more or less pointed applicable to every track which in the field of thought and action it is in the power of art and invention not excepting science to take the two first mementos demand a joint consideration the end it may be asked exists there any man who be the art what it may in the practice of it ever omits so much as for a moment either to keep his eyes fixed upon the end or to keep a lookout for the fittest and most promising means oh yes with the exception of the inventive few who are few indeed every man the end yes of the end he is not altogether unregardful but as to means the means which he sees pursued by others by all those from whose discourse and practice his notions on the subject have been derived these are the means which from first to last he has been in the habit of regarding as not only conducive to the end but if not the only ones that are so in any degree at any rate those which are so in a higher degree than any others which the nature of the case admits of let reason be fruitful custom barren such indeed is the advice which on this subject has been delivered delivered but by whom—by bacon by the man whose mind was of almost all minds the most unlike to others in regard to fruitfulness how stands the matter as between reason and custom in the world at large reason breeds like a polecat custom like a doerabbit third memento† the more stupid a man is especially if in his mind stupidity be as it is not unapt to be accompanied by selfconceit the more improbable it will appear to him that to the invention in question be it what it may any such characters as those of useful and meritorious would be found to belong to it so difficult as the art is in its present state so great the expense which in the articles of genius and industry which it must have cost to the men of former times to bring the art up to its present mark in the scale of perfection so great the multitudes that for so many ages must have been occupied in the endeavour to give to it every degree of perfection of which it is susceptible—is it in any degree—is it preponderently probable that by the man in question who in his exterior has probably nothing to distinguish him to his advantage and whose weaknesses whatever they may be being indicated by envy and jealousy are laid open to general observation so important an addition to the art should really have been made such are the observations by which the consideration is diverted from modern invention fourth memento clarification of ideas—if the subject be of the physical class render the images which you form of it in your mind as correct and complete as possible if the subject be of the psychical class in so far as the words employed in discoursing of it are names of fictitious entities take the only course by which it is possible for a man to give perfect clearness to the ideas of which they serve to constitute the signs viz by searching out the real entities in which these names of fictitious entities have their source on some subjects in some instances without the use of words a man may exercise invention drawing his materials and instruments from the stock of ideas already laid up in his own mind but unless by the actual survey of sensible works the results and fruits of inventions already executed it is only through the medium of words that for his assistance in the exercise of invention he can make any use of the inventions or practices or works of others here     then are so many collections of signs of ideas from which according to the degree of attention bestowed on the consideration of them and the degree of discernment with which that attention is accompanied the ideas which he obtains from those words will be more or less clear ambiguous or obscure in so far as the words are such as to be themselves direct representatives of clear ideas so much the better but even where this is in but a small degree or not in any degree the case still it will frequently happen that by the reflections and comparisons of which in his mind they are productive they may render to him more or less assistance towards the formation of other ideas such as shall in a greater or less degree be clearer than those by which they were themselves suggested fifth and sixth mementos the mode and use of applying these subalternation scales are as follows viz i application in the descending line with the exception of such words as are names of individual objects take any one of the material words that present themselves as belonging to the subject not being the name of an individual alone this word will be the name of a sort of objects the name say of an aggregate if the aggregate be the denomination of a genus think of the several species which by their respective names present themselves as being contained under it whatsoever is predicated of the genus will in so far as it is truly predicated be with equal truth predicable of all these several species ii application in the ascending line in like manner look out for the name of the next superior genus with reference to which the genus in question is but a species and observe try or conjecture whether that which beyond doubt has been found predicable with truth of the whole of this species be or promise to be with like truth predicable of the whole or any other part of the aggregate designated by the name of that genus it is in the instance of the physical department of the field of thought and action and more particularly to the chemical district of that department that the applicability of this memento is most conspicuous upon every subject try or at least think of trying every operation to every subject in the character of a menstruum apply every subject in the character of a solvent and so on it is to the extent in which application has been made of this memento that chemical science is indebted for the prodigious progress which within the compass of the present generation has been made in it it is by the ideal decomposition performed by the separate consideration of the several distinguishable operations which respectively constitute the component parts of various mechanical arts and thence by the division of labour that the great improvements made within the last half century in manufactures have been effected seventh and eighth mementos inventions of the physical stamp are those in regard to which the importance of these mementos is generally speaking at its highest pitch discovery practice publication—by these words are designated so many periods which in the career of invention may to the purpose here in question be distinguished with practical advantage to the purpose of the discovery that generally speaking it cannot but be of advantage to a person of an inventive turn to be apprized of and acquainted with whatsoever has been already invented or thought of in the same line is obvious enough but so far as mere discovery is concerned any inconvenience which it can happen to a man to incur from a want of acquaintance with anything that has already been discovered by others is in this case but inconsiderable in comparison with what is liable to have place in the first place so far indeed as for want of being preacquainted with this or that discovery which has already been made by this or that other person he fails of making this or that discovery which had it happened to him to have been acquainted with the existing discovery in question he would have made so far here is so much lost to the individual in question and to the world at large in the next place in so far as after the discovery has been made by himself it happens to him to learn that this same discovery has already been made by some one else in this case what is but natural enough is that in proportion to what appears to be the degree of importance of the discovery uneasiness in the shape of a pain of disappointment should be experienced by him but in such a track as that of invention no step that has ever been taken no step be the ulterior result of it what it may is ever lost of every step present pleasure is the accompaniment from every step the mind derives increase of vigour of that which is an instrument of future security and future pleasure ninth memento quodlibet cum quolibet—a mechanical help will be found in the facility of confrontation for this purpose in so far as writing i e manuscript is employed let it be on one side only of the paper reason—propositions which are on different sides of the same plane cannot invariably be confronted with each other while that which is on page   is hunting for the terms of that which is on page   and what is intended to be compared with it are either forgotten or become dubious if such is liable to be the case with the smallest members of a discourse how much     more is it with those that are larger and longer with complex sentences and whole paragraphs so in printing nothing could be more incongruous than at the back of a table intended for a synoptic one to print anything that may require to be confronted with any part of the matter of it appendix—a phenomena of the human mind section i analytical view of the phenomena of the human mind the whole structure of the mind may be considered as included in two faculties viz the perceptive and the appetitive to the perceptive belong all mental experiences—simple experiences—to the appetitive all mental operations and their results in the perceptive faculty the judicial may in a certain point of view be considered as included to the head of experiences may be referred the following phenomena   apathematic perceptions—perceptions as they have place in the case in which they do not consist of nor are attended with any distinguishable pain or pleasure   pathematic perceptions—perceptions as they have place in the case where they consist of or are attended with sensations or feelings either of pain or pleasure i e are attended with pains or painful perceptions or pleasures or pleasurable perceptions pathematic or apathematic perceptions may be distinguished into judgmentnotinvolving and judgmentinvolving a judgmentinvolving perception is the perception of a relation i e of the existence of a relation between some two objects one of the relations most frequently exemplified in this way is the relation of cause and effect between a judgmentinvolving and a judgmentnotinvolving perception the differential character is this—in so far as an experience or act of the judicial faculty is not involved in the perception in question it is not susceptible of error—in so far as any such experience or act is involved it is susceptible of error the case of a judgmentinvolving perception is exemplified in and by every one of the five senses   i open my eyes—i see something before me—it seems to me that it is a distant hill but in fact it is a cloud here is a misjudgment here is error but that i see something i e that on the retina of my eyes an image is depicted in this is no error   i hear a sound—to me it seems the voice of a man at a distance but in fact it is the cry of an owl   i am sitting in the dark—a piece of drapery is presented to me—i am asked what it is i pronounce it silkvelvet but in fact it is cottonvelvet   left in the dark a plate of boiled vegetables is placed before me—i am asked what it is—it tastes like spinach but in fact it is beet leaves   still in the dark a flower is presented to me—i am asked what it is—it smells to me like a pink but in fact it is a carnation in the production of that state of mind in which a perception whether judgmentinvolving or judgmentnotinvolving has place objects exterior to the body have or have not borne a part in the first case the perception may be termed a perception ab extra or say derivative—in the other case a perception purely ab intra or say indigenous of derivative perceptions the above five are each of them so many exemplifications of indigenous perceptions a sense of dilatation in the stomach a sense of increased or diminished heat are exemplifications—in all or in each of which cases the perception may be apathematic or pathematic—and if pathematic accompanied either with pain or pleasure section ii operations—results of the exercise of the appetitive faculty every operation of the mind and thence every operation of the body is the result of an exercise of the will or volitional faculty the volitional is a branch of the appetitive faculty i e that faculty in which desire in all its several modifications has place desire has for its object either pleasure or pain or what is commonly the case a mixture of both in ever varying and unascertainable proportions the desire which has pleasure for its object is the desire of the presence of such pleasure desire which has pain for its object is the desire of the absence of such pain i see an apple i conceive a desire to eat and thence to possess that apple—if not being either hungry or thirsty my desire is notwithstanding excited by the supposed agreeable flavour of the apple pleasure and pleasure alone viz the presence of that pleasure such as it is is the object of my desire if being either hungry or thirsty or both and that to a degree of uneasiness pain viz the   0 absence of that same uneasiness is moreover the object a desire then has in every case an internal object viz the corresponding pleasure and in so far as that object has for its expected source an object exterior to the body an external object a desire having pleasure alone i e presence of pleasure for its internal object has place in so far as from the presence or productiveness of the supposed source pleasure is regarded as about to be eventually experienced a desire having pain alone i e absence of pain for its internal object has place in so far as from the presence or productiveness of the supposed source pain is regarded as being eventually about to be experienced a desire having pleasure and pain taken together for its internal object has place in so far as while from the presence or productiveness of the supposed source pleasure is regarded as being eventually about to be experienced pain is at the same time experienced from the reflection of the actual absence of that same source—or in so far as while from the presence of the supposed source pain is regarded as being eventually about to be experienced pleasure is at the same time experienced from the reflection of the actual absence of that same source if the desire being a desire having pleasure for its object be to a certain degree intense in this case so long as it remains unsatisfied it has a certain degree of pain for its inseparable accompaniment viz the pain of nonpossession or say privation produced by the absence of the source and the consequent nonsatisfaction of the desire if the desire be a desire having pain for its object i e the absence of pain from this or that particular source in this case if the desire be to a certain degree intense it has for its inseparable accompaniment a persuasion more or less intense of the probability of a state of things in which pain will be experienced considered as having produced or as being with more or less probability of success operating towards the production of the result viz presence of pleasure or absence of pain which is the object of it a desire is termed a motive in so far as the production of the state of things which is the immediate object of the desire is considered as following immediately and certainly upon the existence of the desire an act of the will is said to take place—the faculty by which this effect is considered as produced is termed the volitional or volitive faculty or in one word the will the volitional faculty is therefore a branch of the appetitive but no act of the will can take place but in consequence of a correspondent desire in consequence of the action of a desire in the character of a motive also no desire can have place unless when the idea of pleasure or pain in some shape or degree has place minute it is true minute in the extreme is the quantity of pleasure or pain requisite and sufficient to the formation of a desire but still it is not the less true—take away all pleasure and all pain and you have no desire pleasure and pain considered in themselves belong to the perceptive faculty i e to the pathematic branch of it but pleasure and pain considered as operating as above in the production of desires operating as above in the character of motives and thus producing volition action internal or external corporeal or purely mental belong to the appetitive faculty pleasure and pain compose therefore as it were the bond of union and channel of communication between the two faculties attention is the result of an act of the will of an exercise of the volitional branch of the appetitive faculty in so far as attention has place in so far as attention is applied either to the direction or to the observation of an experience the experience is converted into an operation or at any rate in the field of thought that place which would otherwise have been the field of an experience and nothing more becomes now the field of an experience and of a correspondent operation at the same time—an operation having for its subject the object which was the source or seat of the experience in some instances language affords not as yet any word or words by which the difference between the presence or absence of attention in relation to the effect in question is denoted here the word judgment—act of the judgment—is the locution employed as well in the case of those instantaneous and involuntary judgments which as above are commonly confounded with simple perception and those attentive and elaborate judgments which are pronounced in the senate on the bench or in the laboratory of the chemist or at the librarytable of the logician without attention the memory is but the seat of a mere passive experience which is termed remembrance in consequence of an exertion or exercise of the will importing attention applied to the purpose of searching out and bringing from the storehouse of the mind     the impression in question it becomes the seat and subject of an operation termed recollection section iii enumeration of the mental faculties of a set of fictitious entities to give a list neither the correctness nor the completeness of which shall be exempt from dispute or doubt cannot be a very easy task of the following articles neither the perceptibility meaning that sort of perceptibility of which these sorts of fictitious entities are susceptible neither the perceptibility nor the mutual distinctness say rather distinguishability seems much exposed to dispute    perception or say perceptive faculty alias simple apprehension    judgment or say judicial faculty    memory or say retentive faculty this is either   passive or   active i e recollective    deduction or say ratiocinative or deductive faculty that by which a number of judgments i e acts of the judicial faculty are deduced one from another   abstraction or say abstractive faculty    imagination or say imaginative faculty whereby a number of abstracted ideas results or products of the exercise of the abstractive faculty are compounded and put together   invention or say inventive faculty whereby out of a number of the products of the abstractive faculty such compounds are formed as are new i e were never produced before invention is imagination directed in its exercise to the attainment of some particular end   methodization or say arrangement or the exercise of what may be termed the tactic faculty it may be employed in the service of any one or more of the several faculties abovementioned   attention or say the attentive faculty the exercise of this faculty seems to be the result of an exercise of the will of a special application made of the power of that faculty to the purpose of attaching to their work with different degrees of force and for different lengths of time any one or more of the several distinguishable faculties abovementioned  0 observation in this are included perception memory judgment and commonly ratiocination set and kept at work by attention and directed commonly in their exercise to the accomplishment of some particular end     communication or say the communicative faculty a faculty which may have for its subject the results or products of the exercise of any one or more of the several faculties abovementioned speaking writing and pantomime i e discourse by gestures or otherwise by deportment are so many modes in and by which it is exercised communication on the one part supposes receipt or say reception on the other in so far as to the exercise of the art of reception attention on the part of the receiver is considered as necessary the receiver is styled a learner reflection is attention considered as carried backwards and applied to objects considered as presented and kept in view by the memory    comparison is attention considered as applied alternately and as nearly as possible simultaneously to the two or greater number of objects which are the subjects of it for the purpose of giving direction to an exercise of the judicial faculty the operation by which this faculty is exercised can scarcely it is believed be performed for a continuance and with advantage on more than two objects at a time at any rate to the purpose of noting points of resemblance and difference for the purpose of distributing an aggregate into parcels which are to be compared with one another it is necessary to proceed in the first instance by dividing it as it were at one stroke if for any such purpose objects in any number greater than two are compared with one another the attention finds it necessary to divide the three for this purpose into two parcels some one of the three objects forming one parcel and the two remaining ones together another thus in the case of physical motion between any two objects alternate motion is a sort of operation in itself extremely simple produced with little difficulty of which the exemplifications are numerous and frequently occurring and which has accordingly received a name viz vibration but between any greater number though it were so small as three in nature no such alternate motion is to be found anywhere exemplified nor could it without a highly complicated system of machines be produced of this difference a sort of exemplification seems even to be afforded by the very word between between i e by twain means by parcels consisting each of no more than two articles as in the phrase where it is said let comparison be made between these two articles here in this case the comparison is understood to be perfectly made or at any rate to be capable of being perfectly made but if the number of articles to be compared be greater than two in this case the word between cannot with propriety he employed instead of it the language affords no word less improper than the word among but a comparison made among three or more articles does not present itself in the character of a perfect one it seems as if the comparison ought to be made either between any two leaving out the others or between any one of them taken singly on the one part and     the other two formed into one parcel on the other part in a word where the word among is used in this case besides that the number of the objects in question is left indeterminate the operation itself is not the same sort of operation as where the word between is employed change the expression ever so often still the difficulty not to say the impossibility of keeping under equal consideration for any considerable length of time any greater number of objects than two presses itself into view you may indeed say compare together the objects a b and c but then as in the case where the preposition among is employed the comparison has the air of a confused partial and indeterminate one but then in each of these cases so it is that for the purpose of the comparison the three articles are in the first place made up into one aggregate and in the next place that aggregate is divided into two and no more than two parcels    synthesis or combination    generalization    induction    analysis i e division viz logical or anological analysis    distribution appendix b division of art and science† section i generals or particulars abstractions or concretions—which first in the field of eudæmonics and pantognosy the field of abstractions or the field of concretions—to which of these two compartments shall the surveying eye apply itself in the whole human race considered at all periods of its history the knowledge of particulars has preceded that of generals abstraction a branch of logic is an art that has been learned by slow degrees but when general conceptions have once been attained the communication of them is performed with much more despatch even to the most unfurnished and uninformed minds than that of particulars i e in a given time much more knowledge may be communicated by the use of more general terms in company with less general terms than by the use of less general terms alone true it is without the use of particular terms and even according to the nature of the subject i e as it belongs to somatics or psychology no clear knowledge can be conveyed by general ones but by a single individual or species exhibited in the character of a specimen or sample for the explanation and illustration of a generic term the exhibition of all the other individuals or particulars contained in the genus of which it is the name may be saved with these explanations from particulars to generals may be stated as the actual order of learning or acquisition but from generals to particulars the most convenient and extensively efficient order of teaching or communicating instruction condillac was a french abbé in his youth he had served an apprenticeship to the greek statuary so well known to the dilettanti by the name of pygmalion in his workshop he had learned that secret which to statuaries is what the philosophers stone is to chemists—the art of giving life to clay or marble pygmalions practical object in the animating of his statue was as everybody knows the pleasure of teaching it to speak—more appositely the teaching her the art of love condillac being an abbé and moreover a man of an independent mind and an original cast of character—a philosopher by trade—determined instead of making himself the servile copyist of his master to teach logic to his statue instead of love‡ in this view instead of cramming her all at once with the five senses—not to speak of the sixth sense which how necessary soever to the purpose of the greek would have been quite foreign to the new purpose of this frenchman—he found it necessary to proceed upon a more economical plan and to begin at least with furnishing them to her one by one for matter for one of her first exercises he took aristotles logic in hand and proposed to himself to teach her the ten predicaments and by means of the ten predicaments proposed to himself to teach her the nature of those fictitious entities called abstractions when it came to the point he found that aristotles list was not quite so well made up as it might have been and doubtless would have been had the ingenious greek had the advantage of consulting with locke and a few others in teaching her these predicaments his plan was to begin with those if any such there were the nature of which could be taught without taking into consideration any other     in all new courses of experiment there is commonly a good deal of fumbling of the crude conception that occurred to him and the unsuccessful trials that took place in consequence mention need not be made of a few of those by which it appeared that more or less light was thrown upon the subject a short and plain account will suffice for the present purpose   he gave her the sense of smelling—he presented her with a rose in the way of logic nothing was taught her by the experiment she learned the smell of the rose and liked it very well but she knew not what it came from—whether from a rosetree from otto of roses or from the esprit de rose   equally limited was the science she made herself mistress of when endued with the sense of taste a slice of pineapple was no less agreeable to her than the rose had been but all she learnt from it was the taste of pineapples   he gave her the sense of sight and now for the first time he gave her schooling smelling and tasting were no better than childs play the first thing he presented to her view was a round spot nothing was to be learned from the round spot with a little alteration the round spot was converted into a triangle and by this triangle was furnished the first lesson she learned in the art of logic the triangle happened to be an equilateral one not but that any other might have done nearly as well being a triangle it had three points or corners look there says he at those points in that place on the left one—in that on the right a second—above them both a third here you have numbers one two three but when the predicament of number was thus made sensible to her the predicament of figure was made sensible to her at the same time for by these three points the triangle had its bounds and by these bounds its figure was determined to make the matter the clearer he presented to her by the side of this triangular spot the round one from this round one viewed by itself nothing had been to be learned a figure it had but being so perfectly uniform and presenting to view but one number it had not presented her with any such idea as that of figure no more than the smell of the rose or the taste of the pineapple had done but now being placed by the side of the triangle and her eye passing continually from the one to the other the difference between the one and the other was so often presented to her and by the contrast her ideas of figure became every moment more and more distinct as well as from the first moment more extensive by knowing what number was she already had some notion of what arithmetic is and by knowing what figure is she had moreover some notion of what geometry is he would have been glad to have given her a correspondent notion of what algebra is but this he found impossible till she had become more or less acquainted with the use of language arithmetic has for its subject number directly and independently expressed viz the several modifications of it all of them expressed by so many determinate absolute and appropriate names algebra has for its subject number and numbers but these expressed in every instance not by any determinate and absolute names but by names indicative in each instance of some relation borne by the object in question to some determinate number or numbers which sooner or later may be presented to view by their respective names but which as yet are not presented to view section ii field occupied by art and science entering upon the field of mesology we shall find science occupying a compartment over a portion only of which and that comparatively a small one it is in the power of art to follow it always excepted that space and quantity of art which being employed and that of necessity in the acquisition of the science is therefore inseparably attached to it contributory to wellbeing human wellbeing and its opposite are or may be for they have been supposed to be all beings of which we have any notion as well as all with which we have any acquaintance if so it be then so it is that with that portion of the field of eudæmonics which is occupied by mesology the whole field of ontology—a word more in use in former days than at present and employed to signify the science of being in general is coincident for the designation of the general term science considered as applying to this or that particular portion of the field of science by some persons and on some occasions the termination logy and by others the termination gnosy is preferred on other occasions or by some persons to give compactness to the appellation both are discarded and the termination cs† as designative of an adjective of which the substantive is subintellected is preferred‡ these terminations are all taken from the greek the language without which scarcely any new names could by our barbarismsprung language be framed and consequently scarcely any new views of things taken or expressed nor in so far as former ones are either     incorrect or incomplete any true and adequate ones be so much as formed somatology somatognosy or somatics psychology psychognosy or psychics†—to one or other of these denominations will every branch of science which has for its subject the field of to us perceptible existence the class to us of perceptible beings be found referable physioplastic anthropoplastic by one or other of these appellatives will the condition of all beings by which any part of the field of somatics is seen to be occupied be found referable physioplastic the state in which being found in the bosom they are supposed to have been formed by the hands of nature anthropoplastic the state into which after having been torn from the bosom of nature they have been brought by human labour the labour or course of the operations by which under the hands of man forms are given to bodies different in any respect from those into which they are cast by nature may be considered at two different stages or points of time viz   the stage during which with a view to the advancement whether of art or science or of both in one trials are made of the different forms into which they may be cast of the different properties immediately or eventually conducive to mans wellbeing they may be discovered or made to possess and of the different points of view in which for that purpose they may be contemplated and subjected to examination   the stage at which by the light of a more or less considerable mass of knowledge derived from such trials means having been found of casting them into such and such useful forms and thereby enduing them with such and such useful properties the casting them into these forms and enduing them with these properties has become the regular and extensive result of an established course of practice in their physioplastic state in the state in which fashioned by the hand of nature they are found in the bosom of nature bodies form the contents and subject of that portion of the field of somatics which is so commonly but so improperly designated by the appellation of natural history and which the term physiology having by a narrower application been unfitted for this use may more aptly and expressively it should seem be designated by the term physiognosy in so far as they are considered as forming the subject of these preliminary trials and examinations which as above serve as the foundations for those ulterior operations by which they are rendered subservient to general use they form the contents of that portion of the field of somatics which also very generally but not the less inappropriately has been termed sometimes natural philosophy sometimes experimental philosophy but which neither unaptly nor unexpressively may it is supposed be termed empiric somatology‡ the further we advance the more clearly do the convenience of an apposite nomenclature and systematic arrangement and the inconvenience of inapposite nomenclature and unsystematic arrangement become perceptible somatics being the name given to the stem by the two adjuncts physioplastic and anthropoplastic a designation which is correct and to every one to whom the import attached to those adjuncts in the original language is familiar an intelligible one is presented by a person whose ignorance of all particulars contained in the respective fields of human science should be as great as that of any person can be the import of the two names and accordingly the nature of the two branches of science would nevertheless be conceived and understood so he were but apprized of the import of the greek words correspondent to the word nature and the word man so much for the apposite and systematic nomenclature and arrangement now as to the inapposite and unsystematic of the two composing the inapposite appellative employed to designate physioplastic somatics the word natural in so far as it went was apposite and expressive but when applied to designate the anthropoplastic branch of somatics instead of being apposite and leading to truth it leads of itself to error what it gives you to understand is that under the branch of science to which it thus gives name in the observation made on the bodies which are the subjects of it the state to which the consideration is confined is that into which they have been brought by the hands of nature whereas the truth is that the state in which alone they constitute in a direct way the subject of anthropoplastic somatology is the state into which they have been brought or are capable of being brought by the hand of man true it is that in anthropoplastic somatics without more or less regard paid to physioplastic somatics that is to the bodies which are constituted its subjects and that too in the state in which they are its subjects nothing could be done for it is to physioplastic somatology that anthropoplastic somatology is indebted for all its subjects for all the materials which it can have to work upon but from this no such consequences follow as that in any part anthropoplastic and physioplastic are the same by architecture stone and wood are employed but architecture is not on this account one and the same branch of art and science either with mineralogy or with botany when upon taking a further step we come to the word philosophy the misrepresentation instead of receiving any correction is rendered still more flagrant instead of a state of or     acquisition made by the understanding and that alone that which the term philosophy was originally employed to designate and which even now it ceases not to convey to those who are more or less acquainted with the language from which it has been borrowed is a state of the affections a sentiment or affection of love and goodliking of goodliking in relation to what—not to this branch of somatics in contradistinction to the other nor yet to somatics in contradistinction to any other branch of science no nor so much as to science in contradistinction to anything else to what then—why even to wisdom and what is wisdom—a term of wide and imperfectly determined import employed not so much to designate science as to designate an habitually correct state of the judgment or judicial faculty to whatsoever subjects considered as applied but more particularly to such as are regarded as standing distinguished in respect of their importance in the highest degree as in its original import this term natural philosophy is scarcely expressive of any idea which it is employed to express hence it is that from the first to the last in relation to this or that less extensive branch of science a question may be—does it belong to natural history or does it belong to natural philosophy whereas under the terms physioplastic somatology and anthropoplastic somatology a clear line of demarkation between the two sciences thus designated is drawn at one stroke and all such questions are nipped in the bud instead of physioplastic and anthropoplastic—had the words pushpin and trapball been to the same extent and for the same length of time employed for the designation of the two branches of art and science for the designation of which the terms natural history and natural philosophy still continue to be employed the change instead of being for the worse would have been rather for the better by the word trapball no person would have been tempted to regard as belonging to physioplastics what belongs to anthropoplastics whereas of the term natural philosophy when thus applied the tendency to produce this sort of misconception is as hath just been seen not inconsiderable a word is not the more inconvenient but the less inconvenient the less liable it is to lead men to confound with any object those objects from which it is most material that it should be distinguished the attention which it applies to its subjects somatology may either apply indiscriminately to all the properties observable in them or confine itself to any one or more of them to the exclusion of the rest in the first case ageledodiascopic or for shortness ageledoscopic—in the other case choristodiascopic or for shortness choristoscopic are the names by which it may respectively be distinguished vacuity rest time figure quantity—all these form so many distinguishable subjects of choristoscopic somatics of vacuity it may seem that it belongs not to the properties of body but be the body what it may and be the place which at the time in question it occupies what it may it may as easily be conceived to be absent from as present at and in that place to be either in or out of any given place is therefore among the properties of body for if there were no such being as a body there would be no such distinction as that between place and place it is only by abstraction that the idea of rest can be formed any more than that of body it has for its ground the idea of place it is the absence of motion and of motion itself no idea can be formed but what has for its ground the idea of place take at any time into consideration any body considering it with reference to the place which at that same time it occupies but from that same place conceive it removed and into that same place suppose no other body or portion of matter introduced in this way and no other is formed the idea of a vacuum or portion of unoccupied space in so far as human observation has been able to apply itself to the subject absolute motion is at all times among the inherent inseparable properties of every distinct body and in so far of every particle of matter but of relative motion motion as between any two bodies or particles of matter considered in relation to one another examples real or apparent may upon the surface of this our globe be found in abundance of relative motion or its negation relative rest no idea can it should seem be formed otherwise than by the help of the idea of time two distinct bodies in so far as in the course of a given length of time the distance that intervenes between them is observed to be or appears to be different are observed to have been one or both in motion with reference to each other—to have been one or other or both of them in a state of relative motion—in so far as no difference in respect of the amount of the distance between them has been observed or is supposed to be observable they are regarded as having been in a state of rest the idea of time is derived says the common phrase from the succession of ideas of this definition the misfortune is that in the explanation given of the object the object undertaken to be explained is itself introduced under a disguise it may perhaps be said to be derived from the diversity between ideas to a mind to which an idea and no more was present one smell for example or one taste or one sound no such idea could it should seem present itself as an idea of time condillac in his traité des sensations took a statue and having taken a leaf out of the     book of pygmalion endowed it successively as we have seen with the several senses at first one by one afterwards in such groups as it occurred to him to collect them into for that purpose neither from any one smell nor from any one taste nor from any one sound nor from any one feeling supposing it diffused all over its body could this statue of his form it should seem any such idea as that of time from a single object of sight perhaps yes viz supposing the object of sight spacious enough to present different parts subtending though it were ever so small an angle coloured or not coloured the surface would present distinguishable parts and during one portion of time supposing the attention of his statue applied to one part—during another portion of time to another here it should seem would be ground sufficient for her building on it an idea of time to our statue thus borrowed from the ingenious abbé condillac neither by one smell nor by one taste nor by one sound nor by one feeling whether universal or local could the idea of number be suggested but correspondent to any one of those senses suppose two sensations then it is that the idea of number presents itself or at least is capable of presenting itself to her mind what if at all times she had one sensation of each kind and no more—still it should seem no idea of number coalescing the whole assemblage of sensations would form altogether no more than one in regard to the sense of sight whether it presented her or not with the idea of number would depend it should seem on the figure of the surface by which the angle formed by the pencil of rays on entrance into the eye was subtended suppose it circular no difference anywhere no number suppose it triangular—here would be three points by each of which a different idea might be produced and thence the number three of figure the idea is not derivable but through that of number it may be received   from sight   from feeling witness the blind of quantity the idea may be derived   from number without figure   from figure without consideration of number but the idea of figure cannot be derived without that of number of these eight abstractions six viz   place   motion viz relative motion   time   number   figure   quantity—in a word all but vacuity or void space and rest have furnished so many distinguishable branches of science—branches let us say of choristoscopic somatology each of them already furnished with a separate name how far soever from being uniformly apposite and expressive i sciences having for their subject the predicament of place topography a term confined in its customary application to small portions of the surface of our earth though with equal original propriety applicable to any portion or portions of the whole universe chorography a term not much in use but when in use applied to portions larger than topography is commonly applied to geography a term exclusively and necessarily as its etymology shows confined to this our earth and subject to that limitation applicable to any portions so they be not so small as that the propriety of the application shall find on the part of topography a ground or pretence for disputing it by uranography or still better by uranognosy rather than astronomy may that branch of topography taken in its largest sense which remains after the substraction of geography be designated uranognosy rather than uranography because while on our earth the situations of its several parts with relation to each other when measured upon a large scale are never observed to undergo any considerable change those of the bodies of which the whole universe is composed are as far as observation or indication may be depended upon—are all with relation to each other in a state of constant relative motion and accordingly their relative situations undergoing continual change uranognosy or even uranography in preference to astronomy because by the word astronomy a needless separation is made of the bodies which whilst some perceptibly others imperceptibly are continually moving in their boundless field ii sciences having for their subject the predicament of motion had it happened to this predicament to have been customarily taken for the subject of contemplation in its whole extent i e under all the applications capable of being made of it to particulars kineciology or kinematology or some such word might have been the name allotted to it taken in its whole extent however it presented not any such identity or unity of interest as to give occasion to a portion of science having exactly those same dimensions in the case however in which the motion is considered as receiving its direction from the hand of man whether its origin be or be not derived from that source it has received principally from the pens of french philosophers a name of its own viz la dynamique—with an english termination dynamics δυναμις is the greek word for power and it is by direction given to motion that is to matter in a state of relative motion that mechanical power is produced and employed of the field of dynamics a great but scarcely a determinate portion is occupied by mechanics taken in the narrowest sense in which it is commonly employed when motion considered in the case in     which it has its origin in volition in animal volition is excepted motion in every other case has for its cause or shape that to which the name of attraction has since the time of newton been applied or its opposite and antagonist repulsion in other words to one or other of these heads or both together will be found referable every motion which for the purpose of technology has been employed or regarded as capable of being employed in addition to and in aid of animal force in the character of a primum mobile it is by the balance between the several modifications of attraction on the one hand and of repulsion† on the other that the relative situation of the particles of the several bodies one amongst another and thence the weight and texture of those bodies respectively are determined iii sciences having for their subject the predicament of time by chronology events in so far as a persuasion more or less intense or decided in affirmation of their existence has been suggested by appropriate evidence are presented to our view events considered as the word itself imparts with reference to time with which is also commonly connected a reference to place in so far as in addition to the events themselves nakedly considered intimation is given of accompanying circumstances in so far as they have appeared material and therein and therewith of the real or supposed causes and anticauses instruments agents and counteragents principal and accessory chronology takes the name of history according as it takes for its subject the transactions of political states or other aggregate bodies of men history is either aggregate commonly termed general or individual i e if taking for its subject what has been supposed to have been done and experienced by this or that individual for the designation of individual history the appellation commonly employed is the greeksprung word biography literally the delineation of life iv sciences having for their subjects the predicaments of number figure and quantity among the three predicaments respectively designated by these three names the nature and intimacy of the relation that has place has already been brought to view of figure the modifications are scarcely conceivable nor accordingly clearly expressible otherwise than by means of number whilst quantity is a predicament including both and therefore still more abstract than either by the greeksprung word posology the science of quantity may it is believed and if so now for the first time not inappositely be distinguished melomorphic or say morphoscopic and amelomorphic having regard to figure and not having regard to figure to the one or other of these denominations will the whole contents of the field of posology be found referable of posology the melomorphic or morphoscopic branch has found in the word geometry measurement of the earth a denomination altogether familiar but far from being coextensively expressive in the practice of measuring the earth may be found the origin of this branch of art and science as well as one of its great uses but besides the earth it is moreover employed in the measuring of the rest of the visible universe not unfrequently in the measuring of imaginary and unexemplified extension i e in the measuring of nothing at all and it is when thus employed that those by whom it is cultivated seem most proud of it oristic and aoristic or more expressively oristicosemeiotic and aoristicosemeiotic determinately and indeterminately expressed—to one or other of these denominations will the whole contents of the field of amelomorphic posology be found referable of amelomorphic posology the oristicosemeiotic branch has always had an appellative no less apposite and expressive than familiar in the word arithmetic i e the art and science which has numbers for its subject—the art of applying numbers to use including the science of the properties of numbers the aoristicosemeiotic in the arabicsprung word algebra an appellative not much less familiar but altogether inapposite and unexpressive for the designation of the branch of art and science for the designation of which the word posology has been as above proposed the word familiarly employed is as every one knows the word mathematics—a word not altogether inapposite but in an enormous degree uncommensurably expressive for in its original language of what is it that the word is expressive of everything that is ever learned neither more nor less but for this abuse in the designation of the class of intellectual exercises by which a lesson is got the adjunct mathematic would in consideration of its familiarity have been employed but in the constantly erroneous conception of which in consequence of the abusive extension thus given to it it could not have failed of being productive an exclusive negative was found opposed to the use of it applied and unapplied—according to another principle or source of division may the field of posology taken in its whole extent as above sketched be divided     instead of applied mixed instead of unapplied pure are the terms in familiar use in so far as by pure neither more nor less is expressed or suggested than with reference to some correspondent object unapplied to and thence unmixed with it is simply and coextensively synonymous with unapplied and in so far not pregnant with error and delusion but here steps in imagination and forasmuch as in their physioplastic state most objects are found in a state of combination with others and all objects have a tendency to combination with others while at the same time for many useful purposes it is necessary to have them in a state as free from combination as possible whether to the end that they may be applied to use in that state or that for the purpose of being applied to use they may be made to enter into new combinations and whereas the bringing them into or keeping them in that state is very commonly a work of more or less considerable difficulty as well as labour and expense thence it is that to this fundamental idea of the absence of combination imagination by means of the association of ideas has attached the accessory sentiment of approbation which being indiscriminating has given to its application an extent more or less outstretching that which by the precept of utility would have been marked out for it inasmuch that through no inconsiderable part of the extent given to the application of it the word pure is synonymous to useless v of space and rest—of these predicaments—of these supremely abstract and comprehensive appellatives two have been mentioned viz void space or vacuity and rest i e relative rest absolute there being none of which in any instance the existence is either known or probable which are not of the number of those which have become the subjects of so many correspondent branches of art and science of the exceptions thus constituted to the general rule the cause seems not unobvious presenting no variety no change neither of them is a source of use nor on any other account an object of curiosity pathematology by this name may be designated the science of psychology in so far as pleasure or pain are taken for the subjects of it—applied to pleasure it will receive the specific name of edonology—applied to pain that of odynology but for preestablished associations pathology as equally apposite would in respect of brevity have furnished a preferable name the appellative however has been employed by the art and science of medicine and after being shorn of a great part of its import confined to a corner of the field occupied by that science pleasure and pain being the only objects possessed of intrinsic and independent value simple perceptions perceptions if any such there were altogether unconnected with either pleasure or pain would have no claim to attention would not in fact engage attention would not be comprehended within any part of the field of art and science in general pathematic feelings i e pleasure or pain and apathematic feelings i e simple perceptions considered in so far as separable from pleasures and pains are experienced together—are simultaneously concomitant but although instances are not wanting in which as on the one hand perceptions might be found unaccompanied with pleasure or pain so also on the other hand if not pleasure pain at any rate unaccompanied with any perception distinguishable from itself but abundant are the instances in which a simple perception which has neither pleasure nor pain for its contemporary adjunct may through the medium of attention reflection volition and transitive action reckon feelings of both sorts in abundance among its consequences and hence it is that except for clearness of intellection the distinction between pathematic and apathematic perception becomes void of practical use simple perception simple remembrance enjoyment i e sensation of pleasure—sufferance i e sensation of pain—attention reflection examination judgment or opinion or judicial determination volition volitional determination internal action external action—all these on one and the same occasion indeed on most occasions all these several accidents are taking place at the same time but in the way of abstraction for the purpose of science any one of them every one of them may be and has been detached from the rest and held up to view and subjected to examination by itself so many of these incidents as are capable of being distinguished from each other so many compartments or separate fields are included within the vast allcomprehensive field of psychology in the production of the events of which it is the scene the state of the mind is either active or purely passive—purely passive in so far as the will bears no part in the production of them—active in so far as in the production of them the will has had a perceptible and efficient share when in the production of the result the will has had a perceptible and efficient share the field in which that result has had place has either been confined within the precincts of the mind itself or has extended beyond those precincts—in the first case the act to which the will has given birth and in the production of which its efficiency has consisted may be and actually has been termed an intransitive act in the other case a transitive one in so far as the will is concerned in the production of any result the field of the corresponding branch of science which takes cognizance of such result may be termed the field of thelematology in so far as either the will has borne no     part in the production of the result in question or the field of its operation has been confined within the precincts of the mind—the field of the corresponding branch of science may be termed the field of noology passive or purely passive noology when in the production of the result the will has had no share—active in so far as in the production of the impression made and correspondent change produced in the mind the will has borne a share thelematology or thelematognosy has pathematology for its basis it is by the eventual expectation of pleasure or pain that in every case the will and thereby the agency internal only or internal and external together are determined it is by the idea of pleasure or of exemption from pain considered as about to result from the proposed act that the volition in pursuance of which the act is performed and consequently the act itself is produced in the character of ends and in the character of means in that double character it is that pleasures and pains or their respective negatives are continually presenting themselves not pain itself but its negative i e exemption from pain is the end but in the character of a means pain itself operates as well as its negative—pain itself as well as pleasure what dynamics is to somatology the practical branch of thelematology or the art of giving direction to volition and thereby to action is to psychognosy or psychology—it may be termed psychological dynamics from somatology and psychology taken together eudæmonics or the art of applying life to the maximization of wellbeing derives its knowledge of the phenomena belonging to human existence considered as applicable to that its purpose in the one word deontology may be comprehended the knowledge in so far as by art it is attainable of the course by which on each occasion those means may with most advantage be rendered conducive to that common end in the field of deontology as thus explained will be found included the several fields of ethics meaning private ethics or morals internal government and international law if on ground so thorny and so slippery inquiry could be warranted in expressing itself with that intensity of persuasion that fulness of assurance which is included in the import of the word knowledge the field of deontognosy would be the more expressive denomination for the designation of the field of this branch of art and science in that case deontognosy would be the knowledge of what on every occasion is by the person in question proper to be done were it not for the extent thus given to deontology upon a great part not to say the greatest part of what has been advanced and written on the subject of ethics of government and of international law taken together an exclusion would be put of deontology the field is either private or public and for the division of the science itself these adjuncts may accordingly be made to serve intransitive and transitive to one or other of these denominations will the whole contents of the field of private deontology be found referable intransitive in so far as that individual and no other whose agency is on the occasion in question the object of consideration the person for whose guidance the inquiry is made is the party whose wellbeing is taken into consideration and included in the account transitive in so far as in the account in question the wellbeing of any other individual or individuals is considered national and international to one or other of these denominations will whatsoever belongs to the subject of public deontology be found referable national in so far as in the consideration of the effects of the act or course of conduct which is in contemplation in the list of the persons whose wellbeing is taken into account all the members rulers and subjects taken together of the political state in question all these but no others are taken into this account international or universal in so far as the wellbeing of the members of all other political states taken together or of this or that individual member of such foreign political state is taken into the account when in so far as the person in question is considered as occupying the situation of a member of the ruling few the art and science of deontology will coincide with the art and science of government within the field of which art and science is included the art and science of legislation together with what remains of the field of government after abstraction made of the field of legislation—which remainder may be designated as it commonly appears to be by the appellation of the field of administration as for its end to pathematology—so it is to thelematology and thence to psychical dynamics that deontology looks for its means section iii uses of the foregoing divisions to what purpose all this ramification all these divisions subdivisions and subsubdivisions to what purpose all this neology the words which to everybody are so familiar of which the application is so easy why seek to disturb the possession they have so long held of the field of art and science   0 answer—to enable you whomsoever it may concern should you ever happen to be in the humour not only to complete an allcomprehensive view of the field of art and science but also an observation of the mutual relation and connexion of its several compartments and their respective contents at the same time to show in what way those contents are respectively of a nature to be regarded as interesting and as such as qualifying the whole system to make an adequate return for any such labour as any person may feel himself disposed to employ in the examination of it this view this observation the assemblage of names in use—so long as they are employed to the exclusion of a connected and consistent system of nomenclature such as the foregoing has endeavoured to render itself—will not suffer to be taken in the first place as to the principle or source of division the point of view in which it places the whole field is not merely the most interesting in which it is capable of being placed but the only one to which in itself the appellation of interesting can with propriety be applied unless in so far as it means conducive to wellbeing—to the maximization of the aggregate mass of pleasure—to the minimization of the aggregate mass of pain the word interesting is devoid of meaning in the next place as to the denominations divisions and subdivisions and the names given to the results it is only by a correspondent set of apposite names that the relations that have place between different objects can be instructively and conveniently expressed and thereby as far as by general words can be done the nature the true and distinctive nature of those several objects made known by the most and allcomprehensive term of every system those properties are expressed which are common to all the individual objects which are understood to be designated by and comprehended in the import of that universal appellative divide that aggregate into two parts taking care at the same time that in one or other of those parts every individual comprehended in the whole shall be included—by the names respectively given to those two parts whatsoever properties are peculiar to the contents of each in contradistinction to the contents of the other are designated but in so far as in addition to all those properties which it has in common with other objects those which are peculiar to itself are known and understood the nature of the object be it what it may is understood in addition to that vast assemblage of common properties which is designated by the universal name the greater the number of the divisions and subdivisions which are thus made—while to the two lesser aggregates forming the result of each act of division apposite denominations expressive of a property by which the contents of each of the two compartments are distinguished from those of the other are attached—the greater the number of those successive acts of division the more clearly each one of the individual objects contained under them is rendered distinguishable from every other with which but for the distinctions thus brought to view it might have been in danger of being confounded such is the use of apposite names now observe the inconvenience produced by inapposite ones of their inappositeness the consequence is that in conjunction with the ideas which they are employed and intended to present to view they are continually presenting to view others which are quite different and which in so far as on the occasion in question they are annexed to the words in question are productive of constant confusion and frequent error true it is that originally i e antecedently to established associations neither appositeness nor consequently inappositeness are among the properties of language for giving expression to any idea any and every combination of sounds or figures is as apposite as any other but in so far as between ideas on the one part and sounds or visible signs on the other associations have already been formed then in so far it is that inappositeness as well as appositeness has place with relation to the idea which for the first time it is employed or about to be employed to designate a term is apposite when in virtue of the family connexions with which it is already provided it has a tendency upon the first mention to dispose the mind to ascribe to it properties whatsoever they may be by which that object is distinguished from other objects it is inapposite in as far as in virtue and by means of such its connexion its tendency is to dispose the mind to ascribe to it instead of the properties which are thus peculiar to it others which it is not possessed of or at any rate which are not peculiar to it thus of appositeness on the part of the appellative on the part of the mind to which it presents itself correct at least if not complete conception is at first sight the natural result of inappositeness conception always more or less incomplete and frequently altogether incorrect and erroneous in the above analytical sketch the dichotomous bifurcate twopronged plan of division is that which it may have been observed has all along been endeavoured to be employed the ground and reason of this choice are as follows     in the instance here brought forward on the occasion of the first divisional operation the dividend taken in hand was the aggregate composed of all bodies whatsoever by the first operation performed on it as above it was divided into two condivident portions to one of which all bodies in which the property of life is to be found were referred to the other all bodies in which that property is not to be found take then any individual body for example it being referred to the aggregate distinguished by the adjunct animated if that adjunct be with truth and propriety applied to it what we learn thereby is that it is possessed of all those properties the aggregate of which is designated by the term life proceed now and perform an ulterior viz the next ulterior divisional operation taking for the dividend that one of the two condivident portions for the designation of which on the occasion of the first divisional operation the word animated was employed for the principle or source of division take on this occasion the property designated by the word sensation on this as on the former occasion dividing the aggregate into two portions or heaps throw into the first heap all such individuals in which this ulterior property is to be found leaving for the second heap all those in which it is not to be found in this way to the information which concerning the individual or species in question is conveyed by referring it to the several appellatives body and animated body may be added this further information conveyed by the referring it to the ulterior additional appellative sensitive animated body or to omit the intermediate adjunct as unnecessary since if the divisional process have been rightly carried on i e upon the exhaustive plan as here described then if the object in question be sensitive it cannot but be animated to the shorter appellative sensitive body thus much for theory but the sort of information thus conveyed does it end in theory is it inapplicable to practice if so it were it would be useless if so it had been deemed no such labour as has here been bestowed upon the endeavour to render it intelligible would have been expended upon it but far indeed is it from being devoid of use correspondent to and in every considerate mind determined by the properties which it is found to possess is the manner in which the object be it what it may requires to be and will be dealt with in one of his newly visited and at the same time conquered countries alexander was one day taking a walk in a wood aristotle was in his company pointing to something on the ground which had caught his attention—what is that said the monarch a leaf answered the philosopher a leaf say you why you sec it moves indeed and so it does it is not a leaf it is an animal it is a particular species of insect—the leafcaterpillar i must deal with it accordingly if it be the pleasure of your majesty to have it kept a little further on—there is another odd thing cried the conqueror that stick it seems to be that is just by you do so much as pick it up gladly replied the naturalist had i durst that stick as it seemed to you was a serpent and one of the most deadly sort i have crushed it and killed it or by this time it would have killed me take any object at pleasure and at the same time take any property at pleasure to that same object either that same property does belong or it does not this property belongs to that object—this property does not belong to that object the two propositions are with reference to each other termed contradictory ones to whatsoever object applied both of them cannot be true one or other of them is sure to be so hence may be seen the convenience of that plan of division according to which in one or other of the two compartments or condivident portions into which at each step the dividend is divided every particular contained under the name of the dividend is sure to be found if the dividend thus assumed be that one object by which the whole field of art and science is occupied and covered proportioned to the number of operations which under this plan of division can be performed with truth the nature of everything contained in that field is gradually developed and in proportion as it is developed clearly and thoroughly expressed and made known this being the case the consequence is that in so far as the observations in pursuance of which the properties in question have been ascribed to the object in question are correct truth will be the property of every proposition by which an object is referred to any one of the heaps and correspondent compartments thus formed at every step be the individual or other particular object what it may so it does but belong to the universal all comprehensive aggregate which stands at the top of the system to one or other of the heaps or compartments thus formed it cannot but belong and at the same time it cannot belong to both of them hence it is that so long as the divisional process proceeds upon this plan—so long it is that of the whole contents of the universal allcomprehensive aggregate no one item is omitted which in other words is as much as to say that the plan of division is allcomprehensive and exhaustive that the whole stock of materials contained under the appellative by which the universal aggregate is designated is all along exhausted to furnish the matter on which the operations are successively performed instead of bifurcate twopronged suppose the plan of division for example trifurcate threepronged so long as it remains in this state the test of allcomprehensiveness as     above not being applied to it so long it is that whether it be allcomprehensive whether the whole stock of the matters contained in the dividend be or be not lodged in these three condivident portions and in that way the dividend compartment drained and exhausted of its matter remains unindicated if the conditions necessary as above to the rendering the division all along exhaustive have been fulfilled then so it is that in itself and in truth exhaustive it will be but in this case though by the supposition it be exhaustive yet this is more than it will be shown to be and in so far as seeing depends upon showing seen to be minerals vegetables animals—here of the allcomprehensive aggregate designated by the word bodies we have three condivident portions which are the result of a division of the threepronged kind—minerals vegetables and animals subjects of so many kingdoms formed by some logician when in a poetic mood for the containing of them now so it does happen that by these several appellatives taken together all individual bodies whatsoever are designated and thereby in the allotment thus made of subjects to and for the three kingdoms the population of the whole empire out of which portions were taken to people the dominions of these same three kingdoms was and is exhausted of this exhaustion the proof may be afforded and has been afforded by the application of the test of exhaustiveness as above described and exemplified but this is more than either is announced by the name thus given to them or would be announced in and by any tabular view in which without any intimation given of the two dichotomous divisional operations of which these three compartments are the results they were exhibited in the character of so many portions of the allcomprehensive aggregate into which by one and the same operation that aggregate had been divided so again with regard to indication given of properties distinctive as well as of properties aggregative points of difference as well as points of similitude that minerals while agreeing with vegetables in being bodies disagree with them in not being endued with life that vegetables while agreeing with animals in being endued with life disagree with them in not being endued with sensation all this from one source or other we know or upon a moments instruction may be made to know—such of us as are acquainted with the application made of these general names to individuals but of this by the names themselves no intimation is conveyed by the term vegetable what is indicated is—that vegetables possess a species of life viz the vegetable species of life but that in addition to this faculty the other faculty of sensation is not possessed by them of this property life viz though equally belonging to them no indication useful and instructive as it would be viz by serving to distinguish them from animals to prevent their being regarded as possessed of a property of which they are not in truth possessed is afforded this example though of any that could have been found it is by reason of its familiarity the fittest for conveying in relation to the plan of division and arrangement in question a clear and adequate conception is by that very reason the least fit for giving at least to a cursory view an adequate conception of its utility that which when applied to other subjects it is so exclusively qualified for making known being in this instance universally known without it the further the operation is continued in other words the number of steps taken in and by the performance of it the longer and more complex would be the names thus given to the continually lesser and lesser aggregates which by this division are obtained in a synoptic table an instrument designed for the eye rather than the ear this inconvenience may under favour of a welladapted language remain for some time almost imperceptible but in a running discourse a discourse designed for the ear as well as the eye it would probably become intolerable in ordinary discourse therefore at the second if not at the very first operation the necessity will be felt of substituting in the instance of each aggregate in place of the twoworded appellative exhibited by the table a singleworded one thus in english to the twoworded appellative material substance on the occasion of the first division made of the import of the universal appellative body a fortiori to the threeworded appellative living material substance—a singleworded appellative so it were that the english language as do the greek and latin† languages afforded one—a fortiori again on the occasion of a second division to the threeworded appellative insensitive living body or the fourworded appellative insensitive living corporeal substance will require to be substituted another singleworded appellative such as plant or vegetable and so in the case of the opposite result of this same division viz animal on this occasion the logician finds himself under the obligation of employing the same sort of expedient as on a similar occasion is wont to be employed by the algebraist who to a heap of as bs and cs mixed up with a heap of xs ys and zs forms to himself in the shape of a single s a concise and most commodious substitute at every step taken in the track of exhaustive division the condivident aggregates or two prongs which are the result when added to the divided aggregate which forms the stem exhibit a definition and that of the regular kind a definition per genus et differentiam of the two aggregates thus brought to view     thus in the porphyrian tree the two terms living and lifeless present when added to the term body the definition of any term in the import of which the import of either of the two terms respectively employed for the designation of them shall be included true it is that in relation to this instrument of instruction thus much must be confessed viz   that it is an instrument for the due handling of which no small quantity of mental labour coupled with no slight portion of knowledge and no small degree of correctness on the part of the judgment are necessary   that in respect of the stock which it requires of those qualities of which they being when separately taken so rare are when in conjunction consequently so much more so the number of the divisional operations employed and consequently the number of aggregates one within another which are the result must perforce receive a pretty early limitation   that in so far as error creeps in instead of the true and clear instruction which it is in its nature to convey false instruction and confusion will be conveyed by it   that such error will be liable and apt to be the result wheresoever previously to the fixation of the two condivident appellatives the test of exhaustiveness as above described is omitted to be applied to the result of the division which has been made   that though if it were possible for every race of individuals or even for every individual object comprehended in the aggregate in question to be included in the view given of the contents our acquaintance with the contents would be by so much the more perfect and the table thereby so much the more useful yet it is to a comparatively very small number of divisions and thence to a correspondently very small number of articles constituting the results of these divisions that the usefulness and even that the practical application of this useful instrument will unavoidably be found confined   that accordingly the faculty of making use of it with advantage will be found confined in its application to the largest aggregates which the nature of things affords as well as to a small number of the steps which in the course of the divisional plan might by possibility be made the greater the labour the complexity and nicety of the operation the fewer the occasions on which with an effect advantageous upon the whole it can be employed but of these observations what is the result with regard to this instrument much the same as with regard to gold—not that it is of no use—not that it is of no value but that the getting it for use is an affair of no small difficulty and that accordingly of the whole number of occasions on which a man would be the better for employing it and would accordingly be glad to employ it if he could it is but in a small part that he is able to employ it   that though to maximize the instructiveness of the partition it is necessary to render it demonstratively and manifestly bifurcate in which case at each operation the numbers of parts into which the whole aggregate is divided will be no more than two yet to the number of the directions in which or sources of division from which the whole may thus be successively divided there is no limit in the direction of the sections at right angles to that direction—at any angle other than a right angle—in any one or more of these ways may an orange be divided yet in each instance into two and but two parts and thus far even into equal ones not to speak of the infinity of the modes into which it may be divided into two unequal ones of this diversified plan of bifurcate and exhaustive division this division from several sources—the use is to reach such general terms as the usage of language has established and therewith exhibit the several relations which the objects respectively designated by them bear to each other viz in so far as the aggregates which they respectively serve to designate have been so made up that if the course of the division were confined to one direction the nature of the case would not admit of any such course being carried on upon the bifurcate and exhaustive plan as would take them in         essay on language now first published from the manuscripts of jeremy bentham note by the editor this essay as well as that on grammar which immediately follows it are edited from the collection of mss on psychological subjects mentioned in the editorial notice to the essay on logic supra p     they will be found occasionally to embrace matter not generally included in the respective subjects by other authors being by them usually referred to rhetoric or criticism both the works are in a fragmental state the outlines seem not to have been fully developed and many parts projected have not been completed from the pencilmarkings on the margin the author seems to have intended to include his observations on grammar within an extensive work on language when the other departments should be completed on the same scale in the state in which the mss were found there was a convenience in presenting the portions more directly bearing on grammar in a separate form as they could not be symmetrically incorporated with the portions relating to the other departments of the subject of language to the reader however both tracts will naturally present themselves as disjecta membra of some greater work and indeed the author seems to have designed to incorporate them in his great treatise on logic         introduction uses to which in the character of ends this essay is directed practical and speculative or theoretical in both these points of view will the matter of language be here considered—in a speculative point of view to what end answer to this end viz that the objects for the accomplishment of which it is considered in the practical view may be the more effectually attained on this occasion as on all others suppose no practical good attainable speculation is without use and without value it is therefore no otherwise than in virtue of its relation to practice that the speculative survey proposed to be taken of the matter in question is of any use but if by its relation to practice the speculative survey be subservient to practice it is then itself of practical use and the difference between the practical survey and the speculative vanishes and so in effect it does in respect of everything but vicinity to use to actual and particular use to particular use that part which is distinguished by the name of practical is most immediately subservient that which is termed speculative in a manner not quite so immediate it being only through the medium of the practical part that it is so thus much being premised i proceed to bring to view the order in which the principal and most comprehensive topics viz those in which taken together all others will be included—will follow one another in the ensuing pages i modes or forms of which discourse or language has been found susceptible viz audible visible and their respective substitutes ii uses of language   primary or social viz communication of the matter of thought from mind to mind   secondary or solitary viz   recordative of the matter of thought   improvement of the matter of thought and language—improvement of thought viz always with a view to action otherwise the improvement is but imaginary not real iii operations performable in relation to discourse or language viz   employing in the ordinary manner   choosing for use   learning   teaching   improving iv different occasions on which it may be desirable that language should be respectively applied to the several sorts of uses to which it is applicable viz   simple information applying to the conception   probation applying to the judgment   gratification applying to the sensitive faculty   excitation applying to the will through the medium of the affections and the passions v properties desirable in the matter of which language is susceptible this will be determined by and bear reference to the several preceding topics viz   modes or forms   uses   operations   occasions of these properties the following list will it is hoped be found not to want much of being a complete one—  clearness   correctness   copiousness   completeness   nonredundance   compressedness   pronunciability   melodiousness   discibility  0 docibility    decorability    meliorability    impressiveness    dignity    patheticalness vi different degrees in which these several desirable properties are possessed by the principal and best constructed languages in use† vii means by which in so far as the particular language employed by him admits of the possession of them these several desirable properties may on each occasion be secured by the individual by whom the matter of language is employed viii explanation of the several parts of speech i e of the different modifications of the matter of language corresponding to the several modifications of thought for which—as often as to any considerable extent thought comes to be communicated whatsoever be the subject and the occasion—expression requires to be found and for which signs must in every language be provided and accordingly—whatsoever be the difference between the sign or signs employed for the designation of any given import in this or that language and the sign or signs employed for the designation     of that same import in this or that other particular language—are accordingly furnished chapter i modes or forms of which discourse or language has been found susceptible viz audible visible and their respective substitutes section i definitions the word language is wont to be regarded in three different senses i as an instrument employed in and for the interchange or say communication of ideas between man and man and this without distinction as between different societies among men or regard had to the particular occasion on which or the particular purpose for which it is employed—call this the informationregarding sense ii as considered with a view to certain particular occasions and to the several purposes for which it is employed or employable on these several occasions call this the occasion and purposeregarding sense iii as employed to designate the different collections of signs which have been or are employed by different societies among men for giving expression to these same ideas in this sense it is employed for the purpose of bringing to view the difference between languages ancient and modern and the languages employed in and by the different nations by which the earth is inhabited as for instance the english the french the german and so on language considered in the most extensive sense of the word is the aggregate of the matter of discourse actually employed or capable of being employed by all individuals of the human kind taken in the aggregate considered in its next most extensive sense it is the aggregate of the matter of discourse actually employed by all the individuals of this or that portion of human kind taken in the aggregate in this sense when spoken of it is spoken of by the name of a language to constitute a language a portion of the matter of discourse must suffice for the purpose of whatsoever intercourse between individual and individual is necessary for the continuance of the existence of each individual and that of the species in general language† is seldom considered in any other point of view than that of an instrument of communication—an instrument employed by one mind in making communication of its contents to another mind but upon an attentive view it will be found that when perception has been excepted of all the several distinguishable faculties of the human mind there is scarcely one in the use of which it is not habitually employed—scarcely one which without it would be exercised with any considerable advantage to any considerable extent section ii signs employed in discourse—audible visible and their respective substitutes at a stage a certain degree advanced in the career of civilisation man has two perfectly distinct and different modes or instruments for the fixation of thought and the conveyance of it from mind to mind the one that in which—on the part of him whose design it is to make the communication the instruments employed are measured or as they are termed articulate sounds produced by organs which in man are in a peculiar degree adapted to that purpose—on the part of him by whose senses it is the intention of the utterer of these sounds that the communication so made of them should be received and on his mind the requisite impression should be made the corresponding organs of hearing these accordingly may be termed audible signs the other that in which on the part of the author of it the instruments employed are perceptible characters and on the part of the intended receiver with the exception of the particular case in which the appropriate organ is deficient the instruments put in exercise are the organs of sight these accordingly are termed visible signs that the signs which address themselves to the ear were the first in use several considerations concur in rendering manifest one is that the audible form is alike natural to mankind and to the inferior animals the visible though as experience testifies not altogether incapable of being employed by man in his intercourse with some of the most intelligent species of animals is not as far as     appears at any rate in a degree approaching to that in which the audible is natural to any of them another proof is that of all the denominations by which in any of the civilized languages this mode of communication is designated the organs of speech are the only ones by which it is ever in any direct way designated witness this very word language derived as it is from the latin name for a tongue lingua witness also the other word speech by which from what root soever derived the audible form and that to the exclusion of the visible never fails to be presented true it is that for the designation of both alike there exists in the english the word discourse which word is moreover derived from the latin word discursus having for its logical conjugate the verb discurro but of the verb discurro the original import is by far more extensive and at the same time less appropriate by it is meant to run over or to run on and accordingly so far is it from being in any sufficient degree on all occasions appropriate that on many occasions notwithstanding the seeming contradiction even in speaking of discourse in its visible form it has been found necessary to put aside that appellation and instead of it to employ the word speech or the word language for two purposes it was necessary that at this early period the distinction between these two forms should be brought to view one is that of making out and rendering complete the list—that list so important in a practical point of view—the list of the properties desirable in language among these some will be seen or at any rate one the application of which is confined to the audible signs of language another is that of being necessary to the purpose of forming and conveying a distinct conception of the solitary use of language this being as to a considerable portion of it confined as already intimated to the visible signs of language hence in answer to the question—what is meant by language—necessarily included is the answer to the question what is meant by signs—for signs are the elements of which language is composed these signs then are in the first place either   evanescent or   permanent into the two classes thus designated may be divided the whole aggregate of these signs this is the primary distinction to which those others which there will be occasion to bring to view are subordinate evanescent signs are those of which words pronounced by the mouth are composed those which address themselves to the ear permanent are those which address themselves to the eye for the most part that is to say in the language of most nations the permanent visible signs are themselves but signs as it were of the second order—signs of those same audible signs which in the language of these countries at any rate were the sole primary signs of which language at its origin and for an immeasureable extent of time thereafter was composed i say in most languages for an exception there is viz that which is consituted by the chinese language principal and subsidiary—into the two classes thus designated may be divided the whole aggregate of these signs by principal understand those which in the ordinary state of the human senses are employed by subsidiary those which in the case of the extinction of any of those senses are employed as substitutes to the above principal ones of the latter class the signs chiefly in use if not the only ones that have ever been in use are those of which the finger language is composed partly for their own sake partly in respect of the light capable of being thrown thereby upon the field of language considered as applied to ordinary purposes three particular topics which may be considered either as subordinate or as collateral with reference to that principal topic present a claim to notice these are   shorthand   signals   cyphers   signs—employed or employable in the government of brutes shorthand has for its object the reducing to such a degree the time necessary for the committing to written signs the words of an oral discourse as to enable a man thus to give fixity to the whole of it without loss signals cyphers and signs have for their objects one or other or more of the following results viz   producing despatch   surmounting distance   preserving secrecy section iii subjects of discourse of discourse the only immediate subject is the state of the communicators mind in other words of some one or more of the faculties belonging to it of this proposition the truth it is believed will presently be made apparent the faculty the state of which is thus declared may be either the active faculty to which belongs the volitional faculty or the passive faculty if it be the volitional branch of the active faculty the discourse in and by which expression is given to it will be—a wish a command a request or a petition if it be a branch of the passive faculty that branch will be—the perceptive faculty the retentive  00 faculty or memory or the judicial faculty or judgment if it be the perceptive faculty—in every case except that of a sensation produced by an external body by operating on the touch—the object or subject by which the sensation is produced—the object the action of which is the exciting cause cannot but be present and in action at the time of the expression at the time of the declaration made for if that object be not present the faculty the state of which is declared cannot if the declaration be true be any other than the memory of the cases in which the faculty the state of which is declared is the perceptive faculty or of the case in which it is the retentive faculty no separate consideration need be made for seldom indeed is either the perceptive or the retentive faculty in exercise or operated upon but an act or exercise of the judicial faculty is mixed with it there remains for consideration the judicial faculty when concerning the state of the judicial faculty a declaration is expressed—the existence of a persuasion in some shape or other—an opinion a belief in relation to some object or other is thereby expressed this object the declared subject of this persuasion will be the state either of the communicators own mind or of some exterior object or aggregate of exterior objects—exterior viz in relation to his own mind the portion of time in or in relation to which the state of this exterior object or aggregate of objects is considered and declared will with reference to the portion of time in which the declaration is made be either present past or future or all those or any two of those portions of relative time the exterior objects concerning which such declaration is made will belong either to the class of persons or that of things or to both these classes in regard to motion and rest the state in which at any such given point of time they are thus considered as spoken of as existing will be either a quiescent state i e a state of rest or a moving state i e a state of motion the objects in question any such as are considered as appertaining to the class of things will either be such as are endowed with the volitional faculty or such as are destitute of that faculty when considered as the result of motion any state of things is termed an event considered as having had for its cause an exertion of the volitional faculty whether on the part of a person or of a thing an event is itself termed an action or is considered as having action—an action for its cause it is only through some sense or senses external or internal i e physical or psychical that anything can be known to a man or to speak more correctly that concerning any object or aggregate of objects any persuasion can be obtained in so far as it is from his own sense or senses external or internal that the persuasion which on the occasion in question is expressed by the communicator on the question is represented by him as obtained the persuasion is said to be indigenous in so far as it is from a declaration made or supposed to have been made by any other person that the persuasion so expressed is represented as being derived it may be styled an adoptive persuasion the existence of any expressible state of things or of persons or of both whether it be quiescent or motional or both at any given point or portion of time is what is called a fact or a matter of fact in so far as the act of the perception the memory or the judgment the existence of which is in and by the discourse delivered by the communicator in question represented as being the result of the exercise not of his own faculties but of the faculties of some other person the declaration so made by the communicator in question is termed a report—a report made concerning the state of the things or persons which is therein and thereby averred and declared in this case and thus far the whole of the subject of the report as declared by the reporter—the only matter of fact of the existence of which by such his communication the communicator as such declares the existence—is the matter of fact that to the purport in question at the time in question if mentioned a declaration was by this other person made at the time of the communication made that which is declared as being present to the mind of the communicator is neither more nor less than a recollection or rather more correctly the persuasion of the existence of a recollection—a work of the memory by which the fact of his having at the time in question by means of one or more of his senses received and obtained a perception of the matter of fact so described as above the description of which is—the fact that at the time in question by the person in question a declaration to the purport or effect in question was made to the declaration of the existence of such recollection or rather of the existence of a persuasion of the existence of such recollection may or may not be added as it may happen a persuasion affirmative or disaffirmative of the supposed matter of fact the existence of which was the subject of the report in question supposing such report to have been made as according to the recollection it was made  0  chapter ii uses of language when in the state at which in a civilized nation as far back as history reaches the subject of language is contemplated two perfectly distinct howsoever intimately connected uses of it will be found observable these may be termed the   purely selfregarding   extraregarding the object of the latter the communication of thought the object of the other the improvement of thought the one whose object consists in communication may be termed the social use the other for distinctions sake though not less than the former capable of being ultimately subservient to social purposes yet not being immediately so—the solitary use the extraregarding or social and that alone is the use to which language is indebted for its existence it was for a long time not only the only use actually made but the only one which was even so much as in contemplation for the purpose of communicating ideas were the several portions of the matter of discourse first employed of the solitary use even to this day no instance is recollected in which in the character of a separate use completely distinct in its nature from the former any notice has in print been taken the practice of applying the mind to look as it were into itself—to look at its own ideas by means of the words to which they stand associated is the practice of man as he exists in a state of society comparatively mature meditation has not been among the purposes to which language in the earliest state of society has been applied as to the social use it is in its nature already as familiar as it is in the power of words to make it by the selfregarding or solitary or say communicationnotregarding use of language understand that use which the matter of discourse is of to the individual in question relation had to his own ideas independently of that use which supposes communication made or about to be made by one individual to another or others this use may be thus expressed—serving to the ideas associated with the several correspondent words or combinations as so many anchors by which they are fastened in the mind in regard to these two uses the first observation that occurs is that of the two different instruments capable of being employed to the social purpose viz audible signs and visible signs the visible signs are those which are in a preeminent degree better adapted and more subservient to the solitary purpose than the audible by means of these the individual is able to record the ideas that arise in his mind or that he gathers up in his communication with others and is enabled at any future time to take them for the subjects of meditation or improvement in regard to language two perfectly distinguishable functions may be observed—the intransitive and the transitive in respect of its intransitive function it as it were amalgamates itself with thought—it forms no more than a sort of clothing to thought in respect of its transitive function it is the medium of communication between one mind and another or others this communication may convey information purely or information for the purpose of excitation say—more simply and when as above explained not less precisely—information or excitation to one or other of these ends and purposes or both will language in every case be directed in so far as information is the end the understanding is the faculty upon which in the instance of the person by whom the import of the discourse is intended to be conceived who is principally addressed and intended to be operated upon—in so far as excitation is the end the will to the purpose of simple communication neither in act nor in wish need the philanthropist wish to apply any restriction to the powers of language of such communication evil it is true may be the subject as well as good but in the mixed mass good upon the whole predominates and it cannot be rendered apt for the one purpose without being rendered proportionably apt for the other considered as applied to the purpose of excitation the case may at first sight present itself as being in some respects different in regard to passion and thence in regard to affection which is but passion in an inferior degree and always liable to be raised to higher degree repression not excitation may appear to be the object to be wished for passion being in every part of the field the everlasting enemy of reason in other words of sound judgment alias correct and allcomprehensive judgment  0  but even to the lover of mankind an acquaintance with the powers of language even when applied to this dangerous purpose is not without its use for by the same insight by which the mode of increasing its powers in this line is learned the mode of repressing them when and in so far as applied to pernicious purposes is learned along with it in the case of moral as in that of physical poison an acquaintance with the nature and powers of the disease is commonly a necessary preliminary to an acquaintance with the proper nature and mode of applying the most efficient and upon the whole the most benignant remedy chapter iii operations which in the character of an art are performable in relation to discourse or language in general   learning   using or employing   teaching   improving or ameliorating—these are so many operations capable of being performed and the three first at least actually and continually performed in relation to everything that bears the name of art the order in which these several operations are brought to view or in which their names are made to precede each other is it will readily be observed the order of priority in respect of performance whatsoever be the operation in question a man must have learned to perform it before he can perform it he must have known how to perform it before he can teach it and thereby enable another to perform it and unless it be by some extraordinary and extraordinarily felicitous accident he must not only have learned it but be in use to practise it to practise it in the state in which he finds it before he will be able to make improvements in it i e to raise it up to a higher and better state than that in which it had happened to him to find it to a first glance as applied to all these several operations the observation seems to present the aspect of correctness but upon a closer view to confine it in every part within the pale of truth it will be found to require sundry limitations but for which it would be liable to give birth to errors of such a nature as to exercise or practise a pernicious influence   the truth of it is throughout confined to the several operations taken singly of which the vast aggregate called by the name of the art in question is comprised of those particular operations it will in almost every instance happen that a number more or less considerable may be found of which one and the same person may in one and the same day or even hour while he is occupied in learning one be occupied in practising with advantage a second teaching a third and making improvement in a fourth   from a too extensive and unlimited adoption given to it as applied to learning and practising has arisen that most pernicious and foolishly devised clog to productive industry the english statute concerning apprenticeships be the art what it may how it was asked can a man practise it well unless he have learned to practise it therefore be the art what it may seven years shall he have been employed in learning it before he is allowed to practise it   applied to the art of teaching considered in its relation to the operation of learning and at the same time applied to language considered as the particular subject of these general operations it has ever been pressing and continues to press as a dead weight upon the intellectual branch of education to learn it has been said is the duty of the ignorant to teach is the privilege of the knowing the skilful the learned the advanced in age assign to those who are destitute of instruction the function of administering it unite in the same individual the opposite and incompatible functions of scholar and master—the consequence is too obvious to require mention and almost two ridiculous to admit of it at length by bold experience acting in despite of superficial wisdom the discovery has been made that for the function of teacher he who at the same time and in the same seat of instruction is acting in the character of learner is not merely in as high degree adapted but in a much superior degree applied to the operation of making improvement considered in its relation to that of learning to that of practising and even to that of teaching this same effusion of superficial wisdom is an instrument which in the hands of envy the offspring of imbecility and indolence is neverfailingly employed in the endeavour to nip in the bud the blossoms of active genius its language is—be the art what it may not merely to teach it but even to practise it in the perfection to which it has in these times been brought forward not to speak of merely learning it requires all the ability that a man of consummate talent can hope to possess who are you who pretend to improve it—who are you who not content with equaling pretend to have risen above those whom the whole world admires as seated on the highest pinnacle of eminence it is the same instrument which in the hands of the ruling few selfclothed in the robe of superior wisdom is employed in covering with contempt the claims and exertions of the subject many applying to art in general these same instructions would be found applicable with indisputable propriety to that master art the art of discoursing of which the product is discourse  0  itself or language to the art itself—to the fruit or produce of it—to the instrument of it—to all these distinguishable howsoever intimately connected senses are both these words discourse and language wont to be applied teaching learning practising or choosing for use on the occasion of the use made of the names by which these several operations considered as having language for their common subject are designated the state in which language is tacitly and impliedly considered as being taken in hand and made the subject of the operation is the exact state in which it happens to be at the time—by improvement in so far as it is considered as taking place the language is considered as being brought out of that state into a better a language like any other work or subject—a language is good in proportion as the several qualities which on any account are desirable in it are found to be in it in the instance of language what those qualities are it will be the business of the next chapter to endeavour to show as to improvement it has two distinguishable subjects   the work itself language   the several other operations viz teaching learning and employing performable in relation to that work of these operations teaching and learning are correlative and for the reception of any improvement of which the mode of performing them is susceptible they must wait hand in hand but in both these instances improvement considered as applied to the instrument itself and improvement considered as applied to the mode of teaching and learning are perfectly distinguishable in regard to employing on the occasion of improvements relative to the employing the work improvements considered as made in the work itself and improvements considered as made in relation to the mode of employing it in the character of an instrument of discourse will be apt to coincide and become difficultly if at all distinguishable chapter iv properties desirable in a language section i division and enumeration of desirable properties of what use it may be asked is this topic language and languages each particular language and the aggregate mass of signs composed of all languages put together are everywhere what they are every man must take them as he finds them by no man be his own language in particular be all languages in general ever so ill adapted to the ends of language say in one word ever so bad can any of them be made better than it is to a considerable extent these observations will be found no less just than obvious not but that some points however will it is supposed be seen in relation to which observations may be brought to view such as will be found not altogether unproductive of or incapable of being applied to practical use   occasions are not altogether unexampled in which a man has the choice of the language he will make use of on such occasions if any doubt should arise which of them to employ he will be able to satisfy himself which of them on the occasion in question is best adapted to his purpose   be the language in the use of which he has been principally bred—be in a word his native language what it may it may be of use to him to be apprized in what degree the qualities desirable in language are possessed by it why that in respect to them he may employ it to the most advantage—that he may on every occasion be able to endue his language with these several desirable properties and that in the proportions which on the occasion in question are best adapted to use   wild as at first mention the notion may appear upon the list of these qualities articles may be brought to view in relation to which improvement may be seen to be a result the contributing to which in one way or other is not altogether out of the reach of individual hands in so far as in the instance of this or that nation the language in universal use shall have been recognised as labouring in a greater or lesser degree under this or that imperfection correspondent and opposite to any one or more of these desirable properties it may be seen whether in any and what degree that imperfection may be susceptible of a remedy and in what ways and degrees it may be in the power of any individual to contribute to the application of such remedy in a certain sense every man has power over his own style at any rate whatsoever be the language which he employs his style is such as he has made it a language is the aggregate of the significant signs employed by all the several individuals that use that language to know what are the properties desirable in a language is therefore to know the properties desirable in the sum of the discourses used by all those several individuals on all the different purposes and occasions taken together for and on which they can have need to use the language some properties will be alike desirable or at any rate desirable to all purposes and on all occasions without distinction for other properties the demand applies not to all purposes and occasions without distinction but principally and exclusively to certain purposes and occasions  0  these properties are distinguishable into three different classes viz   the informationregarding   the nationregarding   the purposeregarding i the informationregarding i e properties desirable for the communication of the information for which language is employed that is to say whatsoever be the language by means of which it is endeavoured to convey it the persons by whom the persons to whom the occasions on which and the purposes for which it is endeavoured to be conveyed   clearness as opposed to   obscurity    ambiguity    undefinedness i e want of distinctness between the limits of the idea designated by the word in question and the several circumjacent ideas   correctness    copiousness as opposed to scantiness   completeness or say allcomprehensiveness   nonredundance—i e exemption from useless terms inflections and modifications as opposed to abundance in useless terms inflections and modifications   conciseness or say compactness or compressedness as opposed to diffuseness ii the nationregarding class of properties or—properties desirable in a language in comparison with other languages—meaning here by a language and the language the aggregate composed of all the words habitually employed by a certain aggregate of persons in whose instance this habit of employing the same aggregate of words for all purposes of social intercourse causes them to be spoken of as having the same language     pronunciability as opposed to difficulty of utterance     melodiousness as opposed to unharmoniousness     discibility or say capacity of being easily learned     docibility or say capacity of being easily taught     meliorability or say perfectibility capacity of being easily improved     decorability or ornamentability as opposed to baldness iii the purposeregarding class i e properties desirable this or that one of them or this or that other of them in the language or say discourse employed according to the occasion on which and purpose for which it is employed   impressiveness as opposed to feebleness   dignity   patheticalness or say aptitude for exciting tender emotions if the above qualities be termed desirable properties of the first order those properties which are conducive to the investing a language with this or that property of the first order may be termed desirable properties of the second order subservient or say conducive to the primary properties of discibility and docibility are—   giving expression by means of a small as effectually as by means of a larger number of inflections to the idea in question   facility of admitting the junction of two or more words into one considered as applied to language in general that is to every language without distinction every one of these qualities is liable to have place in different degrees not perhaps in any one existing language is every one of these qualities possessed in a degree equal to the highest in which it could be conceived to be possessed of them respectively at the same time not perhaps in the instance of any one of them can it be said with correctness that there is any one of these qualities which is not in any degree to be found applicable to it section ii of clearness with equal right two distinguishable though nearly related qualities may claim to be represented by this word viz exemption from ambiguity and exemption from obscurity both of them negative ones   the case in which ambiguity has place is where after the discourse has presented itself to and has been received by sense two distinguishable acceptations have presented themselves to the mind—two distinguishable and accordingly distinguished imports between which the judgment hesitates unable to determine which of the two it was that was intended should be presented and received by the strict and original import of the word ambiguity the number of these imports is confined to two—but in its application this explanation may be extended to any greater number of imports so as they be determinate in practice it is seldom between more than two that the mind will have to hesitate   the case in which obscurity has place is where after the discourse has been received by sense the mind for a greater or less length of time finds itself unable to fix upon any determinate import as having been intended to be conveyed and if after continuing for a greater or less length of time the endeavour is given up as hopeless the obscurity of the discourse becomes with relation to the individual in question viz the individual by whom it is thus taken in hand converted for a time at least into unintelligibility  0  obscurity so long as it lasts may be considered as the superlative or highest point of ambiguity ambiguity having place to the widest extent it is not as in the case of ambiguity in its stricter sense between two or some other small number of imports and these determinate ones that the mind hesitates but between all or rather among all imaginable ones the greater the number is of the words that are employed in the expression of a given import the less clear is the discourse which they compose take an entire paragraph take any one of the sentences of which it is composed—to whatsoever purpose the mass of discourse in question is considered as a whole till the last word has been heard or read and understood obscurity of a shade more or less deep covers every part of it such being the case the sooner the mind has gone over the whole the sooner this obscurity is dispelled and the less there is of it the sooner it is gone through with section iii of conciseness the conciseness of an expression is inversely as the number of words employed in the conveyance of the idea intended to be conveyed by it the uses of this property are— i when the signs employed are of the impermanent kind such as words spoken—saving in the article of time of time employed in utterance and reception—in speaking and hearing ii when they are of the permanent kind   saving in the article of time employed in reading   saving in the expense of giving birth and preservation to these same permanent signs in the expense of the substraction and colouring matter for writing printing and engraving or the like iii to a certain degree conciseness as above expressed is contributory to clearness that is to say the want of it is contributory to the absence of or is opposite to clearness—is contributory at any rate to obscurity and it may be to ambiguity iv conciseness is in many instances contributory to impressiveness v to apprehensibility vi to retainableness—thus horace   quicquid præcipies esto brevis ut citò dicta   percipiant animi dociles teneántque fideles   de arte poet          two branches of art and science or say two subject matters of knowledge there are in its application to which the usefulness and importance of conciseness is prodigious these are   law   posology or to employ the word which unexpressive as it is is the only one as yet in use mathematics—yet prodigious as is this importance scarcely has it been taken for the subject of observation and indeed as applied to posology namely to the arithmetical branch of it it seems to have hitherto altogether escaped notice of the wonders performed by the means of algebra abbreviation has been one main not to say the principal instrument abbreviation productive of conciseness—the act of giving in a degree more or less considerable to the discourse in question the property of conciseness that compressedness is of use not only immediately and on its own account but mediately and in the character of an instrument of clearness has been already intimated—in what way it is so may now have been observed section iv facility of utterance or say pronunciability though in the field of causality intimately connected with melodiousness this quality is in its nature and thence in idea sufficiently distinguishable from it in proportion as to produce it requires effort on the part of the speaker and on that occasion effort is accordingly employed the fact of its being employed naturally becomes perceptible and the existence of it is actually perceived and in proportion as in the bosom of the speaker uneasiness is or by the hearer is supposed to have place by the force of sympathy the like effect is in his own bosom apt to take place that in the formation of language in general melodiousness and facility of utterance taken together have actually in the character of ends been generally aimed at is a matter of fact that may be stated as perceptible in the history of some languages and it is supposed in a degree more or less considerable in the history of every language in every known language in so far as it is known changes in structure are observable and in every instance these changes appear to have had for their cause a general endeavour towards the giving to the instrument of discourse these agreeable qualities in a continually increasing degree section v of melodiousness or say harmoniousness by each of these terms is meant the property of producing through the medium of the ear a sensation of an agreeable cast in the mind applied to different species of discourse i e to discourse considered as employed for different purposes melodiousness or harmoniousness whichsoever be the term presents two  0  ideas somewhat different though differing rather in degree than in any other particular in this point of view the opposite ends of the scale may be designated by the terms positive and negative a sort of medium being assumed—any point being taken at pleasure as and for the middle point—positive melodiousness has place when the degree of that quality is considered as being above that middle point negative melodiousness when the situation of the degree in question is considered as being below that point in the discourse in question what degree of this quality is required depends upon the nature of the discourse i e upon the purpose and the occasion on which the discourse is employed   in the case of poetry in so far as rhythm i e the succession of measured sounds is considered as entering into the composition of it melodiousness on the positive side of the scale is universally understood as essential and indispensable in the case of the art and labour of the composer one great object is the securing the undiscontinued existence of it   in the case of that sort of poetry in which rhythm is not employed and of which the agreeableness is understood to depend on the intercourse between the imagination of the author and the imagination of the reader melodiousness in the positive degree is not of the essence of the discourse but the quantum of the pleasure produced cannot but be more or less dependent on the degree in which this quality has been conferred on it and at any rate by any positive degree of the opposite quality—unmelodiousness or unharmoniousness—the design cannot but be proportionally counteracted   in the case of public speaking—of a speech delivered to or before a public assembly—though the melody or harmony is of a different cast from what it is of in the case of vocal music or even that of poetry metrical or unmetrical and though positive harmoniousness enter not here as there into the very essence of the purpose yet to that purpose as universally acknowledged of this quality in so far as obtainable an extraordinary share is in proportion to the degree of it conducive and at any rate by any such deficiency as leaves the degree below the middle point the purpose cannot but be in a proportionate degree counteracted   in a word there is not perhaps that imaginable occasion on which by the degree of harmoniousness or unharmoniousness appertaining to the discourse its efficiency with relation to the design of it be that design what it may may not in some degree be influenced this connexion viz between the efficiency of a discourse and the harmoniousness of it when indicated howsoever clear and indisputable is in no small degree apt to be unobserved speaking of the admiration universally bestowed upon shakspeare it is to the harmony of his numbers as much as if not more than to any other feature of excellence in the works of that author that mrs montague attributes the effect when this observation first made its appearance the character of originality was it is believed very generally attributed to it at any rate the quality in question presented itself to the author of these pages in that same character and the observation as one which though when once presented the justice of it was felt had not till then presented itself to his mind section vi of ornability or decorability whatsoever be the import intended to be conveyed by the mere conveyance of that import alone nothing which can with propriety be termed ornament unless it be in so far as harmoniousness and those other intrinsic qualities are considered in that light can be given to the discourse by which that import is endeavoured to be conveyed saving the above exceptions whatsoever therefore of ornament can be given to a discourse will be given by the conveyance of some ideas which are not essential to the main or direct purpose in addition to those which are essential to it of some ideas not essential to the main purpose will the matter of ornament be composed of that matter of ornament the exhibition and conveyance may be performed either by  0  and with or even without addition to the number of the words which if nothing in the way of ornament were conveyed or intended to be conveyed would have been employed in what manner matter of ornament as expressed by additional words designed for that purpose may be added to discourse is a topic that belongs not to the design of this work according to the general nature of the end proposed by the discourse it belongs to the head of rhetoric or poetry the case which alone belongs in any way to the present design is that in which in and for the conveyance of the ornament no greater number of words is employed than would or might have been employed had no such design been entertained nor any such effect been produced under the present head one very general observation may have its use this is—that so long as no addition is made to the number of the words that would otherwise have been employed the addition of any ideas the effect of which is not in some particular and assignable way of a positively displeasing nature the effect of which is not to produce uneasiness in some positive and assignable shape will operate as ornament and have the effect of producing i e at any rate a tendency to produce pleasure of this pleasure the cause has been already brought to view among the qualities desirable in language that of compressedness has in its place been brought to view communication of ideas being the benefit which it is the nature and design of discourse to confer and the time and labour employed on the one hand in the utterance on the other hand in the hearing or reading and in both cases in the considering the discourse not being increased the consequence is that the price remaining the same whatsoever ideas can without any addition to that price be imparted and received are with relation to the mind of the receiver so much clear gain the mind is thus led to the subject of association—of the associations that have place among ideas   what are the sorts of ideas which in the character of main or principal ideas are wont to have others associated with them in the character of accessory ones   what are the ideas which in the character of accessory ones are respectively wont to be associated with these principal ones   in what cases association is wont to be productive of an immediately pleasant or otherwise beneficial effect   in what cases if any of a pernicious effect   by what means any unpleasant or in any other way pernicious effect produced or producible by such association may be put an end to or prevented section vii of impressiveness or force by the word impressiveness is meant to be brought to view the degree in which so far as depends upon the general structure of it—and not upon any particular talent of the individual by whom on the occasion in question it happens to be employed nor yet upon the particular purpose for which on that occasion it is employed—the nature of the language in question affords on the occasion in question be it what it may and with relation to the purpose in question be it what it may the means and probability of accomplishing that purpose in the nature of the purpose may be seen a circumstance on which the form in which this quality presents itself cannot but be more or less dependent the time at which the purpose is designed to be accomplished what is it with reference to the time at which the discourse is uttered is it present or future if future more or less near or remote the faculty proposed to be operated upon what is it—the intellectual alone or the volitional also and if the volitional by what means—by the affections in a temperate state or by the affections operating in a warm or in an inflamed state in a word by the passions on the modifications brought to view by these questions will depend in some measure not only the degree but the mode of the sort of impressiveness best adapted to the nature of the purpose in so far as time future is the time at which the purpose is to be accomplished and the portion in question of that time is remote the memory is the subject on which the impression requires to be made and thus far as applied to a portion of discourse impressiveness coincides with fitness for being held in remembrance if it be on the passions that the impression is proposed to be made the present will be the portion of time more particularly looked to for making it be the purpose what it may of which of these sorts it may how it is that the strength and thence the depth of the impression is influenced by the structure of the language is an inquiry that will call for consideration as we advance at present all that seems suited to this place is—that in most cases impressiveness depends upon or is promoted by clearness in so far as clearness stands opposed to ambiguity and likewise in all cases by compressedness section viii of dignity by dignity is here to be understood that  0  quality or character in a mans style which is the result of its being such as to convey to the hearer or reader the idea of selfpossession on the part of the speaker or writer the idea of his having acquired a mastery over the subject which he has taken in hand whatsoever it be or at the least of his having settled and arranged his thoughts concerning it this quality may be termed a secondary one as being a quality which is as it were a collateral result produced without any separate and additional causes by virtue of some of those which are requisite for securing to the style the qualities of clearness and impressiveness of strength of mind on the part of the speaker or writer dignity of style is a natural consequence and by that means a sign the signs of strength of mind are exhibited in a mans style in greater or less perfection in proportion as it is clear of certain marks which may be considered as symptoms of weakness under one or other of two denominations viz   laxity and   fumbling the principal symptoms of weakness may it is believed be found comprehended   laxity—in what improprieties in the choice and arrangement of words ambiguity and obscurity take their rise have been shown in the several preceding sections but as it is with the several other imperfections which stand opposed to the several qualities desirable in language so is it with these—no man who with equal facility could exclude them from his discourse would leave the marks of them to appear in it and deface it in proportion therefore to the degree in which it is seen to be defaced by these imperfections is the degree of weakness under which his mind is seen to labour in the constitution of the mind ambiguity and obscurity of style are symptoms of laxity and weakness clearness and impressiveness are signs of strength   fumbling—this is the natural result and by that means a symptom of want of preparation when the field which a man has to travel over is new to him he finds himself under the necessity of picking up as he goes the opinions which he sees reason to deliver and the expressions which in the delivering of them he employs the consequence is that no sooner has he pitched upon one opinion and clothed it in such expressions as at the moment have presented themselves than he finds that in some way or other they are deficient in respect of correctness or completeness hence come clause after clause having for their objects the producing the effects of ampliation restriction or modification or in one word amendment besides and again and this too and moreover it is by words of this sort that the symptom of weakness here called fumbling is betrayed in some cases the seat of this disease may be found in single terms in other cases the whole proposition or the whole paragraph or in a word the whole argument must be examined before the nature of the disease becomes apparent and thence before the proper mode of cure can be ascertained instances of fumbling as perceptible in the character of single terms are—species of things picked up on the spot and brought to view one after another in the order in which they have happened to present themselves if a correct and comprehensive view of the subject had been taken some generic term in the import of which the import of all these several specific terms or at least of such of them as belonged properly to the occasion would have been included would have been employed by this means a number of repetitions equal to the whole number of these specific terms minus one would have been spared and if for greater clearness it had been deemed advisable to present separately to view the idea designated by these specific terms or any of them for producing that effect so many single words with the requisite small assortment of connectives for stringing them together might have sufficed and instead of being weakened by correction after correction the first impression would by so many exemplifications illustrations and corroberations have been rendered stronger and stronger proportioned to the difficulty of adequate preparation is the degree in which want of preparation is apt to be unavoidable and thence where it betrays itself the degree in which it appears excusable and conversely—proportioned to the facility of adequate preparation is the degree in which evident want of preparation as evidenced by its symptoms viz laxity and fumbling is apt to render itself offensive and discreditable in every spoken discourse in general want of adequate preparation is much more apt to be unavoidable than in any written discourse in a spoken discourse laxity and fumbling are accordingly more excusable and less offensive than in a written discourse section ix mutual relation of the properties desirable and undesirable in language i clearness conciseness and correctness with their opposites obscurity ambiguity c—their relation while obscurity lasts the signs employed call up no idea signified while indistinctness lasts the sign presents along with the idea intended to be presented and conveyed another idea between which two the boundaries are not defined and ascertained while ambiguity lasts the sign presents  0  along with the idea intended to be presented and conveyed another idea which is not intended to be presented and conveyed but between which and the idea intended to be conveyed the boundaries are sufficiently definite and ascertained when incorrectness has place instead of the idea intended to be presented and conveyed is presented and conveyed an idea which was not intended to be presented and conveyed when and in so far as noncompleteness has place either an idea or ideas which were designed to have place or an idea or ideas in regard to which it is desirable that they should take place fail to take place thus it is that comprehensiveness has two senses—a negative and a positive sense according as the standard of reference is an idea which already has place in the mind of some person or persons or an idea which till the discourse in question was uttered or at least framed never yet had place in the first case the imperfection has place and noncomprehensiveness is the name in the other case perfection has place and comprehensiveness is the name of that perfection in so far as nonconciseness or say noncompressedness or say verbosity has place utterance is given to signs other than those by which the idea intended to be conveyed might have been expressed though perhaps in a manner not quite so free from obscurity ambiguity and indistinctness or say indeterminateness compactness supposes ideas more than one perhaps propositions more than one opposite to compactness is noncompactness or say perhaps desultoriness in so far as desultoriness or say noncompactness has place the propositions or portions of discourse instead of being placed in contiguity are placed at a distance more or less great from one another other ideas one or more being placed between them between the two desirable qualities of clearness and conciseness there is a perpetual repugnancy a perpetual competition—taking each of them at its maximum even an absolute incompatibility between clearness and conciseness considered with reference to the same sentence there exists the same sort of incompatibility as between conciseness considered as a quality of each particular sentence and conciseness considered as a quality of the whole discourse of which that and the other sentences are component members ii copiousness conciseness tractibility—their relation of language the use and the sole use being the communication of ideas in proportion to its copiousness will be the usefulness and in so far the excellence of every language but be the particular language what it will at no one point of time will it contain within itself a stock of words such as without prejudice to the perfection of all these other desirable properties shall be capable of giving expression to all the ideas for the expression of which a demand is capable of having place at a succeeding point of time hence in the property of copiousness if considered as a constantly existing property or quality the idea of tractibility is necessarily included opposite to copiousness is poverty or scantiness scantiness may be distinguished into absolute and relative absolute is that which has place in so far as for the proposition for which a man has occasion to find expression no expression can be found by any means relative where such expression may indeed be found but not without prejudice to conciseness to wit by the employing instead of a singleworded term in the form of a nounsubstantive either a definition or a description more or less loose and diffuse in so far as in language copiousness is a perfection scantiness cannot but be an imperfection copiousness may be distinguished into useful or serviceable and useless or unserviceable in respect of any given words copiousness is serviceable in so far as to the idea or proposition in question without the employing of that word expression either cannot be given at all or not without preponderant prejudice to this or that other one of the properties desirable in language unserviceable in so far as without preponderant prejudice to this or that property desirable in language expression may be given to the idea or proposition in question without the employing of that word scantiness and useless copiousness i e redundancy are properties very capable of coexisting in conjunction with one another in the same language in the vocabularies of the several arts liberal and manual in addition to such as are serviceable others which according to the explanation above given to the word may with strict propriety be termed unserviceable will in almost every instance to an amount more or less considerable be found iii copiousness and simplicity their relation   as to copiousness this is a quality of a positive aspect and presents itself as the principal one the main use and purpose of language is to express thought by the amount of all useful thought for which it is incapable of affording an adequate expression therefore any language cannot but be imperfect and inadequate this observation will be apt to appear so extremely obvious that all mention of it may seem superfluous a prejudice however is to be found established and that in no small force the harbouring of which is irreconcileable   0 with the acknowledgement of this quality in the character of a desirable one the word in and by which this prejudice is wont to find utterance is purity   simplicity in this quality may be seen as it were the antagonist of copiousness a language is copious in so far as it is provided furnished replete with useful matter it is simple in so far as it is unencumbered with matter which being useless is at best superfluous to this purpose the words of which language is composed may be considered   singly but entire   aggregately as put together in the composition of a sentence   fractionally i e each of them in respect of its component parts by useless combinations by words altogether useless or lastly by useless modifications of words may the simplicity of a language be destroyed but allowing to the quality opposite to the one here in question the character of an imperfection in what way it may be asked is it attended with any practical inconvenience in a word with positive uneasiness or with loss of positive enjoyment i answer in this way—whether it be his own native language or a language which with reference to him is a foreign one of no part of any language can the use be obtained by a man without labour and in so far as it is consumed either in the learning or the employing of words or phrases that are without use in so far is a mans labour devoid of use† section x comparative importance of these several desirable qualities such as above is that which in the character of a complete as well as correct one has presented itself as a list of the several qualities desirable in language good—it may be said—desirable but in what degree as compared with one another all in equal degree or in different degrees answer—different and widely distant in the scale of importance will these several qualities it is believed upon comparison with each other be found copiousness and clearness viz clearness from ambiguity and obscurity—compared with all the several others these two qualities present themselves as seated upon a lofty eminence   on the highest point stands copiousness it is only in proportion as it is copious that a language contributes anything to its end—to any of the modifications of which the universal end wellbeing is susceptible reduce its copiousness and in proportion as you reduce it the height of the place occupied by man in the scale of being is reduced from that of a member of the best governed and mannered community down to that of a barbarian of a savage of a beast   next in the order of importance and at no great distance comes clearness—clearness from the two kindred imperfections of ambiguity and obscurity this however is but as it were a sort of negative quality consisting in the absence of two peculiar imperfections each of them diminishing as far as it goes the benefits attached to copiousness   upon a yet lower level presents itself the quality of impressiveness—at any rate if considered by itself viz as having place no otherwise than in a case in which in respect of the article of clearness no deficiency has place a circumstance by which in so far as importance corresponds with utility the importance of this quality viz impressiveness may it should seem be found to experience no inconsiderable reduction is its liability to be rendered subservient to pernicious purposes in     a degree superior to that in which it is likely to be rendered subservient to purposes of a beneficial character—the greater the intensity of passion the greater its aptitude to be productive of pernicious consequences and in the case of a discourse the object or tendency of which is to operate upon the passions the greater the degree of its impressiveness the greater the degree of efficiency with which it is likely to operate upon the passions—the greater the degree of intensity of the passion which it is the nature and tendency of it to excite   and   simplicity and compressedness—lower still is the level on which these two qualities present themselves of their utility that part which is original and intrinsic and which consists of the saving in time and labour is comparatively inconsiderable the principal part consists of that secondary and derivative utility which is composed of and increased by their subserviency to the two qualities of primary and intrinsic utility viz clearness and impressiveness   and   lowest of all stand the two kindred qualities so nearly allied to purely physical ones viz melodiousness and facility of utterance melodiousness—still more the absence of the opposite quality may in some measure be considered as subservient to impressiveness but for this connexion it might perhaps be regarded in no higher character than that of a foreign and accidental ornament not connected with any of the important ends and uses of language and not having application to it but in two portions of its field viz oratory and poetry even as between these two viz melodiousness and facility of utterance—facility of utterance presents itself as standing on one account in so far as it has place in an uncombined state manifestly and considerably below melodiousness by excellence in respect of melodiousness other persons besides the speaker or writer—other persons to the number of which in the case of the writer there are not any limits and in the case of the speaker none but such as are not narrow ones are gratified—by deficiency in that same respect proportionably more or less displeased—by facility of utterance in so far as it is separable and exists separate from melodiousness one individual alone viz the author is affected and he only in so far as the discourse being composed of signs of the audible kind it comes accordingly to be made audible section xi of the qualities desirable in style i e in language considered as employed by this or that individual   simplicity   compressedness   clearness   impressiveness and   harmoniousness—among the several distinguishable qualities which presented themselves as desirable in language in general in the whole structure of every language by whatsoever hands employed these five presented themselves to the case of this or that individual considered as taking in hand this or that language in particular and applying it to his own purpose whatsoever be that purpose these same five qualities will it is believed be found alike applicable and with equal propriety and advantage of the several qualities desirable in the case of language in general considered without reference to an individual employer of the instrument there are two others viz copiousness and facility of utterance or say pronunciability which are not thus applicable   of these copiousness seems scarcely to have any application to the case of an individual speaker or writer in his case copiousness bears reference to the occasion and the subject occasions are not wanting with reference to which a sufficient degree of copiousness may be exhibited in the compass of a single word in so far as the language which he employs fails of being adapted adequately adapted to the subject the most consummate writer or speaker will not be able to give to his style the quality of copiousness in the native language of new south wales the most consummate master of the language of that country would not be able to deliver an intelligible argument in the english court of common pleas in an action of replevin or on what is called a point of practice   pronunciability or facility of utterance—in this we have seen another quality the applicability of which will be found to be confined to the case of a whole language in contradistinction to that of an individual considered as making use of it in so far as the language in which he expresses himself affords a choice it will naturally be especially in this experienced and polished age among the cares of every well educated man especially of the poet and the public speaker to put aside rather than look out for any of those difficultly pronounceable sounds which the usage of early times happens to have introduced into the language and that of intervening times to have left in it but if throughout its whole texture the language abound in sounds of difficult utterance the utmost possible skill on the part of him by whom it is employed may be insufficient to give utterance to a discourse of considerable length without suffering uneasiness and in his intonation and deportment exhibiting sensible marks of such his sufferance without much toil to himself a statesman of the hottentot country might perhaps for a considerable time continue to display his eloquence     but to an european hearer the idea of continual difficulty and considerable uneasiness would all the while present itself one quality there is which will be seen to depend on the individual alone—on the use made by him of the language whatsoever it may be for the designation of this quality no appellative more apt has been found than the word dignity by the word dignity no such meaning is here intended to be expressed as that which is conveyed by the word pomposity with or without dignity pomposity is a quality that may be given to a mans style by inappropriate choice of words taken singly—by words selected for the purpose of impressing on the imagination the ideas of grandeur sublimity and importance commonly at the expense of clearness—words calculated to gratify the ear with pleasure produced by appropriate melody and harmony the quality for the expression of which the word dignity is here employed will be found to depend—not upon the choice of terms taken singly but principally or exclusively upon collocation—and that not so much upon the collocation of words taken singly as upon the collocation of whole sentences and their component clauses or members chapter v of improvement considered as applicable to language or the means by which in so far as the particular language employed by an individual admits of the possession of them the properties desirable in language may on each occasion be secured section i questions applicable to improvements in language to make an improvement or improvements in a language is to cause it to possess in a higher degree than it does at the time in question some one or more of the qualities desirable in a language of these a list as complete as it could be made has already been given† an imaginable ulterior species of improvement would be the putting language in general or this or that language in particular in possession of some quality of which till the time in question no language was ever possessed but if the list above referred to be what it was intended to be—a complete one on this supposition this imaginary species is incapable of being exemplified and realized in connexion with this subject the following are the questions which seem to call for an answer—  what alterations have a just claim to the title of improvements   in what way and in what manner have they actually been brought about without design   whether any and what improvements are capable of being brought about by design in other words in what shape or shapes the nature of language admits of improvement and   by what hands and in what manner improvement in these several shapes may be effected or promoted section ii what alterations may be deemed improvements short is the answer which for this question may suffice of the qualities desirable in language the following list has been given—viz   clearness   correctness   copiousness   completeness   nonredundance or simplicity   compressedness   pronunciability   melodiousness   discibility  0 docibility    meliorability    decorability    impressiveness    dignity    patheticalness in so far as this list is correct and complete the answer to this question has been already given if the list above given be a complete one then it is that in the qualities contained in it added to their respective opposites we have all the qualities good and bad of which a language is susceptible and if so then will every alteration to which the name of improvement can with propriety be applied consist in bestowing upon the language—i e the aggregate of the words of which the language is composed one or more of these qualities in a higher degree than that in which it was respectively in possession of them before after and in consequence and in virtue of the improvement the language will pro tanto and to the extent of the improvement be more copious more simple more compressed more clear i e freer from ambiguity and obscurity more impressive more melodious more easy of utterance more ornamental c than before section iii what improvements take place without design improvements made without design no certainly in all the several shapes in which all the several improvements that have ever been made in none of them has it ever been made any otherwise than with the design of doing what was done in what sense then without design in this sense—viz without any general survey taken of the language without any such thought as that of doing on the individual occasion in question that which on that individual occasion was done   copiousness for the purpose which the individual had in hand a new word is thought wanting—he accordingly makes one       simplicity on the occasion in hand a phrase a word a part of a word which by others had been employed presents itself to him but presents itself to him in the character of a superfluous one or as not better adapted or as less fit than some other which presents itself at the same time—he in consequence according to the nature of the case leaves it or throws it out—forbears to employ it or excludes it and so in the instance of the several other desirable qualities section iv by what hands and in what way improvements in language are capable of being effected or promoted individual and simple practice individual instruction free association government authority—by these several expressions so many different hands by which or so many modes in which improvement in this field is capable of being effected or promoted may be brought to view† in so far as in the nature of the case improvement is capable of being introduced into language by practice—by mere individual practice—any individual may with more or less prospect of success take his chance for introducing it and by what means answer—by clothing the discourse employed by him on each individual occasion with all the several properties desirable on the part of human discourse regard being had to the particular occasion on which it is so employed these several properties being such as are subservient and contributory to the several ends in view for which on the individual occasion in question language is employed if of these same properties the above enumeration is complete then so it is that of every alteration held up in the character of an improvement the effect if that character does in any way belong to it will be to invest it with those same properties one or more in england we hear of this or that man operating in his individual capacity having made improvements in language we hear of voltaire of junius of burke of johnson of goldsmith as having given force to or put a polish upon the language of their respective countries now in what way can these men any one of them have made any improvement in the language—that is to say in the language employed by other persons one or more or all answer—voltaire c writes other persons in number and proportion more or less considerable write on this or that subject with or without thinking that they are endeavouring to imitate him they endeavour to write in the same or a similar manner section v externally applied instruments of improvement external instruments of improvement for augmentation of the usefulness of the several desirable properties of language are— i for abbreviation of the signs thence saving in the labour employed in forming and thereby making use of them   shorthand applicable and applied to all subjects   alegomorphic abbreviation—viz   figures instead of letterpress   algebraic characters instead of figures ii for diffusion or say giving increase to the number of the persons capable of receiving participation in the benefit   instruments whereby increase is given to the diffusion of audible and evanescent signs—  stentorophic tubes   pipes such as those employed in the conveyance of water and gas   cannon—for to a limited degree neither are these hostile instruments altogether incapable of being applied to a peaceable and useful purpose   diffusion by means of signs visible and permanent independent of conveyance—  letterpress substituted to manuscript   manifold mode of writing   means of presenting to the view of a speaker or writer the words he has need of—synonymation as in the gradus ad parnassum   dictionaries whereby of the idea expressed in this or that language corresponding equivalents are presented in this or that other language   diffusion by means of conveyance—  letterpost   telegraphs diurnal and nocturnal iii durability—increase given to instruments of durability are engravings in stone or metal section vi rules for clearness i e the avoidance of ambiguity obscurity and debility so far as depends upon the choice of words taken singly‡ rule i when the language affords a word appropriated exclusively to the expression of the import which alone it is your intention to express avoid employing any word which is alike applicable to the expressing of that import and a different one which may require to be distinguished from it examples—substantives adjectives adverbs—in the instance of all these parts of     speech frequent breaches of this rule may be found i substantives—  the word taste employed instead of the word relish to relish a thing is to taste it with pleasure do you relish this peach in this question there is no ambiguity not even for a moment but instead of this oftentimes we find—do you taste this peach and so in the case of almost any other source of pleasure for example a poem a sonata a building a landscape in the french language there exists no appropriate word by which pleasure is represented as an accompaniment of the perception indicated no word expressive of i taste with pleasure gouter is to taste and for to relish there is again this word and no other in french therefore this imperfection this ambiguity and inadequacy this incompleteness and consequent incorrectness of expression is the result of necessity in the word taste when employed instead of the word relish this imperfection is needlessly and inelegantly copied why answer—from affectation and vain glory to give the hearer or reader to understand that the speaker or writer is so well acquainted with that foreign language that it is more readily present to his memory than his own language ii adjectives—either employed instead of each to the word either belongs an exclusive signification which belongs not to the word each where the idea of exclusion is not intended to be conveyed how slovenly and absurd is it not to employ a word by which the exclusion is expressed yet of negligence in this shape examples are continually occurring poetry is the species of composition in which it is most frequent there it has its excuse—  in cases where the monosyllable each would not so it may be that the dissyllable either will suit the measure   in poetry distinctness is less requisite than in prose a uniform distinctness would even be incompatible with the nature of the composition and fatal to the design of it to produce and keep up in the mind confusion so it be but accompanied with pleasure is an object not of aversion but of endeavour and study to affectation may the sin against propriety be imputed in this case as well as in the last preceding one in saying taste when he means relish a man pleases himself with the thought of showing how familiarly he is acquainted with the language of france in saying either when he means each a man pleases himself with the thought of showing how familiarly he is acquainted with the language of poetry affectation the genus pedantry the species formerly the dress most frequently worn by pedantry was greek and latin latterly it is french and poetry to the ambiguity attached to this impropriety one circumstance alone operates in some measure as a palliative if so it be that for predicating what you meant to predicate alike of two things a and b the word you have employed is a word by which one of them is excluded conceive the word repeated then one after the other they are both of them comprised first introduce a without b then introduce b without a—both of them are introduced but how much better would it not be if without any such unintended exclusion both were introduced at once all every each either—these collective adjectives are none of them absolutely incapable of being employed for and instead of any of the rest but they have each of them its appropriate and most proper sense thus it is throughout in regard to words which with reference to one another in common acceptance and discourse pass for synonyms take any two of them by neither perhaps is exactly the same idea expressed as is expressed by the other in many instances however so it is that without impropriety and without inconvenience one of them perhaps either may be employed instead of the other iii the word future employed instead of the word subsequent future and subsequent are both of them names of relations terms of reference by each of them two portions of time an antecedent and a consequent are brought to view by the term subsequent the point of time brought to view in the character of an antecedent is that which with reference to the state of things or transaction spoken of was present this alone and not the time at which that same state of things or transaction is spoken of thus stands the matter in so far as concerns the word subsequent in the use of it nothing of ambiguity is to be found now as to the term future but for the context—from which upon reflection it may be concluded that the time from which the futurity is reckoned was the time when the state of things or transaction spoken of was present—that time would always be the time in which the discourse if oral was spoken if in writing was written from the promiscuous use made of these two words suited to very different purposes confusion and absurdity are continually arising iv restrictives such as alone and only by these words what is constantly understood is that the purpose for which they are employed is the narrowing the import of some word or other to which they are respectively annexed that which in many cases cannot be collected but from the context nor from the context without some difficulty is to which of all the words in the sentence the restriction is meant to be applied   substantive in the nominative case i e name of the agent   adjective agreeing with do i e quality ascribed to the agent   verb   substantive in the accusative     case name of the patient   adjective agreeing with do i e quality of the patient   adverb in the character of the name of a quality of a quality annexed to one or other of the adjectives or to the verb frequently to any one of these with more or less propriety may the restriction be considered as applicable in english what thickens the confusion is the indeterminate character of the restrictives alone and only each of them is employed sometimes in the character of an adjective sometimes in the character of an adverb to exhibit the different cases in which each in contradiction to the other is most proper would of itself be a task of no inconsiderable length required to exhibit so many forms by means of which in the several cases where the restriction is meant to be applied exclusively to the objects respectively signified by several parts of speech it may in such sort be applied to these several subjects that no misapplication whatsoever howsoever transient and momentary can take place to solve this problem would be a task of no inconsiderable length and labour—but at the same time of no inconsiderable use if of the words alone and only the one were always an adjective the other always an adverb the difficulty of the task would be much less than it is but unfortunately as has been just observed no such constant distinction has place v ordinals more especially the word first of the aptitude of this term to involve in ambiguity the import of the sentence in which it is employed the causes are of the same nature in this instance as in that of the restrictives alone and only viz—   uncertainty of the part of speech and thence of the subject to which the attributive is meant to be applied   uncertainty in regard to the part of speech to which it is meant to be considered as belonging viz whether an adjective or an adverb example of the mode in which the ambiguity may be avoided   ambiguous expression—columbus first saw hispaniola   correspondent pair of sentences by which the existence of the ambiguity and at the same time the mode of avoiding it are indicated   columbus was the first person who ever saw hispaniola   of the islands now called the west india islands hispaniola was the first that columbus discovered the plural number is in a particular degree liable to be productive of perplexity and misstatement rule ii for remedy substitute the singular to the plural number where substitutable without impropriety and by one means or other it may generally be so substituted rule iii unless for special reason by whatsoever name an object has once been designated by that same name and no other continue to designate it or if on any account you find it matter of necessity or convenience to employ for that purpose this or that other name take care to give notice of the change eadem natura eadem nomenclatura   wheneer the same nature   the same nomenclature converse of the above rule—whatsoever be the object for the designation of which a given word has been employed employ not that same word for the designation of any other object unless so it be that the word being a generic one on the first occasion it was employed for the designation of the whole genus or of one species on the other occasion for the designation of another species of the same genus rule iv prefer verbal substantives to verbs numerous are the instances in which for the giving expression to the import in question a single word in the form of a verb may in some sort suffice and is frequently made to suffice and a verbal noun from the same root with the addition of some verb of extensive sign and proportionally frequent use may also serve as when instead of to apply the phrase to make application is used from this substitution convenience is frequently found to result the noun from the same root is commonly a verbal noun a verbal noun of that sort which serves to designate in the first place the species of action for the designation of which the verb including all the several adjuncts and modifications belonging to that complex part of speech is used and thence by an almost imperceptible transition the state of things produced by that same act this verbal noun when thus obtained in a state of separation from these adjuncts which form so many parts in the composition of the very complex part of speech called a verb and which in this its separate state becomes the name of a sort of fictitious entity of a sort of fictitious body or substance is in this state rendered more prehensible being thus prehensible it is more easily and thence directly brought to view and being thus brought to view it is capable of being employed as a common subject to any number whatsoever of     propositions that may be requisite for predicating whatsoever the nature of the case requires to be predicated of the sort of act in question or of its result by means of a few verbs of extensive import such as the above word make capable of serving as it were in an auxiliary character introduction may in most cases be given by each of them to a large number of names of fictitious entities and the advantage in question compassed to the utmost extent of which it is susceptible when a characteristic verb thus capable of being resolved into a correspondently characteristic verbal nounsubstantive and an uncharacteristic auxiliary verb has been employed a practice not unfrequent is to follow it by some relative which has for its antecedent the verbal noun the import of which is implied in that of the characteristic verb subjoining or not subjoining to it the antecedent noun thus implied example   the implied antecedent brought to view as if repeated if you would gain the populace upon every favourable occasion apply yourself to their senses this application will do more for you than the closest train of reasoning   the implied antecedent not brought to view but only tacitly and implicitly referred to if you would gain the populace apply yourself upon every favourable occasion to their senses this will do more for you than the closest train of reasoning if the verbal noun the name of the fictitious entity have in a preceding sentence been expressly brought to view the repetition of it in the succeeding sentence will have the good effect of reviving and strengthening the first impression on the other hand insert the verbal noun in the succeeding sentence without having inserted it in the first the consequence is that in this way of speaking a sort of false intimation is conveyed—an intimation that the verbal noun employed in the succeeding sentence had already been employed in the preceding one leave the verbal noun altogether uninserted the result is still more awkward this will do so and so what is it that will do so and so to this question no answer being given by the writer the reader is left to hunt for one rule v—when for the designation of the idea in question no other appellative is in use but one which is tainted with ambiguity presenting in conjunction with the idea required another which is different from it and which on pain of being led into error by it must be distinguished from it or say seen to be different from it—substitute another word which is free from all ambiguity presenting to view no idea other than that which is wished and endeavoured to be presented by it example gathered from the field of penal law—to acts considered as having been taken for the subjects of prohibition is universally applied the appellation of offence but when in regard to these acts the desire is to present to view the quality or say property on account of which they have been constituted or it is in contemplation to constitute them offences for conveying this idea no other word is in use than this same word offence by law the act is made an offence—and why answer—because in its own nature it is an offence generally speaking the idea which in this case is associated with the word offence is that of maleficence that is to say the property which the act to which this appellative is attached has or is supposed to have of making a defalcation more or less considerable from the aggregate happiness of the community in so far as the greatest happiness principle is the ruling principle on no other ground can any species of act be taken in hand by the legislator and by prohibition and eventual punishment constituted an offence this ambiguity it has seemed to me matter of high importance to remove accordingly continuing to employ the term offence for designating the fact of the act having been taken for the subject of prohibition—for the purpose of bringing to view the quality in consideration of which it was my desire to see it thus dealt with i employed the word maleficence giving to the act in which this quality was beholden by me the appellation of a maleficent act once having become sensible of the need there was of a word for this purpose and having accordingly formed the determination of being on the lookout for such an one i soon found that i had not far to look beneficent beneficence were words already not only in the language but in every mouth in the language the latin from which they were derived correspondent and opposite to them i saw the words maleficent and maleficence thenceforward instead of not knowing what to say unless it were in a roundabout way or saying this act is an offence and therefore ought to be made an offence it has been my custom to say the sort of act thus described is a maleficent act and that in such sort and to such an amount that by apt prohibition backed by apt eventual suffering it ought to be constituted an offence section vii rules for clearness and thence for impressiveness so far as depends upon collocation rule i wheresoever it is of importance that two objects be distinguished from each other be careful so to order the expression as to render the distinction between them as clear i e the contrast between them as strong as may be     rule ii—when the two objects belong to the same scale the difference between them is in degree and in degree only in that case what is to be endeavoured at is that that which is considered as entitled to stand at the higher degree shall not be placed at any lower degree that which ought to stand at the lower degree not at any higher degree so that the difference of degree may be correctly indicated rule iii—when the objects belong to the same scale placing in the situation of contradictory propositions the two propositions whereby they are spoken of does not place the differences between them in so strong or in so clear a point of view as that in which they would be placed by an indication of the degrees which they respectively occupy milled corn is not cold ice is cold by these expressions how feebly and inadequately the difference in temperature between the two bodies is represented is sufficiently manifest rule iv—when contrast is meant to be exhibited keep to the same words throughout till you come to those by which the contrast is meant to be exhibited rule v—for impressiveness put not the names of two leading objects in one sentence unless when they are under the same regime one thing at a time rule vi—of that idea which is the principal one and to which in the sentence in question the purpose requires that the attention should be principally attached put the sign in the first place or as near the first place as the state of the grammatical relation will admit an inconvenience attendant on this mode of collocation is that it will seldom be that which would be pursued or without presenting the idea of affectation could be pursued in oral discourse it is on this account with reference to the most usual order of discourse termed inversion but the reasons which perhaps would render this mode of collocation difficult and unusual and thence unpleasant in oral discourse do not apply at least with equal force to written since in this case for marshalling his words in such sort as to him seems best a man may then take whatever time is necessary rule vii—use antecedent modifications   they prevent instead of correcting misconception   they excite the collateral idea of selfcommand on the part of the speaker or writer this is the or a reason why i find it not pleasant to begin a sentence with a nominative case rule viii—every clause not expressly ampliative is restrictive rule ix—when in relation to the clause in question having the effect of a limitative ampliative or in any other way modificative clause your intention is that the import of it shall be understood as applying exclusively to some one to the exclusion of one or more other clauses the nature of the case affords two expedients either of which will suffice for insuring the production of the desired effect   it is only in one case that the first of them applies and that is when the clause to which it is intended that the modification should be considered as applied is that which it is intended should stand before any of the others to which it would be capable of being applied in this case put the modificative clause before the clause intended to be modified and in this way modificative clauses in any number may be made to precede and by that means exclusively attach upon one and the same modificand   the other expedient is applicable to all sorts of cases it consists in inserting the modificative clause within the modificand by this means it is to this modifiable clause to the exclusion of all other modifiable clauses that it will be found applicable in the wording of acts of parliament and indeed in discourses in general this expedient is pretty generally employed and that with manifest good effect rule x—between an antecedent substantive and its relative be careful not to interpose any word capable of being though it be but for a moment understood as meant to be taken for the antecedent of that same relative rule xi—the list of topics given treat them in the same order—change not the order rule xii—when of two or more ideas brought to view in the course of the same proposition sentence or clause there is some one to which whether to the exclusion of or in preference to the rest it is your wish that for the purpose of its being impressed into his mind with a preeminent degree of force the attention of the hearer or reader to the end that he may take particular cognizance of it should be pointed contrive so to turn the phrase as that the word or words designative of that idea shall occupy the front of the sentence example—say when it is by word of mouth that the communication is made—rather than when the communication is made by word of mouth in the latter form the attention is divided between the consideration of the general fact of the making the communication in question and that of the particular mode in which that operation is proposed to be performed and by this division the impression made by the words indicative of the particular mode is more or less weakened—in the first form the attention is without division fastened at once upon the only one of the two objects to which on the particular occasion in question it was meant to attach it the attention is pointed to one of the two objects in preference to the other at least if not to the exclusion of it rule xiii—place not in a strong light—place not in an impressive point of view two propositions—two clauses in the same sentence     for example—a principal clause and a clause which is employed to modify it—or say a modificative clause reason—when upon the same level in the scale of importance two objects are thus placed at the same time the consequence is that between the one and the other the attention is distracted it takes not a sufficient hold of either of them present them to the mind one after another it grasps them with its undivided force section viii rules for correctness and completeness rule i—correctness—the more extensively general the terms you have occasion to employ be the more careful in examining the species contained under the generic appellation employed and in considering whether that whatever it be which you predicate of the genus is with truth predicable of these several species rule ii—completeness or say comprehensiveness—when on the occasion of any sort of operation which is productive of beneficial effects when performed in relation to a certain species of subject matters look round for the several genera within which the species in question is contained and consider whether with correspondent beneficial effects the same operation may not be performed upon the other species contained in that same genus all or some of them so as to objects analagous to the one in question without being congeners to it by this means are inventions produced section ix of the improvement of language in respect of copiousness general rule—exceptions excepted the more copious a language the better new words and new combinations to one or other of these heads may every improvement of which language is susceptible in respect of copiousness be referred in whichsoever mode any addition is made to the preexisting state of instruments of discourse the addition is primâ facie and saving particular exceptions entitled to be set down to the account of improvement particular reasons apart for the same reason that the first word that was ever invented was an addition to the stock of instruments of enjoyment and security in a word to the instruments of wellbeing so has every other been and so will every other be on this head therefore the general rule is the more copious a language is the better—the better adapted to the purposes of language but to this general rule particular exceptions are not wanting as to the grounds of these exceptions and thence as to the rules in cases of exception that have place under this general rule their place will be found under the head of the nextmentioned article upon the list of qualities desirable in language viz simplicity generally speaking there exists in language a natural tendency to improve itself or to speak strictly to become improved in respect of this desirable quality the same causes by the operation of which the earliest and scantiest stock of the instruments of thought and conversation were produced continue in action and will continue in action without end observation experiment experience reflection discovery invention all these are so many seeds of language seeds from which new additions to the stock of words and combinations in every language are continually springing up as there exist cases in which the alteration made in language by increase given to the number of words and combinations of words of which it is composed cannot with propriety be set down to the account of advantage so are there cases in which though the addition if made is or would be of an advantageous nature yet the addition finds the introduction of it opposed by various springs of human action by various principles of human nature indigenous weakness viz in the intellectual faculty sinister interest interestbegotten prejudice adoptive prejudice in this part of the field of action as in every other will human felicity find these its enemies set in array against it and opposing its progress at every step while in so far as the mode of enrichment is unserviceable in any instance the interests of all mankind are opposed to it section x modes of enrichment on the occasion of the explanation of the modes in which a language is capable of being enriched two objects require to be considered viz   the source from which the addition is derived   the mode in which it is made say enrichment ab intra or homedrawn in so far as the addition is drawn from the same language—ab extra in so far as it is drawn from any foreign language simple modes of enrichment are   indication of particular properties as applied to a given genus—as expressed by a generic name of any degree of amplitude examples of this mode of enrichment are afforded by the several branches of natural history and natural philosophy   spiritualization or psychologization in so far as of any name of any physical substance operation or quality application is made to the purpose of giving designation to any correspondent     or supposed correspondent psychological substance operation or quality the psychological object being modelled from the physical archetype as a bust in clay from any part of the human figure   formation of new words on the ground of analogy example—from beneficence maleficence from beneficial maleficial   by composition the composite mode in which enrichment is performed is per inequalitatem the words conjoined being in their import of unequal importance with relation to each other the one may be considered as the principal the other as being with relation to it the accessory word in this case let the number of words thus related and entering into the composition of the compound word be supposed to be no more than two the place of the accessory word will either be anterior or posterior to the principal if anterior it may be termed with relation to it a prefix—if posterior it has been called in latin a suffix where the mode of enrichment is by composition it may be distinguished into   composition by simple aggregation or agglutination or coalition viz without change in the signification of either of the two constituent elements and without the need of supposing the addition of any other word as necessary to complete the sense of this sort is that which has place between a subject in the grammatical form of a substantire and the name of an epithet or adjunct in the grammatical form of an adjective as in the case of the words vainglory feesimple plaindealing   by aggregation with ellipses examples   churchyard i e yard of the

importation of words from other languages dead or living   by addition to not to say completion of each set of conjugates a noun taken in its several cases and numbers a verb taken in its several moods tenses numbers and persons these aggregates may be considered as so many grammatical conjugates by the term logical conjugate may be designated the aggregate of these same aggregates—the whole stock of the aggregates capable of being formed of those aggregates in the greek and latin lexicon or say dictionary of scapula may be seen the several lists of logical conjugates made to grow out of the same root say out of some nounsubstantive taken in hand and considered as a root of the several branches or say ramifications thus seen growing out of one and the same root each one is expressive of an idea bearing a determinate relation to the idea designated by that same root section xi importation of words from foreign languages dead and living—its advantages and disadvantages there exists not that state in life be it ever so humble in which a mans wellbeing is not in some shape or other in some degree or other more or less dependent on the acquaintance he has with his own language—of the language in which he not only converses but thinks language being not merely the instrument of discourse but moreover the instrument of thought the stock of a mans ideas is limited and determined by the stock of the words which he finds at his command for giving expression to those ideas in every language words are found in clusters growing out of the same root whatsoever be the cluster to which the word in question belongs the comprehension a man has of its import is comparatively imperfect if it include not a more or less general acquaintance with the whole cluster to which it belongs in the stock of words of which the english language is composed a very considerable not to say the largest portion are borrowed from some one or other of several foreign languages in some instances at a very early date in others at different points of time from the remotest down to the most recent in some instances these words so borrowed were transplanted in a single state in others in large clusters in others in smaller clusters which after transplantation have gradually grown into larger ones when a word has thus been transplanted and naturalised in a single state the conception entertained of its import by persons altogether unacquainted with the cluster to which it belonged in the language from which it was borrowed is always very obscure and imperfect in comparison with that which he has of a word which forms one of a cluster more or less complete originally of the growth of his own language or fully rooted and naturalised in it these languages are some of them of a northern some of them of a southern origin of the northern the one principally borrowed from is the german of the southern the french among ancient languages those principally borrowed from are the latin and greek the latin being the language from which the french has borrowed a great part perhaps the largest part of its words hence in the instance of many words of latin origin it remains a question whether the word was derived from the latin immediately or remotely through the medium of the french the greek being the language of the writers from whom the first crude notions respecting most of the arts and sciences were derived to us hence the appropriate terms expressive of the subjectmatters and operations belonging to those several branches of art and science have in a   0 large proportion been borrowed from that language even when the subjectmatter instrument or operation is itself new a convenience is found on several accounts in taking its name from a foreign language more especially from the greek rather than from our own for characterizing an object which not only is new but is designed to be presented as such a word as plainly new as the object itself is meant to be represented as being is much more convenient than any old word taken from the oldestablished stock of words belonging to the language for when any such oldestablished word is taken and thus employed it comes with the whole of its original import adhering to it and the consequence is that it presents to the mind instantly and to a certainty a multitude of old ideas which on the new occasion it is not intended to present and this in the most perfect manner while it is only in a manner comparatively imperfect that it presents the new idea which it is intended to present borrow the word from a foreign language and that a dead one from the greek for example this confusion is avoided let but the reader have once succeeded in his endeavours to establish an adequately constant association between the new idea you mean to impress upon his mind and the newcoined or imported word employed by you for expressing that idea for which purpose in the first instance an explanation more or less particular will to persons unacquainted with the language so borrowed from be always necessary thenceforward as often as the new word is presented to his mind the idea which it brings with it will be the very idea which it is your desire it should present that and no other that idea alone unaccompanied by and unclogged with any other by the very description of it thus given this mode of proceeding it is however evident has its difficulties and thereby its inconvenience the difficulty consists in getting men to give themselves the trouble of establishing this association whereas when the language from which the word is taken is a mans own language the association such as it is is already formed and howsoever clumsy the new appellative appears and howsoever troublesome the cluster of collateral and with reference to the purpose in question irrelevant ideas it stands associated with and however confused and inadequate the import is which it has the effect of presenting still it can scarcely fail of bringing to view an import having some similarity to the one which it is intended to present whereas if it be a word of altogether foreign original no other word of the cluster it belongs to being presented to the mind of the person in question the necessary result is that if the explanation attached to it has either never been received into the mind or after having been so received has dropped out the word is so much unmeaning sound not presenting any the faintest intimation of the import which it is intended to present chapter vi analytical view of the matter of thought and internal action correspondent view of the matter of language section i thought the basis of language of language the primary and only original use is the communication of thought the conveyance of thought from mind to mind from the mind of a speaker to the mind of a hearer all thought belongs either to the intellectual or to the volitional department of the mind—to the understanding or the will a portion of the matter of language is frequently termed a discourse by every portion of discourse communication is endeavoured to be given of the state which in some respect or other one or the other of the above departments of the speakers mind is in acts of the intellectual department or faculty are   simple perceptions†   sensations i e perceptions attended with pain or pleasure and   judgments or opinions remembrance is but the work of a particular species of perception of the general faculty of sensation a particular impression is the exercise or exemplification of the memory the correspondent idea i e the copy of that same impression as taken by and preserved in the mind of judgment the subjects are   points of similitude between object and object   points of dissimilitude between object and object   existence or nonexistence of the relation of cause and effect as between object and object simple perception is not capable of erring no nor sensation neither but judgment is on the part of every person and on almost every occasion exposed to error a state or act of the mind in which judgment is continually included is apt to be considered as an exemplification of perception alone or sensation alone such is the case with all instances of the exercise of the organs of sight and hearing i see a hill i e what appears to me a hill but oftentimes when what a man sees is believed by him to be a hill it is in reality a cloud i hear the rain but oftentimes when a man thinks he hears the     rain falling the cause of his perception is not rain but the wind whistling through certain trees when as above desire the state or act of the will and simple perception or sensation the state or act of the understanding are excepted all that the mind of man is capable of containing is an act of the judicial faculty—an opinion a judgment an opinion entertained by himself entertained in his own mind this is the only immediate subject of any communication which concerning the state of that faculty can be made of no matter of fact external to of no matter other than that which passes in his own mind can any immediate communication be made by language opinion an opinion entertained by the speaker this is all of which in any instance communication can be made of an opinion thus expressed any imaginable matter of fact real or supposed may have been taken for the object but that to which expression is given that of which communication is made is always the mans opinion i e that which in so far as the expression answers its intended purpose that which he wishes should be taken for his opinion in relation to the subject in question nor anything more be this as it may the strictly logical consequences are the only ones that belong to the present purpose one is—that in every portion of discourse which is not the expression of a desire a simple sensation or a perception in every portion of discourse for example by which the existence of a matter of fact exterior to the person of the speaker is asserted—is included a communication made of the state of the judicial department of the speakers mind an opinion entertained in relation to that same matter of fact this being the case a certain degree of complexity attaches to every proposition the simplest imaginable not excepted which has for its subject a matter of fact at large eurybiades struck themistocles by a proposition in these words what is it that i assert it is this it is my opinion that eurybiades struck themistocles this is what i can be sure of and it is all that in relation to the supposed matter of fact it is in my power to be assured of this pen exists—meaning the pen employed in the tracing of these characters this pen exists i e my opinion is that this pen exists such is very decidedly and firmly my own opinion but of no pen with which he ever wrote would any such opinion have been entertained by bishop berkeley thus it is that in respect of this complexity—this constant and unavoidable complexity—the expression of the mode of being of the intellectual department agrees with the expression of the volitional department of a speakers mind come hither by this discourse as every man will acknowledge at the very first hint what is expressed is that it is my desire that the person to whom i speak should so do he is there by this discourse in like manner what is expressed is my opinion that he the person spoken of is in the place alluded to by the word there the consequence is that in saying—he is there—the proposition simple as it is in appearance is in its import complex and if it be considered as designating expressing communicating the whole of the object of which it is employed as the sign viz the mode of being of my mind it is elliptical that to which it gives expression is the supposed matter of fact which supposing me to speak truly was the object of my thought—that of which it does not contain the expression is that thought itself the only matter of fact of which the discourse in question is strictly and immediately the assertion is left to be inferred from the context from such words as are actually uttered† in all ordinary discourse propositions come entire it is only on the occasion of some science or art that unless where employed instead of a proposition and by ellipsis or abridgment containing in it the import of an entire proposition any term is presented by itself every man who speaks speaks in propositions the rudest savage not less than the most polished orator—terms taken by themselves are the work of abstraction the produce of a refined analysis—ages after ages must have elapsed before any such analysis was ever made of the above observations another logical consequence is this viz that for the giving expression and conveyance to any thought that ever was entertained so far as concerns import and not discourse nothing less than the import of an entire proposition and that as above a complex one ever was or ever could be made to serve not but that in many instances for the making communication of thought even a single word is made to serve but then it is by means of other words which according to the occasion the single word in question may have the effect of suggesting as effectually as     by this same single word the ideas constantly associated with it are suggested looking at my son whose name is john—i say to him john—he hears me—what is it that he understands by this the import the full import belonging to one or other of these two phrases my desire is that you attend viz to what more i am about to say or my desire is that you come i e come near to the place at which i am sitting and thus it is by bringing to view other words in the character of words of which though not pronounced the import was meant to be conveyed by the word which was pronounced that a single word may be made to have the effect and thus as it were comprise the import of an indefinite number of other words—of a discourse of an indefinite length this being the case if nothing less than the import of an entire proposition be sufficient for the giving full expression to any the most simple thought it follows that no word being anything more than a fragment of a proposition no word is of itself the complete sign of any thought it was in the form of entire propositions that when first uttered discourse was uttered of these integers words were but so many fragments as afterwards in written discourse letters were of words words may be considered as the result of a sort of analysis—a chemicological process for which till at a comparatively much later period than that which gave birth to propositions the powers of the mind were not ripe with a view however to save the words which would be required to point out this complexity such propositions as are only in this way complex may for some purposes and on some occasions be considered and spoken of as simple upon this field of observation the logic of aristotle and his followers did not penetrate the subjects it began with were terms i e words of a certain description and beginning with the consideration of these terms it went on to the consideration of propositions in the character of compounds capable of being composed out of these elements antecedently to all particular inquiry in an inquiry the subject of which was confined to the signs of thought—in an inquiry in which no attempt was made to look into the thoughts signified in the conception entertained in relation to the nature of thought and of the diversification of which it is susceptible much clearness correctness or advance to completeness could not naturally be expected these terms are accordingly spoken of as possessing of themselves an original and independent signification as having existence before anything of the nature of a proposition came to be in existence—as if finding these terms endowed each of them somehow or other with a signification of its own at a subsequent period some ingenious persons took them in hand and formed them into propositions but the truth is that in the first place came propositions and that out of these propositions by abstraction and analysis terms possessed each of them of an independent import were framed† condillac—for the purpose of elucidating lockes doctrine that all ideas grow out of sensations and but for such sensations could not have existence—imagined to himself the idea of a statue and enduing it successively with the five senses and such combination of them as promised to afford instruction with reference to this his purpose exhibited to view the furniture of the different orders of minds with which the statue would in this way be provided proceeding thus was proceeding in the way of synthesis—synthesis means putting together proceeding thus he took in hand in the first place as a basis for the rest the most simple element he could find and adding to this one other elements one after another exhibited in this gradual way the contents of all the several compounds capable of being made and which accordingly are the most compounded of those in experience found to be made out of those elements equally well adapted has this same method appeared to be for exhibiting to view in the order of simplicity or complexity it may be denominated in either way the results that have been produced by putting together the several ideas respectively denoted by the several sorts of words of which language is composed‡ of language in its origin the parts could not have existed in a degree of simplicity equal     to that of the most simple of those at present in use the first words must in their import have been equivalent to whole sentences to sentences expressive for example of suffering of enjoyment of desire of aversion of this original language the parts of speech called interjections are examples of this nature is and seems destined for ever to continue the language of quadrupeds and other inferior animals to form the words of which language is at present composed has been the work of analysis the original sentences were as it were broken down into words these words into syllables and these syllables by the help of written and visible signs into letters of these elements thus formed by analysis those called words will now be to be put together in the way of synthesis the task here undertaken is to take up the several classes of words denominated by logicians in consideration of the connexion between their respective imports with reference to one another conjugates and beginning with that one of which the import is most simple not admitting of being analyzed into others more simple to apply to it the several other classes of which the respective imports are more and more complex of this theoretical labour the practical use is this by the observation of the compounds already made and the conveniences with reference to the ends of language respectively derived from them to show how the number of them may be made to receive increase very considerable increase and in respect of its several useful and desirable properties the utility of the instrument called language may be made to receive increase language has its logical and its chronological history its logical history shows what must have been the order of formation among the elements of language—shows it from the nature of man shows it from the circumstances in which all men are placed shows it from circumstantial evidence the chronological history of language shows what has actually been c in language are to be considered   the ideas designated   the signs employed in the designation of those ideas as to the signs they have been for the most part arbitrary bearing no naturally characteristic analogy to the things respectively designated when considered apart from the ideas no very considerable instruction comparatively speaking is accordingly derived from the consideration of them being arbitrary they have accordingly been infinitely diversified taking the human species in the aggregate one and the same idea having found employment for signs to the number of some hundreds at least not to say thousands in the expression of it in a very different case are the ideas themselves these being the furniture of the mind and mind being in fact a property of the body—in the sort of fictitious language without which it cannot be spoken of—a sort of inmate of the body the differences between minds that is to say the furniture of minds are not greater than the differences between bodies hence it is that in the history of the formation of ideas i e of the order in which the several ideas thus characterized by their several sets of signs have made their appearance there must throughout the whole human race have been a considerable degree of sameness section ii of conjugates by grammarians who may be considered as a tribe of logicians operating in a particular quarter of the field of logic the term conjugates or at any rate the nearly allied terms to conjugate and conjugation have been employed of old by logicians to the import of these terms a considerable and very useful extension has been given by grammarians the aggregate or say cluster of connected words called by them a verb has been said to be conjugated when in conjunction with the characteristic fundamental portion of it the several modifications by which—the several varieties by which tense mood person number to which in some instances is preposterously added gender i e sex stand expressed—have been exhibited and recited and the groups in so far as for the expression of these modifications of the fundamental import words more or less different in sound are employed are said to belong to so many different conjugations with the same propriety and convenience as that with which the terms conjugation and to conjugate were applied to the cluster of intimately connected words called a verb might they have been applied to the other cluster of intimately connected words called a noun as diversified by the several modifications called cases in addition to those by which the designation of the several varieties of which sex person viz with relation to the speaker the hearer and others and number are susceptible—by which so many correspondent varieties in respect of sex person and number are expressed and brought to view as it happened no such extension however was made in the case of a noun instead of conjugation and to conjugate declension and to decline were the words employed applied to the cluster to which they were applied viz to the verb the terms conjugation and to conjugate were apposite and expressive     jugum is the latin word for a yoke an instrument by which a number of animals employed in draught are connected with each other and with the burthen which is to be drawn connected with each other for that common purpose the cluster of words called a verb presents to view a fundamental or radical import to which throughout the whole cluster expression is given by some letter or combination of letters which has place in every one of the component words and by which as by a bond of union they are connected together and made up into one whole exactly of the same sort is the connexion which in the different parts or portions of the part of speech called a noun has place in the instance of a noun the several sources of modification designated by the words person gender and number are designated by the same names as in the instance of the verb the sources of diversification in respect of which the noun differs from the verb are on the part of the verb the moods and tenses which the noun has not on the part of the noun the cases which the verb has not when a noun being given a man names the modifications called cases together with those which regard person number and gender he is not said to conjugate it—he is said to decline it associated with the import of the word case is according to the grammarians the import of the words declension to decline but in the instance of declension the emblem or archetypal image exhibits no marks of such felicity as have been seen exhibited in the case of conjugation case is from cado to fall an image borrowed by the latin grammarians from the greek grammarians a rod is conceived to fall in the nominative case the mode of its falling—the direction in which it falls is considered as direct—perpendicular to the horizon and is accordingly calledrectus in the other cases it is considered as oblique viz with reference to the horizon accordingly all these several cases are besides their peculiar names expressed by one common name and called oblique cases with indisputable propriety and with no inconsiderable utility if comprehensiveness of perception be of any use have the logicians extended the application of these words conjugation and to conjugate—or at any rate that other term so intimately connected with them viz conjugate or conjugates not only to the cluster of connected words called nouns but to all words the connexion of which is formed and evidenced by the circumstance of their containing in their structure the main portion expressive of the principal and characteristic idea of the whole cluster in the combination of letters expressive of this characteristic idea may be seen what may be termed the root of the cluster in the whole word whatever it be which if there were any difference in respect of time presents itself as likely to have been the word first in use we have the radical and primitive conjugate in all the others the several ramified branches or collateral and derivative conjugates on looking over the materials of which any language is composed two distinguishable classes of words will be found one which possess a sort of independent import and suggest each of them an idea without the assistance of any other word the other which not suggesting each of them an idea of itself serves no other purpose than that of modifying in some way or other the idea suggested by those of the abovementioned independent cast the former may be distinguished by the name of principal the other by that of accessory words taken together a principal when considered in connexion with one of these accessory words may be termed a conjugate with each such principal term will be found connected accessory words in great number and variety hence in the case of each principal as many different conjugates as there are accessory words found in connexion with it and as among these accessory words different classes will be found distinguishable hence to each such principal so many clusters of conjugates in some instances the accessory term is found attached to the principal forming but one word with it in others not hence the distinction—accessory words attached—accessory words detached conjugates in the attached form—conjugates in the detached form where the accessory word is attached in some instances it precedes the principal word in others it follows it hence the distinction—accessories prefixed or in the way of prefixion accessories suffixed or where the word accessory is understood to be in question leaving out that word one may say for shortness prefixes and suffixes accessories which in one language are attached are in another not attached accessories which in one part of the same language are attached are in another part of the same language not attached in this respect taken in the aggregate infinite are the diversities which language brings to view the greater the number which in any language can be found of those sorts of words called conjugates the more manageable will the language be and the fitter for all the purposes of language for the formation of these the first and     most obvious step will be for a man to begin with the language in which he writes to take stock as they say in mercantile accounts to form his inventory out of those articles which his own language furnishes and then to see what if any enrichment it may be made to receive from other languages on this occasion one subject of observation will be the difference—the prodigious difference between the degree in which in its present state the language is stocked with this or that one sort of conjugate and the degree in which it is stocked with this or that other sort of conjugate in this or that one instance the number stretching to hundreds or even thousands in this or that other not going beyond units when the same use which is actually derived from the species of conjugate in those two or three instances might without inconvenience be derived from it in the two or three hundred or two or three thousand instances as a noun or a verb is a cluster of words so a complete set of conjugates formed upon the model of those already in use and by analogy each of them made complete would include in it an aggregate cluster of all those clusters the different species of conjugates in the logical sense of the word conjugate are chiefly if not exclusively formed of either terminations or beginnings mostly terminations added to the principal part of the word considered as standing in the relation of the root or basis to that part of the word by which the principal part of the import of the compound is designated take for example the cluster of conjugates of which the latin word locus the english place forms the basis terminations or suffixes—say for example locate to locate location located add locatedness and locatement beginnings or prefixes—dislocate add upon the model of replace relocate add upon the model of transfer and transfuse translocate of the import of all the several sorts of conjugates actually existing and imaginable the basis is the import of the nounsubstantive a nounsubstantive is the name of some entity real or fictitious by a real entity understand a substance—an object the existence of which is made known to us by one or more of our five senses a real entity is either a person or a thing a substance rational or a substance not rational by a fictitious entity understand an object the existence of which is feigned by the imagination—feigned for the purpose of discourse and which when so formed is spoken of as a real one these sorts of fictitious entities may be classed in different ranks or orders distinguished by their respective degrees of vicinity to the real one first comes motion—fictitious entity of the first order to speak of a motion we are obliged to speak of it as if it were a substance we say he or it is in motion thus speaking we speak of a motion as if it were a place a portion of space and the person or thing situated in that place the absence or negation of motion is rest we say that person or thing is at rest—speaking thus we speak of rest as being a sort of substance suppose a tree or a stone and the person or the thing as being in a state of contiguity or relation to it considered with reference to our senses every particle of matter perceived or perceptible at the time at which or with reference to which it is considered is either in a state of motion or in a state of rest the state of rest is the negation of the state of motion with reference to the same object no particle of matter can therefore be in motion and at rest at the same time to say that it is or can be would be a selfcontradictory proposition resolvable into a pair of mutually contradictory propositions but take any body composed of a number of particles of matter then so it is that of and in that same body while part i e some of those particles are in a state of motion other parts may at that time be in a state of rest when of any body it is said that body has been in motion what is meant is that at or in different portions of the field of time that body has occupied different portions or positions in the field of space as atoms or minimum portions may be conceived as having place in the field of space so may atoms or minimum portions in the field of time if speaking of any body suppose the plaything called a pegtop i say this body is now in motion then if by now i mean no more than a single atom or minimum portion of time what i thus say cannot be exactly true since as above for motion to have had place or to have place two atoms of time at the least are necessary but if speaking as above what i mean by now is a portion of the field of time containing any number of atoms greater than one then the proposition delivered by me in those same words may be true in general the word now when applied to motion is understood as applicable with propriety why because in the utterance of the proposition to that effect atoms in great number are employed†     here then we have a division of the states of which things i e portions of matter are susceptible and that division an exhaustive one of states of things and thence and therefore of the objects of thought in so far as they come within that same denomination viz portions of matter states of things when at rest are their positions with reference to one another in the field of space states of things when in motion are motions considered abstractedly from volition a motion is termed an event a simple motion a simple event a complex motion a complex event considered as the result of volition a motion is termed an act an action an operation in the word position we see already the name of one fictitious entity and thereby in so far as it can be said to be visible one fictitious entity in the word motion we see another taking into consideration any body which we have been considering as having been in a state of motion we thence take occasion to ascribe to it a quality viz mobility the quality which consists in the capacity of being or aptitude to be put into and thence to be in a state of motion antecedent to our idea of this quality mobility must have been our idea of the correspondent state viz a state of motion to substance we ascribe qualities to motion also we ascribe qualities it is by this circumstance that of motion the import is placed as it were nearer to that of substance than that of qualities substances have their qualities—they are large small long short thick thin and so forth motions have their qualities—they are quick slow rising falling continued discontinued regular irregular and so on if then motion be termed a fictitious entity of the first order viz that which is nearest to reality mobility and so any other quality may with reference to it be termed a fictitious entity of the second order here then we have an additional class of fictitious entities—of fictitious substances we have largeness smallness length shortness thickness thinness we have moreover quickness slowness we might have as well as rising risingness as well as falling fallingness as well as continued continuedness as well as discontinued discontinuedness we have as well as regular regularity as well as irregular irregularity attributes as well of substances as of motions already has been brought to view though as yet without special notice a different sort of conjugate the nounadjective—large small long short thick thin and so forth this sort of conjugate in what consists its difference from that which is the name of a quality in this—when we speak of largeness there is largeness we speak of the fictitious substance so denominated without reference made to any other object on the contrary when we say large we present the idea of that same quality but accompanied with the intimation of some other substance which is endued with that quality—some other object in which that quality has existence and is to be found we put the mind upon the lookout for that other object without which it is satisfied that the expression is incomplete that the idea presented by it is but as it were the fragment of an idea—a fragment to the completion of which the idea of some object in which the quality is to be found is necessary in a word the substantival name of a quality presents the idea in the character of a complete idea conceivable of itself the adjectival denomination of that same quality presents the idea in the character of an incomplete idea requiring for the completion of it the idea of some object in which it may be seen to inhere in the order of invention proper names come before common names common names are the result of generalization every common name is the name of a general idea the pronoun i is a sort of common name being applicable by any person as well as any other the pronouns he she and it more manifestly so languages it is said are in existence in which there are no such pronominal names instead of i the speaker employs his own name instead of you the name of the person spoken to instead of he or she that of the person spoken of a different sign for the third person when of a different sex must have been a superior refinement so likewise the difference between animals endued with the organs of sex and other substances—whence the distinction between masculine and feminine on the one hand and neuter on the other among the articles the definite article the must have come first into use the use of the indefinite article a implies the existence of the habit of abstraction—of generalization—an advance made in the art of logic on the occasion in which the original sole part of speech the interjection began to be resolved into the eight which we distinguish at present the nounsubstantive was probably the first to make its appearance and that in the nominative case and singular number nounsadjective and verbs—which came forth first the adjective or the verb it seems not at present very easy to determine what is certain is that of the adjective the idea is altogether simple in comparison with that of the verb but as above simplicity so far from being an evidence of priority is rather an evidence to the contrary when once the verbsubstantive was established the greatest of all strides was made in the track of abstraction and generalization added to a correspondent set of adjectives this one verb is capable of performing the office of all other verbs     in the logical sense of the word conjugate every verb is a cluster or set of conjugates—of conjugates bearing the same relation to each other in the instance of every such aggregate accordingly to conjugate a verb is in the hitherto current language of grammarians for in this respect in the language of logicians there is a difference—to enumerate the several words which enter into the composition of the aggregate so denominated to see clearly into the nature of this aggregate it will be necessary to take an inventory of the ideas the signs of which enter into the composition of it distinguish them in the first place into principal and accessory section iii irregular nouns and verbs are amongst those which are of most frequent use—why at an early period in the history of language a word or sound of one sort was employed as a basis for one of the relations which are expressed by inflection a word of another sort for another fragments of the mass of language in the shape which it wore while in that imperfect state are still to be seen and that it is believed in every at present cultivated language these fragments may be seen in the composition of all those nouns and verbs which are regarded as being in any respect irregular and which on that account are exhibited by grammarians in the character of irregular nouns and verbs by any person who will be at the trouble of reviewing them these irregular parts of speech will in every language be found among those for the import of which the demand is most frequent in its occurrence and which consequently are in most general use in the track of time the stage at which they first came into use was that at which the number of words in use was not as yet sufficiently great for the labour attached to it to have drawn men into the expedient of cultivating it by employing the principle and scheme of connexion for a multitude of mutuallyrelated words and thus substracting from the inconvenient multitude of different forms with the import of which they would otherwise have had to make themselves acquainted such was the state of society—such the state of the demand for discourse at the time when they first came into use the demand never having diminished thus it is that the actual use of them remains undiminished thus it is that of the history of language no inconsiderable part remains to this day written upon the face of it section iv necessity of names of material objects for the designation of pneumatic or immaterial objects all our psychological ideas are derived from physical ones—all mental from corporeal ones when spoken of mental ideas are spoken of as if they were corporeal ones in no other manner can they be spoken of but thus to speak of them is to give an erroneous a false account of them an account that agrees not with their nature—it is to misrepresent them but very different from what it is in most other cases in this case misrepresentation is not matter of blame by it no deception is intended if to a certain degree for want of sufficient explanation misconception be the result of it unless by accident it is not among the results intended by him by whom the misrepresentation is made—the false account is delivered from what there is of falsehood not only is pure good the result but it is the work of invincible necessity—on no other terms can discourse be carried on every nounsubstantive is a name a name either of an individual object or of a sort or aggregate of objects the name of an individual has by all grammarians been termed a proper name—the name of a sort or aggregate of objects a common name it being applied in common to each one of the individual objects which are regarded as belonging to that sort—as possessing certain properties supposed to belong in common to them all by this name an existence is ascribed to the individual object or sort of object of which it is the name in the case where to the object thus spoken of existence is actually an object of one of the five senses and in particular of the sense of touch or feeling—the only one without which man cannot exist say in a word where the object is a tangible one here there is no fiction—as this man this beast this bird this fish this star—or this sort of man this sort of beast this sort of bird this sort of fish this sort of star—the object spoken of may be termed a real entity on the other hand in the case in which the object is not a tangible one the object the existence of which is thus asserted not being a real existing one the object if it must be termed an entity as on pain of universal and perpetual nonintercourse between man and man it must be—it may for distinctions sake be termed a fictitious entity take for example this motion this operation this quality this obligation this right thus then we have two sorts of names with two corresponding sorts of entities names of real entities—names of fictitious entities unfortunate it is howsoever necessary and indispensable that for speaking of fictitious entities there is no other possible mode than that of speaking of them as if they were so many real entities this blameless falsehood     being universally uttered and remaining universally uncontradicted is to a considerable extent taken for truth with every name employed an entity stands associated in the minds of the hearers as well as speakers and that entity though in one half of the whole number of instances no other than a fictitious one is in all of them apt to be taken for a real one to speak of an object by its name its universally known name is to ascribe existence to it—out of this error misconception obscurity ambiguity confusion doubts disagreement angry passions discord and hostility have to no inconsiderable amount had place there is many a man who could not endure patiently to sit and hear contested the reality of those objects which he is in the habit of speaking of as being his rights for the assertion of the existence of these fictitious objects no small degree of merit has been ascribed no small degree of praise has been given—assertion has been taken for proof and the stronger and more numerous the sets of words employed the more complete and conclusive has that proof been esteemed to such of the sources of perception as are of a material or corporeal nature whether audible or visible names are early attached—by the presence of the object to both parties at once the addresser and the addressee i e party addressed at the time that by the addresser the sign is presented to the sense of the addressee the individuality of the object the idea of which is by that sign presented to notice is continually established bring hither that loaf—behold that apple—at the time when the sign is thus presented to sense the thing signified—the portion of matter thus denominated being at the same time presented to the senses of both parties the import of the word loaf or apple is thus fixed readily fixed and beyond danger of mistake objects of a corporeal nature may be designated and denominated in a direct way not so in the case of an object of which the seat lies in the mind—not so in the case of an immaterial being for producing in any other mind any conception whatsoever of an object of this class a man has absolutely but one means and that is to speak of it as if it belonged to the other class—to speak of it as if it were a material object—to present to the party addressed some sign or other with the signification of which he is acquainted in the character of a sign of some material object—and upon the resemblance or rather analogy such as it is which has place between the material object of which it was originally the sign and the immaterial object of which it is now employed as a sign to depend for the chance of the signs exciting in his mind the idea which on the occasion it is endeavoured to excite viz the idea of the immaterial object in saying bring me that loaf it lies in that pan—if a pan with a loaf in it were accordingly existing in the presence of us both—i should raise up in your mind two ideas that of a pan and that of a loaf correspondent to the portion of discourse having matter for its subject here then is a portion of discourse having mind for its subject by what means then is it that by words employed for that purpose i have succeeded in my endeavour to present to your own mind the general in conjunction with the particular idea of something which i have caused to have place in it it is by causing you to consider your own mind under the image or similitude of a receptacle in which the idea has been made to have place as in the material pan the material loaf is deposited and here after having officiated in the material sense the preposition in a preposition significative of place officiates in the immaterial sense and it is by its material sense that it receives its explanation when employed in its immaterial sense for from no other source could it receive its explanation applied to the designation of any class of material objects a sign is or may be the sign of a real entity applied to the purpose of designating any object of the class of immaterial objects a sign cannot in that respect be the sign of anything but a fictitious entity the entity of which the sign in question is given as a sign—your mind as in the above example shall in the character of an immaterial substance have whatsoever reality it may be your pleasure to see ascribed to it but in the phrase in question in virtue of the preposition in it is in the character of a material substance that it is spoken of a receptacle in which an idea may have place as a loaf may in a pan and in so far as that is the character in which it is spoken of fiction is employed so far therefore the name given to your mind is the name of a fictitious entity and your mind itself a fictitious entity if in the instance of your mind it be in any way displeasing to you to make this acknowledgment take for the fictitious entity the idea spoken of as being lodged in it—or if that be not agreeable let it be your understanding your will your conception your imagination considered in the character of so many separated existences capable of having objects lodged in them of the origin of the import of the sign in some instances the materiality is it is true no longer visible take for example as above the word mind itself and the word will but in by far the greater number of instances it is plain enough take for example the words understanding conception and imagination as above even in regard to mind though of that word the root in material ideas is lost in the french word the import of which though it coincide not with it comes nearest to it viz esprit the materiality is plain enough     correspondent to and derived from that french word or from the latin word spiritus is our word spirit and that spirit means originally breath i e air discharged out of the lungs is sufficiently notorious in so far as any origin at all can be found for it it is in a material import that the origin of the import of every word possessing an immaterial import is to be found seeing that in the numerous instances in which both sorts of imports are attached to the same word this rule is verified we can do no otherwise than conclude that originally such was also the case in the instance of the comparatively small number of words in and for which no material import can at present be found throughout the whole field of language parallel to the line of what may be termed the material language and expressed by the same words runs a line of what may be termed the immaterial language not that to every word that has a material import there belongs also an immaterial one but that to every word that has an immaterial import there belongs or at least did belong a material one in a word our ideas coming all of them from our senses from what other source can the signs of them—from what other source can our language come of one and the same thought from mind to mind by what means—through what channel can conveyance be made to no other mans is the mind of any man immediately present matter this or that portion of matter external to both in this may be seen the only channel the only medium which the nature of the case admits of yonder stands a certain portion of matter by that portion of matter feelings of a certain sort are produced in your mind by that same portion of matter feelings of a sort if not exactly the same at least with reference to the purpose in question near enough to being the same are produced at the same time in my mind here then is the channel of communication and the only one of that channel language takes possession and employs it under you tree in that hollow on the ground lies an apple—in that same spot while i am saying this to you pointing at the same time to the spot you are observing that same apple by this means along with the signification of the words lies ground hollow c you and i learn the signification of the word in at and during the time we are thus conversing the ideas of the apple the ground and the hollow are in both our minds in this way it is that we learn the import of this same word in with reference to our two minds in a word with reference to mind in general by no other means could we have learned it in no other way could the word in add or any other word have acquired a signification with reference to mind unless it be the one expressed by the proposition of taken as the sign of the possessive case the material image and thence the immaterial idea expressed by the preposition in is the one the exemplification of which occurs with the greatest frequency by this example the derivation of the immaterial idea from the material image and the use thence made of the noun considered as the name of the immaterial idea from the use made of the same word in the character of the name of the material image being once explained to any one to whom the explanation thus given is clear and satisfactory of the two senses thus attached to as many propositions as the particular language whatsoever it be happens to furnish the explanation may henceforward be despatched in a short formulary and at the expense of a comparatively small number of words section v subjects of discourse immediate and ulterior language is the sign of thought an instrument for the communication of thought from one mind to another language is the sign of thought of the thought which is in the mind of him by whom the discourse is uttered it may be the sign of other things and other objects in infinite variety but of this object it is always a sign and it is only through this that it becomes the sign of any other object on this occasion and for this purpose the whole of the mind of man may be considered as distinguishable into two parts—the purely passive and the active in the passive is included the intellectual the active may also be styled the concupiscible the passive the seat of perception memory and judgment in so far as it is capable as in seeing of being exercised without any consciousness of the intervention of the will the active the seat of desire and thence of volition and thence of external action the object for the designation of which a class of words termed by grammarians a verb in the imperative mood is employed is one example out of several modifications of the state of which the concupiscible part of the mind is susceptible a certain event presented by my imagination as being not yet realized but as capable of being realized becomes the object of my desire if the event be regarded as capable of being brought into reality by my own agency alone and my desire of seeing it realized is strong enough my will my volitional faculty and at the same time the appropriate branch of my externally active faculty are concerned in the production of it if it be regarded as capable of being brought into reality by the active agency of some other individual and not otherwise at the same time that it appears to me probable that by the knowledge of the desire entertained in my   0 mind a correspondent desire followed by corresponding action will be produced in his i address myself to him i employ the faculty of language in making communication to him of such my desire accordingly in respect of power regard being had to the particular occasion and purpose in question what is his situation in life in relation and comparison to mine is it that in my view of the matter i have it in my power to exercise a greater influence on his wellbeing than he has on mine—i am his superior is it that on the one hand the power which i have of exercising influence on his wellbeing on the other hand the power which he has of exercising influence on my wellbeing are equal to one another—he is my equal is it that the power which he has of exercising influence on my wellbeing is greater than that which i have of exercising influence on his wellbeing—i am his inferior in the first case if the mode in which i make communication of such my desire be such as to convey to him an intimation of the opinion i entertain of the position of such my own station in life with relation to his the expression thus given to my desire is termed a command in latin impero means i command imperation commanding of the cluster of words designated by grammarians by the name of a verb one included cluster is termed as above a verb in the imperative mood by this name the intimation expressed is that wherever a word of this form is employed intimation of superiority is given as above that by it this sort of command is signified and that commands are not signified by any other sort of word but that neither of these propositions is correct will in its place be made manifest thus far then are we advanced the immediate subject of a communication made by language is always the state of the speakers mind the state of the passive or receptive part of it or the state of the active or concupiscible part now then in the case where it is the state of the receptive part what is or may be the ulterior subject of the communication thus made answer it will be in some respect or other the state viz meaning the supposed or alleged state either of the corporeal part of the speakers frame or the state of some object other than and exterior to the speaker of the corporeal part of the speakers frame examples—i am weary i am hungry i am dry of the state of some object other than and exterior to the speaker examples—that apple is ripe apples are sweet apples are good in both these cases an object other than the state of my own mind is the subject of the discourse held by me but in neither of them is it the immediate subject in both of them the immediate subject is no other than the state of my own mind—an opinion entertained by me in relation to the ulterior object or subject in the one case it is an opinion of which the subject is the state of my own body in the other it is an opinion concerning the state of a body exterior to my own body in the first case the opinion though it be but an opinion is not as the case is here put much in danger of being erroneous in respect of the actual state of my sensations meaning the sensations themselves i am scarcely liable to be in an error but beyond that point no sooner do i advance but a single step if i undertake to pronounce an opinion relative to the cause of any of those sensations from that moment i am liable to fall i here launch into the ocean of art and science i here commence physician and in the field of the physician the dominion of error is but too severely felt speaking of the state of my own body am i thus exposed to error—much more so am i in speaking of the state of any other the sort of infirmity just noticed being common to all discourse in the composition of which an assertion of the state of the speakers mind intervenes precedes introduces and weakens the ulterior assertion which lies beyond it the consideration of the intervening assertion may in every case but the present in which for the purpose of explanation it has been necessary thus for once to bring it to view be dropped and the subject of the discourse may be stated as being except in the particular case where it is the state of the speakers body the state of some exterior entity or assemblage of entities but now already comes the stage at which it will become necessary to launch into the track of fiction at which by an irresistible voice and on pain of leaving everything unexplained and misconceived the land of fiction calls upon us to visit it that apple is ripe apples are sweet apples are good an apple is a real entity in saying that apple exists—the existence of which i express my opinion is a real entity but that apple is ripe of what is it that in addition to that of the apple i express my opinion of the existence it is of the existence of the quality of ripeness in the apple but the quality of ripeness is it a real entity different from apples and everything else that is susceptible of it has this quality or any quality any separate existence if there were no other apple in the world than that which i have in my hand this apple would not the less be possessed of existence but if     there were nothing in the world that were susceptible of being ripe where would be the quality of ripeness nowhere in saying this apple is ripe what is it that i affirm it is that in this apple is the quality of ripeness the two expressions are equivalent but—in this apple is the quality of ripeness in the assertion thus made what is the image that i bring to view it is that the apple is a receptacle and that in this receptacle the quality of ripeness the imaginary the fictitious entity called a quality is lodged for of the preposition in this is the import witness the apple which i am supposing myself to have in my hand witness the pen which at this moment i actually have in hand thus it is that in the use made of language fiction at the very first step that can be taken in the field of language fiction in the simplest or almost the simplest case in which language can be employed becomes a necessary resource coeval with the very first steps that can be taken in the endeavour to give a clear explanation of the nature of language must be the intimation given of the distinction between real and fictitious entities and the correspondent distinction between names of real and names of fictitious entities though to the development and thus to the explanation of the import of the word ripe the word ripeness may thus be rendered subservient it follows not that of the two the word ripeness was first in use from the use which—in and for the developing the texture of the import of the verb—of the word quality in the character of a generic name and of the names of the several sorts of qualities distinguishable in the several sorts of substances in the character of so many specific names may now be made it follows not that words of this description were in use before the verb—before that complex species of verb in every individual of which the import of some species of quality may be found contained on the contrary the contrary course seems even by much the most natural and probable to have taken place in the earlier stages of society all conceptions and consequently all expressions were generally indistinct it is only by longcontinued courses of attention that distinctness in conception and expression have been produced it seems probable that it was in the shape of entire propositions that the sounds of which audible language was composed first presented themselves witness those words which under the name of interjections are by grammarians numbered among the parts of speech and which may be considered as so many fragments of language as it showed itself in its earliest state as it was with the audible so it appears to have been with the visible signs of language and as words were formed by the decomposition of propositions so were letters by the decomposition of words if all language be thus figurative how then it may be asked how then is it that the character and in so important a class of instances the reproach of figurativeness is cast upon the use made of it in particular instances to this it may be answered—the discourse that in this particular sense is not figurative is the discourse in which for the conveyance of the immaterial part of the stock of ideas conveyed no other fictions—no other figures are employed than what are absolutely necessary to and which consequently are universally employed in the conveyance of the import intended to be conveyed when a discourse is figurative in lieu of those or in addition to those other images not necessary to and thence not universally employed in the conveyance of the import in question are employed in some instances by the figures by the images thus without necessity employed it happens that in the mind of the hearer or speaker a sense of pleasure is produced in this case according to the nature of the subject and according as the use of them is or is not conjoined with the use of metre they constitute the matter of poetry or rhetoric and are regarded as ornamental in other instances the sensation of which they are productive is that of disgust the case in which this happens is where the resemblance between the material image employed as a sign and the immaterial object meant to be signified is too faint the distance too wide or where in such a proportion as to be fatiguing for the designation of one and the same object a multitude of images one upon the back of another are heaped up not unfrequently when for the designation of the immaterial idea meant to be designated a man has chosen and employed a material image not very closely analogous to it that image brings to view and gives expression to a second that second to a third and so on not one of them perhaps very closely analogous to the one by which it was immediately suggested what adds to the confusion a quality which belongs only to one of these images considered in the character of a subject is inadvertently ascribed to another in this way perhaps before the discourse is come to a close the immaterial object or state of things originally meant to be designated has been forgotten and is dropt out of sight and thus the whole becomes a tissue of nonsense of imperfection in this shape the most conspicuous examples may be found generally not to say universally in the works of oriental writers section vi relation as between archetype and type with their respective synonyms and modifications when any two psychical real entities any     two ideas whether perceptions remembrances or factitious mental images have either at the same instant or at two contiguous or nearly contiguous instants been present to the mind—each of them such is the effect of this conjunction howsoever transient acquires in the event of its reappearance a tendency to draw forth and introduce the other and the more frequently the conjunct appearance is repeated the more apt cæteris paribus is this tendency or probability to ripen into actuality this tendency is equal and mutual and forasmuch as when considered in this most simple point of view the two objects thus associated present not any points of difference by which either can be distinguished from the other they are not while considered in this point of view and no other susceptible of different names when in respect of order of time any difference between the two has place in this difference may be found it might be supposed matter sufficient to serve as the ground for the formation of a difference in respect of name but innumerable are the instances in which no difference in point of time can be found to have place and even when a difference of this sort might perhaps be observable to such a degree is it fugitive and questionable as to be altogether incapable of affording any permanent and sufficient practical ground for a permanent difference in respect of name at the same time so it is that for the two ideas in a pair of ideas thus associated two different names and those employed throughout a large portion of the field of thought have been provided to the possibility of putting to any kind of use this difference in respect of name some difference in respect of nature was an indispensable requisite of this necessary difference a source was found in the order of importance for designating the object regarded as superior in the scale of importance the word archetype or thing signified was employed for the other the words sign and type in so far as any importance is considered as belonging to both and if to both in so far as any difference is considered as having place in their respective degrees of relative importance that to which the highest degree is ascribed will be considered and spoken of as the archetype or thing signified that to which no more than an inferior degree of importance or what is perhaps more common no importance at all is regarded as belonging will be spoken of as the type or sign if while importance is considered as belonging to both no difference of level is considered as having place between their respective situations in the scale of importance either may be considered as possessing the character of archetype or thing signified in relation to the other which in that case will be considered as operating in the character of type—performing the function of type or sign in so far as no degree of importance is regarded as belonging to either of them no source of denomination can in that case be found for either of them—neither of them presenting any pretension to the character of archetype neither of them is capable of being designated by any such denomination as that of type the condition requisite to the establishment of this conjunction being so extremely simple and such as in the nature of things cannot but be of continually repeated occurrence design human design cannot but have been necessary to the exemplification of it but if even without design i e an exertion of the will applying itself to that purpose it be capable of taking place much more is it with and by design of the production of this effect by design language in all its various forms is the most extensive exemplification—within the field of its operation almost all other exemplifications are included in the case of language taken in the aggregate the aggregate composed of ideas or other psychical entities capable of being expressed by language being considered as constituting the aggregate archetype or thing signified the aggregate of the sounds employed for that purpose constitute with reference to it the aggregate type or sign this aggregate type or sign being considered as the archetype the aggregate of the images which under the name of letters are employed for the designation of those sounds constitutes with reference to the aggregate of those same sounds the aggregate type or sign symbol index indication token badge the ideas attached respectively to these words are so many modifications of the idea attached to the word sign though in the nature of the case as above no object of perception be incapable of being in the character of type or sign made to serve for bringing to the minds view any other yet by reason of their natural permanence or capacity for permanence the signs most naturally and frequently applied to this purpose are of the visible class so extensive and considered in its totality so adequate to the purpose of designation is the collection of signs of which language is composed that any other sign or lesser aggregate of signs to which on any occasion it happens to be applied to any part of the same purpose is considered in no other light than that of a substitute to that supremely useful instrument symbol token badge—in these words may be seen so many names of signs of a particular description employed on some particular occasion with or without advantage in the character of substitutes to that universally and constantly fit and useful instrument of the above three words symbol and token are not incapable of being employed for the designation of any class of objects considered     as employed in the character of signs of the word badge the applicability seems confined to such signs as consist of visible images section vii of propositions every word to be made intelligible must be represented as part of some assertion or proposition every sentence is either an assertion or a combination of assertions to be subservient to any use or purpose every assignable portion of language must on each occasion be enunciative or suggestive of at least some proposition this proposition will consist of one word only or of divers words—will be either monoepic or polyepic when it is polyepic the proposition has several words for its component elements a proposition is either simple or composite every composite proposition is resolvable into a number of simple ones every monoepic proposition has for its equivalent a polyepic one of which it is the abridged expression examples of monoepic propositions are the several conjugates the infinitive mood excepted which are usually contained in what is called a verb—one and the same verb a simple proposition is either   physical   psychological or   compounded of the two every psychological proposition has for its archetype a physical proposition physical are therefore the propositions the mention of which requires to precede that of the other by every single physical proposition the subject of it is stated either as being in a state of rest or in a state of motion in every simple physical proposition if complete are contained a word designative of the subject of the proposition a word designative of the predicate of the proposition† and a word designative of the copula‡ or bond of connexion between the two a word by which the operation called predication is performed this copula is either affirmative or negative by the copula if affirmative the subject is averred to be in some state for the description of which the predicate is employed the portion of language employed for giving expression to a proposition may be either—  exactly adequate or commensurate   superabundant or   deficient it is exactly adequate or commensurate when for the designation of each member one word and no more is employed it is deficient in so far as the name of any one of the members being omitted the import belonging to it is left to be inferred viz from the context i e from such parts of the whole discourse of which the signs are inserted it is redundant or superabundant in proportion as in lieu of the designation of any one or more of the members words more than one are employed§ propositions may be distinguished in the first place into purely real purely verbal semireal or ambiguous a purely real proposition is either intellectual i e state of the intellect expressing or volitional i e state of the will expressing in propositions of the intellectual cast or kind the name of the subject may be the name either of a real entity or of a fictitious entity so also the name of the attribute or predicate may be either the name of a real or the name of a fictitious entity every simple proposition comes—or without violence and in respect of unity and simplicity with considerable use may be made to come under this description viz a mass of discourse by which the assertion conveyed is to this effect viz that in the subject of which the name is contained or implied in it a property or quality∥ of which the name is contained or implied in it has had has or will absolutely or eventually have existence every proposition predicates the existence past present or future i e future certain or future contingent of some state of things which is either motional or quiescent a motional state of things is an event to predicate for instance the existence of a quality in a subject is to predicate the existence viz past present or future certain or contingent of the events which are the manifestations of that quality     a proposition containing the name of a fictitious entity predicates indirectly as if a real event were predicated of a real entity some event as if it were real concerning the fictitious entity at the same time the event being referred to an entity which is not real cannot itself be real and this is done by means of a distant and fanciful analogy which there is between the event typified and the real event made use of for typification abstract entities can no otherwise be expressed than by fiction thus a billiardball is said to be in motion or motion in a billiardball or two billiardballs in a situation two objects two billiardballs considered in successive moments have been either at different distances from one another or at the same distance in the first case they are in motion in the second case they are at rest motion can no otherwise be defined than by diversity of distance the portion of matter interposed between them being at one time of one length at another time of another diversity of distances are judged of by a comparison which is simultaneous one moment i can place no more than one piece of wood of an inch long between the two balls the next moment i can place two such pieces words cannot in a direct manner represent any other events than what are quiescent motion they cannot represent it is with language in this respect as it is with painting in all propositions composed of or concerning fictitious and abstract entities there are two events concerned   the real event typified   the fictitious event which is the archetype the proposition which announces the event typified may be termed the plain or unfigurative proposition the other the figurative proposition a proposition is really significative in so far as the import of the subject and that of the attribute not being precisely the same the attribute is represented by the proposition as bearing this or that relation to the subject examples—man is rational apples are nourishing a proposition is no more than verbally significative in so far as without relation had to the nature of the entity signified by the subject this or that relation is represented as having place between their names examples a wight is a man a miser covets wealth a rapier is a sword a proposition is both really and verbally significative in so far as by the names given to the subject and the attribute respectively the nature of both or either of them is meant to be brought to view example—wood anemonies are plants sea anemonies are animals of all propositions by which a minor genus is spoken of as being contained in a major genus the import may be considered as being of this mixed kind in propositions of which the subject is a fictitious entity the subject and predicate the verb and noun which use has conjoined must be kept conjoined a new combination appears an impropriety at least a novelty as much almost as the use of a new term you may say strain a point or stretch a point you cannot say extend a point nor strain nor stretch a line or a buckle† a complex proposition is that which has at least two subjects with a predicate and copula to each of them two subjects and as many predicates and copulas the general effect of it is to bring to view two entities each of them real or fictitious accompanied with an intimation that by one of them a change is produced in the state or condition of the other considered in this point of view a complex proposition may be termed a transitionexpressing proposition examples—  eurybiades struck themistocles   themistocles was stricken by eurybiades in both these instances the result expressed is one and the same but in the one instance the verb employed is in what is called the active voice in the other in the passive in both instances a change in the state of a certain entity is represented as produced and a motion is presented in the character of a cause of that change but in the first instance the entity brought to view is the entity in which the motion is represented as having had its commencement the entity which is represented as having been first in motion and with that same entity the motion so produced by it in the other instance it is the entity in which the motion is represented as having had its termination themistocles was struck viz by eurybiades this motion may be considered as the manifestation of a correspondent quality on the subject viz an active quality an active quality which is represented as having on the occasion in question at the moment in question been resident in one of the two subjects in question viz eurybiades in the other instance the being struck may be considered as the manifestation of a correspondent quality of the passive kind which is represented as having been on that same occasion at that same moment resident in the other of the two subjects in question viz themistocles‡     section viii of the subject of a proposition the name of the subject of a proposition is either singularly designative or plurally designative it is singularly designative when no more than one individual is meant to be designated plurally when individuals more than one a singularly designative name is either determinately or indeterminately significative determinately where the individual meant to be designated is distinguished from all others as in the case of the proper name of a man a field a street a lane c indefinite or indeterminate when the import of the pronoun adjective some or any is considered as attached to it a plurally designative name is the name of an aggregate or number of individuals considered as if collected together these individuals are either all determinate all indeterminate or some determinate others indeterminate   all determinate for instance the members of one official board actually in existence   all indeterminate for instance the intended members of an official board not in existence but in contemplation to be established   some determinate some indeterminate of this sort are the names of all species and genera of things of aggregate objects which have have had or will have a real existence for in and by every such specific or generic name are designated in the first place all the individuals which are considered as being at the time in question endowed with the specific quality indicated by the name in the next place all that ever were in the last place all which ever will be and by the supposition these last neither have nor ever have had existence a specific name partakes therefore at once of the nature of the name of a real entity and of a name of a fictitious entity it is the name of a real entity considered as applied to any one of the individuals now or before now in existence which were endowed with the specific property or to the whole number of them or to any part of the whole number of them put together it is as yet the name of a fictitious entity considered as applied to all or any one or more of those individuals which with that same specific character belonging to them are considered as about to come into existence in this it differs from the name of a quality for a quality is an object altogether fictitious an object which considered as distinct from the subject in which it is spoken of as inhering neither has nor has had nor ever will have existence for as often as it is spoken of as if it were in a body i e a tangible substance or in some other object which is spoken of as if it were a body it is spoken of as if it were a substance a tangible substance which by the supposition it is not section ix of predication in the character of a subject an entity real or fictitious being brought to view if by any phrase intimation is given that in that subject a certain quality thereby designated has place predication is performed the quality in respect of its being so asserted to have place in the subject is styled the predicate and the sign by which the assertion the act of assertion to the effect in question is expressed is termed the copula in this explanation a proposition implied is that predication may in every case be reduced to this an attribution of a quality to a subject to the entity which is the subject of the proposition of which the predicate in question is the predicate the import of the word quality being already explained as not to be confined to the case in which the existence of it is considered as permanent property relation place time manners by the one word quality can the import of all these terms be with propriety said to be included answer—yes   property—this may be considered as being perfectly synonymous to the word quality and therefore in any case in which the use of the word quality might on any account be less convenient may without any difference of import be employed as a substitute for it   relation for explaining the import of divers parts of speech this word will of necessity come to be employed but the bearing this or that relation to this or that other object may without impropriety be numbered among the qualities or properties of any object   of the modification of which place i e space considered in a relative point of view is susceptible frequent occasion for making mention will present itself but the having its existence in the place in question may for so long as it continues be with as much propriety in this instance as in any other numbered among the properties or qualities of the object whatsoever it may be   so in regard to time amongst the qualities attributed to this subject in question may be the having its existence in a certain portion of the field of time     every object that exists exists in some portion or other of the field of place or space every object that exists exists in some portion or other of the field of time in so far as it exists in the field of space an object bears a certain relation to every other object considered as having its existence in that field in so far as it exists in the field of time an object bears in like manner a certain relation to every other object considered as having its existence in that same field—the field of time and thus we have the relations of place and time which with the addition of quality in the less extended sense of the word viz that in which it is put for qualities other than those which consist in existence in certain portions of the field of place and time constitute some of the principal classes of the objects for the designation of which the different classes of words called parts of speech are employed as it requires an entire proposition to give complete expression—expression at length to an intimation that to the subject in question a certain property or quality belongs so does it to give the like expression to an intimation that of the subject in question the existence is confined to a certain portion of the field of space or to a certain portion of the field of time in this way it will appear that not only in an adverb such as—here there now then the import of an entire proposition is contained but even that in a mere preposition such as of under the import of an entire proposition is contained and that accordingly whenever over and above the preposition in the import of which is included in every proposition or every form of words by which a quality is asserted to be in a subject any other preposition is included in the proposition that proposition is a complete one containing in addition to whatsoever other simple propositions it may contain one of which the preposition in question is the abridged equivalent and substitute predication is either real or verbal—real when the design of the proposition is to convey information concerning the nature of the object signified—when it declares the existence of some quality in the subject named—of real predication nothing can be the object or matter but a quality verbal when the design is merely to give intimation of the import of the word which on the occasion in question is employed in the character of a sign as an oak is a plant a dog is an animal different as they are in themselves that is in the design in pursuance of which they are employed these two modes of predication are very liable to be confounded when the predication is real the purpose of it the purpose of the proposition in which it has place is always as above to convey an intimation that in the entity in question which or the name of which is the subject of the proposition in question a certain quality to which expression is given in and by the predicate has existence when the predication is verbal purely verbal the design is not to give intimation of any quality as having existence in any subject but merely to convey an intimation of a certain relation between the import of one word and the import of another no such object as the nature of the quality designated by either being on that occasion meant to be brought into view† the reason for holding up to view this distinction is that sometimes when the effect or design of the preposition is of one sort it is liable to be misconceived by being conceived to be of the other sort section x of collections of signs i e propositions expressive of some state of the perceptive faculty considered as having for the source of the perception a corporeal object or objects correspondent to such as are the objects to be designated such must be the signs by which they are designated correspondent to the states and such as are the modifications of which corporeal objects are susceptible such must be the modifications of the signs which under the name of language or discourse are employed in the designation of them every proposition by which any portion of matter is brought to view—is presented to the mind has for its subject either some material body some portion of a body or some collection of bodies or portions of bodies the sign or portion of language by which any such modification or modifications of matter are presented to the mind is termed a name a denomination an appellation the appellative by any such name what is designated is either a simple body a part of a single body or an aggregate of bodies or of parts of single bodies if a part of a body be spoken of by itself it is in so far considered as a whole if it be a single body the mode in which that body is spoken of is either determinate or indeterminate if determinate the name is styled a proper name if it be an aggregate of bodies it is styled a common name if the individuals designated by such common name be all determinate it is or may be styled a collective name—in so far as any of them are indeterminate a general or specific name     if being a single body it be indeterminate it has for its denomination a common name whether collective or generic being the name of the aggregate of which it is considered as an unit coupled with a species of sign denominated a pronounadjective of which by and by during any given length of time every material object capable of being taken for the subject of a proposition in fact has been either in motion or at rest but when it is in motion it may be considered as capable of being at rest and when at rest as capable of being in motion every proposition has either one subject alone or more than one it being understood that under the description of one subject is here comprehended that which has for its sign a common name whether collective or generic i e logically comprehensive or that of which a proper name is the appellative a proposition if but one subject be designated in it may be termed a single proposition if two double if more than two complex as everything which can happen to a corporeal subject is resolvable into this viz the having been during the length of time in question either in a state of motion or in a state of rest so everything that can be said of said to have happened to that same corporeal subject is resolvable either into this viz that during the length of time in question it has been or has been capable of being in a state of motion or into this viz that it has been or has been capable of being in a state of rest in either case by what is said of the corporeal subject in question a quality may be said to be ascribed to it to be attributed to it to be said to belong to it—it may be said to be possessed of endued endowed with that same quality—the quality is spoken of as being in that same subject belonging to appertaining to inherent in that same subject if in speaking of the quality as being in the subject no more than a single point of time is brought to view the quality thus attributed may be styled actual or momentary or transient—if it be considered as either being or capable of being in the subject for an indeterminate length of time the quality may be styled potential habitual or permanent when a quality is spoken of as appertaining to this or that subject that which on this occasion is most frequently meant to be designated and is therefore most apt to be brought to view is an habitual or permanent quality in consideration of its being attributed to a subject a quality is also frequently styled an attribute—an attribute of that same subject and in consideration of its belonging to a subject it is also frequently styled a property—a property of or belonging or appertaining to or inherent in that same subject suppose then a portion of the matter of language so constructed as to present to view a quality whether actual or habitual as appertaining to this or that given corporeal subject let it be considered what are the objects of which this portion of the matter of language must have contained the signs these are   the subject   the quality but to say that the quality in question is in the subject in question is to affirm the existence of a certain relation between that subject and that quality viz the sort of relation of which the word in is the sign thus then to the sign of the subject and the sign of the quality must be added the sign of the relation but what is thus said what is thus affirmed is that in the subject in question the quality in question is in other words that between the subject and this quality there exists the relation in question thus then to complete the texture of the proposition to the sign of the subject the sign of the quality and the sign of the relation must be added the sign of existence—the sign by which existence is brought to view—the sign by which existence is asserted to have or to have had place viz the existence of the relation between the subject and the attribute for the present viz to aid conception and to afford a mark of distinction whereby this minimum proposition and a proposition of larger dimensions and a greater number of parts may be distinguished let the following examples serve— apples say are sweet or to keep clear of certain causes of complication say rather sugar is sweet the number of words employed is here no more than three but in the form of expression an abbreviation may be observed sweetness the quality of sweetness is in sugar sugar the name of the subject—a corporeal subject sweetness the name of the quality the quality consisting in the aptitude in consequence of the necessary actions to produce in the sensorium of men the perception termed by the same name section xi aristotelian logicians—imperfection of their conceptions in relation to propositions for the formation of a proposition it has been seen that no fewer than four objects require to be brought to view—objects all of them distinct and for the designation of each of them a distinct sign capable of being and in use to be employed what has moreover been seen is that for the formation of a complete proposition though it be but a single proposition the number of     objects brought to view cannot be smaller than as above true it is that for the bringing to view this number of distinct and altogether different objects a smaller number of words and in truth even a single word may be and often has been made to serve and to suffice but how only because in virtue of certain established associations by this one word the whole number of the abovementioned distinct and different objects have been brought to view not so the aristotelians constituent parts of a proposition according to aristotle himself no more than two viz the subject and the predicate name of the subject a noun—name of the predicate a verb seeing that out of the two and no more than two distinguishable parts no proposition could be formed no attribute spoken of as belonging to any subject the followers of aristotle one and all added a third viz the sign of existence to which they gave the name of a copula though in this according to sanderson they departed from the truth of the case why because they departed from the conceptions expressed from the language used by aristotle but the relation between the subject and the attribute the relation of which the existence between this subject and the attribute was to be affirmed even after the above addition what name had they found for it—what observation had they made of it answer none as in anatomy so in logic by a continued and varied course of attention bestowed by a succession of observers new organs have from time to time been discovered for the formation of a proposition taken too in its least dimensions according to aristotle no more than two according to his observers no more than three parts necessary whereas this minimum number it has been seen is no less than four and in their view of the matter this number sufficient for another sort of proposition which remains to be brought to view and which when analyzed will be found to contain twice the number of parts contained in the only sort of proposition as yet brought to view† term it must be acknowledged is the latinsprung word corresponding to the word employed by aristotle terms—no more than two and so by his followers terms no more than three but by terms he and they must have meant component or constituent parts for that was the thing which required to be brought to view if by the name of term there were any parts that were not designated then by some other name such other parts should have been brought to view according to sanderson the copula says aristotle is neither a term nor so much as a part of a proposition—it is no more than a syncategorema and what according to him is a syncategorema it is a part of the predicate which according to him is itself a part of a proposition the subject being the other a part of that which is a part of the whole and yet not a part of the whole what selfcontradiction—what confusion—what trifling—what torment to the student who by the law of authority stands bound to find it all true and incomprehensible     fragments on universal grammar now first published from the manuscripts of jeremy bentham asterisks with reference to the mss from which these fragments are edited see the editorial notices to the works on logic and language pp           0     introduction you to whom in comparison with the whole number of existing languages but a very small number at the utmost of this whole can be in any degree known—on what ground is it that you can undertake to give an account of universal grammar that is of the grammar of all languages whatsoever answer—in a great degree in respect of the character and mutual relations of the parts of speech—viz of those classes of words of which language is everywhere composed—the articles of which the subject of grammar is composed as to which all languages cannot but agree the demand in that respect being everywhere to a certain degree the same the nature of the supply cannot fail also to be everywhere in a great degree the same when in relation to these points of necessary and universal agreement the connexion between the demand and the supply between thought and the signs employed for the communication of thought are brought to view the points of possible difference will be found to lie within a compass comparatively narrow under this identity of the demand the greatest difference which in regard to the texture of the supply can possibly have place will be found to be exemplified by a distinction which will here be brought to view—viz that between the sparingly and the copiously inflected languages—and for the developing of this difference the limited number of languages which in the best informed parts of the world are included within the ordinary compass of a liberal education will be found to be amply sufficient under these circumstances whatsoever degree of diversity can have place as between any language not included in the survey taken for this purpose and those which have been included in it such and so numerous will be found to be the points of necessary identity as to form all together a ground or standard of comparison and reference to which any language whatsoever how numerous and various and widely distant soever its points of diversity with relation to the aggregate standard so formed may be referred and in this way it is believed such will be found to be the nature of the case that among those languages which have not in any degree been included in the survey taken for the present purpose scarcely will any one be found to which the sketch here given—supposing it applicable with advantage to those languages which have been included in the survey—will not be found applicable with little if any less advantage than even to the language in which this sketch is penned absolute and relative—in the nature and properties of every object may these two branches be observed in the case of language in particular to the absolute nature of each tongue or language belongs all those particulars for the conception of which it is not necessary to keep in view any other tongue or language to its relative nature the points of agreement and disagreement identity and diversity similitude and dissimilitude observable on comparison made of it with other languages for the attainment of the most clear correct and complete conception that can be attained of the points of similitude and dissimilitude as between one language and another there are no means so effectual as a view taken of the ends or purposes of language in general with the addition of a view taken of the different degrees of success with which different courses are respectively taken by them towards the attainment of those ends the language in which for the purpose of giving expression to the several modifications of import of which words are capable no use whatever is made of inflection in which for the giving expression to all these several diversifications of import no other instrument is employed than that of distinct addition would not it is believed be found but some languages there are in which on comparison with others the use made of inflection is extremely small these may be termed sparingly inflected languages the others copiously inflected languages between sparingness and copiousness taken according to the common acceptation of the terms no naturally determinate line of separation would be to be found but in their application to language to the several known languages so wide and conspicuous in every instance will the difference be found that in the particular case here in question no ambiguity will be found to be produced by that want of determinateness by which it might in some cases be produced from this distinction between sparingly inflectedness and copiously inflectedness as applied to language a variety of results have been found deducible most if not all of them such that in a practical point of view the importance of them if correct will it is believed be generally and readily recognised in the character of propositions to be proved     they will now immediately be presented to view what has presented itself as necessary in the shape of explanation and proof will successively come to view as we advance in the field of universal grammar four objects or topics present a principal claim to notice viz—   the uses or properties to which language has been or is capable of being rendered subservient   the properties which in the character of properties conducive to these purposes are desirable on the part of a language in a word in the instance of every language   the degrees in which by the several known languages in so far as they are known these properties may be seen to be possessed   the properties which according to the occasion on which the language whatsoever it be which is in question is employed are desirable on the part of the style i e the language of an individual by whom on that occasion it is employed i the purposes to which language may be applied are   social or principal   solitary or secondary ii the properties which for all purposes taken together are desirable on the part of language at large i e as far as may be in every language will it is believed be found to be as follows—  clearness or perspicacity   correctness   copiousness or comprehensiveness   completeness   nonredundance   conciseness or compressedness   pronunciability i e facility of pronunciation   melodiousness   discibility i e facility of being learned  0 docibility    meliorability    ornability i e facility of being made subservient to the purpose of ornament    impressiveness    dignity    patheticalness of the abovementioned fifteen properties the five first regard being had to the difference in the degrees in which different languages are respectively susceptible of them are beyond comparison the most important iii in respect of all these five properties the sparingly inflected languages have in a prodigious degree the advantage over the copiously inflected languages by means of the sparingly inflected languages alone and not by any of the copiously inflected languages can the fundamental principle of universal grammar and the nature of language in general including the relation and correspondency between the nature of the thoughts requiring to be expressed and the nature of the signs capable of being employed for the expression of them have been developed with that clearness of which they are susceptible to the class of copiously inflected languages belong the ancient greek the ancient latin and the modern languages of the continent of europe of which from those two but most immediately from the latin the structure has been derived of all known languages the english is that which is most sparingly inflected of all known languages the english is accordingly that in which in the highest degree taken in the aggregate the most important of the properties desirable in every language are to be found in particular in a higher degree than any other is the english language adapted for the purpose of a treatise on universal grammar in which the essential characters of all language and the fundamental principles of all grammar are intended to be brought to view in so inferior a degree are the copiously inflected languages and in particular the greek and latin adapted to the purpose of being employed as instruments for the explanation of the principles of universal grammar that it may be doubted whether by any person unacquainted with any other than those languages respectively a clear conception of the nature of language in general and of the principles of universal grammar could have been conveyed or formed iv by means of the lights afforded principally by this distinction between the sparingly inflected and the copiously inflected languages and in particular by that enumeration by which it has been suggested or at least accompanied viz the list of the properties desirable in language observations may be suggested by which not only the attainment of the maximum of perfection in the style of each individual on each occasion may be facilitated but the improvement of the whole body of the particular language which they respectively employ may be placed in some degree within the reach of individuals for the purpose of conveying as early as possible a conception of the design and principal results of this essay a distinction that has been observed as between language and language in relation to the parts of speech must in this place be brought to view essentially diversified and not essentially diversified under one or other of these two heads will every one of them be found capable of being arranged those which are essentially diversified are those which are at the same time expressive of some one principal idea or import and of some one or more accessory ideas of which according to the nature of the discourse one or more are constantly and inseparably annexed to that principal one these will be seen to be   the nounsubstantive   the verb called by grammarians the verbsubstantive the verb in its utmost degree of simplicity the pure and simple verb the sign of relative existence     necessarily attached to the principal idea in the instance of the nounsubstantive there is but one accessory idea and that is that of number the objects meant to be brought to view by the word in question are meant to be represented either as one only or as more than one and in one of those two cases they cannot but be presented to view necessarily attached to the principal idea in the instance of the verb are the diversifications of which time is susceptible and the ideas of absoluteness and conditionality one or other of which is the inseparable accompaniment of every conception that can be formed on the subject of existence considered as the attribute of the matter of fact the idea of which is by the portion of discourse in question presented to the mind considered with reference to time as applied to the signs of existence in the case in question the verb is said to present itself to view in different tenses considered with reference to absoluteness and conditionality it is said to present itself to view in different moods it will be shown presently how the imports of all the other parts of speech are resolvable into the import of these two viz the nounsubstantive and the verbsubstantive viz as well those which in certain languages though not of necessity are in fact diversified as those of which no diversifications are to be found in any language it will be seen presently how it is that the nounadjective contains not any necessarily distinct diversification its only diversifications being those of the nounsubstantive to which it makes reference it will also be seen how it is that in addition to those just mentioned the verbsubstantive requires not any diversification it will moreover be seen that the import of any other verb than the verbsubstantive admits not of any diversification other than those which belong to the verbsubstantive insomuch as the import of every verb other than a verbsubstantive is resolvable into the import of the verbsubstantive added to the import of a nounadjective and farther on will be explained the mode in which the import of the preposition conjunction and adverb is resolvable into that of the nounsubstantive nounadjective and verb one two or all of them for giving expression to the abovementioned diversifications the authors of language have had the choice of two modes one is by the addition of so many separate words allotted to that purpose the other is by some change in the letters of which the sign of the principal idea or import is composed say in the first case by detached signs or more strictly though less clearly by distinct addition say in the other case by modification or to employ the word already in common use by inflection of the ideas here hazarded should they in any instance be deemed new if they are at the same time regarded as correct and just in that case it is not from their novelty that any consideration can justly be deducible tending to forbid their being presented to view in the idea of improvement that of novelty is essentially an ingredient among such new ideas as have been ventured to be submitted to the public eye the endeavour to render a thorough acquaintance with the whole nature and mechanism of language more general than it is has never been lost sight of chapter i definitions grammar is that branch of art and science in and by which the words of which language or discourse is composed are considered without any regard to the subject or occasion of the discourse but only with respect to the relations which the imports of the different classes of words of which it is composed bear to each other these classes of words being the same whatsoever be the subject of discourse those classes of words into which all discourse whatsoever may be the subject of it may be divided are termed the parts of speech in the course taken for the providing of words for the giving expression or designation to these several imports considerable differences are exhibited by different languages but as to those differences which have place in the mutually related imports themselves the demand is the same in all languages that branch of the art and science of grammar which has for its subject the course taken by the particular language in question for satisfying this abovementioned demand may be called particular grammar in so far as the modifications taken cognizance of are those which have place in every particular language this branch of the art and science may be designated by the name of universal grammar its objects are the different correlative imports which are essential ingredients in discourse whatsoever be the subject and which stand respectively designated by the different classes of words called as above parts of speech in so far as the imports are considered in themselves alone and without regard to the different provision made in and by different languages for the designation of them they constitute the subject of a branch of the art and science of universal grammar which may be distinguished by the appellation of the abstract or unapplied branch in so far as they are considered with regard to the differences that have place in the provision made for the designation of them in different languages the branch may be termed the concrete practical or applied branch     chapter ii uses of universal grammar of an acquaintance with this branch of art and science should it be asked what is the use an answer is at hand   giving facility to the study of any particular language whatsoever   giving to study of a number of languages conjunctly a degree of facility not obtainable by any other means   in the case where a man is so circumstanced that for the purpose in question it may be a matter of doubt with him which of several languages to employ—affording substantial grounds for the solution of that doubt   by developing the nature of the connexion between thoughts and their respective signs between the different sorts of signs and the thoughts of which they are the signs rendering a man the better acquainted with the nature of his own thoughts whatsoever on any occasion may be the subject to which they apply themselves to give a clear correct comprehensive and instructive view of the field of universal grammar it is not enough for a man to look into the books that are extant on the subject of grammar whether particular or universal—he must look into his own mind for want of being confronted and compared with the purposes the demand for which gave birth to the distinctions of which they are expressive—for want of being brought to view in company with the thoughts or parts of thoughts of which they are the signs the parts of speech have formed altogether a dark and mysterious cloud the only medium through which grammar whether particular or universal has ever yet been presented is that in which it is presented by the languages of ancient greece and rome but in both these languages properties will be shown by which they are rendered in a high degree incompetent and ill adapted to their purpose if then by a clear insight—if in a word by a clearer insight than has been as yet obtained of the general principles of language and of that art and science of which it is the subject the acquisition of any and of every particular language may be made to receive a facility hitherto unexampled—if at the same time in the obtaining of this insight no greater difficulty will in the case of nonadults be experienced than in the forming that acquaintance which so many actually form with the particulars of the grammars of several particular languages if these several suppositions shall be found verified it will follow that the art and science of universal grammar will present such a claim to be admitted upon the list of branches of learning as will be proof against all dispute chapter iii of the parts of speech by the name of the parts of speech are designated certain classes of words which being either indispensably necessary or universally and highly convenient to the purpose of discourse are to be found in all known languages the characters by which these several classes of words stand distinguished and from which they are denominated are taken solely from the consideration of the parts which they respectively bear in the composition of the mass of discourse termed a grammatical sentence and thence from the relation which the classes of objects respectively designated by them may be seen to bear to one another when considered in that point of view they are the same to whatsoever part of the field of thought and action the subject and adjuncts of the discourse belong of these parts the names in general use are—nounsubstantive nounadjective verb participle adverb preposition conjunction and interjection the objects respectively designated by these names are some of them single some of them aggregated consisting each of them of a cluster of words or signs the simple are   preposition   conjunction   adverb   interjection the aggregated are   nounsubstantive   nounadjective   verb   participle in those parts of speech which are aggregated may be distinguished so many subparts as there are different objects included under the same name for giving an explanation of the several parts of speech and their respective subparts that language will be the fittest to be employed which being furnished with signs for all the necessary parts and subparts is encumbered with the smallest number of superfluous ones this language will it is believed be found to be the english in giving an explanation of the several classes of words called parts of speech the most instructive not to say the only essentially instructive course will it is believed be found to be the bringing to view in the first place the classes of objects that require to be designated and thereafter and thereupon the different contrivances and as the results of those contrivances the species or classes of words which in different languages are employed in the designation of them this being the track proceeded in for the laying a foundation for grammar the art of logic or as some would say metaphysics is called in and employed the parts of speech are parts of a sentence parts actual or potential all of them of one and the same sentence to every word to whatsoever part of speech it belongs there are two distinguishable imports     viz   absolute   relative—relation being had to the relative import of the other sorts of words placed or capable of being placed in one and the same sentence the parts of speech may be divided into   significant by themselves   not significant by themselves those significant by themselves are—   nounsubstantive   nounadjective   verb unmodified†   adverb‡   interjection those not significant by themselves are—   preposition   conjunction   words indicative of mood   words indicative of time the noun and the verb are each of them a cluster of conjugates—each cluster composed of a root and branches the branches peculiar to a noun are the cases the branches peculiar to a verb are   moods   tenses   persons the branches common to nouns and verbs are numbers i e affixes expressive of the number of the subjects or objects which are in view chapter iv of the nounsubstantive section i a nounsubstantive—what the name of an entity real or fictitious real as bodies of all sorts fictitious as motions modifications of motions qualities modes or manners powers c is a nounsubstantive in every language it exhibits itself in various forms—some of them serving to give intimation of some relation of the nature of position or motion belonging to the entity others serving to represent sex as belonging or not belonging to it others to designate the number of those entities which are in question but without any other distinction in regard to number besides that between one and every greater number or at most as in the greek between one and two and any greater number section ii of case an entity be it what it may is susceptible of a multitude of relations as towards other entities when it is viewed in the character of the subject or the predicate of a proposition there is continual occasion for giving expression to those relations in so far as for the giving expression to any such relation a particular modification is given to the word by which the entity in question is designated that word is thereby said to be put into a certain case§ for the production of this effect two courses have been employed one of them consists in the inserting into the texture of the proposition a separate word appointed for that purpose this may be termed the external course or method the other consists in some change made in the letters of which the word itself of which the relation to be expressed is composed this may be termed the internal method the external course seems the most natural it seems to be that which would be the first to occur and to be employed for giving expression to the principal subject a separate term has been employed by the same reason and the same habit by which this mode of designation was suggested in this instance it seems but natural that this same mode of designation should be suggested in the other instance after having for some time been employed in company though not in union with the sign of the subject it was natural enough that insensibly the sign of the relation should come to be considered as an inseparable part of it and then be put in union with it in the case of some of the most obvious relations those which there is most frequent occasion to bring to view this expedient might serve but as the field of language came to enlarge itself the complication and embarrassment that would be produced by the giving such a multitude of modifications to the same word were the expedient applied to every relation which there would be occasion to bring to view set limits to the practice in the instance of some of these relations the internal method or course continued thus to be employed but in the instance of other relations the external method was preserved and for every such relation that had been distinguished from the rest a separate sign continued to be employed being in the order in     which the words of the sentence were arranged most commonly put immediately before one of the two words employed as the names of the entities between which the relation was represented as having place it thus acquired the name of a preposition this course could the effects of it have been generally foreseen this union would never have been generally adopted in the course of pronunciation somehow or other it happened that the termination which was regarded as suiting this or that principal word was not found suitable to this or that other principal word to one class of words one set of terminations came thus to be attached to another class of words another set of terminations—for the giving expression to one and the same idea a great variety of signs to these different sets of terminations were given the name of declensions from all these inconveniences the english language is almost if not altogether free for giving expression to these relations with only one exception it employs no other than the external mode no declensions are to be found in it from that source that abundant source of useless and troublesome complication it stands wholly free of the existence of one exception intimation has just been given this exception is that which is constituted by the mode in which expression is given to the relation of possession in the language of grammarians to the possessive or as it was first styled the genitive case but of the sign employed for this purpose such is the simplicity—a single letter s—and that on all occasions the same that not being applied in the instance of more cases or relations than this one the internal mode is not productive of any sensible inconvenience applying itself to all nounsubstantives without distinction no particle of that useless system of complication expressed by the word declension is produced by it the nominative case expresses the subject of the proposition the minor terminus the subject in which the motion commences the accusative signifies the subject in which the motion terminates it may be called the subjectexpressing case—john take the bread bread is in the subjectexpressing case the vocative† is an elliptical expression if it stand alone it is equivalent to an entire proposition including a verb in the imperative mood—ex gr john i e john come here i e john attend my will is—the cause of my speaking is a desire that john may come may attend neither of these cases signifies situation which is relation the other oblique cases signify situation either quiescent or the result of motion they consequently require separate terms i e prepositions to express the relation where the relation is not indicated by the termination in english the preposition indicative of the genitive case is of—this may be called the possessionexpressing case the dative may be called the goalexpressing case—give this loaf to mary mary is in the goalexpressing case the case expressive of the terminus ad quem the ablative may be called the startingpostexpressing case—take thomas loaf from the oven the oven is in the startingpostexpressing case the case expressive of the terminus a quo i e the thing or event from which it is desired the motion desired shall commence section iii of gender gender is the sign either of sex or the absence of it masculine and feminine of the two sexes neuter of the absence of sex when the form given to a noun is that which causes it to be said to be of the masculine gender an assertion which it expresses is that the object of which the noun is the sign is of the male sex and so in the case of the feminine gender of the female sex when it is that which causes it to be said to be of the neuter gender the assertion which it conveys is that the object of which the noun is the sign is not of either sex applied as it is to common names this modification wherever it is employed is altogether an useless one and not merely useless but replete with absurdity and pregnant with inconvenience the english language is in relation to this point a perfect model it attributes not on this occasion sex to any object that is not endowed with it by the entire name and not by any particular modification of the name it attributes sex to such objects as are really endowed with that quality in the languages of classical antiquity the greek and the latin and in most modern languages that are chiefly derived from them not to speak of others in the form of the conjugational suffixes and in that of the pronominal adjuncts one or both in speaking of the subject be it what it may a real or fictitious entity—if real a thing or person—intimation is given that it is of one or other or neither of the two sexes when true the intimation thus given is superfluous     and it is useless when not true besides being superfluous and useless it is a fertile source of confusion and indistinct and erroneous conception—in every case a blemish and a nuisance upon the conception and memory of the learner of the language it is a load and that a very burthensome one section iv of number a sign for the distinction of numbers i e of more than one from one alone is it has already been observed indispensably necessary in every instance so that the purpose be but answered the shorter the sign employed the better and here so perpetually recurring is the demand for the distinction brevity is of very particular importance a single letter attached to the word by which the object is designated when more than one of the sort is meant to be brought to view is the shortest sign that can be employed shorter than a whole word employed on purpose the instances excepted—of which the number must necessarily be small confined to the number of the vowels—in which a word consisting of no more letters than one can for such a purpose be spared here then is another point in respect of which the english language presents a model of perfection to this purpose it allots a single letter and with the exception of a very few words remains of the language in its earliest state† this one letter serves for all words of this class—on this head as on the former none of those declensions by which the greek and the latin are infested to the nounsubstantive alone and neither to the verb nor the nounadjective belongs in the nature of the case the affection or modification of plurality it is only in the case of the substantive that the attaching to the word the sign of plurality can be of any use attached to the verb or even to the adjective it is so much useless complication abel is a good boy cain and abel are good boys here the adjective when employed for giving expression to the plural number or the state the adjective is in differs not in any respect from the state it was in when employed for giving expression to the singular number in latin the adjective would in the first case be bonus in the other case boni true in the english in the case where the persons meant are more than one in the case of the verb a word is employed different from that which is employed where one and no more is meant to be brought to view but even in english some instances of superfluity in inflection may be found and this is one of them as by the nounsubstantive alone the two numbers are sufficiently distinguished in other cases so might they have been in this for distinguishing the three classes of persons denoted by we ye and they these pronouns serve of themselves the verb being in the same letters in all three cases—we love ye love they love in the singular indeed the third person is in a different form—not he love but he loves but as we suffices to distinguish the first person from the third in the plural so might i have sufficed in the singular accordingly in the subjunctive mood which in so far as it differs from the indicative is an unnecessary one love serves for the third person singular and even for the second person singular as well as for the first every proposition in which the noun is in the plural number is a complex one and as such resolvable at least in its origin into a multitude of propositions according to the number of the persons or things which occupy in it the station of subject or predicate to which soever it be that that number is attributed when the number of these objects is determinate the number of the simple propositions included in the complex one thus formed will be exactly equal to the number of these objects and so far no abstraction will necessarily have had place when the number of these objects is altogether indeterminate so of consequence must be the number of the simple propositions requisite to the constituting one equivalent to the supposed plural one take the state of things when the primeval society consists of four persons cain and abel being born to adam and eve applied to persons—they are asleep addressed by eve to adam will have for its equivalent these two simple propositions cain is asleep—abel is asleep a sister suppose is born to them—the numbers of simple propositions capable of being included in a pronounsubstantive of the first person is now increased from two to three as soon as the plural becomes indefinite abstraction is performed the idea of a class is formed an aggregate of which the individual elements are susceptible of continual change chapter v of the adjective an adjective is the name of a quality or relation     accompanied with an intimation of the existence of a subject in which it is to which it belongs of which it is a or the property celer puer a boy in whom is the quality of celerity the corresponding abstraction—denoting substantive is the name of the quality unaccompanied by any such intimation of such substantive existence though the name of the abstract fictitious entity the quality be prior in the order of tradition to the adjective name it was not probably in the order of existence bonus existed before bonitas—as its brevity imports humanus before humanitas case gender number of none of these affections of the nounsubstantive has the nounadjective any need in all these particulars its import is determined determined with perfect clearness by the connexion it has with the nounsubstantive by the connexion which the sign of a quality has with the sign of the subject in which it is meant to be represented as inhering in this particular again the english may be seen presenting a model of perfection in the english the adjective is everywhere altogether undeclinable the substantive has but two declensions two signs of modification—the sign of the genitive case in the singular number and the sign of the plural number in all cases in the adjective even these modifications are unnecessary accordingly in the english they have not either of them any place in the latin and greek languages the terminations of which the nounadjective is susceptible are determined by correspondency with the terminations which stand attached to the nounsubstantive chapter vi of pronouns pronouns are either substantive or adjective the pronounsubstantive as the name imports is but a nounsubstantive of a particular kind the pronounadjective as the name imports is but a nounadjective of a particular kind chapter vii of verbs section i a verb—what a verb is the name of a quality exhibited as momentary having place on the particular occasion in question coupled with intimations of the dependency or independency of its existence and of the several modifications of time in which its existence is represented as being placed a verb is either simple or complex there is but one simple verb and that is the verbsubstantive—the word of which the function is to designate existence as ascribed to any subject by the addition of a word expressive of absence or negation it is rendered significative of nonexistence in comparison with this every other verb may be termed complex for in the signification of it is involved the signification of some adjective in which as abovementioned is already involved the import of some quality coupled with the existence of some entity in the character of a subject in which that quality is to be found a verb whether simple or complex may be considered either with or without the several modifications of which it is susceptible—in a modified or in an unmodified state these modifications are either absolute or relative   absolute modifications are present past or future with reference to an indeterminate point of time   relative modifications being such with reference respectively to some determinate point of time considered as present past or future coupled also with the intimation of the state of existence either active or passive on the part of the subject i e the entity real or fictitious in which the quality exhibited by the verb is considered and represented as existing for the explanation of these modifications let us were it only in consideration of its simplicity begin with the simple verb—the verb substantive a verb is the sign of existence the modifications essential to a verb are those which are essential to existence considered in that limited point of view in which alone the human faculties enable us to consider it of these modifications there are two sources—  difference in respect of time and   the difference between absolute and conditional existence say rather between the case in which existence as applied to any subject is regarded by the speaker as absolute i e certain and that in which it is regarded by him as conditional i e as uncertain depending upon this or that event or state of things the existence of which is regarded as a condition to its existence†     a verb is equally capable of existing and being considered in an unmodified as in a modified state   as to those modifications of which time is the source no event or state of things can have existed but it must have existed in some portion or other of the field of time but in speaking of it as having existed it is not necessary that of the portion of time in which it is regarded as having existed any intimation shall be made   next as to those modifications of which the difference between certainty and uncertainty absoluteness and conditionality is the source by the speaker in question of the event or state of things in question though in itself either existent or nonexistent the existence may have been regarded as certain or it may have been regarded as conditional but it is not necessary that of the point of view in which in this respect it has been contemplated by him any intimation shall in his discourse have been conveyed section ii of person by persons understand the several words or parts of words which are employed in making known of which of those human beings namely a person speaking styled the first person a person spoken to styled the second person or a person spoken of styled a third person—what is said is designed to be understood in the language of grammarians persons are words representative of human beings bearing the above relations in english these relations are expressed by pronounsubstantives without inflection section iii of number the relation of number is expressed in english by pronouns without inflection except in the second person singular to which the plural is almost always substituted the plural number supposes abstraction made it implies the existence of a certain class thou and he do not compose a class we not necessarily where the persons are certain yet it frequently does we means i the speaker and some class i belongs to you ye the person spoken to and some class of persons you belongs to section iv of tenses or designations of time by the denomination of tenses are designated some words or parts of words which when added to the word expressive of the principal or say radical idea are designative of the ideas of so many distinguishable accessory modifications of relative time in which the motion or state of things is meant to be spoken of as having place in the mind of every man on every occasion time naturally divides it self into three portions—the present the past and the future† the designation of these three portions respectively is the only mode of designation that can be termed simple but whatsoever portion of time is now past was at one time present and at that time had its past and its future moreover whatsoever portion of time is now future‡ will should it ever have place be present and then like a portion of present time it will have its past and also its future as time flows on the absolute portions of time of which these names are designative are continually upon the change—at every instant different from what they are at every other of one of these portions of time all language is essentially and necessarily designative and that is the present the portion of time that has place while the discourse is going on why necessarily—answer because a thing and the only thing immediately and necessarily expressed by language is the state of mind that has place in the instance of him who is thus using it past and future manifestly and constantly are words of reference and even present may be such hence out of these three simple modes of designation arise seven compound ones—making in the whole ten   simply present—i am   simply past—past without reference i struck i did strike   simply future   present with reference to a portion of time past—i was   present with reference to a portion of time considered as future   past with reference to present time—i have been   past with reference to a portion of time past—i had been   past with reference to a portion of time considered as future—i shall have been   future with reference to a portion of time past—i was about to be i have been about to be i had been about to be  0 future with reference to a portion of   0 time considered as future—i shall be about to be but of whatsoever is considered as having place in these several portions of time respectively the existence may be considered as absolute or as conditional adding to these absolute tenses so many conditional ones we have thus twenty different designations applicable to so many differently considered portions of time whatsoever be the species of action and whatsoever be the portion of time in which by the representation given of it it is placed—if in the nature of it it was susceptible of continuance and if for the purpose for which it is brought to view it be required that such its continuance be brought to view—it is a matter of no small convenience when the structure of the language is such as admits of the bringing the fact of such continuance decidedly and distinctly to view of the existence of this feature of convenience the english language affords an exemplification of its nonexistence the french i am now walking to charing cross i was walking yesterday in the park i shall be walking tomorrow in the park many are the occasions in which the importance of an action depends on its continuance if the structure of the language admit of it the bringing to view this continuance is on an occasion of this sort frequently a great beauty—the not being able to do so a great defect the french language admits not of the giving in this manner continuance to any portion of time nor therefore in a word to any action in a translation made from that language into english the advantage thus attached to the english is apt to be overlooked and the word employed in the english being in this respect the literal translation of the french word the poverty and unexpressiveness of the french language is thus transferred into the english this designation of continuance may be applied to or withholden from any one of the abovementioned designations of time to the beforementioned twenty distinguishable designations of time adding twenty others we have thus forty for the grand total under the particular structure of the english language the future tense including its modifications as above admits of an additional modification almost if not altogether peculiar to itself in consequence of this modification it requires to be distinguished into two species—  the simply predictive future   the dominative future the simply predictive future is that which it has in common with other languages in general the dominative future is that which is peculiar or almost peculiar to it as above the future may be termed dominative where the event predicted is spoken of as being the result of the power and will of him who speaks the dominative future may be termed imperative when the event so predicted is spoken of as being an action about to be performed by a person or persons to whom the discourse is addressed in the absolute mode or form for the giving expression to these two modifications of the future tense the two words will and shall are employed with their respective conjugates but in the performance of this function they make a mutual exchange of their significations in a manner which to persons who are not perfectly familiarized to it by incessant use is to a high degree perplexing for expressing an opinion affirming the absolute futurity of the event spoken of we thus see that the english language has two auxiliary words viz will and shall   in one thing they both agree viz in that an event being by other words in the sentence brought to view they both of them are expressive of an opinion on the part of the speaker that that event will take place and that absolutely no other event or state of things having place on the existence of which in the character of a condition the event in question is dependent   another point in which they agree is that over and above the futurity of the event as above each of them to the expression of an opinion to that effect adds the expression of an opinion that when it does take effect it will have the will of the speaker for its cause the particular in which they differ is this viz the intimation thus given of the dependency of the event in question upon the will of him who speaks does not in the two cases apply to the same persons when the purpose is that this dependency should be considered as having place—if the event in question be an act to be performed by the speaker in which case the verb employed by him is in the first person will is the futuritydenoting auxiliary verb to be employed as i will read for this same purpose if the event be either a mere event or the act of a person or persons other than the speaker the futuritydenoting verb employed must be the verb shall when employed in conjunction with the sign of the first person plural viz we no such intimation is given of the six descriptions of persons in conjunction with the signs of which this verb as well as every other verb is capable of being employed viz the first second and third person in the singular number and the same in the plural number one there is viz that     indicated by the first person plural concerning which it is not possible in the nature of the case that the strength of the assurance expressed should be equal in strength to the strength of the assurance expressed by the first person singular say for example we will read for affirming my assurance of the futurity of the act in so far as it is an act of my own that is in question the first person—i will read—serves correctly and completely but if in conjunction with an act of my own i apply the same sign of futurity to the respective acts of a set of persons with whom i consider myself as associated it is impossible that in relation to the description of the persons whose will in the result is represented it should convey the same idea as that which it conveys when applied to the first person singular viz my own person alone let it be supposed that in the instance of those other persons i may so far as concerns their acts their external conduct and that at a future time be as well assured as i can be of my own still in regard to the state of their will—of their internal and secret inclinations and that too at the very moment of uttering the discourse in question—no such equal assurance is possible in the nature of the case in this case therefore the import of the word is attended with a sort of ambiguity and indeterminateness with which it is not attended in any other of the six cases with respect to any set of persons whatsoever an intimation which by the use of one of these words it is in my power to express is that in so far as concerns the act which the principal verb is employed to designate viz the act of reading their conduct is dependent upon my will but in this case the class of persons in which by my mode of speaking of them i place them must be that which in grammatical language is termed the third person plural as above that is in other words in speaking of them i must say they shall read here occurs another question supposing my design to be to represent the act or other event in question as depending upon their joint wills for an import to this effect by means of either of the two auxiliary verbs in question shall and will or by any other words does the language afford any and what phrase the answer is in the negative by the phrase they will read the import will not be conveyed by that phrase an import that is not conveyed is that their reading is regarded by me as dependent on my will but neither is any such import conveyed by it as that it will be dependent on the will of all of them together or of any one of them the event spoken of may according to the description thus given of it have alike for its cause either an act produced by a concurrent determination of their own respective wills or a state of things in the production of which no part has been brought about by the will of any one of them the imports for the expressing of which these two auxiliary futuritydenoting verbal particles afford the means are simply two   that the result which is meant to be represented as about to have place and for the designation of which the principal verb is employed is meant to be represented as dependent upon the will of him who speaks   that that same result is not meant to be represented as thus dependent in both these cases to carry into effect the intention in question viz in so far as in the nature of the case it is capable of being carried into effect through all the six persons for the designation of which language in general has furnished expressions both these auxiliary and futuritydenoting verbs are necessary but for the giving expression to these two opposite imports respectively a course that will not serve is the course which in general is the only course which for such purposes can be made to serve viz the employing in one of the two cases throughout all six persons one of these two words and in the other case the other no but for the giving expression to these two opposite meanings in the instance of each of them both these words require to be employed viz as applied to some of the six descriptions of persons the one of them as applied to others of those same six descriptions of persons the other for placing all this matter in what it is believed will be found a clear light the following two scales of phrases by one of which one of the two imports is meant to be expressed—and by the other of them the other will it is hoped be found to serve case i— case in which the event is meant to be represented by me the speaker as dependent upon my will this may be called the imperative or dominative or tyrannically predictive future singular number first person i will perish second person thou shalt perish third person he she or it shall perish plural number first person we will perish second person ye shall perish third person they shall perish  in this person the assertion expressed is not capable of being so determinate in this number as in the singular  they viz those male persons—those female persons or those things or one or all of those classes together here in the singular number the measure of power of the existence of which intimation is given is greater than in the plural it is possible to be be the power of him who speaks ever so great there exists not any person of the state of whose will he can have an assurance altogether so perfect as that of the state of his own will in both numbers when the dominative future is imperative the measure of power expressed by it is greater indeed with strict propriety it may be said to be infinitely greater than that which is expressed by the formal modification styled hitherto by grammarians the imperative mood employing the imperative mood addressing myself to any person and saying speak thou or speak all that i give intimation of is that it is my desire that he should speak employing the dominative and imperative future saying thou shalt speak besides giving intimation of the existence of a desire on my part that he should speak i moreover give intimation of a persuasion on my part that so irresistible is the influence exercised by my will on his that the fulfilment of it is an event that cannot but take place such beyond doubt will be his conduct and that conduct will have had for its cause either on his part the knowledge of my will or else my agency in some other mode case ii— case in which the event is not meant to be represented by me the speaker as dependent upon my will this may be termed the simply predictive future singular number first person i shall perish second person thou wilt perish third person he or she or it will perish plural number first person we shall perish second person ye will perish third person they will perish what remains is employing successively through all six descriptions of persons the same one of the two futuritydenoting words in question to subjoin to it on the occasion of its application to those several descriptions of persons respectively an intimation of that one of the two imports in question of which it is expressive in this case the explanation given is the same as that given in the others the only difference is that which regards the order in which the particulars are brought to view case i in which will is the word employed singular first person i will perish intimation that the event in question is dependent on the will of the speaker is in this case given second person thou shalt perish third person he she or it shall perish in neither of these cases is any such intimation as that in question given plural first person we will perish in this case a decided intimation is given that in so far as regards the fate or condition of the speaker the event is dependent on his will but in so far as regards the fate or condition of his alleged associates the intimation given is that it depends in some way or other upon their wills and his taken together but as to what part their respective wills will respectively bear in the production of the event no peremptory determination is expressed because in the nature of the case no such peremptory assurance can be entertained second person ye will perish third person they will perish in neither of these cases is intimation of the dependency of the event on the will of the speaker conveyed case ii in which shall is the word employed singular   first person i shall perish intimation not given that the event is dependent on the will of the speaker   second person thou shalt perish   third person he she or it shall perish  intimation given in these two cases that the event is dependent on the will of the speaker plural   first person we shall perish intimation not given   second person ye shall perish intimation given   third person they shall perish intimation given in a jestbook story the mode in which a foreigner is apt to make a mistake in the application of these two words is presented in a halfdisastrous halfludicrous point of view the stranger has fallen into the water and he cries out to the bystanders help help i will be drowned nobody shall save me     should and would appear at first sight as derived from and corresponding to shall and will respectively and thence to one another but this correspondence is far from being so perfect as at first sight might be expected   should has two perfectly distinct senses viz the conditional and what may be termed the moral   the conditional as if i should move i should fall   the moral or monitory as you should take heed lest you should fall here in the first clause the word should is moral monitory—importing that in the opinion of the speaker the performance of the act designated by the principal verb is the object of moral duty or obligation at any rate of prudence considered as choosing and employing means to the attainment of ends good being included under that notion   preceptive in respect of probity i e designative of what is conducive to general welfare as— in whatever you do for the furtherance of your own interest you should never be disregardful of the effect it may have on the interest of others   moral in respect of prudence abstracted from the consideration of the end aimed at consisting in the choice of means considered with reference to the probability they present of contributing to the attainment of the ends as— in whatever course you take for the furtherance of your own interest you should never appear to be regardless of the effect it may have upon the interest of others so in matters where morality is out of the question—if you wish to hit a mark you should be sure to take good aim section v of proper moods or moods properly so called the existence predicated may be either absolute or conditional i e certain or uncertain the mood employed in the giving expression to the absolute mode of predication is by the latin grammarians termed the indicative in this the action is stated as being real the mood employed in giving expression to the conditional mode is the potential† in this the action is stated as being imaginary or fictitious feigned for the purpose of discourse the absolute mood is the simple the most natural and most usually employed the conditional mood is expressed by adjuncts some belonging to verbs some being conjunctions the greek subjunctive is either indicative or potential i e absolute or conditional the following are the modes of conditionality and the modifications applied to the import of may and can by the addition of the negative not i may i may strike perhaps if i will may signifies liberty and power but coupled with uncertainty as to the question whether it will be exerted or not present libertyasserting uncertaintyasserting as applied to an event not considered as subject to human will to the will of any person in question may signifies uncertainty in regard to the fact of its taking place ii can i can c—present powerasserting—perhaps is here scarcely applicable iii might i might perhaps strike—conditional libertyasserting iv could i could perhaps strike—conditional powerasserting v would i would strike—conditional volition or desireasserting nb—would and more particularly would not have also an absolute sense when eurybiades struck themistocles would not strike i e he chose to abstain from striking vi ought to i ought to strike—moral obligationasserting present or future absolute or conditional vii must i must strike—present necessityasserting viii should i should strike—present necessityasserting with an obscure intimation of imperation low moral obligationasserting ix may not i may not strike may here imports futurity perhaps is here applicable x cannot i cannot strike can here imports present time perhaps is not here applicable the use of the categorical or absolute senses must in the order of invention have come before and served as a basis of the conditional the language of brutes is throughout absolute conditionality embracing—a prospect taken of the future through the medium of the past and present is an object to the surveying of which no eye inferior to the human is competent section vi of improper moods or moods improperly so called absoluteness and conditionality—under the name of moods these are the two modes of designation actually established by ancient use for the designation of time of the forms that occur in language these are the only two to which the term mood can with propriety be applied not but that in itself for any one thing any one term is just as applicable as any other but that after its having been applied     to this purpose to apply it to others so widely different and separate from it in that it is that the impropriety consists of these improper moods the usage of language affords two examples— one is that which by the latin and greek grammarians is so improperly termed the imperative the optative a term applied by them in certain cases to another mood would for this it will be seen have been the more proper adjunct supposing the term mood properly applied the other is a form which may be termed the causal mood in the hebrew tongue it is exemplified and is denominated hithpahel in the scottish dialect of the english language though there is no denomination for it it is exemplified in the phrase he caused make so also in french il fit faire what by the latinists is termed the imperative form seems to be improperly put upon the same line with and designated by the same name as those other forms which as above are termed moods that which it expresses is in all cases the existence of a will an act of volition to a certain effect on the part of the speaker or writer to the designation of this will the term imperative considered as applied to all the modifications of which the expression of that will is susceptible is in a remarkable degree defective and by reason of that deficiency improper improper in no fewer than three out of four cases be the case what it may such will so expressed will have for its object either some event or some state of things in speaking of this event or state of things either some person will be considered in the light of a person by whose will and consequent agency it will or would be made to take place or not if not the will expressed is of that sort which is called a wish and the mood by which expression is given to it has been termed the optative in the other case the person in consequence of whose agency it is supposed that the event or state of things in question would be made to take place is either the person to whom the discourse is addressed or some other person in this latter case likewise the mood comes under the same denomination the optative when the person by whose agency it is supposed that the event or state of things in question would be produced is a person to whom the discourse is addressed the relation borne to him in the order of power by him who speaks may either be that of a superior that of an equal or that of an inferior it is in that case alone in which the relation borne by him as above is that of a superior nor in that but when the superiority is so decided and acknowledged as to give to the expression of his wish so denoted the character and denomination of a command that the term imperative can with propriety be applied to it it is when the person by whose agency it is desired that the event or state of things in question should be produced is the almighty that the imperfection and absurdity of this denomination presents itself in a striking point of view grant us o lord hear us o lord taken in themselves and without a thought bestowed upon the grammarians by whom a common appellation has been bestowed upon these forms there is nothing to which any such idea as that of impropriety appears to attach itself but when to such a form of speech when to any form of speech addressed to a person conceived to be in such a situation any such appellation as that of imperative is applied then it is that the impropriety—and that rising to a degree of absurdity involving a virtual contradiction in terms may be seen to manifest itself beyond dispute such as it is under the restrictions above brought to view the form of speech brought to view under its trivial name the imperative mood may be termed the imperative mood all this while there exists a form of speech which though not termed imperative is not only imperative but more strongly and pointedly and forcibly imperative than that which alone hath as yet been ever styled imperative i speak of that which may be termed the imperative future a form of speech which requires to be placed in contradistinction to that other which may be termed the predictive or simply the predictive future this is the form of speech which in the english language is in some cases designated by the word shall as when a man says thou shalt or you shall go to school again tomorrow you shall go to school again tomorrow in and by these forms of speech the mode of optation properly termed imperation is plainly enough expressed but neither is it less undeniably manifest that by the latter the form in which the command is expressed is much more forcible than in the former speaking to a child of mine and using the firstmentioned of these forms all that i give him to understand is that at the time in question it is my will my desire that he should repair to the place in question of the expected efficacy of the will or desire thus notified i say nothing but if i say tomorrow you shall go to school that which i give intimation of is not only that such is my will and desire but that in my own persuasion such will be the effect of the notification made of such my will and desire so strong so irresistible the force and influence of the command so notified that upon and in consequence of the notification so made of it obedience that obedience in and by which the wish and desire will have received its accomplishment cannot but take place     in english the mood termed imperative is expressed in the singular by the simple omission or nonapposition of the pronominal sign of personal relation in the plural the expressed pronominal sign is inserted or not according as on the occasion in question it is or is not needed when inserted the pronoun is put after the verb and thus the imperative is distinguished from the indicative the imperative mood as being the expression of want and desire is probably of very early invention it is implied and involved in the use of the vocative case of the noun addressed to an individual the name being a proper one imports no abstraction as a common name does whether the article a or the be prefixed to it the subjunctive mood serves to mark the connexion given to the name of the action with a proposition indicative of the time which is the object of reference in the indication of the time of it the infinitive mood is synonymous to that verbal noun which is the name of the correspondent action and in greek is accordingly declined with the article το the variation of termination being confined to the article this is the groundwork of the whole verb section vii of voice voice has place in that case alone in which the verb being transitive the proposition of which it forms a part is complex of the instances in which we have occasion to speak of motion—in some the motion is with relation to our organs and means of observation boundless in others bounded the instance in which it is boundless is that of the celestial bodies the planet on which we live taken in its totality included in these instances we learn not where the motion had its beginning nor where nor even whether anywhere it will have an end but for the most part in the instance in which we have occasion to speak of motion the motion is bounded viewing it as it goes on we either know or have the means of learning where it actually began and of conjecturing with more or less probability of success where it will have an end of the instances in which the motion in question has or is considered as having both a known beginning and a known end in some its beginning and end are spoken of as having place in different bodies in others as having place in the same body when it is considered as having place in different bodies the verb which is employed in the designation of its commencement according to the grammarians of antiquity is said to be in the active voice the verb which is employed in the designation of its termination is said to be in the passive voice the verb at large considered independently of the action of time and conditionality and unconditionality involves in its signification that of some quality active passive or neutral coupled as in the case of the adjective with the intimation of some subject in which it is to be found in so far as the quality indicated by the verb is an active quality the verb is said to be a verb active and to be in the active voice in so far as the quality indicated by the verb is passive the verb is said to be a verb passive and to be in the passive voice the passive voice has more of complication and refinement than the active it involves the consideration and expression of causation it brings to view an effect actually produced it is therefore probably of later invention than the active section viii of the participle† the participle is an adjective it agrees with most of the parts of the verb in so much as to that signification which it has in common with the adjective it superadds the designation of some portion of time chapter viii‡ of government and concord with the ideas that belong properly to the subject—with the purely grammatical ideas—a ludicrous mixture of moral and political ideas has happened in this case to have been associated in these latter times darwin has sung the loves of the plants but ages before darwin lilly and others had sung the loves not altogether pure from the tyranny of the parts of speech here issues to view an additional mass of useless complication—mere evil unalloyed with any particle of good anarchy would everywhere be an advantageous substitute to such government—discord to such concord of the herbage of this jungle a suspicion arises that the seeds were sown by the muses once more in the structure of the english     language scarcely a trace is to be found of the tissue of useless and unamusing fictions designated by those two names chapter ix of prepositions adverbs and conjunctions section i their connexion the three parts of speech here in question viz prepositions adverbs and conjunctions require in some respects a conjoint consideration in many instances the different functions designated by these three several names are performed by one and the same word of the imports respectively belonging to them that of the preposition is most simple by the addition of some further import or imports belonging to some one or more other parts of speech the import of the preposition becomes identical with that of the adverb and in some instances at least by the addition of a still ulterior body of import the import once already augmented as above constitutes and becomes identical with that of the conjunction of these three parts of speech the explanation constitutes the obscure the transcendental the mysterious part of the art and science of universal grammar in relation to the other parts of speech the relation they bear i e which their imports respectively bear to the imports of the other parts of speech viz the substantive the adjective and the verb resembles that which by the signs employed in algebra is borne towards the signs employed in common arithmetic when the signs employed in algebraic arithmetic are all of them translated into the signs employed in common arithmetic those employed in common arithmetic being at the same time reduced to one simple uninterrupted line of numeral figures the import of the algebraic signs is completely understood and the problem for the solution of which they have been employed is solved in like manner when of a sentence of which a preposition an adverb or a conjunction makes a part the equivalent is given in a sentence in which no part of speech other than a substantive a verb and an adjective or some other substantive is employed—then and then only is the import respectively attached to these mysterious parts of speech at once clear correct and complete for bestowing upon the imports respectively attached to these several mysterious parts of speech the abovementioned desirable properties of clearness correctness and completeness the following are the logical operations which have presented themselves as requisite to be performed in relation to them—   denomination i e giving to them respectively and to each separately or to each aggregate composed of several together an appropriate name or denomination   systematization i e placing the several denominations when so constructed as above in systematic order—i e by a division made of the respective universal trunks being the names of the several genera generalissima preposition adverb conjunction performed in each instance as far as it can be pursued with advantage in the exhaustive or bifurcate mode whereby their several relations of agreement and disagreement to and with each other will be brought under the eye at one view   exemplification—i e exhibiting a proposition or sentence of the sort of those in common use in the texture of which several words belonging respectively to the abovementioned genera generalissima shall respectively be employed   paraphrasis—i e for the explanation or exposition of each such proposition or sentence exhibiting another which shall present exactly the same import but without containing in it a word belonging to the part of speech thus undertaken to be expounded as in every instance in the paraphrasis or paraphrastical proposition or sentence thus brought to view a more or less considerable number of words will be contained while the word thus requiring to be expounded is but one except in a few instances in which two are so put together as to form as it were but one on this consideration the paraphrasis may be termed the development section ii of prepositions this part of speech is employed to give intimation of the existence of some relation as having place between two or more entities real or fictitious determinate or indeterminate section iii of adverbs for giving expression to the import of the adverb a single word is in every instance sufficient observing that the sign was thus simple and looking no further than the sign the ancient grammarians and after them their worshipper hermes harris took for granted that the thought that the import of which they found it the sign was equally simple it is however a composite part of speech in the import of the adverb three distinguishable imports have been found contained—being those of the three simply significant parts of speech above brought to view viz the substantive the adjective and the preposition here i e in this place—now i e at this time—sweetly i e in a sweet manner     of these elementary imports contained in a part of speech the import of which is in this instance complex the exhibition may be termed its development upon the principal classes into which this part of speech may be distinguished this operation will be endeavoured to be performed but in the first place it will be necessary to mark out these classes section iv of conjunctions by the same immaturity of mind and want of penetration by which the grammarians greek and latin and their abovementioned worshipper were prevented from seeing into the import of the adverb they were prevented still more naturally from penetrating into the import of the conjunction in the days of those ancients the star of locke had not risen in the days of their idolater harris that star had risen but his idolatry had shut his eyes against its light a conjunction is a word by which sentences are tied together true—but of the ligament thus employed what was the nature—what the texture was it like the nounsubstantive simple expressive of one object or subject and no more than one or was it not rather complex and if complex what were the links or filaments of which it was composed examining it with the eye of a grammarian and among grammarians of an etymologist horne tooke discovered that the conjunction was always some element of the complex aggregate part of speech a verb capital indeed and highly instructive was the discovery but at that point it rested but of those small words consisting several of them each but of one syllable what is the import is the import as simple as the word thus employed as the sign of it to answer or so much as to ask the question may perhaps be regarded as belonging to the province rather of the logician than the grammarian and into the field of logic scarcely did horne tooke ingenious as he was ever attempt to introduce his sickle of the adverb it has been seen that the import is complex having a number of elementary imports not fewer than three but of the simplest species of conjunction the import of the adverb includes no more than a part of conjunctions in addition to that of adverbs the development will now be attempted† but first in this case as in that it will be necessary to bestow upon them an arrangement the demand for this part of speech being the same in every language so far as concerns import this arrangement and this development will serve for every language chapter x of interjections interjections have the import of entire propositions they may be considered as fragments of the original language—they are to the human animal what the different species of sounds emitted by other animals are to them respectively—ex gr the mewing the purring the growling the spitting of the cat interjections may be termed the unconstructural parts of speech—the others the constructural in the interjections may be seen so many remains of the original language common to man and the brute creation—the language which was in use before the parts of speech were formed by the decomposition and recomposition of propositions every interjection may be considered as the equivalent of some preposition as alas i e i am grieved—i experienced a sensation of mental pain hurra—i rejoice i experience a sensation of mental pleasure         tracts on poor laws and pauper management by jeremy bentham now for the first time collected note by the editor on the tracts on poor laws the following tracts which have all been previously printed though the last in order is now for the first time published bear internal evidence that they are only a portion of what the author has written on the subject of the poor laws he left behind him indeed a considerable number of unpublished mss on the subject which on some future occasion may see the light from the annals of agriculture it does not appear how far the queries there promulgated from the answers to which the author intended to fill up the outline of his great work on pauper management were responded to in vol xxix of the annals p     the editor makes an earnest appeal to his readers on the subject and expresses a hope that the country gentlemen and resident clergy who can with so much ease satisfy many if not all of his benthams inquiries will take the small trouble of sending him the particulars he requests for the parish at least in which they reside but it is probable that few of the persons able to supply the requisite information comprehended his enlightened views and he seems not to have met with sufficient encouragement to induce him even to complete his outline it has been the practice of the editor on the occasion of the state of the law as it existed when the author wrote being animadverted on in the text to mention in a note any changes that may have since taken place by statutory or other authority in the present instance however the vastness of the alterations which have been made in the administration of the poor law and especially in relation to the features chiefly noticed in these tracts rendered it impossible to accomplish this object without introducing more extensive notes than readers who have so many other means of being acquainted with the subject would have felt of service the chief administration is in the plan proposed by bentham in hands quite distinct from those in which it has been placed by the poor law amendment act but the two systems agree in the principle of centralization in the minutiæ of the plan so far as they are indicated in the ensuing outline the reader will find many arrangements identical with those of which the practical experiments on which the new poor law is based have led to the adoption while many of the practical abuses attacked by the author such as the system of settlement the facilities for obtaining relief without submitting to labour c have been duly acknowledged and rectified but perhaps the most remarkable illustrations of the authors practical segacity are to be found in his anticipations of the civilizing benefits of such alterations as he suggests benefits which may have then appeared as the wildest utopianism but which have of late been on so large a scale practically and speedily realized a comparison of the effects which the author expects to arise from his plans of juvenile training and apprenticeship may be viewed as a text of which the report on the training of pauper children presented in the year      to the secretary of state by the poor law commissioners may be considered as forming a series of practical illustrations   0     situation and relief of the poor by jeremy bentham esq addressed to the editor of the annals of agriculture queens square place westminster  th september      dear sir—it was but tother day that i became master of a complete series of your annals—accept my confession and record my penitence having on my return from my long peregrination on the continent lent to a friend—who had lent to another friend whom we neither of us could recollect—the twentyfive or thirty numbers which i had taken in before that period i postponed from time to time the completion of the series in hopes of recovering the commencement of it when at last shame and necessity got the better of procrastination what a treasure of information burst upon me—no—so long as power without—and without—shall have left an annual guinea in my pocket blanks are better here than words not a number of the annals shall ever be wanting to my shelves—hold—dont take me for a jacobin now nor even for a croaker—what i allude to is not any common burden—such as you landowners and landholders grunt under—but my own ten thousand pound tax—my privilegium—a thing as new to english language as it is to english practice—sole and peculiar fruit of the very particular notice with which i have been honoured by —— this waits upon you with a proof of a blank pauper population table being a table framed for the purpose of collecting an account of the pauper population in as many parishes c as i may be able to obtain it from knowing so well your zeal for all zealworthy objects and mindful of your often experienced kindness i cannot on this occasion harbour a doubt of your assistance but in what shape will it be most convenient and eligible for you to give it me will you reprint the heads alone upon the plan of common letterpress and without the form of a table or will you accept of an impression of the same number as that of the annals for the purpose of annexing a copy to each copy of your next number this latter expedient should it meet with your approbation would lessen in a considerable degree the trouble to any such gentleman as may be disposed to favour me with their contributions is it worth while to give the table this indiscriminate kind of circulation at any rate your editorial majesty will i hope be pleased graciously to grant unto me your royal letters—patent or close or both addressed to all—and if need be—singular your loving subjects my fellowcorrespondents—charging and exhorting them each in his parish—and as many other parishes as may be—to fill my tables and send in their contributions along with the table you will find a ms paper exhibiting the importance of the information i am thus labouring to collect you will print it in your annals or suppress it as you think best the danger is lest there should be some who though they might otherwise have been disposed to furnish the information desired may perhaps shrink back at the idea of the applications that might be made of it to the economy of the parishes in the management of which they may respectively happen to be concerned a gentleman who bears a principal part in the management of one of the great london parishes had with more than ordinary alacrity consented to a general request of information i sent him a pair of tables and though this account of the use was not with them he returned them with an excuse i also send in ms a table of cases calling for relief—a general map of pauperland with all the roads to it few if any of the projects i have seen but what have appeared the archproject not excepted to bear an exclusive—at least a predilective—reference to some of these cases overlooking or slighting the rest i send it in the state in which i propose printing it for my own book but in the meantime if it be worth the honour of a place in the annals it is altogether at your service this preparatory insertion will turn to the advantage of the work itself if any of your correspondents not forgetting their editor would have the goodness to contribute their remarks to the emendation of it you will not easily conceive—few heads at least but yours are qualified to conceive—the labour it has cost me to bring the two tables to this state as to the work at large it will occupy two independent though connected volumes pauper systems compared—pauper management     improved—the last the romance the utopia to which i had once occasion to allude—romance—how should it be anything less—i mean to an authors partial eyes in proportion as a thing is excellent when established is it anything but romance and theory and speculation till the touch of the seal or the sceptre has converted it into practice—distress at least—distress the very life and soul of romance cannot be denied to mine for in this short and closepacked specimen already you behold it in all its shapes—magnanimous president—accomplished secretary—ye too have your romance—heaven send you a happy catastrophe and the fettered lands a happy deliverance—patience patience—ye too before you are comforted must bear to be tormented apropos of presidents—the high priest of ceres having divined or not divined my recent occupations has been pleased to send me a mandate in form summoning me to devote myself to this branch of his goddesss service that the fruits of my labours may be consecrated in her temple at whitehall—so that whatever other requisites may fail me i shall be in no want of auspices continue yours to me—and believe me with the most serious respect ever yours jeremy bentham arthur young esq c c c observations on the pauper population table hereunto annexed showing the novelty as well as use and importance of the information that would be afforded by a set of tables one or two from every parish or other pauper district filled up upon the plan of the blank table here exhibited the stock of information here in question constitutes what will be found to be an indispensable groundwork to every welldigested plan of provision that can be framed in relation to the poor for some of the classes a peculiar mode of provision is requisite different as between class and class as in the case of infants lunatics idiots the deaf and dumb and the blind the rate of neat expense per head as between class and class is also susceptible of a very extensive scale of variation the quantum and value of return actual or possible in the way of labour by the produce of such labour is again susceptible of a scale prodigiously more extensive  st to consider the variation where infirmity whether of mind or body is the constituent character of the class in the case of lunatics for example the average rate of expense per head is probably double at least to what it is in the case of a person of sound mind and of the same age able or not able to work profit by labour of course nothing—yet in a set of appropriate establishments set apart for the reception of persons of this class not only might the expense per head be reduced to the ordinary level but in many instances a quantity of profit might it is supposed be extracted from their labour to the advantage of the individual himself in the way of medical relief or even cure no less than of the public in the way of economy an observation which as far as economy is concerned applies in a greater or less extent to the other classes above exemplified viz idiots the deaf and dumb and the blind to which may be added the various sorts of cripples so again where the variation in point of neat expense has no other cause than the difference between age and age in the case of a fullgrown person capable or not capable of work to take the male sex for instance the amount of necessary expense everything included may when compared to the case of a child of three or four years old rise perhaps to twice as much while on the other hand in the case of an individual of the same sex possessing an ordinary degree of ability in regard to work and full grown whether arrived or not at what is properly termed the age of manhood the capacity of affording in the shape of labour a return for the expense i speak of mere natural capacity may be from sixteen to twenty times as great as in the child even supposing the child to stand already upon the working list and to be earning every day a sum worth taking into the account and therefore when compared with a child not yet set to work the capacity of the man or fullgrown boy may be as sixteen or twenty to nothing between these two extremes in the scale of profit and loss there will be a series of perceptible gradations at least as many as there are between year and year of age insomuch that although the total number of a parish stock of pauper boys were known no tolerable calculation could be made of the quantum of     profit or loss capable of being derived or likely to accrue from that stock unless the proportions in which that number is divided betwixt the different ages were known not less than a year being taken for the interval between age and age simple and incontestable as these truths when once pointed out may appear so imperfect are the advances as yet made in the arts of management and bookkeeping in this line that in no instance that has yet been made public has any complete statement been ever given in the accounts of any house of industry or other poorhouse of the different varieties of condition in respect of infirmity birth parentage c as expressed in this table and in regard to age the distinctions made have seldom gone beyond those between men and women on the one hand boys and girls on the other or if anything has been said of age the distinctions have been so few that little if any additional information has been to be collected from that source distinctions thus loose will be apt to mislead rather than to inform individuals between whom there shall exist no difference at all in respect either of profit or loss are thus ranked under different classes while individuals between whom the difference in respect of profit and loss stands at the very highest pitch as   or  0 to   or as   or  0 to 0 are ranked under the same class a boy of twenty shall earn quite as much as well as consume as much as a man of twentyone the same boy shall consume twice as much as another boy the boy of three or four years old for example at the same time that while he is costing twice as much he might on the other hand be made to earn from sixteen to twenty times as much the earnings of the boy of twenty years old rising as high as eight or ten shillings a week while for the boy of three or four years old if he earns anything sixpence may be full pay true it is that where as above supposed there happens to be profit as well as loss earnings as well as maintenance so that the account has two sides whatever error there may be on the side of loss will operate as far as it goes in compensation of the error on the side of profit but where the capacity of yielding profitable labour is wanting as in many individuals in each parish or not improved into act so that there is nothing on the profit side of the account as in most parishes whatever error results in regard to the expense of maintenance stands single and uncompensated and on the other hand where there is something on the profit side of the account the error may instead of two hundred per cent as in the other case rise as high as eight hundred or a thousand per cent such being the difference in point of value as betwixt boy and boy laying aside for shortness sake men women and girls observe the difference that may result in the boy account as between parish and parish take two parishes bigham and littleton—numbers of every class the same in the one as in the other not to have recourse to any such extraordinary supposition as that at littleton they shall be all of them below what if the expression be allowable may be termed the workable age and therefore yielding no earnings at all—at bigham all of them at the age of highest earnings let us suppose that at littleton those below the workable age and those above it being put together the capacity of affording profitable labour is upon the whole stock together the same as if the whole was at the lowest workable age while at bigham that capacity is upon the same footing as if the whole stock were at the age of half earnings viz the age at which instead of earning from  s to  0s as before a boy might be made to earn from  s to  s all this being supposed observe the errors it is likely to give birth to as well in regard to the quantity of natural strength as in regard to the goodness of the management as between house and house the number of boys being the same in the one as in the other if in bigham the sum of the earnings were from four to five times as great as in littleton ages being by the supposition unknown the management under this head would naturally appear four or five times as good whereas in fact it is not above half as good for had it been equally good the actual earnings would have been as the capacity for yielding earnings whereas they are but half as great in the pecuniary value positive or negative of the individual there is another ingredient in respect of which this lumning distinction between men and boys affords no sort of light nor will any division of less minuteness than that into years of age be sufficient to the purpose the value of a child in this point of view will depend not only upon the present value positive or negative but upon the quantity of negative value past and the quantity of positive value yet to come suppose fourteen years the age at which boys go off in both places and let the total pecuniary value of the stock of hands take it either in regard to actual     earnings or in regard to the capacity for yielding earnings be equal in both places yet for a period of six or eight years the difference may be prodigious at bigham the positive part of the value may be derived—the earnings obtained—from a set of boys who wanting but a few weeks or days of fourteen years of age are on the point of going off the rest being composed of boys below or little above the commencement of the workable age this elder part of the stock being gone the value may sink to little or nothing and so remain even for years while in littleton the same value shall be afforded by a stock of boys of no more than seven or eight years old whose value will for six or seven years to come be every year on the increase averages it may be said may be taken—yes so they may with the benefit of proper data but those data are wanting here when a series is given composed of terms having a common difference—a first and last term consequently given—the middle term gives the average here the lowest term is given it is true it is the day of birth—number of years 0 in all places but the highest term the highest age up to which a boy sound in mind and body stays upon the parish is not given what this highest age is in general we do not know it is as high again in some parishes as in others and averages will not do here in one parish children shall go off at eight seven and six years old in another not till fourteen fifteen or even sixteen years old we know in general that the differences in this respect are very great but what they amount to we do not know to suppose—first a lowest term—then a highest term—then an equal number of each—or a regular series from the one to the other—and so strike an average would be altogether a random shot these it may be said are extreme cases and not likely to have place anywhere—admitted nor are they given but as extreme cases they are given as the utmost limit to which error can extend itself but below this improbable degree of aberration how many other yet still high degrees are there that are probable—a difference—an error to the amount of cent per cent can scarcely be stated as improbable but what would be the fate of that mercantile adventure in which as much capital again as was necessary had been expended or not above half as much as was necessary had been provided or which in return for that advance had reckoned upon twice as much labour as the establishment had afterwards been found capable of affording and this for many successive years for my own part i must confess i am unable to conceive how any plan of general economy in this line can rationally be attempted without something like an estimate of the mouths to be fed as well as of the hands to work with to give an idea of one general application which i propose to make of whatever information i might be fortunate enough to obtain i will subjoin a sketch of a table i have been attempting to frame and which for shortness might be styled the nonadult value table as to the particular uses that might be derived in practice from the information thus particularized the case of lunatics and other infirm classes has already afforded one example among infants the destitute class comprehending bastards orphans foundlings and deserted children may afford another of these no inconsiderable share of the whole pauper population would be found to be composed upon an average taken from the pauper population of a considerable number of parishes bastards alone composed about a ninth under a certain age none of the individuals thus denominated being capable of any special attachment to person or to place nor any other individual being likely to possess any very special attachment with regard to them this absence of natural connexion might afford room for transferring them without hardship and in any numbers to any proper situation or situations if the state of the laws were such as to admit of such an arrangement and the interest of the public in point of economy or any other head of advantage with reference either to the public or to the children themselves were to demand it during the age of sheer expense for example transference to a situation where the expense of maintenance is at the lowest at the age of ability or commencing ability with regard to labour transference to situations where the demand for labour is at the highest thus much for illustration and for illustration merely to exhibit this or that arrangement as a proper one would be to insert into a petition for materials the work itself for the construction of which they are desired advantages crowd in on one side objections on the other but this is not a place for striking the balance were the several other classes to receive each of them a separate consideration in this view many other proofs would appear of the importance of the information sought for by these tables but the subject could not be thus exhausted without plunging into the details of the particular plan for the purpose of which these tables were contrived as it is two points appear sufficiently established   one is that whether quality or quantity of the demand in the way of supply for maintenance—or prospect of return in the way of labour—or quality or quantity of the demand in respect of the stock of requisites for the extraction and application of that labour—be considered no wellgrounded plan of provision in relation to the pauper community can be framed without the stock of information sought for by these tables n table of cases calling for relief n b the several distinctions exhibited in this table were collected with a view to their being respectively rendered subservient to one or more of the three practical subjects of consideration following viz   the nature and degree of prevalence of each efficient cause of indigence the degree being measured by the number absolute and comparative of the individuals reduced to indigence by such efficient cause—  the cause degree and duration of the inability in respect to work—  the mode and degree of relief or prevention practised or practicable adequate or inadequate eligible or ineligible—☞ a plan of provision in relation to the burthensome part of the poor will if complete embrace all these cases the demand for relief is constituted by indigence—which may be the result of i personal or internal causes—viz i perpetual—viz i infirmity of mind viz in the case of i insane hands a   i idiots      absolute idiots—     persons foolish or weak in mind b—   ii lunatics      — flighty—     — wantonly mischievous—     — maliciously mischievous—     — raving—     — melancholy observations a hands n b the word hands is chosen as bearing reference to employment serving thereby to point the attention to the consideration of the employments to which the persons thus characterized may respectively be competent or incompetent b foolish c viz to such a degree as to be unfit to be trusted with the management of their own affairs c class iii italics are employed principally for the purpose of pointing the attention to the efficient cause of indigence in addition to the intimation of it conveyed in many instances by the name of the class d classes xi to xx all these classes might be comprised under some still more general appellation such as that of employmentlacking hands these general denominations though many of them new and more or less uncouth will it is hoped be tolerated in consideration of the very important practical advantages derivable from the use of them—the very name of the patient expressing the cause of the disorder and affording a sort of direction to the remedy e class xi the character of the pauper and thence the nature of the employment he is fit for depending so much upon the question whether in his instance the efficient cause of indigence was or was not accompanied with blame—the care taken to point the attention of the reader without intermission to this important circumstance—will it is hoped not be looked upon as illbestowed one practical inference is—that every plan of provision which regards the indigent in the lump either as virtuous or as vicious—either as objects of pure compassion or as objects of pure coercion or pure neglect—must be fatally erroneous f classes xiv xv and xvi may be comprised under the more general denomination of the dangerous classes—classes xvii and xviii under that of the disreputable classes in the case of the dangerous classes the demand for relief

considerable and various enough to be considered as affording an adequate sample of the pauper population comprised within the territorial authority of the poor laws numbers i infer from expense total numbers of the whole pauper population that would be to be provided for from the known totals of past expense compared with expense per head as far as it can be ascertained then say—as the total of the pauper population in any set of pauper districts according to the tables when filled up for those districts is to the total of pauper population in the whole number of such districts in south britain so are the numbers of the several classes in the same parts of the country taken together to the numbers of the same classes in the whole observations on the table of cases calling for relief hereto annexed pauperpopulationtable—table of cases calling for relief why make two tables—why not give the matter of both in one answer—the pauperpopulationtable being contrived for a particular purpose—that of collecting information—such classes and such only were inserted in it as afforded a hope that the numbers of each might be found capable of being collected a minute investigation of the difference between two tables framed for different purposes would be of little use the general account of the matter is this the classes of which the respective numbers are here inquired after the classes comprised in the pauperpopulationtable compose what may be considered as the permanent stock of pauper hands in the table of cases calling for relief are designed to be comprised every class and every individual that can ever enter into the composition of the general mass—the comingandgoing stock as well as the permanent—the ablebodied as well as the infirm—those who under the existing order of things come in but for casual relief as well as those who under the system of communitymaintenance are constantly in the house and those who under the system of homemaintenance are constantly upon the list of pensioners a single glance at the table of cases calling for relief will be enough to show that among the classes there exhibited there are more than one of the respective numbers of which no general returns could reasonably be expected such are all the degraded classes those whose condition shuns the light reputed thieves and other depredators—deserters—beggars—prostitutes to state the particular use the contemplation of which gave birth to each distinction would be to state the particular plan of provision in contemplation for each class—to state the particular plan of provision in contemplation for each class would be to give the entire work of which this paper is but an offset thus much however may be observed that of all the classes there distinguished there is not one the circumstances of which have not in the framing of the plan of provision been specially taken into account outline of the nonadult value table contrived for the purpose of exhibiting whenever the requisite data can be obtained the pecuniary value negative or positive of the service of a pauper or other individual i e expenses and returns by labour on account of such individual at

value negative column   expense of diet column   ditto clothing—materials column   ditto ditto making column   ditto ditto washing and mending column   individuals share in the common and indivisible expenses of the establishment column   totals of expense to be provided for before hand during and for the several halfyears commencing on the several days column   totals of expense from birth up to

years positive if at all not till after a number of years column    balance of expenses and returns from birth up to the ends of the several halfyears commencing on the several days giving at first a negative value then perhaps a positive value as before column    present clear value of the service of a pauper or other hand on the supposition of its being to be performed during the several halfyears of age commencing on the several days—value at first negative then positive as before by present is meant on the day of the commencement of the term viz  st jan   00 supposing the future profit or loss were to be contracted for on that day column    present clear value of the whole period of service up to the ends of the several halfyears commencing on the several days v rate of mortality assumed from a standard table column    number of influents into the respective halfyears of age—number of influents into age stated for the purpose of calculation at  000 or  0000 column    number of decrementalists effluents by death dying according to the standardtable in the course of the several halfyears of age column    number of remanents at the ends of the several halfyears of age vi balances after allowance for death and sickness column    present value deduced from the above standardtable of the halfyears service of a pauper taken at the several ages and supposed to accrue at the end of the several halfyears commencing on the several days—allowance made for the chance of death according to the foregoing standardtable column  0 present value of the whole period of

sickness as before column    values at the several successive ages of the whole of the period of service remaining at these respective ages—allowance made for death and sickness as before tables upon this plan one for each sex had actually been constructed under my direction the numbers of the different ages being taken from the censuses reported as above by sir frederick eden and the rate of mortality taken from dr halleys breslaw table which on account of the roundness of the assumed number of influents  000 seemed most convenient for the purpose but on examination the census taken from sir frederick eden being found inapplicable to this purpose and dr halleys table being found to labour under a very material error not noticed by dr price or any other of the many mathematicians who have made use of it all the calculations that had been grounded on either of these bases have been given up and it is to supply the deficiencies thus left that the information described in the blank pauperpopulationtable is desired the value i take from the value of an adult employed at daywork on the lowest paid species of work agricultural on an average of the whole of south britain supposing the value to rise up to that pitch by equal gradations commencing at the earliest workable age to get at the average in question i am ransacking or causing to be ransacked all the books i can lay hands on in particular the agricultural reports your science were i fortunate enough to have it within reach might abridge the labour as well as secure the ground you will recollect my question to which you were kind enough to send me an answer about the maximum of earnings in a gradation formed by age what say you to this idea of forming a valuation     of that part of the national live stock which has no feathers to it and walks upon two legs is it new or old—if old can you tell me where it is to be found i do not mean in the head of what west indian but in the tables of what mathematician or statisticalist for strange it would be if the term value had less propriety when applied to the labour of the freeman than to that of the slave is an average child at his birth—supposing him certain of not living beyond the age of oneandtwenty years complete—worth more or less than nothing to those himself of the number who during that period of legal as well as natural subjection have the benefit of his capacity for labour at command if more than nothing at what age does he become so whether worth more or less than nothing can he by any and what means be made worth more if worth more than nothing how comes it that in an oldplanted country such as england whatever may be the case in a new planted one such as america a child is in every class without exception regarded as a burden i mean always in the pecuniary sense to its parents this deficiency in point of value is it necessary and irremediable or accidental and remediable is it absolute or relative only i mean with relation to the parents or partly absolute and partly relative in other words is it that a child has not by the end of the period in question produced so much as he has consumed or that though what he has produced be in itself considerably more than what he has consumed yet with reference to his parents it is less on account of their having expended more of what he has consumed than they have received of what he has produced in proposing to you these questions i give you a clue which if it be worth following will lead you to one of the main pillars of my plan—an enigma which you and if you please your correspondents may amuse yourselves with instead of a rebus or a mathematical problem from the ladies diary my scale you will observe extends no farther than from the bottom to the summit of the hill of life not that either the tableland at the top or the descent on the other side are undeserving of mensuration but they do not lie within my present department except the narrow slip at the very bottom which belongs to pauperland amongst the different plans in relation to the poor you lean i observe to that of mr ruggles that being the case i flatter myself with the pleasure of seeing you and your intelligent friend on my side his plan is mine—add only certain sources of profit—certain sources of saving—certain means of obtaining capital—not from the unwilling but the willing—certain securities for good management—and certain other et cæteras in which the welfare of the pauper community is not forgotten and which i hope you will both approve of some prefer homeprovision in toto but this will not do for those who have no home in particular not for the destitute classes of children for which see the table others prefer working without boarding or lodging or working and boarding without lodging to working boarding and lodging but this again will not do for those sons of indigence who have not where to lay their heads—look once more at the table some are for doing everything by savings out of earnings but this will not do very well where there can be no savings still less where there can be no earnings—another glance if you please at the table—bating these cases the recipe is good for the provident unfortunately the bulk of labouring hands especially the highpaid ones is composed of the improvident providence may by proper facilities for encouragement is scarcely necessary be rendered more general but man must be new made before it can be made universal some think they annihilate the burden when from shoulders that cannot but be able to bear it they shift it upon shoulders that may or may not be able to bear it from shoulders more able to shoulders less able or from shoulders that are used to it to shoulders that are not used to it or when instead of rate they write subscription—like the old statute which to reconcile the farmer to a set of officers who plundered him under the name of purveyors ordered them to be called caterers if this does with poorrates try it upon tithes and call them offerings one gentleman for whose probity of intention i would be security though i have not the honour of his acquaintance takes the burden from the shoulders of the man of property and lays it upon those of the man of hardpressed industry who unable to find subsistence among his friends and neighbours is driven to hunt for it among strangers an improvement this at any rate upon the existing laws since a tax so long as it is paid is less heavy than a prohibition in some such ways as these we begin all of us and if we did not begin a little at random how would anything ever be done come my oedipus here is another riddle for you solve it or by apollo—you remember the penalty for not solving riddles—rates are encroaching things you as well as another illustrious friend of mine are i think for limiting them—limit them—agreed—but how—not by a prohibitory act—a remedy which would neither be applied nor if applied be effectual—not by a dead letter but by a living body a body which to stay the plague would like phineas throw itself into the gap yet not like curtius be swallowed up in it when i speak of limitation do not suppose that limitation would content me my reverend friend hurried away by the torrent of his own eloquence drove beyond you and let drop something about a spunge i too have my     spunge but that a slow one and not quite so rough a one mine goes i promise you into the fire the instant you can show me that a single particle of necessity is deprived by it of relief one thing we shall not differ about—the priority due to agriculture and the necessary nonproductiveness of every system of pauperemployment in which manufactures come in on any other footing than a supplemental one to take off such part of the strength of an establishment and such part of the time as cannot be employed in producing food for it one thing i thank him for—i should have said mr ruggles—the confirming by his professional science a hope fondly nourished by my ignorance that under such a system of management as if not already exemplified anywhere might be framed at least for the purpose employment might be found even in agriculture for almost every species of infirmity—for almost every modification of refuse labour stationary force being found by inanimate ambulatory by animated nature how very little strength and even how very little practice is necessary in a guide—and even supposing—what is not the case—there were nothing but girls for the plough would not even a girl be better employed now and then at the plough than spinning her health away and earning twopence but away with party—away with exaggeration—neither clothing nor lodging any more than food can be excluded from the catalogue of necessaries in the principle of selfsupply behold another of my sheetanchors and that after giving twothirds to agriculture leaves one for manufactures the principle of selfsupply—what say you to it—does the term explain itself—does the idea recommend itself—quit that—especially such part of it as looks to agriculture—and i divide your poorhouses for you—call them what you please—houses of industry—schools of industry—into two parcels—one the illmanaged employed in ruining themselves the other the wellmanaged in ruining their neighbours—assertions are not proofs but announce the theorem—and another time if it can be necessary you shall have the demonstration this you will say to yourself is a sad farrago—but your miscellany how superior soever to others in subjectmatter and contents has this in common with them—that halfformed ideas—so they have but matter in them—are not prohibited from presenting themselves it is part of the character of your correspondents to have more of substance about them than of form and of the many recommendations which join in drawing so much good company to your conversatione one nor that the least is the convenience of being admitted to it in boots mine you will say have hobnails in them for somehow or other the very idea of the person to whom i am addressing myself has insensibly betrayed me into that sort of playful confidence—that épanchement as i think the french call it—which i have always felt in his company the opportunity of laying plans before a sort of open committee in an unripened state and for the purpose of getting help for ripening them before they have yet received the form they are to wear when presented at the bar of the public by which they are to be tried is a serious advantage and as such if you afford me any encouragement i am not likely to be sparing in availing myself of it ps—for your next number or next but one i dont know but i may trouble you with a compressed sketch of my two abovementioned works or one of them—something between the work at large and a mere table of contents imperfect it cannot but be were it only for want of

between house and house  0⅔ miles viz the side of the square of which four contiguous houses occupy the angles distance of the remotest part of each industryhouse district from the house upon the supposition of an exact equality of distribution  ½ miles being the semidiameter of a circle circumscribing that square—distances upon the supposition of two hundred and fifty houses miles fifteen and  0⅝ reasons of the above arrangement—the larger the houses the fewer and the fewer the farther asunder but the fewer the better especially on the score of expense for the company partly on account of there being the fewer partly as will be seen on account of there being the larger the more however the better for the paupers and others resorting to the houses partly because the distance is less between house and house partly because it is the less between each house and that part of the country which is at the greatest distance from any house the number of the houses being given the more

abovementioned all the above points provided for and the principal of them to a degree of absolute perfection by a plan of architecture governed by a new and simple principle—the central inspection principle general form circular or for cheapness circularly poligonal—say in twelve sides or cants each constituting a division of the building each division divided in height into five stories viz two long or whole floors alternating with two short or narrow floors and a gallery above divided into six stages rising one above another—ward the name of an occasional division adjusted in its dimensions to the population of the class to which it is allotted the governed the paupers of all ages and classes occupying the several divisions at the circumference the governors the officers the central part termed the lodge or inspection lodge see the plate annexed any part capable of being withdrawn from inspection at any time for comfort decency c by circumferential screens parallel to the outer front of the division and up to the height to which it reaches closing the inner front at the time of divine service a stage on which are placed the pulpit readingdesk clerks desk and communion table lets down through the ceiling upon the floor of the lodge balanced by counterpoises all round a moderate force is sufficient to raise or lower it the under surface of the stage in form of a flattish dome constitutes as far as it extends the ceiling of the lodge the descent of this dome discloses a set of circular seats above serving as a gallery for chapel visiters the pauper congregation are ranged at the inner front of their several divisions on a set of forms backed by the circumferential screens which keep the implements of work out of sight an interval of two feet all round above the top of the circumferential screens serves for the admission of the light means of ventilation   between the lodge and the divisions all round an annular well covered by an opening skylight and clear from top to bottom except in as far as occupied by the staircase and the two stories of landingplace or gallery all round for communication between the staircase and the several divisions this well will maintain a draught of air from the several stories of windows all round five in number whenever they are open as a chimney does from a door   chains of ventilation tubes running from the bottom to the top of each division—conceive a square tube like that used for conducting rain water from the top to the bottom of a house running through the building at bottom piercing the floor of the lowest level or ground story at top piercing the roof on the ground story conceive a few inches of this tube cut away from the ceiling downward this discontinuance will give room for that part of the air injured by respiration which being the lightest tends to occupy the top of the room viz the azote to escape through the ceiling at the part where the tube recommences and the height at which the tube opens being so much above the height of a man standing in the room will not incommode any of the inhabitants by the blast an equal part and no more is cut away in like manner in the room immediately above where for the reason just given the foul air issuing from the room below will not be breathed over again by the inhabitants of the upper room not being discharged into it but at a height considerably above that of their mouths another chain the converse of the above for carrying off the heavy part of the foul air viz the carbonic acid the interruptions being in this case towards the floor instead of being towards the ceiling as in the former case one division allotted for officers private apartments is exhibited in the draught five whole floors as in an ordinary house out of the interior part of it is taken the only staircase out of the annular well the galleries forming the communication between the apartments and the staircase in the central part the lowest floor a little lower than in the circumferential for the sake of getting two floors of storeroom under the lodge the height of the central lodge being according to the plan fourteen feet and capable of being increased a gallery not exhibited in the draught extending all round to a breadth     limited by the circumference of the dome would on week days afford a commodious station for any number of clerks and on sundays would add to the accommodation of chapel visiters should any deficiency of light be perceived in the lodge a supply might be obtained by lining the interior boundary of the gallery on the outside here and there with pieces of lookingglass by which the light coming through the windows of the upper or gallery floor of the divisions all around might be reflected down into such parts of the lodge as it would not otherwise reach and by the same means some parts of the upper floor or gallery all around might be rendered visible to some parts of the lodge to which they would not present any direct view—means whereby the lodge notwithstanding the centrality of its situation might at all times be subjected to any degree of ventilation that would be required—two hollow trunks leading from the outside of the building through the radial passage one on each side the doorway forming each of them at its surface a seat skirting the passage the whole of its length entering the lodge one on each side of the door they terminate each in a hollow pilaster from this pilaster the air may be discharged either at a height approaching that of the ceiling as in the chain of ventilationtubes for the apartments in the circumference or at any lesser elevation by means of apertures opening or closing at pleasure continued up through the chapelvisiters gallery they would afford ventilation to that part in general a sufficient current would be kept up by difference of temperature but in a hot season and a stagnant atmosphere the current might be accelerated or produced by the action of any one of a variety of machines too well known to need any description here the same room for all purposes—work meal and sleep lodging is thus afforded with scarce any addition to the expense—accommodation for sleeping—i single bedplaces i e places for single persons of all ages from about six years old upwards see the plate—a range of bedstages or frames in a line running along each of the sidewalls of each room as shown in the ground plan the head towards the wall each bedstage six feet in width and from six feet and a half to five feet and a half in length the longest where the room is broadest some holding three persons others four with a partition between every two persons height at the head the width of two boards a little less than two feet sloping down to the breadth of one board at the feet a little less than one foot room in width for each person—in a stage holding three twentyfour inches—in a stage holding four eighteen inches seamen have but fourteen each bedstage being furnished as in the plate with a counterpoise at two or each of the four corners might draw up to the ceiling in the daytime to leave the space below clear but if reversed it would form a table for working at or any other purpose the extradepth which would be in the way of the knees being got rid of by doubling up on hinges by means of a few cords remaining constantly attached the beds and bedding would pack up within the frame the stand composed of two horses crossing one another and turning round a common upright the horizontal section of it being represented by an x would be nearly flat when the legs of x were brought close for the purpose of stowing the stand away at bedtime when not thus employed the partitions furnished with proper stands might form each of them a bench to sit upon at table or two together might form a narrow table various means of adapting the articles in question to these changes may be conceived the particularizing them would require more room than can be spared ii double or married bedstages see the plate each four feet in width bounded by a moveable partition or screen on each side six feet and a half high—alternating with these married bed stages sets of childrens bed stages for children of an innocent and unobserving age—say from two to six years each for two rows of children lying feet to feet breadth in some for two children in a row in others for three in the two opposite ranges in the same room the alternation should be so managed as that each couple should have for its opposite neighbours—not another married couple—but a set of children in the daytime these high partitions serve for the circumferential screens employed as above at chapeltimes and at other times still in the same circumferential situation as antiinspection screens in vacation hours—when not in use they stow away in the radial direction close and parallel to the radial walls—for the sets of cribs for infants see the plate and see ch ix childnursing infirmary persons labouring under infirmities neither noisome nor contagious are lodged in the uppermost or gallery floor a person labouring under an infirmity either noisome or contagious occupies to himself an infirmary hut description of an infirmary hut a cube of seven or eight feet width of the door three feet width of the bed three or four feet space on the other side of the bed one foot the door closefitted and well listed     particularly at the side by which it hangs on the doorcase as the door opens it forms a screen to the head of the patient defending him against the blast on the inside a thin board as long as the door is wide fastened to the top of it making with the plane of the door an angle greater than a right angle for the purpose of directing up towards the ceiling such of the air as at the opening of the door comes in above to weaken the reverberation of the blast opposite the door an oval hole closed by a wellfitted and listed shutter playing loosely on a pin on which it is hung and loaded a little at the bottom that it may the more effectually overcome the friction and replace itself in a position exactly vertical—the fresh air as it comes in at the door pushes before it and pushes out at the aperture a part of the air which it finds in the room and which were it not for the vent thus given to it would reverberate upon the bed on the right hand of the patient as he lies in his bed a small window not opening but closely caulked the bedstead on feet one foot and a half above the ground on each side and at the feet a flap running the whole length and reaching to the ground turning by hinges on the bedstead for warmth the flaps are turned up and occupy a vertical position enclosing the patient as it were in a box and keeping the bedclothes from being undesignedly thrown off for coolness they let down the ceiling instead of being flat coves a little in two slopes corresponding to those of the roof at top they do not meet in an angle but in a narrow plane say a foot wide in the middle of its length an aperture say about two feet in length closed by a slider to let out the foul air occasionally at the top more or less frequently according to the temperature the convergescence of the roof which may take place in two directions only or in all four enables the blast to sweep out the air the more clearly there being no corners where it can lurk unexpelled for equality of temperature the outside covering thatch unless any apprehension should be entertained of its harbouring infectious vapour in which case tiling or slating must be employed instead the door clogged by a counterpoise to ensure the shutting of it and to moderate and equalise the blast produced by opening it

for two persons at bed and meal times by putting four together four walls out of the sixteen or by putting together two one wall out of the eight might be saved as in this figure in which the situation of the door is marked by the short line—but on the quadruple plan the benefit of the vent for the blast of the door is sacrificed in as far as noisomeness is the sole ground of sequestration as in bad venereal cases the quadruple plan may be as good as the double or single and there seems no reason why the double plan at least should not be upon a par with the single even in the most infectious fevers  section iii approach and outlying cottages— the approach an avenue bounded by parallel walls each wall serving as a support or back to a penthouse roof supported in front by slender posts forming thus a sort of covered walk or corridor tiled or thatched paved with brick or stone according to the country the same wall forming one of the boundaries of a line of outlying huts or cottages the door of each cottage opening into the corridor a small window either at the top of the door or in the wall opposite between door and door a bench for the customers to the industryhouse in its quality of employmentintelligenceoffice over the benches the series of employmentgazettes pasted against the wall see book in ch i employment secured no cooking being to be performed in any of these huts each consisting of but a single room on a plan nearly similar to that of the infirmary huts they might be warmed by a flue running through the line of them as in hot houses† uses of the avenue this the only approach—no introduction by stealth—neither ingress nor egress for any one without his being exposed to scrutiny the whole length of the avenue occasional barrier across the avenue     at one or both ends to keep out the promiscuous influx of the employmentseeking hands in the corridor the bedridden and infant part of the population might receive air and exercise on a rainy sunday by being drawn on droshkies a vehicle in use in russia consisting of a board mounted on wheels by the stout part of the children of their own sex the nonexistence of windows towards the avenue would preserve the ancient inhabitants of the cottages from being incommoded by the noise and promiscuous resort of the employmentseeking hands and if on this or any other account it were an object at any time to cut off such communication altogether the access of those visiters might be confined to hours when the inhabitants of the cottages were at their employments in the house section iv means of separation uncommunicating floors in each division three out of the five each short floor communicating with the long floor immediately underneath it divisions eleven out of the twelve the twelfth being reserved for the officers three multiplied by eleven gives thirtythree uncommunicating apartments three and thirty classes may thus be kept in a state of perfect and constant separation from each other yet all of them constantly present to the officers in the lodge between whatever classes a separation is kept in the house it must be equally kept up without the house the land must therefore be separated into wards as well as the house between class and class the barriers will be constituted by roads not to be crossed by either class nor to be made use of as roads by both at the same time barrier against strangers a double fence all round the space between fence and fence a belt planted with wood it may be termed the sequestration belt the land divisions radiating in continuation of the house divisions the house not far from the centre of the land that the land divisions may be equal as well as the house divisions or if one ward requires less land than another the land division may on that side be so much the shorter and the house so much the nearer to the extremity of the land difficulty of framing the conception to an adequate comprehension of the centralinspection plan and of the effects it would have upon the management—if in a building on this plan anything of disorder is supposed it must be because though in words the adoption of it may have been admitted the state of things that would be the necessary result of it is not present to the mind the disorder supposed is supposed to be out of sight which in fact it never could be from the want of this advantage proceeds that anxiety the intensity and at the same time the inefficacy of which is apparent in every page of the rules and orders that one sees officers frequently to go into the wards—frequently to hear complaints—master frequently to go into every ward and inspect the persons therein on a particular day of the week especially—twice aweek the matron to inspect every part of the house—paupers to be kept clean—officers frequently to take a view of them—paupers to come down into the dininghall to be mustered and employed—doors to be locked that they may not harbour in the wards in the day time—nursechildren frequently to be visited—once amonth at least—apprentices frequently to be visited by the messenger—this from the regulations of one of the firstrate poorhouses—all this an attempt—and that probably in a great degree an unavailing one—to effect by great exertions not a hundredth part of what on the central inspection plan would take place of itself without a mans stirring from his chair     section v means of extension first method— if the purpose for which the extension is wanted be such as a floor of one of the divisions of the house will suffice for apply it accordingly giving a proportionable increase to the line of avenue or outlying cottages for per estimate when once provision has been made for the two thousand upon the central inspection plan outlying cottages at two lodgers to a cottage may be built at an expense not greater per head than the expense of the main building this plan of extension may be pursued so long as there is an assurance of a correspondent number of inhabitants so circumstanced as that they can be made to do as much work in value out of the main building as in it being employed for example partly in outdoor work partly in such indoor and sedentary work as they may be trusted with and would be capable of doing in such a confined and illlighted situation to which may be added such farther number for which room can be found in the main building at the indoor working times the additional stock of comfort afforded by this method will be no small recommendation to it—second method by which an extension may be given to the main building to an unlimited amount for any purposes in relation to which the benefit of the central inspection principle is not wanted—before and parallel to that division which fronts the avenue add a projecting front communicating with the main building by a narrow passage—length of the passage such as to save the division from having its light materially   0 obstructed by the projecting front for which reason so far at least as that division extends the projection should consist of but one floor the roof low and if flat so much the better chap iv principles of management— necessity of finding a name for each leading principle for the purpose of reference—the newspaper mode of naming parliamentary bills a precedent and an example of the use to each principle corresponds a rule given at length in the work at large with the requisite limitations and explanations section i managing hands— means   separation and aggregation principle see above

industryhouse the management in relation to that head is better than in the rest and introduce it into the rest   tabularstatement principle in each industryhouse reduce the system of bookkeeping to the form of a table inspectable at one view and at each period from the two hundred and fifty particular tables form a general table see infra ch x bookkeeping the use of the tabularstatement principle is to facilitate the application of the managementselection principle—no close and persevering comparison but when the objects are on the same surface of the same paper or of divers papers ranged in the same plane   uniformmanagement principle keep up the same plan of management in all the industryhouses in all points which present no particular reasons for variation as between house and house frame for this purpose at the outset a set of blank books or forms to be observed in all improving them from time to time according to the suggestions of experience   localconsideration observing or exceptionobserving principle—a memento not to push the principle of uniformity too far—so far as to keep the management the same in any two establishments in regard to any point in respect of which the influence of local circumstances requires a difference section ii managing hands— motives   duty and interest junction principle—no means to be omitted that can contribute to strengthen the junction between interest and duty in the instance of the person intrusted with the management—i e to make it each mans interest to observe on every occasion that conduct which it is his duty to observe application of this principle to practice—all means of acting upon a mans interest reduceable to the two heads of punishment and reward—punishment commonly so called is out of the question here being provided by the general dispensations of law—applications of reward are left mostly free in transactions between individual and individual but money including moneys worth is in point of effect the matter either of reward or punishment or of both at once in so far as it lies in the power of one man to cause it to pass into or to pass out of the hands of another a given mass of reward is the more valuable because the more certain where it attaches of course upon the conduct intended to be promoted without the formality of legal investigation directed expressly to that purpose the duty of the manager of an industryhouse has two main branches duty towards those under his care resolvable into humanity—and duty to his principals the company resolvable into economy publicity the most effectual means of applying the force of moral motives in a direction tending to strengthen the union between his interest and the humane branch of his duty by bringing to light and thus exposing to the censure of the law and of public opinion or at any rate of public opinion every instance of contravention for enforcing economy what is called contract is the most efficacious species of arrangement where the case admits of its being adopted—the contractor standing to the whole loss the apprehension of which operates like the fear of punishment as well as to the whole profit the expectation of which operates like the hope of reward—next to that partnership in which a man stands to only a part loss and part gain—the union between interest and duty being of course the stronger the larger a mans share regard being had to the sumtotal of his property especially since the larger a mans partnership share the less the difference between the whole of any profit which he might make to himself in fraud of the partnership and the share that would come to him     fairly under the partnership next to that a share of profits without any share of loss danger to be guarded against where share of profit is confined to particular articles—temptation to increase to the prejudice of the partnership the amount of the partnership transactions in these articles—and so per contra in the case of loss salary an expedient to be recurred to no otherwise than as far as contract or partnership are inapplicable salary however large affording no motive for the habitual discharge of the trust much less for any extraordinary exertions in the view of discharging it to the best possible effect but only for the single act of undertaking it and thereby exposing ones self to the penalties appointed for nondischarge or misdischarge of it—general receipt for connecting a mans interest with his duty—cause a profit to accrue to him of itself on the taking place of the result proposed to be promoted—or a loss or other prejudice on the taking place of the result proposed to be averted for instances of the application of this principle to the working and other subordinate hands see the several principles of detail exhibited further on under the head of workinghands—motives—for an instance of its application to the situation of the local manager in chief the governor or other persons bearing parts in the management see the next principle   lifeassurance or lifewarranting principle—give to every one on whose care in the instance of each child the probability of its life in any degree depends an interest and that a pecuniary and neverceasing interest—in the preservation of its life—application of this principle that the service of an average child to twentyone possesses a clear value—reckoning even from birth—much more from any more advanced period is proved in another place see book v ch ii pecumary estimates by giving this service to the company an interest in the wishedfor result viz the preservation of life to the latest period is given to the company an interest from which flows the companys best and largest source of profit it is therefore the companys interest to communicate a share of this interest to such of its several subordinates on whose conduct the result in any way depends in such shape and quantity as shall in each instance be best adapted to the purpose—examples   establish it as a rule that the governor matron medical curator and female midwife shall each of them pay headmoney for every woman who dies in childbed   give to a certain part the larger the better of the emoluments of the governor matron medical curator and nurses the shape of headmoney payable for the survivors only of the nonadults from year of age to year of age either during the whole of the apprenticeship viz to twentyone or only during the age of extramortality   give in all like manner an extra premium or bounty to the governor matron medical curator and nurses of such of the industryhouses in a certain number in which the success of the management in this particular shall within a certain period say yearly have been most conspicuous—the interest which a member of the community at large has in the populousness of the community at large is as nothing in comparison with the interest thus created viz on the part of a member of the company and still more on the part of an officer of a companys industryhouse this is the only shape which genuine and efficient humanity can take the notion which insists upon disinterestedness i e the absence of the species of motive most to be depended upon as an indispensable qualification or even though it were but a recommendation in the instance of a person bearing a part in the management of such a concern is a notion respectable in its source but the most prejudicial in its tendency of any that can be imagined—every system of management which has disinterestedness pretended or real for its foundation is rotten at the root susceptible of a momentary prosperity at the outset but sure to perish at the long run that principle of action is most to be depended upon whose influence is most powerful most constant most uniform most lasting and most general among mankind personal interest is that principle a system of economy built on any other foundation is built upon a quicksand  0 principle of publicity or transparentmanagement principle this regards motives as well as means the more universally the particulars of the management are held up to view the more universally the means of observing and thence of adopting whatever is good and of observing and thence of avoiding whatever is bad are held up to view and the stronger the force because the greater the certainty with which the motives derivable from the popular or moral as well as those derivable from the political or legal sanction operate towards the insuring such adoption and avoidance for the dependance of the degree of publicity on the amplitude of the scale see supra ch iii    concourseattraction principle—a branch of the principle of publicity—in the contrivance of the buildings and the whole system of management neglect no circumstance that can contribute to engage attention to the management and attract to the spot a concourse of such visiters whose remarks may afford instruction and their scrutiny a spur to improvement and a check to abuse see ch xii pauper education—and book iii ch x national force strengthened section iii working hands—employment

that situation—in the situation in question employment may be afforded to every fragment of ability however minute on the part of the deaf and dumb and the blind the ability is entire requiring only to be directed into particular channels so on the part of most classes of the insane requiring only particular means for the direction of it—in a limited local establishment on the present footing the stock of ability lies oftentimes unemployed for want of those appropriate means and opportunities of employment which could not be afforded to any profit in any other than an establishment on the largest scale    employmentappropriation principle—till the several classes of confined hands i e who by reason of infirmity are susceptible of particular employments only see ch viii employment are

the deaf and dumb the blind the lame c   nor to the willing any employments to which the earnfirst principle is applicable without imputation or danger of inordinate severity till the stock of lazy hands is provided with employments of that nature see infra section iv earnfirst principle   nor to practised hands any employments to which unpractised hands are competent till the stock of unpractised hands is provided in like manner anybodys work employments are such as may be carried on by unpractised hands imperfecthand employments though capable of being carried on by imperfect hands may require practice    labourdivision principle in the choice and allotment of employments remember to improve to the utmost the room afforded by the largeness of the scale for the division of labour besides the saving of time in respect of the passing from employment to employment and from place to place the more operations a process is divided into the more simple the several operations and the more simple an operation the better the chance it has of being brought within the competence of the different classes of confinedability hands as just described—thence   time saved   relative ability increased   quantity of the scarcest sorts of employment increased—the extent of the advantage derivable from this principle has no other limit than what is set by the expense of conveyance viz the expense of conveying the stock of raw or less elaborated materials to the spot where the stock of hands is accumulated and from thence in a finished or more elaborated shape to the field of consumption or demand    employmentchanging or severaltrade principle—classes of employments proper in divers points of view to be assigned interchangeably to the same hand   for health and gain of

susceptible like value in the way of exchange of being destroyed or reduced by glut competition stagnation change of fashion war or other causes nor by imperfections in workmanship affecting appearance rather than use—imperfections particularly congenial to such unpractised and feeble hands—under the     principle of selfsupply neither market i e demand nor capacity of production are exposed to failure—each hand working for the most part not only for the establishment of which he is a member but in some degree individually for himself natural justice holds out its sanction to this arrangement sympathy helps to promote it and selfadvantage to sweeten it—acknowledged community of interest will enable the willing to spur the lazy without exposing themselves to the reproach of officiousness or illnature—working for sale would unless laid under restraints by superior authority expose individual competitors to universal ruin self supply injures nobody—affords ground of complaint to nobody in the case of an individual indeed the principle of selfsupply is repugnant to good economy and is the forced resource of a nation little advanced in the career of opulence for in that case in as far as the application of the principle of selfsupply extends the benefit of the labourdivision principle is foregone but in this vast populous establishment affording within itself the means of carrying the division of labour—not only to the ordinary pitch but beyond it—the two principles act in conjunction and the operation of each is favoured by the assistance it receives from

would do nothing as to those who come within the operation of the selfliberation principle whether a man works more or less makes no difference to the company the better he works the sooner he is out the less he works the longer he stays so far as the operation of this principle extends the company need never be a loser but may be a gainer if it pleases utmost expense of maintenance per head per day of an ablebodied male not so much as  d average value of the lowest paid species of labour not so little as  s humanity however will not be the only check upon the abuse of rating the value of the relief too high or what comes to the same thing the value of the work performed too low since the worse terms the company afford to selfliberation hands the fewer they will have the better the more it is only by the combination of the selfliberation principle with the earnfirst principle applied the one or the other according to circumstances that voluntary charity is reconcileable with industry or compulsory charity with justice employment for lazy hands to be administered upon the earnfirst principle should be—  certainly performable   exactly measurable ex gr turning of a wheel for grinding c—or for raising water—so many turns made so much work done—to husband this sort of work give a new hand the option between a greater quantity of this sort of work and a less quantity of a sort which is more wanted but in respect to which the quantity or the relative ability of the workman is less free from dispute ex gr digging wheeling away carting hedging gathering chaffcutting weaving picking sorting c    piecework or proportionablepay principle—the application of it seems confined to three cases   that of the relative extrability hands among the permanent stock i e those who though not capable of earning a full maintenance elsewhere are capable of earning more than a maintenance in this establishment—the company keeping up a fund of employment such as is not to be had elsewhere and affording maintenance cheaper than it can be had elsewhere   among these may be reckoned the extraability part of the apprentice stock who cannot earn a maintenance elsewhere because they are not yet permitted to go elsewhere   the case of encouragementmoney given out of earnings if a man cannot be maintained in the establishment for less than  d and he cannot in the way of piecework earn more than  ½d nothing is to be got by the company by paying him the whole of his earnings and making him pay for his board instead of finding him in board and working him upon the earnfirst principle—caution necessary in the application of the piecework principle where badness of quality may be masked—ex gr in those parts of a house or ship which are covered up—inside brickwork caulking c—or where despatch under the spur of the reward threatens to be productive of bad workmanship or waste caution in favour of health especially in the case of the apprentice stock many under the spur of the piecework principle injure their healths and shorten their lives but the mischief is probably owing in a considerable degree to fermented liquors by the use of which such excessive exertions are commonly accompanied     and supported and which would have no place here  0 peculiarpremium prizegiving or competitionexcitement principle—advantages   by paying one or a few victors you get the result of the extraexertions of the whole multitude of competitors   this combines well with the piecework principle—nor does either supersede the other some being more taken with the certainty of a smaller reward others with a chance of a larger one—the degree of excitement and thence of exertion is thus rendered greater than it could be even by the certainty of a reward to the same amount in a state of insulation    honoraryreward principle—this is mostly an application of the peculiarpremium principle and the class of hands to the circumstances of which it is more particularly applicable are the unripe hands in this shape reward costs nothing—examples   superiority of seat at table or elsewhere   precedence in processions or other public exhibitions   promotion to a higher class or form i e to a form already occupied by children standing higher on the scale of acquirments and mostly of a higher age   distinction in dress with or without addition for the purpose of decoration—query which is the greatest the good done by the exercise of useful exertion or the mischief by the suffering produced by the ferment raised among the dissocial passions—disappointment dejection envy jealousy revenge—the good is supposed to predominate considerably but all possible care should be taken to reduce the mischief to its minimum    separatework principle or performancedistinguishing principle—this is the basis of the foregoing principles without this neither punishment nor reward—especially no punishment rules   where tasks can be separated avoid gangwork   where gangwork is inevitable the smaller the gang the better   because the fewer the workmen whose work is thus blended the easier each mans share in the work may be distinguished   because if a reward be given to the gang the smaller the gang the larger the share which each mans own exertion procures for him n b if the gang be not large by shifting the hands from gang to gang in the same work the share contributed by each to the result of the jointwork may be obtained separate   where the reward is divisible to spur a lazy hand join him with a willing one viz if the arrangement be temporary for if it be permanent despair and resentment against injustice will be apt to slacken the exertions of the industious hand and reduce them to a level with those of his unindustrious partner   in work for selfsupply allot to each individual what he has individually been concerned in producing he will then be his own rewarder and his own punisher according to the goodness or badness of his work   giving him the last choice may in some cases be a means of bringing his workmanship to a uniform pitch of goodness   in work for sale the price fetched by the work of each gang and if possible of each individual should be noted that the reward if any may be proportionate section v working hands— fare    suitablefare principle—charitymaintenance—maintenance at the expense of others should not be made more desirable than selfmaintenance fare consequently the cheapest that can be found so it be nourishing and wholesome—for if there be any cheaper in use it must be among the selfmaintaining poor—luxury being a relative term is applicable with as much propriety to the diet of the poor as of the rich luxury if it does not render the condition of the burdensome poor more desirable than that of the selfmaintaining poor fails of its purpose if it does it violates justice as well as economy and cuts up industry by the roots—this extends not to any who may have earned though it be in the establishment more than the expense of their maintenance—since these are not burdensome but selfmaintaining—nor to any extra comforts purchased with any such peculium share of earnings the allowance of which is productive of a value more than equal to the expense although the whole amount of a mans earnings should fall short of the whole expense of his maintenance example expense of maintenance say  s aweek ordinary earnings  s if by giving fifty per cent encouragementmoney for extra earnings you can make him earn  s  d you save  d and the  d he spends and costs over and above the  s does not go counter to the principle—although it should be clear that a selfmaintainer of the same degree of ability without doors would not earn above the  s    habitrespecting principle—this principle is the antagonist of and a check upon the former its application is merely temporary confined to the existing stock of oldstagers how far in consequence of habits of luxurious fare contracted under the existing plan of poorhouse provision how uncomfortable soever upon the whole the suitablefare principle should be departed from in the instance of that stock is a problem for the humanity and discretion of the company to solve see ch vii diet    principle of sobriety or nofermented liquor principle—  fermented liquor even of the weakest kind is a drink not natural to the human frame   in as far as it is fermented it contributes nothing to health or nourishment   in its abuse it is the most     fertile of all sources of vice and misery—  no line can be drawn between the use and the abuse—some constitutions are kept in a state of perpetual intoxication by small beer—  perfect health reigns where fermented liquors are excluded—proved in the instance of the

this state many are the articles that may have gone through more stages than one in the scale of degradation see ch x bookkeeping—   usemultiplying or severaluse principle—an article being deemed

extraordinary good ear and thence affection for the pursuit in the instance of a natural taste for the arts of design or of strength or comeliness adapted to dancing or other theatrical exhibitions superiority is less manifest culture is less exceptionable in the eyes of a severe moralist and the object is of inferior account—advantages comfort and consideration of this part of the pauper community increased—importance and desirableness of the condition of a companys apprentice raised for the importance of music as an assistant to instruction intellectual moral and religious see ch xii pauper education    fellowinstruction principle—a branch of the indigenouspromotion principle—the children themselves to be employed in the instruction of their fellows the more advanced in the instruction of the less advanced—as much of the instruction as possible to be given upon this plan—in time the whole of it may—advantages   saving in the expense of superior instruction   on the part of the pupils comfort increased the impression of awe and idea of coercion being in great measure removed   progress accelerated—the alacrity being increased and the analogy of ideas betwixt teacher and pupil closer   on the part of the teacher—comfort increased in respect of the pleasures of superiority and command   progress accelerated the knowledge acquired by teaching being much more perfect than what can be acquired by simple learning in the one case the mind being in good measure passive—in the other completely active to the cultivated mind of a master the task of perpetually dwelling on ideas of no higher rank than those which are upon a level with the capacities of children is a wearisome and fastidious task in the case of the pupilinstructor the task which he has but just ceased to learn in quality of pupil is some time before it has lost its relative importance in his conception in his new quality of tutor and when it has it is exchanged for a higher   preparation for the application of the indigenouspromotion principle by appointing the quondam apprentice to the higher offices of the establishment    indigenouspromotion principle—from the time that the institution has been long enough on foot to have laid a suitable foundation in point of education none of the officers unless perhaps the chaplain to be chosen elsewhere than out of the establishment viz out of the apprentice stock—advantages i to the companys wards hope encouragement and consideration ii to the company—  certainty of fitness in respect of suitable education character experience and probation—  saving in respect of expense of salaries a given allowance administered to persons whose habits of expense have been of the very lowest rank will go proportionably farther     than if administered to an individual trained up in the profuse habits of the world at large chap v official establishment section i officers—numbers and functions— the same in every industry house—  governor   chaplain   medical curator   schoolmaster to act likewise as secretary   organist to act on sundays as musicmaster and on weekdays as a clerk   governess for the female part   schoolmistress for the younger part of the female apprentices   matron or head nurse for the infant part—to act as midwife   husbandry bailiff  0 foreman and forewoman at first for the several employments—impossibility of determining with exactness previously to experience the exact number of officers requisite two functions may be exercised by the same individual or several individuals may be requisite for one function section ii pay— in most instances the greatest part of the emolument must wear the shape of a fixed salary from first to last the value of the service actually rendered by each individual not being capable of being exhibited in any such precise quantity that the quantum of the reward shall be capable of being made to rise and fall with it governors must at the outset be in great measure if not altogether upon a salary in process of time as the expenses and returns of the establishment become ascertained and known they may be paid upon the footing of contract or partnership till the apprentice stock has produced individuals ripe for this as well as the other offices the emoluments being fixed it might be sold by auction to candidates possessed of certain qualifications power to the company to revoke the appointment at any time on payment of the purchasemoney the price a man gives will be a proof of the degree of his inclination for the business of the office thence of his fitness as far as depends upon inclination the other exceptions regard the officers to whose functions the application of the lifeassurance principle is extendible—the nurse receiving the whole of her emolument and the medical curator a proportionable part of his and so perhaps the governor and governess in the shape of annuities on the lives of the apprenticechildren under their care up to a certain age see ch iv section iii powers and restraints— except as undermentioned the authority of the governor to be absolute over the whole establishment but no act to be done without the privity of the rest of the officers each being rendered responsible for every act of the governor to which he does not enter his dissent and the entry of each act being accompanied with a memorandum stating what officers were present and which if any absent at the time cases to be specified in which to prevent any such mischief as would be irreparable the veto of the chaplain or surgeon shall be sufficient to suspend the execution of any order of the governor until there shall have been time for the pleasure of the directionboard to be made known—examples   danger to the security of the whole establishment by fire or water—  danger to the safe custody of the apprentice stock or stock of selfliberation hands especially such as belong to any of the dangerous or disreputable classes   danger of communication of infection or danger of life and limb to any individual in the establishment—  danger of violation of the principle of separation as between class and class—  mischief by the cutting down destroying or damaging timber or other trees the mischief in each case being such as were it not for the veto might take place before the intimation of the pleasure of the board could arrive contracts of purchase sale hire and loan such as are made in the local establishment and not by the general directionboard to be made by the governor but with the privity of all the officers of both sexes in cases that will admit of suspension power to be reserved to the directionboard to disallow any such contract within a limited time these like all other acts being reported to the board in weekly or daily course no officer to be ever absent for a day together without a substitute chosen by himself but liable to be disallowed by the governor singly or by any two other officers—the principal to be peculiarly responsible for the conduct of the substitute the substitute to be in the case of the chaplain a minister in holy orders in that of the medical curator a person who has undergone such tests of capacity as shall have been established for the purpose power to each officer to take an assistant or assistants upon the same terms as specified above in regard to substitutes each officer will thus have the faculty—not indeed of appointing his successor but of placing any one whom he is disposed to favour in a situation which will naturally afford him an advantage in this respect the power of nomination remaining in the board no detriment seems likely to ensue from such a privilege the choice of a person for whose conduct the chooser is personally responsible affording as fair a presumption of fitness as a choice made by an irresponsible member of the general board each officer to be responsible to the board for every instance of misbehaviour or proof of manifest incapacity exhibited by any other if within a certain time he does not give information thereof by minute in the books taking care that a copy of the minute be transmitted to the board the plea of selfpreservation will thus afford a shield against the imputation of officiousness and illnature all the official acts to be exercised in the common room viz the central lodge section iv encouragements— rich and honourable source of encouragement were it the     pleasure of his majesty to confer the honour of knighthood on a select number of such of the governors as should have distinguished themselves in the humane upright intelligent and dignified exercise of their office—also to bestow some of the church sinecures on some of the chaplains but tenable only during their continuance in the exercise of that laborious and useful office—might not an arrangement of this sort help to protect the church establishment from obloquy the company at the end of every year to present pieces of plate in the way of premiums to such of the officers of the two hundred and fifty houses—governors more particularly—as shall have distinguished themselves in their respective situations the act of remuneration to be grounded in every instance on specific and specified exemplifications of merit with reference to the evidence presenting itself in each instance as apparent on the face of the books a thousand or two ayear thus expended would go a good way and probably produce ample repayment in the way of zeal and useful service section v visiters— all magistrates and clergymen resident in the county visiters ex officio power to inspect the books especially the complaintbook see ch x bookkeeping—examine persons and make minutes the power might be coupled with an obligation to be performed suppose once ayear in the instance of those resident within the pauper district belonging to the industryhouse in the case of the ecclesiastical visiters especially those resident at a distance a small fee fixed or increased with the distance might be a reasonable accompaniment to the obligation the whole establishment with its two thousand members being inspectable and every member of it examinable sick or well from a single station the centre lodge the time thus required to be bestowed will not be great chap vi diet— diet about twothirds of the necessary quantum of expense—distinction between diet for the newcomers and diet for the oldstagers—necessity in respect of life and health is the only standard in the former case habit may prescribe an addition to the expense in the latter see p     habitrespecting principle—in the case of the newcomers—animal food—meat—is the great source of expense—the greater part of mankind use animal and vegetable together many however use vegetable only ex gr the hindoos—some animal only viz the esquimaux and other inhabitants of the regions too cold for vegetation—also some tartar nations—it is not clear that the latter are healthier or stronger than the former—whether a mixture of animal food with vegetable be more advantageous in point of health and strength taken together than vegetable alone and if so what proportion is most advantageous is a matter of experiment in the highest degree interesting never as yet tried but which might be tried with the utmost advantage in the proposed establishment in the instance of the indigenous branch of the apprentice stock—bread is uneconomical—not only as being the result of an expensive manufacturing process but as being considered as an appendage to meat and thence impressing the idea of a want of meat bread and water a penal diet in england more expensive than the ordinary diet in scotland i nonadults especially the indigenous and quasiindigenous classes—taking the cheapest food in point of quality experiments should be made for ascertaining the most advantageous quantity the lowest step in the scale a quantity greater in a known proportion than the least quantity consumed by an average child of the same age among the husbandry part of the selfmaintaining poor in scotland—this ascertainable with great precision from the observations made by the guardians of the poor at glasgow the highest step the quantity consumed by an average child of the same age to whom as much is given as it will eat gradations to be marked out at equal intervals between these two points—difference to be tried between two meals aday and three—whether any and how much more is consumed at three than at two—the quality the same—quantity at option as before—and if more is consumed whether any and what difference in point of strength or health be the result—one aday and four aday hardly worth trying—the two sexes to be compared to each other for this purpose at the different ages—health being the mere negation of disease if their be no disease in any instance which is the most probable as well as the most desirable result no indication in this respect will be afforded in that case as far as health is concerned the smallest allowance is preferable as being least expensive—difference between general strength and particular or local strength the human frame to be examined in this point of view—some muscles stronger in some subjects others in others—even where in point of general strength there may be no difference—tests of strength to be established—a single species of exertion such as running lifting rowing turning a wheel c—each taken singly—is not of itself an adequate test of general strength for all varieties in point of organization—the proper tests for this purpose are the exertions made in the several employments in actual use—the experiment having by this means a direct application to practical use—the effect of differences in point of quantity being ascertained another class of experiments may regard the effect of differences in point of quality i e species of food each species taken apart and another of the effect of mixtures     ii adults—newcomers—a fixed dietary would be irreconcileable to economy since the proportions in point of price as between article and article are subject to great and continual variation so likewise a fixed allowance in money since the same quantity of money will purchase as much again of any given species of food or even of that which is cheapest at the time at one time as at another and by an improvident application of a limited sum famine might be produced—the following course seems the proper one for the direction board to take give a list of rations of different sorts—the more numerous the better—all regarded as coming within the price proposed give to the governor of each house the option as betwixt these several rations allowing him even to employ or at least to propose others—but on condition of their not exceeding a fixed price iii adults—oldstagers—paupership habit is the habit principally to be considered in this case the original habit acquired during the selfmaintaining state having been more or less superseded by it the paupership habit instead of being less luxurious and expensive throughout is in the instance of those maintained in the way of communitymaintenance i e in poorhouses howsoever denominated invariably and in an enormous degree more luxurious and expensive—original habits are determined mostly by professions though in some degree by territorial situations—the agriculturalist the lowest paid of all classes in communitymaintenance the habit has generally been adjusted to the habits of the bestpaid classes though influenced more or less by territorial situation difference in this respect between bread countries and meal countries and among bread countries between wheaten bread countries and inferior bread countries—viz rye barley oaten and peasebread countries meat is the great article of excess in the existing poorhouses whatever degree of indulgence it may be thought fit in consideration of acquired habits to extend to the oldstagers they should be dieted apart from the newcomers—briefly thus—two tables—new comers table and oldstagers table this to save the newcomers from the pains of regret and privation and from the dissocial emotions and affections of envy and discontent should any retrenchment be deemed advisable voluntary charity will remain as a resource for the amount of the difference see book iii ch xiii voluntary charity assisted—and book iv pauper comforts—fish a contingent resource in situations and seasons affording a glut—expectations entertained of a mode of curing by which the benefit may be extended to all seasons and situations—conduct with regard to the mode of retrenchment—  diminishing the number of meatdays—  diminishing the quantity of meat on each day—  diminishing partly the number of days partly the quantity on each—saving by inferior pieces a casual resource depending on local situation—the amount limited since the ratio of inferior to superior cannot be increased the distinction being principally the result of prejudice and caprice differing widely as between country and country any considerable increase in the relative demand would raise the price in great towns many parts considered elsewhere as delicacies and in vain coveted in country places are degraded in saleable value and even reprobated as unfit for man by being denominated according to the demand made of them for the use of inferior animals the principle of selfsupply though applied to this article would not altogether supersede the distinction between superior and inferior pieces since the superior fresh or preserved might be reserved for sale and the inferior in greater quantity purchased with the price this mode of retrenchment a point of great delicacy the settling of it as far as can be done by resolutions conceived in general terms a proper subject for the authority of parliament the execution ought not at any rate to be sudden time should be allowed to the class in question to accommodate themselves to their new situation and experience the benefit of it in other points of view chap vii clothing bedding c— i clothing—two points to be attended to—frugality and distinction—the latter for the purpose of separation and aggregation—see chap ii—frugality—  materials the cheapest so as to afford sufficient warmth   form excluding all useless parts—such as skirts to coats and waistcoats—brims to hats—unless it be in the heat of summer for protection against the sun for which purpose straw would be preferable—necessity and use the standards—not fashion—though fashion has of late been approaching nearer and nearer to use—distinction principally by colour—form being determined by frugality in default of a sufficient number of cheap colours sufficiently contrasted shreds of one colour applied to a ground of another colour might be employed—shoes with wooden soles used in many country places and even in london under the name of clogs saving on this score alone  s  d a head in the instance of adults about £ 0000 or £ 0000 ayear in the whole—in summer no stockings but the leg covered or nearly so by a prolongation of the breeches which at that part may be repaired by piecing     more advantageously than stockings by darning in winter stockings might be added or rather hose i e stockings of woven cloth as being more advantageously repairable—at the parts most exposed to wear viz under the armpits between the thighs and at the elbows linings for strength of shreds of leather—a species of frugality already in use—for coverings of shoes in place of or in addition to leather the materials of castoff coats and waistcoats might be employed—or for womens gowns and petticoats—such as could not be applied with more advantage to other uses soldiers wear uniforms why not paupers—those who save the country why not those who are saved by it not the permanent hands only but likewise the comingandgoing hands should wear the uniform while in the house for order distinction and recognition as well as for tidiness being charged at a fixed rate per day reserving to them the option with regard to shoes and stockings clothing would be made all of it by the strength of the establishment according to the principle of selfsupply but this would make no difference in point of relative cheapness and dearness as between material and material the quantity of labour requisite being the same whether homemade bought or sold—for the particulars see book v ch ii pecuniary estimates ii bedding—for the bedstages see above chap iv—bed stuffed with straw—one side covered with the cheapest linen or hempen cloth for summer the other with coarse woollen for winter—stretching the under sheet on hooks pins or buttons will save the quantity usually added for tucking in—in cold weather that the woollen may be in contact with the body the sheet might be omitted rug and two or three blankets—upper sheet of no greater width than the cell and tacked on to one of the blankets bed one for the whole stage or a separate one for each cell and so the under sheet—the advantages of separation are superior portability each bringing and stowing away his own bed without embarrassment or delay and that in case of uncleanliness the annoyance may be confined to the author of it straw the more frequently changed the better particularly in the warm months—to the extent of the quantity wanted for littering cattle the change will cost nothing and beyond that quantity the expense will be only the difference between the value of the straw as straw and the value of it as manure chap viii employment— the grand point is to suit the nature of the employ to the nature of the hands—the only difficulty is to find employment of a nature suited to the unwilling hands and the infraability or inadequateability hands the quantum of this sort of employment requisite for the population when complete of each industryhouse will of course depend upon the population of these two classes of hands a stock of easy or anybodyswork employment having been found in a quantity adequate to the number of difficultyemployed hands the difficulty is at an end selfsupply is a principle particularly fruitful in anybodyswork employments—in the agricultural branch most of the operations being suitable to unexercised many to feeble hands in the clothing branch most to feeble many to unexercised hands the stock of everymanswork operations being increased more and more by the division of labour which in this scale of unexampled amplitude may be carried to an unexampled pitch the stock of work adapted to these confinedability hands will receive a proportionable increase to afford the extra stock of labour suited to the extra demand in time of war or preparation for war each hand exercising a wartrade must be prevented from employing in it more than a certain part of his time say three or two days out of the six in peace otherwise whatever accession to the national stock of waremployment hands were afforded by the companys apprenticestock of hands would only drive out or keep out so many free hands and there would be no more to spare of the sort of labour in question—no greater fund of capacity for that sort of labour lying by and unemployed then than there is now the advantage derivable from the employmentmixing principle is peculiar in great measure to such a company and its hands since no man can serve two masters nor in general the same masterman carry on without disadvantage two or more unconnected trades local advantages appurtenant to the situations of the several industryhouses may afford employments to a value which in part might otherwise be lost and those such as would be   0 less apt than others to interfere with private trade examples stonecutting—brickmaking—mining—fishing with the preliminary employments subservient to it—such as shipbuilding sailmaking c the quantity of work performable in these subservient employments might be confined to the supply of the companys own demand—no more vessels to be built c than what the company employs in regard to husbandrywork for individual farmers the company might restrict itself or be restricted to rates regarded as excessive say all beyond double the ordinary rate the object being not to deprive selfmaintaining hands of any employment nor even of any such advantage as would be a reasonable compensation for casual want of work and want of adequate pay in winter time—but only to get this or that work done which might otherwise not be done at all—not being capable of being despatched in time with all the labour that could be afforded by the obtainable stock of selfmaintaining hands with regard to the pouring in hands into overpaid employments whether in the view of taking the benefit of the excess or what would be the necessary consequence for the purpose of reducing it this advantage would be open to the company as well as to private masters and private hands the fund of information created by the employmentintelligenceoffice plan would be alike open to all parties interested see book iii ch i employment secured in regard to the choice of employments and the prudence of hazarding the necessary expense of such parts of the dead stock as might be requisite to a certain branch of industry and could not without loss be transferred to any other branch much will depend upon the permanence of the stock of hands capable of being allotted to any such employment that is in the instance of each hand on the assurance of his continuance upon the establishment for a term not less than a certain time the great and general uncertainty in relation to this head is one of the most powerful and insuperable obstacles to productive economy in poorhouses in the existing order of things—see book v ch v prospect of success—hence an important division of the population of a proposed industryhouse into—  comingandgoing or shortstaying stock of hands—  longerstaying stock—  permanent or standing stock owing partly to the permanence of their situation partly to their aptitude for receiving a suitable education it is the labour of the stock of unripe hands in their quality of apprentices that would constitute the chief basis of the companys profitseeking arrangements†     what the company supplies itself with will be gain to the company without being loss to other traders since whatever be the value that is thus produced by the company value to the same amount is saved out of the poorrates if the whole expense of the pauper community—say three millions—were thus defrayed by the labour of the paupercommunity and the committee were but as trustees for the rateable inhabitants to the whole of the amount the whole of the three millions would be saved to the rateable inhabitants and they would have so much the more in their pockets to lay out with individual traders of all sorts divided as it is proposed to be between the rateable inhabitants and the company the benefit to individual traders will be the same the only difference being that the part which is gained by the company will be laid out by and for the benefit of the members of the company while that part only which is divided amongst—that is saved by—the rateable inhabitants will be laid out by and for the benefit of the rateable inhabitants chap ix childnursing— great advantages the companys infants would have in comparison with those of private families—even of the most opulent much more of the indigent—  medical curators as well as headnurses and nursery girls prepared by the most eminent lecturers in this line   uninterrupted medical attention   uninterrupted nursing attendance—nurses constantly sitting up—no avocations—no overlaying   appropriate exercise administered by the help of machinery in whatever quantity may prove most advantageous—not stinted by the portion of time and labour that can be spared from other occupations as in private families—examples the infants danced as they lay in their cribs in numbers at a time—see the plate the labour performable by the slight exertion of a feeble hand the weight being taken off by a counterpoise for airing in conjunction with exercise an open carriage being provided upon a principle as simple as that of the droshky spoken of in ch iii—the cribs which for this purpose should be capable of being separated from each other may be suspended from horizontal poles supported by proper uprights they might be drawn about in this way in numbers by a single ass or in smaller numbers on smaller carriages on the same principle by some of the bigger children—  a system of experiment for the purpose of improvement constantly carrying on on a scale covering the whole kingdom and recorded according to an uniform plan of registration pursued alike in every industryhouse—see ch x   attention uniform systematical governed by principle—not exposed to be relaxed by casual want of affection or to be misguided by ignorance prejudice or caprice—  best mode of bringing up by hand a particular field for experiment—the great medical authorities to be consulted previous to the formation of the plan   attention sharpened by the lifeassurance principle by premiums and by the honour of publicity rate of vitality among suckled children the standard two children to be suckled by each woman delivered in the house the woman being supplied with extra nourishment for the purpose—mothers of bastards might be detained say for six or twelve months after delivery for that purpose the great object of endeavour will be to reduce the mortality among weaned children to a level with that of suckled children—what if still lower liberal premiums every year to the nurses c of a certain number of the houses in which the rate of infant mortality has proved lowest emulation consequently among all the houses to show how much has been owing to local situation and how much to management if an industryhouse in which a premium has been gained twice running be in a situation deemed peculiarly healthy—as in the welsh mountains—transfer this part of the official establishment to a situation in ill repute for health—such as the hundreds of essex or to any other industryhouse if there be any other in which mortality has been higher if under this disadvantage the success be similar augment the premium in proportion—for the savings to be made in the expense of childnursing as compared with ditto under the existing system see book v ch ii pecuniary estimates—and see book iii ch xi infant mortality diminished chap x bookkeeping— peculiar extent and importance of the system of bookkeeping in an establishment of this sort—besides being in every case an indispensable basis to good management it is in the present case an indispensable security for the due discharge of the several obligations which the direction of the company and the several agents in the several local establishments will have taken upon themselves with relation to the various parties interested—viz the paupers—their individual friends the rateable parishioners the stockholders government and the public at large in a small and single poorhouse there may be neither the demand for a full and perfect system of bookkeeping nor the adequate means of satisfying any such demand the difference between the best and the worst management that can be expected may hardly be sufficient to make up for the expense of an adequate system of registration that is of engaging persons competent to the task in a system of poorhouses of the proposed extent and magnitude good bookkeeping is the hinge on which good management will turn the demand rises to the highest pitch and so it will be seen does the sufficiency of the means at command for satisfying it with the instruction and under the check of an adequate system of bookkeeping the management may be better conducted by the most ordinary hand than by the ablest hand without that     advantage and the good management accidentally introduced by an able hand would vanish with the hand that introduced it without this advantage everything would be too much with it nothing would be too much without it any single one of the collateral benefits hereinafter proposed might be deemed visionary with it all of them together would be found practicable easy and secure in bookkeeping the heads—as in management the principles of the system—will be governed by the objects or ends which it has in view of the objects or ends of action requisite on this occasion to be kept in view the list will as far as it goes be the same in the one case as in the other and will not be much less extensive or diversified in the case of bookkeeping than in that of management itself pecuniary economy usually regarded as the sole object of bookkeeping will here be but as one out of a number for the system of bookkeeping will be neither more nor less than the history of the system of management in all its points health—comfort—industry—morality—discipline—and pecuniary economy—both branches included—the saving or preservative as well as the productive or augmentative compose the list of objects in view in the present instance in relation to all these points and at each period it is equally necessary that it should be known what at that period the state of the management is and has been in order that it may in no future period be suffered to grow worse but in every future period be made to grow better and better in as high a degree as may be the unprecedented multitude of establishments all requiring to be conducted upon a plan in most points exactly the same say two hundred and fifty spread at equal distances over the surface of the whole kingdom is another circumstance which enhances the importance of the process and at the same time gives an unprecedented turn to it in ordinary economical concerns the whole system of management is single and insulated here everything is comparative under every head the management in each house presents an object of comparison to the management of every other in relation to each head the management in each local establishment has therefore two hundred and fifty times the chance of being advanced to the highest possible pitch of perfection that it can have in any insulated establishment standing upon the ordinary footing to profit by this advantage it is necessary that the system of bookkeeping should in each house exhibit with the utmost precision and in the utmost detail what the management is—as for example—under the head of pecuniary economy what the rate of expense is on each of the articles consumed or used and what the rate of expense on each of the articles produced that it may be seen in which of all the houses the management in relation to each of those heads is most advantageous upon the whole and thence with a view to practise that the management of the most successful house may be taken in each instance for a pattern and copied in every other to bookkeeping in its ordinary form must therefore be added in the present case a new and peculiar branch which may be styled comparative or tabular bookkeeping to that comparison between period and period which is so instructive as often as it is made in the case of any private concern may here be added the comparison between house and house the plan of registration—at least the plan traced out in the first instance—cannot be too particular—multiplied by the number of industryhouses in the kingdom two hundred and fifty—by the number of souls in an industryhouse two thousand—or by the number of souls in the whole pauper population five hundred thousand—the minutest article may swell into importance the supposition to set out upon is—that everything is to be registered for the registration of which any use whatever can be found then to strike off the list such heads if any of which the use it is supposed would not pay for the expense multiplication of the number of the books would render the business—not the more complex as at first glance it might seem—but the more simple as in manufacturing establishments the several operations separately considered are the more simple the greater the number of the hands amongst which they are distributed allotting to each article a separate book would save the writing the name of that article as many times as it would occur in a general book the quantity of matter to be entered being given no addition is made to the labour of entering by any addition made to the number of the books books in any number may be given in charge to one hand so long as no two that are designed as checks to one another be given to the same hand multiplication of books is but division of the contents under the proposed system of management as the demand for a copious system of bookkeeping is in an unexampled degree urgent and extensive so are the facilities afforded to the process of bookkeeping by the peculiar plan of architecture equally unexampled compactness and simultaneous transparency—both     of which properties it exhibits in perfection—are the principal points upon which the advantage turns elsewhere the knowlege of the matter of fact requires to be communicated to the manager in chief often through a variety of channels here it is present to all his senses and requires only to be preserved—no false musters—no running to and fro—no mislayings and huntings—no crossings and justlings for the purpose of survey and registration—every person and every thing within view and within reach at the same instant—a degree of minuteness which might elsewhere be impracticable or unthrifty—costing more than the amount of any advantage that could be made from it—would be without obstruction and without objection here chronological and methodical—elementary and aggregate—are the natural and fundamental distinctions between book and book in a set of books having for their common subjectmatter the transactions of the same establishment—and they apply not only to books in which pecuniary economy is concerned but to all the several books that respectively bear relation to the several other heads of management here concerned in a chronological book the arrangement of the entries is governed by the order of time merely in a methodical book by some other order according to the purpose it is designed to serve entries of the elementary kind are generally entered in a chronological book in the first instance† and from thence copied either in their separate and elementary state or in aggregate state and expression into a book of the methodical kind elementary entries are of course the foundation of the aggregate—an error in an elementary article cannot but be productive of a correspondent error in the aggregate in which it is included an error in an aggregate article may exist without any error in an elementary one considered with reference to their subjectmatters the books may be distinguished into—  populationbooks—  stockbooks—including accounts of articles received issued and consumed—  healthbooks—  behaviourbooks—and   correspondencebooks the plans of the populationbooks and stockbooks elementary and aggregate included including also in each instance an indication of the use would take up so much room that they must either be omitted altogether out of the present outline or posted off to an appendix of the healthbooks a sketch will be given in book iii ch xii useful knowledge augmented c—to the class of behaviourbooks may be referred—  complaintbooks—  misbehaviourbooks—  black or punishmentbook—  red or meritbook idea of a complaintbook—i objects of complaint to the pauper inhabitants of any house—  fellow inmates of the same house—  officers of ditto—  the general plan of management—as manifested either by the established practice or the rules and orders of the house—  paupers of other houses—  officers of ditto—  strangers at large ii complainants against the pauper himself may be—  fellow inmates of the same house—  officers of ditto—  paupers of other houses—  officers of ditto—  strangers—these five last cases may be considered as belonging to the misbehaviourbook‡ iii heads for a complaintbook—  time day hour and minute—  by whom—  against whom or what—  concerning what—  to whom—  by whom examined into—  witness or witnesses examined—  by

against suppression of complaints where a pauper is complainant—time for complaining a time when the whole official establishment is assembled—right of having the complaint entered in the book—complaints by paupers against paupers will of course have officers for judges—an appeal will in that case be a complaint against the officer who acted as judge at every visitation see ch v official establishment the governor bound to present to the visiters the books exhibiting the complaints made by paupers whether against officers or against the management for a certain time back complaints against the management not to be repeated by paupers after having been decided upon by the general board punishment for complaints adjudged rash as well as groundless—still more if malicious and made for the purpose of vexation unexampled perfection of which the system of procedure is susceptible in such a situation—the result partly of the discipline but principally of the architecture delinquency known the instant of its being committed defendant complainant witnesses—if distinct from the complainant—judges—everybody—on the spot—delinquency complaint trial sentence execution—might all be included—and without injustice—in the compass of the same minute punishment may here be the less severe in proportion as the certainty of it is the more entire but in proportion as punishment is certain delinquency will be rare in case of complaints of a serious kind such as those which constitute a legal charge civil or criminal the industryhouse itself will be a perfect and the only proper safecustody house by a common jail such as common jails are at present a scratch in the moral character would be inflamed into a deathwound—see book iii ch viii imprisonment c in case of a complaint by a pauper against a stranger if the stranger will not make up the matter or it be a matter not fit to be made up the consequence of a decision given against the stranger will be a report from the house to the general directionboard—of which report if confirmed the consequence will be an order to prosecute—unexampled degree of protection thus secured to the pauperpopulation—thence a degree of security from which by the intricacies and expenses partly natural partly factitious of legal procedure the selfmaintaining poor—that is the great bulk of the community—are debarred see defence of usury and protest against law taxes the blackbook will be of use chiefly by its name the matter of it will have already found a place in the misbehaviourbook

for the insane c—in the instance of some of the classes appropriate houses may be of use the appropriation being special but not exclusive that is the complement of the establishment being made up out of the other classes rather than room or officers time should be unemployed—the centralinspectionarchitecture obviating whatever inconvenience might result from the aggregation if instead of being but apparent it were real—classes requiring appropriate establishments—i the insane ii the deaf and dumb iii the blind—in some cases reasons for collecting together into appropriate establishments persons afflicted with the above infirmities—i reasons applying to the curable classes of the insane   benefit of appropriate medical curation and attendance       giving to the patients the whole time and entire attention of the medical curator undivided by miscellaneous practice   enlarging the field of his observation and experience   benefit of suitable instruction and superintendence in respect of employment   ridding the ordinary houses of an annoyance ii reasons applying to the case of the deaf and dumb also to the blind especially to children born blind or become so at an early age   benefits of appropriate education   as well as attendance—instruction—and superintendence—in respect of employment—the deaf and dumb are of sound mind or upon the footing of idiots according to the care bestowed upon them at an early age iii reasons applying to the case of the incurably insane—appropriate attendance and where susceptible of employment instruction and superintendence the insane of different descriptions—such as curable and incurable susceptible and unsusceptible of employment dangerous and innoxious c—are not to be considered as necessarily allotted to the same establishment one class as another by reason of their common attribute of insanity but may be aggregated to other establishments and with other infirm classes according to the nature of their respective cases see ch iii separation and aggregation chap xii pauper education— an inquiry concerning the best method of providing for the nonadult classes of the pauper population coming under the management of the proposed company—that is for each individual during the period of his nonage—requires for its answer a complete plan of education adapted to this numerous division of the community the importance of the inquiry is in the joint proportion of the advantage to the multitude of the individuals concerned and of the degree of influence which—in the situation in question—a plan for this purpose may be expected to manifest the multitude included under the denomination of the poor compose the bulk of the community—nineteen twentieths might perhaps be found to belong to that class—in the condition of one of these twentieths the plan in question would exercise a direct and allcommanding authority and over the remainder a very considerable—and finally perhaps an allprevailing—though less certain and immediate influence if in point of real importance the education of the rich can bear any comparison with that of the poor it can only be in respect of the influence which the conduct of the former class has over the latter in the situation proposed the conduct of the poor will depend—not upon the remote and casual influence of the rich in the way of example or casual communication but upon the direct and constant exercise of plastic power the influence of the schoolmaster on the conduct of the pupil in ordinary life is as nothing compared with the influence exercised by the company over these its wards yet these are the classes whose case is so generally overlooked by the writers on education partly it should seem as not being worthy of their notice partly as not lying within their reach education is the conduct of the individual through the early part of life the proper end of education is no other than the proper end of life—wellbeing the wellbeing here in question is partly that of the individual to be educated partly that of the parties at whose expense and by whose care he is to be educated—viz the proposed company—in respect of the wellbeing of the child they are as guardians in respect of their own they are as masters from the commencement to the conclusion of the period of education comprising in this country the first twentyone years of life the field of education comprises the whole of the individuals time the time of an individual is employed partly in active occupations partly in repose which is the absence of them all—list of the ends or objects to one or more of which all occupations ought here to be directed—i for the advantage of the company as well as his own   profit of the pecuniary kind the fruit of productive industry—ii for his own advantage in respect of his present condition in the apprenticestate   comfort including amusement   continuation of existence viz by nourishment   health   strength   cleanliness   personal security—iii partly for his own advantage—in respect of his future condition after emancipation—partly for the advantage of the public at large   faculty of selfmaintenance   faculty of selfamusement  0 intellectual strength    moral health    military strength    faculty of pleasing    religious affections    suitable instruction—instruction in all suitable points of art and knowledge among these objects some lead to others many are compassed by one and the same occupation—in some instances the connexion is necessary in others it is dependent on management and presents a wide field for improvement and here comes in the application of the several use principle spoken of in ch iv—examples—repose and comfort sweeten the time occupied in nutrition—cleanliness is subservient to health comfort and the faculty of pleasing productive industry is naturally though not necessarily accompanied by bodily health strength the faculty of selfmaintenance and moral health—by management not only may the connexion between these objects be much strengthened but intellectual strength and comfort in the shape of amusement be added to the group—learning otherwise of little value—unless by being subservient to intellectual strength is if suitable in kind capable of being made subservient to the faculty of selfmaintenance—to the faculty of selfamusement—to     moral health—to the faculty of pleasing—and to religious affections—military strength of use principally to the public is naturally enough subservient to comfort i e to amusement and to the faculty of pleasing—the faculty of pleasing depends upon native comeliness the gift of nature not of education upon health strength cleanliness intellectual strength and moral health of religious affections moral health is in this world the great use from suitable instruction suitable art and knowledge these sublime affections as well as intellectual strength may derive nourishment and increase—amongst active occupations occupations accompanied with strong exercise there is one viz swimming peculiarly subservient to personal security—applying to a danger against which there is no constant security by any other means—and to this advantage is added comfort including amusement health strength cleanliness and even increase of strength by increase of security in a military view of diet and clothing two of the efficient causes of comfort and continuation of existence mention has been made in the ch vi and vii—of occupations considered as directed to pecuniary profit in the ch iv and viii—of the accession of military strength that might be derived from the apprenticeship system mention will be made in ch x of the next book—of the remaining principles of education relative to these and the several other objects a compressed view may be exhibited by the following rules and observations   in the whole system of occupations and in each occupation in particular the attainment of the several objects enumerated in the greatest possible number and each in the highest possible degree regard being had to their respective degrees of subserviency to the general end ought to be kept in view   of absolute repose considered as the total negation of all active occupations the quantity allowed ought to be the least that can be made sufficient for health and strength†   the efficient causes of positive discomfort being absent comfort amusement included—comfort even where it is but the collateral result is the natural concomitant of the several occupations which have for their objects or effects—repose especially after strong exercise nutrition health strength cleanliness personal security the exercise of the faculty of pleasing and the consciousness of possessing it and by suitable management it may be infused into those which have for their objects intellectual strength moral health military strength religious affections and suitable instruction and towards the close of the period the lists of comforts may be closed and crowned by matrimonial society of which comfort is naturally the object though the continuation of the species with its attendant comforts and anxieties is another fruit of it   strong exercises seem in the instance of most individuals to be in some proportion or other necessary to the perfection of health and strength and in particular in nonadults to the development of strength and the greater the proportion of such exercises infused into the mass of occupation without excessive fatigue or the support given by artificial stimulants the better both for health and strength   to answer in perfection the purposes of health and development of strength a system of exercise taken together should be general in respect of the parts concerned in it not local it should find employ for every limb and every muscle it should not be confined to particular limbs or particular motions of the limbs   of the occupations which having profit for their object come under the head of productive labour health and strength supposing a due admixture as above of the different species of labour‡—health strength and even comfort will be the natural though but collateral results   in the choice of occupations due provision being made for health and strength as abovementioned productive labour ought to take the lead and that to such a degree that no part of the time allowed by religion to be employed in productive labour ought to be employed in any occupation directed exclusively to any other object the portions of time allotted in each day to repose nutrition cleanliness and religion only excepted   in particular no portion of time ought to be directed exclusively to the single purpose of comfort§ but amusement as well as every other modification of comfort ought to be infused in the largest possible dose which economy admits of into every particle of the mass of occupations by which time is filled   the period preceding the birth of the faculty of productive labour with the addition of those intervals of time from which though not occupied by religious services productive labour stands excluded by religious prohibitions compose the time proper to be bestowed amongst the several other objects      0 instruction considered in the lump the time of its commencement should be the earliest possible and in determining the earliest time possible the commencement of physical capacity ascertainable by experiment as well as observation not usage—should be the guide    in determining the quantity of instruction to be administered within a given compass of time practicability—not usage—should be the measure    in the choice of subjectmatters of instruction utility—not usage—should be the guide    in regard to the order of commencement as between study and study natural facility not usage should be the arbiter    the utility in view ought to bear reference—in the first place to the situation of the individual during the apprenticeship in the next place to his situation in the world at large after the expiration of it† book iii collateral benefits introduction—taken in its narrowest extent the object or scope of a system of provision in relation to the burdensome part of the poor is—the affording mere subsistence to all persons actually in a state of indigence and willing to accept of relief upon the terms on which it is thought fit to be offered an establishment being instituted for the purpose whatever further benefits—to the burdensome poor to the selfmaintaining poor or to the public at large whether in the shape of employment pecuniary assistance security against depredation or other moral evils—security against death or other physical evils—comfort—accommodation—useful instruction—or in any other shape—may be found capable of being ingrafted on this stock may be termed with reference to that direct and principal object collateral benefits under every other system that has been either exemplified or proposed the task even in its narrowest extent is too great—by much too great for any means that can be spared under the proposed system—under a company instituted on mercantile principles with an undivided authority extending over the whole field of action—furnished with a competent stock of land and capital—acting according to the system of management and that management registered and made public according to the system of bookkeeping above pointed out—neither the extrabusiness here about to be proposed nor a superstructure even of much greater extent would be too broad for the foundation of these extra benefits or collateral results some take place of themselves—others by means of a particular direction given to labour without any addition to the quantity of it—those which require expense in most instances either find or provide ample funds for the defraying each of them its own expense some may be found to be pure sources of profit—considerable and increasable profit over and above the expense or even without expense—while of such as may be attended with expense the neat expense taking them all together would be as nothing in comparison with the sum of profit deducible from the rest considered with regard to its pressure on the intellectual faculties the whole burden of management may be pronounced light and inconsiderable in comparison with that which has been sustained with so much success by the east india company for such a train of years especially since the improvements made in the constitution of that imperial body by the superimperial power of parliament—see book v ch v—wisdom—true wisdom consists—not in the scantiness of measures—but in the amplitude of means chap i employment secured— certainty of the companys being able so long as land is not wanting to find employment for any multitude that can present itself—necessary cost of maintenance—for men not so much as  d aday capacity of yielding return of labour not so little as  s—return treble the expense for women cost of maintenance not more than  d capacity of yielding return by labour not so little as  d—return double the expense nonadults on the apprenticeship footing on terms of permanency and thence still more advantageous—see book v ch ii pecuniary estimates—were the balance on the profit side less the liberation of the individual would indeed be less speedy but the accomplishment of the benefit in its utmost extent not the less certain with land and capital sufficient worse than common management would suffice for this and securities for better than common management have been     provided—see book ii ch iv and x—and see book v ch v—all the hands here in question are able by the supposition inability being already provided for by the principal and fundamental part of the system—physical inability may taking the country throughout be considered as a fixed quantity not susceptible of fluctuations as want of employment is companys employment however is but a makeshift—a dernier resort—free employment is the primary and preferable object preferable as to the employmentlacking hands because liberty and superior pay go along with it preferable as to individual employers because profit on their part goes along with it and because in their instance the supply of it operates in satisfaction of a demand which by the supposition exists already and wants only to be made known this being the case the terms given by the company ought not to be so high as the terms given by individuals much less higher because in either case individuals would every now and then find their supply of hands narrowed by this means on the contrary the affording to individuals a positive assistance in this respect ought to be added to the list of the companys obligations for otherwise a number of profityielding hands who by means of a suitable channel of intelligence might have been made to find their way to individual employers might fall to the companys share the refuse of the population able as well as unable is the lot best adapted to the situation of the company it is natural that it should fall to their share because after experience at least it is natural for men to prefer liberty to confinement independence to dependence it is desirable on all accounts that it should fall to their share and that as little else should fall to their share as may be it is better for a good workman to fall to the share of a private employer as well on account of the employer as on that of the workman it is better for a bad hand to fall to the share of the company—on account of private employers that they may escape being troubled with him—on his own account even because the company possess such means of making him better as the private employer does not possess and since they do possess those means the possession of the workman bad as he is when he comes to them will so long as the company prescribe the terms be no disadvantage to the company demand for labour might as well not exist as not be known to those who have the labour to bestow in as far then as under the existing order of things this demand fails of being thus known thus to cause it to be known is as much as to create it the thing requisite for this purpose is a channel of intelligence—a regular and constant channel of intelligence—coextensive with the demand for employment on the one hand and that for labour on the other—articles requisite to constitute this channel of intelligence—i the employment gazette a publication rendered accessible to all by its cheapness rendered cheap by being cleared of all matter foreign to this purpose the company could render it free of expense to the employmentlacking hands by printing and circulating it at their own charge waiting for their indemnification to a later stage of the business—ii a system of employmentregister and intelligenceoffices spread all over the country at equal and convenient distances—a set of constant statutes as the term is in some countries for those marts for labour which serve in that capacity for no more than one or a few days in the year these for particular inquiry the gazette for offers of service and offers of employment in general terms—to this purpose the system of industryhouses is already supposed to be adapted—see book ii ch viii mode of advertising—a masteremployer wanting hands to apply at any industryhouse most convenient to him paying so much apiece say  s for every hand he wants this lest he should advertise for more than he means to employ—for the purpose of having the more to choose out of or of swelling the apparent magnitude of his business—fruitless journies after sham offers is an inconvenience that will thus be guarded against—deposit say  0s each to be returned for every hand the acquisition of whom is mentioned in a subsequent counter notice of supply this as before to prevent disappointment by preventing the continuation of offers which would not be realized this counternotice should be inserted by the company in the next employmentgazette—the offers should be numbered—to indicate the total numbers and for the purpose of being referred to in counternotices of supply an employmentlacking hand to pay for insertion say onefourth of the daily pay he declares himself willing to accept   to prevent wanton offers as above and   because if it were known that employmentlacking hands might make known their offers without any check from the expense masteremployers would lie by in expectation of such offers partly to save the fees partly to get hands on the cheaper terms by receiving offers instead of making them the master is the party from whom it seems best that the offer should come since having an employment already and wanting hands for that employment and that only it is for him to specify what it is—what an employmentlacking hand wants is rather money than employment many will be willing to undertake with or without reservation any employment by which money is to be got—no deposit here sufficient counternotice being insured by the masters deposit and the employmentlacking hands not being always able to afford it—by practice which might be anticipated in some sort by intelligence these advertisements would on both sides be thrown into settled forms in the     framing of which amplitude of matter and conciseness of expression would be the main objects in view points of character would come to be digested under heads—general heads of the moral cast applying to hands in general particular heads of the professional cast applying to this or that class of hands—examples of general heads—  age   character in respect of honesty sobriety good temper assiduity despatch dexterity c   employment desired exclusively or preferably   number of years experience in that or similar employments naming them   wages demanded c to the industryhouse hands the benefit of the employmentgazette might be given gratis the secretary under the direction of the governor and with the privity of the rest of the official establishment digesting and methodising their offers the same matter in two different forms—  according to the occupations in which employ is wanted   according to the class of hands by which it is wanted—classes to be distinguished in this point of view—  free hands at liberty immediately   selfliberation hands at liberty after the debt is worked out   bonded hands—hands not suffered to leave the industryhouse but upon certain conditions—for which see ch ii mendicity extirpated—and ch iii habitual depredation extirpated—these with their divisions as per table of cases calling for relief   outpoor hands—viz selfmaintaining hands—not belonging to any industryhouse—the numbers of candidates for each employment within a given period at or in the case of selfmaintaining hands resident near to each industryhouse should be noted under both heads notice of the amount of increase or decrease as thus—  offers remaining on the last day of publication so many   fresh offers so many   gone off since the last day so many   remaining at present so many—returns from situations distant from the place or places of publication would of course come in later and later in proportion to the distance hence another source of division and arrangement regulated by the course of the post—general totals and balances every year or oftener the established corn returns afford something like an example though of course not near so complex and voluminous the press to be set at one place only viz london or at several parts of the country at once according to the quantity of the matter—for example home counties northern and western—a place for each each industryhouse would be a general repository for the series of these gazettes as well as a place of resort for the explanation of their contents the walls of the approach would be a proper receptacle for these gazettes if printed only on one side—see book ii ch iii buildings and land—very small fees for search and inquiry say id just sufficient to prevent wantonlytroublesome applications a receipt to this amount would be sufficient for the expense clerks being trained up out of the apprentice stock maintained or paid according to the frugal plan of the house to render the provision perfect by giving to the benefit in view its utmost possible degree of extension would require the use of the system of industryhouses in their further proposed capacity of frugalityinns and frugalitytravelling stages whereby an employmentlacking hand though pennyless would be enabled to travel from any part of the country to any other—see chap vii—hence one out of so many reasons for placing the industryhouses at distances as equal as possible less immediate effects and uses of the institution over and above the more immediate ones of affording subsistence and occupation on the most advantageous terms to employmentlacking hands and hands to masteremployers—  promoting the augmentation of scanty wages   promoting the reduction of exorbitant wages   promoting steadiness in the rate of wages   preventing combinations among masters for sinking or keeping down wages   preventing combinations among working hands for raising or keeping up wages   keeping present to their view tables of rates of wages that for themselves and children they may make a timely choice of the most profitable and least overloaded occupations   reducing the prices of commodities in as far as kept up by exorbitant wages†   the employmentgazette and register will be a useful check and with the help of the visitation plan the complaintbook and the allcomprehensiveness and perfect publicity of the rest of the bookkeeping plan an effectual check against contrivances on the part of the company or its local agents for keeping out of free employment and thence keeping to the company and themselves the most profitable hands the rate of a mans pay is public the goodness of his performances are open to inquiry if he disputes in any point the character given of him by the agents of the company he may refer to other testimonials‡  00 on the plan here proposed maintenance coupled with employment—preservative and improving maintenance not corruptive as in the idleness of the present poorhouse or pensioned cottage—is rendered absolutely secure to everybody of the sort most eligible to present feelings as far as the stock of that sort will go and where that fails it is only by giving place to another sort still more favourable to morality and lasting happiness additional matter—intelligence capable of being ingrafted on the employmentgazette or rather on which the employmentgazette might be grafted being more certain and regular in its amount—periodical say weekly pauperpopulation reports being abstracts of the populationbooks of the whole system of industryhouses—see book ii ch x bookkeeping the escape list including outstays from furlough would answer a further purpose if accompanied with statements of identification marks in french signalement and rewards for apprehension the benefit would be extended by admitting of escape notices from without doors in the instance of childrenwards apprentices army and navy deserters prisonbreakers and other fugitives from justice promulgation—the lists of offers of employment and offers of service articles comprising the principal matter of the gazette may be distributed to the parishes in the whole or in parts according to the chance there may be in the instance of each parish of its affording supply to either branch of the demand these papers may be conveyed either by the general post or by and from each industryhouse within its district they may be directed to the parish clerk the only species of public officer whose abode is permanent and his residence constant and certain to be read by him in the whole or in part and then stuck up in a certain place within or without the church the pauperpopulation report might be read by the minister and by means of suitable comments and offices be ingrafted into the liturgy—prayers deprecatory for the unprosperous thanksgivings for the prosperous part of the results an office of this kind would come home to the business and bosoms of the audience it would be congenial to that gospel in which the concerns of the poor are the objects of such anxious and distinguished notice the gospel itself means in the original good news this would be truly gospel news by the constancy and universality of the attention it would excite it would be among the most powerful of the securities for good management particularly in regard to the points in which humanity and morality would be more particularly concerned briefs which solicit attention in behalf of inconsiderable fragments of the mass of the poor or pretended poor present a very inferior title to admittance indemnity to the revenue—the utmost possible degree of cheapness is essential to that universality of promulgation on which the utility of this part of the plan depends there seems no reason why a stock of intelligence instituted expressly for the benefit of the poorest classes should in as far as it is new be taken for a source of accession to the revenue it is no small matter that charity and that of so useful a sort be administered without expense to government that the revenue may not be deprived of any part of the supply at present derived from this source the company might compound with the stampoffice paying yearly and forever the greatest amount ever received in a year reckoning suppose ten years back for advertisements of this class in the character of a newspaper nothing it not being a paper of general intelligence escapes from without doors might be excepted from the composition so offers of service from and of employment to domestic servants male town servants at least who may be reckoned among the overpaid classes the benefit to them would still be great by the universality of the circulation—an indemnity to existing newspapers for the loss of this source of profit seems also to be requisite by no other hand than that of the proposed company could this invaluable national benefit be created to advantage by government not near so well by a loose multitude of scattered industryhouses under separate mangement not possibly—see book v constitution defended—the existing law of settlements and the existing law of apprenticeships both join in opposing the circulation of labour  0  the former would vanish of course the latter has ever been a nuisance against which many have protested and for which nobody has ever pretended to find a use chap ii mendicity extirpated— section i compulsion indispensable— the industryhouse system the company being invested with the necessary powers a certain means and in this country at least the only possible means of extirpating mendicity in this country under the existing poor laws every man has a right to be maintained in the character of a pauper at the public charge under which right he is in fact with a very few exceptions amounting not to one perhaps in fifty maintained in idleness but in this same country the condition of the common beggar is more eligible in his own estimation at least than that of a pauper maintained in idleness for if it were not he would become a pauper having it in his option so to do at any time it would be absurd therefore to expect that by any management—at least by any good management—the industryhouse provision could be rendered generally acceptable to beggars that is that a system which affords bare maintenance—maintenance in the most frugal and least luxurious shape—nor that otherwise than on the condition of working as far as ability extends to the full amount of it should be preferred to a mode of life exempt from working—to the condition of him who is not at present the lowest of those who are maintained in idleness if in any country out of england plans for the extirpation of mendicity without compulsion i e without bodily compulsion have met with a temporary success no inference can be drawn from the success of such a plan in those countries to the success of a similar plan in england since in those countries beggars being liable to starve and many doubtless being starved the question will have been whether to accept of the proffered provision or starve—whereas here the question would be whether to accept of it or to be maintained in idleness if notwithstanding the adoption of the proposed system in other respects begging were to be tolerated the nuisance would be much greater than at present since of those who are now maintained in idleness in the character of paupers multitudes rather than be set to work would become beggars section ii compulsion justifiable— mischiefs produced by the practice of begging—  in the instance of passengers in general considered as exposed to the importunity of beggars—to some the pain of sympathy—no pain no almsgiving—begging is a species of extortion to which the tenderhearted and they only are exposed   disgust which may exist where there is no sympathy—the sympathy experiences a sort of relief by giving the disgust finds no relief—from the disgust excited by the presence of a filthy beggar none but the equally filthy stand exempted the multitude of the persons subject to this pain of sympathy or to this disgust considered there can be little doubt but that the sum of these pains taken together is greater than the difference to the beggar in point of comfort between begging and working   discouragement to industry every penny spent is the reward of industry every penny given a bounty upon idleness—the luxuries seen in many instances to be enjoyed by beggars are a sort of insult to the hardworking child of industry by holding him out as a dupe who toils and torments himself to earn a maintenance inferior to what is to be earned by canting and grimace   facility afforded to real crimes—mendicity by the removal of shame removes one of the chief safeguards to honesty and to tolerate beggars would be to tolerate habitual depredators for those who are now unavowed employment hands would then if under that name subjected to compulsive industry declare themselves beggars   unfavourable influence on happiness even in the instance of the begging tribe itself taking the whole together—there are many it is true who for a time at least would unquestionably be no inconsiderable sufferers by the proposed change but the greater part would be gainers in point of happiness at least in the long run since—it being a property of this as of other unlaborious professions to be overstocked—for one prosperous and happy beggar there are probably many unprosperous and miserable ones wretches who notwithstanding keep lingering in their wretchedness sometimes for want of power sometimes for want of resolution to emerge from it the discomfort would cease at any rate with the existing stock of prosperous beggars the benefits would be everlasting and the disturbance of the prosperity of the prosperous ones appears to be a sacrifice necessary to the attainment of the benefit section iii plan for the apprehension of beggars— power to any one to apprehend a beggar begging in any public place and conduct him either to a constable or to the next industryhouse—obligation on constables and magistrates with power of commanding assistance—reward  0s or  0s advanced by the governor and charged to the beggars account the whole to the constable if he apprehends on view if on simple information the informer to have a quarter if on information accompanied with apprehension half—necessity in this case of admitting the informer as good evidence power of commitment to the governor or else to the chaplain the latter being without pecuniary interest in the management—intervention of a magistrate unless the chaplain should be nominated to the magistracy would produce complication and delay and might render the execution of the law  0  less steady time of detention till the beggars selfliberation account is balanced—see further on—items for which the beggar is to be debited—  reward for apprehension as above   expense of conveyance†   diet while in the house   use of clothing and bedding while in ditto   medicine or any other articles of separate expense   individuals share of the joint expense of the house for the time   ordinary profit upon so much of the companys capital as is employed in the defraying of that expense   expense of lifeassurance in this instance i e equivalent for the chance of his dying before his account is balanced section iv provision after discharge— beggars offer of service for any employment of his choice to be previously inserted in the employment gazette no discharge however without a responsible bondsman a housekeeper paying taxes undertaking for the giving him a specific employment not to be withdrawn till after suppose a weeks notice to the house giving notice also to the house of the beggars departure on whatever day it happens or the next the beggar to enter into a corresponding engagement on his part—not to depart from such service without suppose a weeks notice to the employer and upon departure to return that same day to the industryhouse unless provided with another employer on the same terms—and so toties quoties this probation period to continue say a year and at the end of it the beggar to be entitled to his certificate of full emancipation—failure of such notice or return to be considered as an escape and advertised as such in the employment gazette with a reward quadruple to the original one in case of a relapse into the begging trade the original reward doubled in case of a second relapse quadrupled and so on doubling it each time—the selfliberation account not to be balanced by money but by labour otherwise rich beggars might in despite of the provision continue their trade or if balanced by money only in part by coming in as a volunteer a beggar will save himself from the expense of being pressed and from the clog of the probation period the provision will tend so far to execute itself section v evasions obviated— classes that must be considered as beggars or the provisions would be nugatory   offerers of pretended services to passengers—examples street and road sweepers—layers of boards over kennels—linkbearers—the two last are apt to be in confederacy with pickpockets   pretended hawkers—hawking to be deemed a pretence if the quantity remaining exposed to sale be too small to afford a profit equal to a days subsistence licences might serve to distinguish the real from the pretended acceptance of alms in a road street or other public place with or without previous petition sufficient evidence of begging—dumb show may be as expressive as words section vi almsgivers unpunishable—   penalties on givers of alms would be needless since if nobody durst take nobody could give   unpopular being penalties on the exercise of what in respect of the disposition and motive or apparent motive at least could not be denied to be a virtue   obstructive of the end in view since in the case of begging by dumb show it would take off the only evidence—punishment is out of the question on both sides even in the case of the beggar what is proposed to be done is no more a punishment than sending a boy to school is a punishment no pain inflicted on purpose for the purpose of operating on others by the prospect of it and the duration of the discipline is made to depend upon the exertions of the party subject to it—in the instance of the lazy hand as in the instance of any industrious selfliberation hand section vii existing remedies incompetent— remedy  st punishment under the vagrant act c    geo ii ch v the effect of this provision is rather to obstruct the design than promote it—whipping does not give employment imprisonment in a common jail so far from giving employment excludes a man from it besides corrupting him by aggregating him with bad characters of all sorts out of the reach of all tutelary aggregation and inspection—the prisons called houses of correction are not universal and where they exist they afford little or nothing of correction but the name they either afford him no employment at all or an employment which will be no resource after discharge an employment not to be had elsewhere because not affording a maintenance to the workman together with an adequate profit to a masteremployer‡   the  0  law is inexecutable—the mere want of jailroom would itself be a physical bar to the execution of it the spare room in all the existing jails and houses of correction put together would scarcely lodge much less set to work the beggars alone without reckoning the unavowedemployment hands and other classes aimed at by the act were it even capable of being executed the necessary parties would not generally concur with the degree of willingness requisite for the execution of it—magistrates not were it only in consideration of the useless expense to the public constables not through compassion and fear of odium private informers not the reward being so small and on account of the known disinclination of the other parties the trouble of the business being so much more certain than the success hence it is that excepting the punishment of here and there an individual who happens to be particularly obnoxious things go on as if there were no such law and the limits that are set to the number of this tribe are set—not by the operation of the laws but by the quantum of encouragement afforded within a given space to this mode of life—if the law had any effect otherwise than in the way of casual and useless punishment it could only be that of driving a man out of the street into the poorhouse that is quartering him upon the unwilling instead of the willing remedy  d—private bondage—by an old statute still existing but scarcely known—  eliz ch iv—in the case of males under a selfappointed master from any age not under twelve up to sixty—this remedy such as it is includes beggars no otherwise than as it includes everybody certain denominations only excepted   females do not lie quite so completely at the mercy of a selfappointed master servitude expires when beauty begins to fade—at forty years of age—and the magistrate has a control upon the choice the very existence of a law like this is sufficient proof of the inefficiency of it since the execution of it would never be endured   with all its harshness towards the intended servant it holds out no adequate advantage to the intended master—for it affords him no adequate means of securing either the service or the person of the bondsman while willing servants are to be had upon such easy terms no man will encumber himself with an unwilling one without the power either of confining him to prevent escape or apprehending him afterwards parallel between the proposed remedy and the two existing ones existing remedy  st     whipping     scene of confinement a close prison     duration not abridgable by a mans own exertions     no means of industry     no means of future livelihood proposed remedy     no whipping or other punishment     scene of confinement a spacious country farm     duration abridgable by a mans own exertions     means and habit of industry uninterrupted     future livelihood secured existing remedy  d     term of servitude any number of years up to fortyeight according to a mans age     master selfappointed—anybody be his character ever so bad and temper ever so intolerable     scene a private house—unconspicuous—uninspectable proposed remedy     term a very few weeks or days more or fewer according to a mans own exertions     master a man of character and education appointed by a great public company     scene a public establishment of the most conspicuous kind—management transparent—inspection uninterrupted and universal chap iii habitual depredation extirpated— section i measures the same in kind as those which serve for the extirpation of mendicity will serve and suffice nor will any others suffice for the extirpation of habitual depredation but here the reward may be greater because the service is greater the mischief to which it applies the remedy being greater as also the danger that may attend the rendering the service the reward being greater the selfliberation period will be proportionally longer of course and the probationperiod may be rendered so the necessity of compulsion is still greater here because the repugnancy is still greater—beggars are so because they are above being paupers habitual depredators are so because they are above being beggars it would be a sad inconsistency to extirpate the undangerous habit and leave the dangerous habit untouched the habit of depredation may be inferred with the most perfect certainty and without the possibility of injury from the want of honest means of livelihood sufficient property as well as honest occupation included coupled with the nonexercise of mendicity for existence has no other means of support what is not known is whether a man is a smuggler—a sharper—a coiner—a thief—a highwayman—or an incendiary—what is known is that he is one or other of these or several in one this though an indirect  0  is an irrefragable proof—not only of an act of depredation but of a multitude of such acts a multitude sufficient to constitute a habit if any one of them were specifically proved in a legal way—in the course of a criminal prosecution—a man would be dealt with as a criminal this proof being wanting he can no otherwise be dealt with than as one to whom honest employment is necessary and who is not provided with it the inference with respect to the existence of the habit of depredation—the ground of proceeding—is therefore still stronger in the case of the unavowedemployment hand than in the case of the suspected hand or even the stigmatized hand in the first case there is certainty in the other it is but suspicion and apprehension—unless the suspected or stigmatized hand happens also to be an unavowedemployment hand a coincidence not unfrequent but nothing like universal the suspected hand having been adjudged unpunishable must not be punished the stigmatized hand having been punished sufficiently must not be punished more but this it has been already shown is not punishment—the remedy is in little danger of being employed where it is not wanted for if a suspected hand i e a person discharged for want of legal proof be really innocent and looked upon as innocent and of good character bondsmen will not be wanting even supposing him guilty and believed to be so if he be but a casual depredator not an habitual one for a bondsman may then get him on reduced terms and the reduction may be his indemnity for the risk section ii proof of habitual depredation— living without any assignable and honest source of income an act of which habitual depredation is the necessary consequence being a negative act or rather habit proof of it cannot be obtained but from the party himself positive acts offering themselves to sense proof of them may be obtained from those to whose senses they have presented themselves negative ones not offering themselves to sense can no otherwise be proved than in the way of inference viz from the want of proof of the opposite and corresponding positive matters of fact on the part of him whose interest it is or is made to furnish such proof and who is so circumstanced that supposing them to have had existence he could not but have it in his power to demonstrate it to put the party to the proof is in such a case to interrogate him interrogation of the party is therefore an indispensable ingredient in the proof of want of honest livelihood employment supposes an employer honest employment does not shun the light but court it employment that does not shun the light supposes witnesses to every circumstance belonging to it—the place operated in—the several subjectmatters of the operation—the operations themselves—so many partners to the operation—so many witnesses—and to the disposal of the result there are at least as many witnesses as there are parties to it and commonly many more under these circumstances any the slightest indication of the want of honest livelihood may be looked upon as affording sufficient ground for putting the question—have you any honest means of livelihood and if so what is it indications that may be established as sufficient grounds for examining a man for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has any sufficient means of honest livelihood and thence whether it shall be lawful and proper to consign him to an industryhouse in the character of an unavowedemployment hand—  conviction of an act of depredation—followed by punishment for a term and the punishment undergone the case of stigmatized hands—  prosecution for ditto grounded on oath though for want of legal proof not followed either by punishment or conviction or by stretch of prerogative the party withdrawn from punishment—the case of the suspected hand—  accusation of an act of depredation by a charge which though specific has been deemed insufficient in the character of a ground of commitment for trial—  oath by a person of character declarative of a suspicion that the party has no honest and adequate means of livelihood—  even strangership to the place if coupled with more than travellers stay and with apparent indigence examples of heads of interrogation—  what are your means of livelihood—  what has it been for say one year past—  in what places have you served or worked—  whom have you worked for or served under—  whom have you worked with—  with whom have you dealt for the materials and implements of your work—  with whom have you dealt for the produce c—if no answer or no satisfactory answer commitment to the next industryhouse on the footing of an unavowedemployment hand the answer in such a case seems not much in danger of containing falsehood the falsehood being in its nature so open to disproof—but in case of falsehood the answer being on oath will be punishable as perjury—power of provisional commitment to the industryhouse on declared suspicion of perjury whether the rule prohibiting the extraction or even reception of evidence deemed selfcriminative be reconcileable to the ends of justice—whether it be steadily observed by those who profess to regard it as sacred are questions which have here no place—here no crime—no punishment—no crimination—no selfcrimination section iii families of the disreputable classes— the provision would be incomplete if the rising generation were left out of it if it neglected the many after providing for the few—  nonadults being themselves beggars stigmatized hands suspected hands or unavowedemployment hands might be bound on the footing of apprentices their respective accounts on the selfliberation principle not to  0  open till their arrival at full age—  nonadults being children of a beggar and living with the parent might for this purpose be presumed beggars unless an adequate honest and industrious occupation be proved—  so in the case of the children of unavowedemployment hands—  children of a stigmatized or suspected hand to be presumed unavowedemployment hands unless as before—  also children of a confined hand confined in execution for a predatory offence—  children of a confined hand confined for ditto on mesne process to be consigned or not to the industryhouse till the trial of the parent on recommendation of the committing magistrate at the discretion of the chaplain of the house—  failing the father the mother or other next friend being master or mistress of the abode in which the child resides to be regarded on the footing of the father for this purpose—  children unless for special reason assigned by the children to be consigned to the same house with the father for his comfort and satisfaction exposed habitually to his view but to preserve them against corruption not exposed to his conversation unless in the presence of an officer or two or three quardian elders—  provision of detail against collusive apprenticeships and other contracts entered into for the purpose of frustrating the above provisions—the general presumption—that the parent is the childs best guardian—fails here the parental influence would be employed—not in the support of morality but in the destruction of it in the case of the notoriously immoral the parental power may require to be suspended till recovery as in the case of the insane and for that purpose transferred although involuntarily in the present case as it is voluntarily in the case of ordinary apprenticeship the wife of a beggar unavowedemployment hand stigmatized hand or suspected hand consigned to an industryhouse might be consigned if living with the husband to an industryhouse likewise unless by consent of all three parties the husband the wife and the direction board on report from the chaplain it should be ordered otherwise—and to the same house unless on petition by either husband or wife it be determined otherwise—and unless on like determination grounded on like petition the selfliberation accounts of husband and wife should then be consolidated into one—that when the parties go out they may go out together cohabitation should be received as presumptive proof of marriage for the purpose of justifying on the part of the company the exercise of power to this effect unless and until this presumptive marriage be disproved by a valid one with a husband or wife living at the time of the proof section iv efficiency of this plan by this plan might be accomplished—and that in a degree little short of perfection—upon an allcomprehensive scale—and not only without expense but with profit—what at a vast expense and with inadequate powers a most respectable society have so long been striving at upon a comparatively minute scale in      numbers provided for     rate of expense per head £    0s ayear over and above earnings total cost of the pauper population were the whole of it provided for at that rate £    0000 a year—extirpating habitual depredation will not extirpate depredation altogether but it will go a great way towards it—casual is probably the smaller branch section v ulterior securities— to give the plan even as against habitual depredation its utmost degree of efficiency might require some such institution as that of an universal register of names abodes and occupations with power to magistrates in certain cases to examine parties as to the truth of their returns—in a word mr morton pitts census rendered allcomprehensive and obligatory—fragments of such a work are growing up as it were of themselves this and more is done by government every half year in the case of the affluent and undangerous classes for the purpose of taxation those in whose instance it would be doubly useful are alone exempted from it were the examination even oral and public which however it need not be as well as universal the highest dignity would be rather illustrated than hurt by it† leaving the extirpation of casual depredation to some maturer age which with intelligence enough to recognise the defects in the law may possess energy enough to correct them were the proposed industryhouse system now established and the care of the police reposed with adequate powers in hands such as those which with such welldirected zeal and such unexampled celebrity we have seen employed in depicturing the existing state of it habitual depredation might even now be confined within a narrow range section vi existing law incompetent— the vagrant act    geo ii c   coupling the unavowedemployment class with the begging class and with so many other classes some differently pernicious some unpernicious is rendered incompetent to this purpose by the causes that have been seen and many more beside—it misdescribes the case—it falls short of it—it overshoots it—it violates justice by punishing as for delinquency without proof—a clause in the police act    geo iii  0  c    grafted on the vagrant act of infinitely superior texture but tainted with the irremediable vice of the original stock confines itself to a minute and accidental portion of the mischief and punishes as for repeated depredations without proof of one chap iv temporary indigence relieved— the best mode of relieving temporary indigence on the part of the selfmaintaining poor is—not by donations but by loans—loans preserve unimpaired the spirit of frugality and industry donations impair it by leading them to transfer their dependence from their own exertions to those of others gratuitous bounty from the company to the selfmaintaining poor would be inconsistent with the selfliberation principle—the main pillar of industry and economy when those who have nothing are not relieved gratis nor on any other terms than that of full payment in the way of work it would be an inconsistency to afford relief gratis to those who have wherewithal to pay for it gratuitous bounty is among the shapes which private charity may with propriety assume—where the expense arises out of a mans own pocket solely he will naturally be the more attentive to the justice of the claim when it comes wholly or principally out of the pockets of others as it would do if bestowed on the companys account by the agents of the company profusion has neither sufficient check nor certain bounds—see pauper systems compared—homeprovision—by loans made at a reduced rate compared with the established terms the company might afford an immense mass of substantial and unexceptionable relief without injury either to their own purse or to the morals of those whose momentary feelings they relieve in the instances in which dissipation is promoted by money advanced in the way of loan it would be favoured still more by money given without condition of repayment the governor with the privity of the chaplain might be empowered and directed to advance money either to all persons indiscriminately or to any particular class or classes meant to be favoured on the ground of the lowness of their wages the rate of interest little or not at all greater than what will be sufficient to cover common interest with the addition of the expense of management which with the assistance afforded by the official establishment and the population of the industryhouse might be very small—suppose six per cent per annum in the whole—to prevent wanton applications a fee must be taken on admission into the office for the purpose of borrowing and again on redeeming say a halfpenny or a farthing each time the expense of booking and ticketing included no loans being gratuitous the fraction due on the score of interest in each account would require in every case to be raised till it amounts to the lowest denomination of coin in the case of immoveable property possession not being sufficient evidence of title mortgageconveyance preceded by scrutiny into the goodness of the title would necessitate an additional expense were a law clerk to form a part of the establishment upon a fixed salary this might form part of his business the learning as well as labour of which might be reduced within a narrow compass by fixed forms in which case for the additional one per cent the mortgager might be exempted from the expenses of conveyance which bearing the larger ratio to the property the smaller it is in small properties such as cottages would eat up a great part of the value of what there is to pledge—and the goodness of the title being once ascertained the money might be advanced to him in small successive sums as he wanted it and after repayment readvanced all without addition to the expense which on the present plan cannot be done—this branch of relief would if exonerated from stampduties require to be confined in its application to property to value not exceeding a certain sum and in its application to persons it might be confined to labourers in husbandry as being the class lowest paid most apt to possess immoveable property in small parcels and in point of affection most attached to it reasons for supposing that six per cent with the above fees would defray the expense—at paris under a government establishment five and a half and in some cases five before the revolution used to defray it six per cent defrays it and with a considerable profit at hamburgh where before this public institution private pawnbrokers used to exact from sixty to eighty per cent at rome and in other parts of italy this branch of charity is or used to be administered upon as cheap or cheaper terms—in a proposed industryhouse part of the requisites are already provided for other purposes—a system of management and a system of bookkeeping—presiding local agents the governor and chaplain—a system of general superintendence the generaldirection board other parts would be furnished at a rate of expense prodigiously below the ordinary warehousemen and warehousewomen from amongst such of the elder members of the community as would be fit for little else—bookkeepers from the apprentice stock of which a sufficient number might soon be qualified for so simple a task—both classes maintained for less than £  ayear a head instead of eight or ten times the sum as under private pawnbrokers—in the meantime such of the existing transferable stock of adults as could write or read might be distributed for the  0  purpose as far as they would go—the distinction of the trust seconded or not by a small addition to their allowance would render the situation a desirable one the only considerable expense would be a warehouseroom the central part of which would serve for the keepers office chap v frugality assisted— section i exigencies operating as efficient causes or sources of demand for funds in store in the sphere of life in question viz that of the selfmaintaining poor particularly the lowestpaid classes of

lowest paid classes—  difference between customary personal expenditure of the man before marriage in england nearly equal generally speaking to the whole amount of earnings and customary personal expenditure of a man after marriage—the latter equal at most to no more than the portion of the earnings remaining after defraying the expenditure of the other members of the family   difference if any between customary personal expenditure on the part of the man after marriage and necessary personal expenditure of the man after the marriage   difference between customary family expenditure on the part of the rest of the family after marriage and necessary family expenditure on  0  the part of the rest of the family after the marriage—the sum of these differences will give the possible amount of savings capable of being laid up in store on the mans side during celibacy applicable to the defraying the first cost attending the marriage union or to the making provision for the several other exigencies above enumerated speaking of what is possible this proportion cannot be set down at less than threefourths of the earnings of a male of the lowestpaid class reckoning from his arrival at the age of highest earnings say twenty years as to the female of this class though her physical faculty of making earnings is perhaps by not more than onethird or onefourth inferior to what it is in the male yet her opportunities of turning that faculty to advantage are comparatively so slender and precarious as scarcely to present a ground for calculation capable of being put upon a level with the above section iii difficulty of hoarding— difficulties which the selfmaintaining poor are apt to labour under in respect to the layingup and improvement of their surplus monies—  want of physical means of safecustody—such as lockup places—thence danger of depredation and accidental loss—pocket the only strong box and that an unsafe one—  difficulty of opposing a neveryielding resistance to the temptations afforded by the instruments of sensual enjoyment where the means of purchasing them are constantly at hand—  want of the means of obtaining an equivalent especially on safe terms for the use of such small sums either in the shape of interest or in the shape of a supply adapted in its form and conditions to any of the several exigencies abovementioned—a bank instituted for the purpose of supplying this deficiency might be distinguished by the name of a frugalitybank—  want of a set of instructions and mementos constantly at hand presenting to view the several exigencies or sources of demand for money in store together with an indication of the most eligible means of making provision for the exigency in each case by means of a system of banks

considered as the commencement of complete or partial selfmaintenance   it might serve as a pledge on which he might borrow money of the company to supply a demand created by any species of exigency that may chance to present itself whether it be regularly accruing such as the above or purely casual and in either case whether it be of the afflictive class such as failure of employment or sickness as above or any other of the causes of impoverishment as exhibited in the table of cases calling for relief or of the lucrative kind—exigencies constituted by the opportunity or supposed opportunity of deriving a positive and extraordinary advantage from the use of a sum thus required for this he may be made to pay common interest to cover which the greatest sum lent may be restricted to an amount not quite equal to the amount of his contribution if at compound interest the amount of his debt comes at any time to equal the amount of his contribution the annuity is thereupon forfeited but the debt is cancelled when the money wanted to be borrowed exceeds the amount of the least portion of purchasemoney received—viz the abovesupposed £ —he may have the option of selling instead of pledging so many of his elementary annuities as correspond to it which would be the simpler mode though upon calculation if the lapse of time since the purchase has been considerable not quite so advantageous   by selling a certain number of these elementary annuities a man would at any time be able to raise money to serve as a marriage fund—nor ought such alienation to be accounted bad economy since to a bachelor or a maiden this nearer and more agreeable object would naturally be the foremost of the two the other of superannuation being chosen at that early period in no other view than that of securing the money and placing it out to advantage in the meantime—the age at which the formation of such a fund may be expected to commence may be in males from sixteen to eighteen or nineteen when the amount of earnings has got the start of the amount of physical wants and the youthful eye has begun to turn itself towards the opposite sex the idea of the attracting object especially if determinate will be a neverfailing encouragement to perseverence—contests may come to take place amongst suitors which shall have given the strongest proof of attachment by laying up the largest marriagefund in proportion to his means the publicity inherent to all transactions in which the company is a party will of course unless otherwise ordered in the present case for special reason give a correspondent publicity to these exertions of individual virtue—that the degree of exertion may be indicated as well as the magnitude of the result the total amount of the earnings may be in a line with the amount of the savings thus applied the degree of frugality being thus measured and exhibited a high degree may become proportionably honourable—not to be upon the list may even become disreputable a maiden known to have lovers may come to take a pride in the magnitude of such their respective sacrifices and to make a point of honour not to yield her hand till the degree of attachment   0 thus demonstrated has risen to a certain pitch—frugality being thus brought forward by desire as it were in a hotbed in the spring of life will maintain itself without difficulty in the maturer seasons what has been withdrawn by marriage from the provision for old age will gradually be restored and finally with increase throughout the circle of domestic expenditure the future will rise in its value in its comparison with the present—in england perhaps one day as high as in scotland it appears to stand already and whatever is taken from the distant future to be given to immediate comfort will be invested in articles of durable use rather than lavished upon the shortlived instruments of momentary gratification section iv friendly society banks inadequate— shown by reference to the above list of properties i solidity—as against the several causes of failure—causes of failure to which a frugalitybank stands exposed—  terms too favourable to the customer the result of want of calculation illconstructed calculation or illgrounded calculation the last a cause liable to take place in as far as the accessible stock of data or facts requisite to constitute a proper and sufficient ground happen to be defective to all these sources of profusion the solvency of the friendly societies taken in a mass appears to stand exposed for the principles of calculation they have access indeed to the works of the respectable authors who have laid the foundation of this branch of traffic but whether in each instance they have taken these authors or any other competent persons for their guides in these dangerous and slippery paths or whether they have taken any guide at all any other than the overweaning presumptions of such uninformed individuals to whose guidance the rest of the members may have happened to commit themselves is a matter which not only had been from the beginning but after all the attention that has been bestowed upon them by government still continues a matter of chance against so much of the danger as depends upon the want of data it is not in the power of skill to afford any adequate assistance in the case of superannuationprovision and widowprovision the two most important of the exigencies for which provision is made by any of these societies the whole stock of data known to exist seems deplorably deficient nor is the deficiency such as can be supplied without the aid of government†       further cause of failure embezzlement or dissipation embezzlement in the hands of some unfaithful member or dissipation by the insolvency of some third person to whom the fund has been lent for the purpose of obtaining an interest from it   another cause of failure—dissolution of the society in consequence of disagreements among the members—of the influence manifested by these two last causes among the friendly societies examples but too numerous are to be found in eden how sure a refuge might not they have found in a bank kept by the proposed company ii plan of provision allcomprehensive and changeable at the will of the customer under this head the plans of the friendly societies appear to be considerably diversified but where the plan is most comprehensive it is far from being adequately so and as to the faculty of transmutation it is probably without example the exigency provided against is in some instances sickness alone—in some possibly superannuation alone—in more probably sickness and superannuation together—in others sickness and widowhood together—in others perhaps all three—in some perhaps the greater number these useful objects are unhappily combined with an ostentatious and expensive burial in no instance does the plan extend to the affording a provision for the expenses of marriage—against failure of employment unaccompanied by sickness—or against the temporary burden resulting from an extra number of children under the selfmaintaining age in the two first of these instances the smallness of the fund in the case of these local associations is an invincible obstacle to the making provision for the exigency since in this line of life more particularly it is convenient to a man at least that his contribution be received from him in any quantities and in the list of exigencies there are several demands to the satisfaction of which it is essential that it be returned to him in any proportion and at any time he pleases but a fund composed altogether of the petty and unincreasable contributions of a small and determinate number of individuals can leave no such room for individual will to operate whether the contribution be in the form of a gross sum or in that of a chain of payments or in a compound of both forms no part of it can ever be given back but in the case of the particular exigency against which it provides if it be a chain of payments the chain must     continue unbroken and the links undiminished or all security is at an end but great as is the mass of population thus provided for in the whole it is still not near so great as it might be if the comprehensiveness of the scheme in regard to persons were not reduced by a variety of conditions limitations exceptions and exclusions some direct and intentional others indirect and unthought of the members being to pass more or less of their time in company with each other they must not be unacceptable to each other hence acception of persons and occasional rejection of individuals in some places community of occupation is regarded as a necessary bond of union in that case the benefit is confined to a few of the most populous occupations differences resulting from sex religion party and a variety of other sources add to the causes by which not only scattered individuals but whole majorities are excluded for if forty are necessary to make up a society and out of the only forty whom the vicinity would have afforded a single one stands excluded the exclusion envelops in effect the other thirtynine—among the unperceived or at least undesigned causes of exclusion may be reckoned the comprehending under one association objects which in this point of view are repugnant to each other an individual who with reference to one of these objects would be an acceptable associate being an unacceptable one with reference to another thus a man who by reason of occupation or constitution is regarded as a bad life would not on that account be a member the less acceptable but the more acceptable to a society confining itself in its object to provision for old age as it happens the only society within his reach is a society which to that remote object adds the immediate one of a provision during sickness but the same cause which brings death near is apt enough to render sickness habitually frequent apprehension of a mans adding to the immediate burden occasions him to be regarded as a dangerous associate and he thence becomes excluded from taking his chance for the more distant benefit for which he would have been an acceptable coadventurer had he stood alone when provision for widows to commence with the death of the husband is confined with provision for old age in the shape of a superannuation annuity payable to the man the case may be much the same to a society confined in its object to provision for old age an unhealthy man would appear a valuable member on account of the apparent improbability of his ever reaching that age but the only society situate within his reach happens to unite both objects and the apparent goodness of his wifes life when coupled with his own unhealthiness more than compensates the advantage promised by the apparent badness of his own life the two benefits not being to be purchased but in conjunction he thence becomes debarred from both by his unacceptableness with reference to one iii scale of dealing accommodated to the pecuniary     faculties of each customer this property is scarcely possessed or so much as capable of being possessed by a friendly society bank not only the original calculations but the current accounts would be too complicated for any literary talents or at least too operose for any time which such an association could in general be expected to afford the contribution is paid at so much per week or per month the same for each contributor though in some instances the amount of the earnings from whence it is drawn may be some number of times greater than in others in general compared to earnings the amount of it appears to be very small from  d to  s aweek where the earnings may run from  s to   s or more so that frugality though invited to raise itself to this low pitch is in a manner kept from rising higher its claims having been acceded to up to this standard height will be apt to be looked upon as satisfied and thus a man who might by possibility lay up above £ 0 a year and with comfort and decency £ 0 or £ 0 is supposed to have done enough when he has laid up two and fifty shillings—on the other hand small as the contribution is it may yet be too much for an individual already burdened with a numerous family and belonging to the lowestpaid class hence another source of unobserved exclusions though for the same individual before marriage a contribution some number of times greater might not have been too great iv terms of dealing sufficiently advantageous to the customer this property antagonizes with and forms the limit of the more important property of solidity due provision being made for that superior object then and not till then the more advantageous the terms can be made the better as to the friendly societies it is not natural that they should be found deficient under this head—the danger is as we have seen that of their promising more than they will be able to pay rather than not so much the mischief resulting from want of calculation illconstructed calculation or illgrounded calculation vibrates between these two dangers—in one place too much is allowed in return for contribution and there bankruptcy is the consequence in another not so much as might have been allowed and there a proportionable part of the benefit is lost—the scale of variation being so great stretching from below twenty to one to above sixty to one the coexistence of these two opposite mischiefs seems an inevitable result of the assumption of a common standard for all places even though that standard were the exact representative of the national rate in the case of a national frugalitybank such as that proposed if the standard be but just both mischiefs are completely obviated v vi vii place of transacting business suitable in other points as well as that of vicinity—mode of transacting business prompt as well as accommodating in regard to times and quantities of receipts and payments among the friendly societies with few or perhaps no exceptions the office of this sort of the frugalitybank is at a publichouse for here it must be or nowhere this being the only sort of house to which it is convenient to be thus employed at the same time if there were any option in the case choosing a tipplinghouse for a school of frugality would be like choosing a brothel for a school of continence the sacrifice a man is enabled to make to that virtue is small and limited the sacrifice he is perpetually solicited to make to a habit which is the most formidable adversary of this virtue has no bounds the obligation commonly annexed of spending at this office not less than a certain quantity of money perhaps  d for every shilling saved as well as a certain quantity of time an evening in every month or every week would be a very heavy tax on the contribution to frugality if the contribution itself were not so slight in proportion to the means and if either already or in consequence of a mans admission into the society the tax were not so unhappily habitual and congenial to inclination as to present itself as if divested of all its burdensomeness be this as it may here comes in another addition to the list of unperceived exclusions since whatever may be the benefit no man is admitted to the purchase of it who will not frequent an alehouse as to vicinity the associations in question are thus far exempt from disadvantage on that     score that the members in their quality of bankers are in every such society sufficiently within reach of one another in their quality of customers to the bank but this circumstance is in effect but another cause of exclusion under the mask of a convenience since in as far as this condition fails the society fails of extending itself at the same time it may be owing in no small degree to the difficulty of collecting together members within reach of one another that is within reach of the common office the publichouse in number sufficient to form a society for this purpose and capable of sparing the necessary proportion of the working time that the benefit such as it is is mostly confined to towns as to the times for receiving contributions and paying allowances these are points that in the instance of these societies must be fixed by general regulation and in respect of which little or no indulgence can accordingly be shown to individual convenience the contribution must be so much a week or so much a month less cannot be accepted for no further advantage can be allowed—the time must be the periodical time of meeting and no other as to the companys system of frugalitybanks in point of mere vicinity if confined to the system of industryhouses they certainly would be in no small degree inferior to the system of public houses which officiate in that capacity to the existing societies but even were no further accommodation provided the advantages it would have in those other respects seem to be more than an adequate compensation for this head of disadvantage no tax—no obligation to drink—neither obligation nor invitation to rob the domestic circle of a regularly recurring evening ten miles the utmost distance—times more or less frequent governed altogether by individual convenience—the time consumed by the augmentation of distance might in many instances be made up for by the diminution in the number of attendances and the time of the week might be the day for wherefore should it not be on which time considered in a pecuniary light has no value should this not be enough the vestryroom of each place of worship presents an office as near and the clerk an officer or subagent as suitable as can be desired the minister and churchwardens would be his natural inspectors in a place in which he is already stationed by his existing and more important duties the smallest coin current multiplied by the number of members and that by the number of times of payment in the instance of each would afford a compensation more than adequate to his trouble for the service thus rendered to morality religion need not go unrewarded attendance on the service of the day might be a condition precedent and its offices rendered preparatory to the exercise of this virtue money transactions are neither illsuited nor foreign to the main business of the day when sanctified by the occasion or the use witness surplicefees communion offerings collections on briefs—and if a money transaction be sanctified by charity why not by a virtue which stands paramount to charity herself by preventing the mischief for which her best exertions are but a palliative viii mode of bookkeeping clear and satisfactory—in the instance of the existing societies the provision made in favour of frugality being so inadequate the plan of bookkeeping necessary will be proportionably simple and indeed so simple that the stock of literary acquirements existing in each society does not it is true appear likely to be found in many instances inadequate to the task but the proposed company in their quality of keepers of a universal frugalitybank would not extend their scheme of provision without providing a system of bookkeeping altogether competent to the purpose under their management that degree of competency which at present is exposed everywhere to contingencies would be certain and universal ix exemption from collateral inconveniences—collateral mischiefs to which the management of the friendly societies is liable to give birth as appears by examples from eden and from all which by the management of the proposed company the business would be cleared   drunkenness and dissipation as above   disagreements and quarrels—results mischievous to themselves besides operating occasionally in quality of causes of dissolution as above   combinations for sinister purposes of a professional or other comparatively private nature—such as rise of wages always in favour of occupations already overpaid or diminution of working hours   combinations for sinister purposes of a public nature—the raging malady of the times section vii exigencies to which the companys bank is least competent— these are such and such only in which the result of the largeness of the society may be the danger of its not defending itself with sufficient vigilance against the arts of customers the interest of each associate in each transaction decreasing as the multitude of associates increases among these cases would evidently be to be found those of simple failure of employment sickness and provision for widows on the supposition that in return for the considerationmoney received the burden to an unlimited amount—to a value not limited by that of the considerationmoney in each instance—is to be borne by the company—  as to failure of employment the exigency itself is so absolutely dependent on the will of the customer as to be palpably unsusceptible     of being insured against on such terms to a man who has an employment which fills up his time and affords him the means of living it will not commonly be a very easy matter to appear to have none but there is no man who could not so manage matters as not to have any such employment   sickness indeed is not altogether in this case but it is too much so to be capable of being provided against upon these terms by so large a company without an evident danger of incalculable loss   even in the case of provision for widows though the event from which the actual commencement of the burden takes its date is not to be considered as being as in the former cases dependent upon the will of the customer yet the knowledge of the matter of fact in regard to constitution occupation c on which the probable duration of life depends and thence on which the terms of the contract or even the reception of a candidate in his proffered quality of customer may be made to depend—and therefore in this way the probable commencement of the burden in each instance are in no small degree dependent on his will against the danger here in question in the case of provision against sickness there seems to be but one remedy viz the calling in the aid of the dutyandinterest junction principle and taking for sharers in the bargain some individual or small assemblage of individuals whose personal interest in the event of each bargain shall be adequate to the purpose—in the case of provision for widows there is besides the above remedy that of reducing the burden of the allowance to a rate adjusted to the supposed utmost efficacy of the cause of disadvantage and for that purpose supposing the lives of husbands among the customers of the bank to be as much worse than ordinary and that of wives as much better than ordinary as the purpose shall be found to require if the latter remedy be not employed there remains still unprovided against in the case of this mode of provision for widows the danger of a sinister and secret interest on the part of the agent strong enough to overcome the known and legitimate interest by which his fidelity is endeavoured to be insured and upon the whole these are the branches of the trade of assurance which appear the least adapted of any to the constitution of the proposed company in the case of a provision for widows in no other shape than that of a superannuationannuity as the commencement of the burden depends—not as before upon the badness of the life of the man but upon the goodness of the life of the woman the danger of imposition has no place this as well as every other case of a superannuationannuity is as competent to the constitution of the company as any branch of assurance can be and as competent to the constitution of the proposed company as to any other company existing or proposable—and this is the only shape in which provision for widows is adapted to the situation of the lowestpaid classes that is to the bulk of selfmaintaining hands for surely it is not a matter even to be wished for that a woman who during her husbands life has been subjected to labour should be raised above it by his death in those cases to which the companys management is applicable with least advantage it is not that this management is less competent to the enabling an individual to make provision for the exigency but only as to the making provision against it in a particular mode—viz in the way of insurance—for to a party     who is content to be his own insurer the companys bank as we have seen holds out against this as well as so many other exigencies a provision not to be derived from any other source if a man has time beforehand it enables him to lay up a fund of selfrelief by means of which he may be provided for in his own way at his own time—if for want of time or otherwise he has laid up no such fund at the worst it provides for him on the selfliberation plan in an industryhouse compared with selfinsurance insurance by contract as in other cases so more particularly in this seems it is true most favourable to happiness upon the whole the distribution of good and evil being in this way more equable—for though what there is of personal suffering in the case is incapable of being distributed yet its concomitant the pecuniary burden is distributed by this means and by being distributed the pressure of it upon the whole is lessened—and the strength given by exercise to the benevolent affections and to the habit of beneficence is a kind of indirect advantage which in a moral point of view is not to be contemned to this mode of provision the company though it were not itself to embark in the adventurous part might afford very considerable encouragement and assistance by undertaking in terms attended with no risk to itself but with a moderate advantage the receipt of contributions the payment of allowances and the charge of bookkeeping the company would ease the associations of all danger and apprehension of embezzlement and dissipation it might release them of a great part of the burden of attendance and exempt them from the dangers of discord and dissolution it would contribute in a great variety of ways to increase the amount of the population thus associated it might reduce the number necessary to the forming an association by taking for itself which it might do without danger a certain proportion of the shares—as far as ten suppose out of forty—by enabling those to form a common purse who by reason of any of the causes of separation above spoken of—as religion party private disagreement and the like—might have been prevented from forming a common assembly—in a word it might remove almost without exception the various causes of latent exclusion above exemplified or alluded to so in the case of associations bound for annuities to commence at widowhood—the company might perhaps not think it advisable ever to contract any obligation of that sort on its own account—at any rate it could never pledge itself for the discharge of obligations already contracted on this score of existing associations—but it might take their funds into its own hands keep account of the produce and undertake for the discharge of the engagements as far as that produce extended and no further the benefit that has resulted from these associations is as important as it is extensive the principle of frugality being rendered popular the foundation is laid the chief difficulty removed what regards relief under sickness is unmixed good—thousands and tens of thousands must have been preserved by it from death misery and pensioned idleness—but of what concerns provision against distant contingencies the result is in the clouds it is in vain to inquire into remote effects when the state even of existing causes is wrapt in darkness who can say to what extravagancies overweaning hope may not have soared while unlettered minds have been left to wander in the field of calculation without a guide—take even the oldest of these bodies the past prosperity were it ever so universal can scarce as yet have afforded any pledge of future the oldest cannot as yet have reached the age of trial meantime safe or unsafe how little they have done or can do towards satisfying the demands of frugality in their fullest extent and in all their diversity of shape has been already seen the body of collateral mischief of which they may prove pregnant appears not to be inconsiderable† but whatever there may be of danger in the institution results from circumstances that are altogether accidental to it—the multitudinous and unbridled concourse of rough and uncultivated minds—democracy is no more of the essence of frugality than it is of prudence tranquillity or science the benefits result from the object itself the disposition to frugality the mischiefs from the means which chance has hitherto furnished for the exercise of that virtue under the management of the proposed company the mischiefs would drop off of course the benefit would remain—with vast increase of magnitude and in its most perfect purity were the disadvantages attached to these petty frugality banks as compared with the proposed general frugality bank ever so considerable it does not follow that it would be abstractedly useful any more than honestly practicable to employ the hand of government     to break them up the companys general bank being added and these particular banks remaining as they are the customer in this as in most cases could not but be a gainer by the competition whatever part of this business they chose should be done for them by the companys bank it would always be ready to do for them on preadjusted terms whatever part they either found they could not do or conceived that the company would do for them better than they could do for themselves they would of course give the doing of it to the company and if in any instance the result of their choosing to do their own business instead of turning it over to the company should be its being ill done they could only have themselves to thank for it the cases in which it is not better for a man to suffer by his own will than to be saved against his will are neither many nor very easy to determine in every shape in which assistance could be wished—instruction—legal powers—pecuniary funds—trustworthy hands—the company with its allcomprehensive and omnipresent bank would never cease to hold out to them a sure and inexhaustible resource chap vi pecuniary remittance facilitated to the poor— disadvantage the poorest and most numerous classes labour under in this respect the relative of expense of remittance increasing as the sum to be remitted decreases a considerable proportion of the selfmaintaining poor of this country are stationed habitually at a distance from their dearest connexions in this humble line of life so small a sum as a crown or halfcrown might be no inconsiderable assistance—from a parent to a child—from a child to an infirm parent or grandparent—from a sister to a sister c—there are individuals in this country to whose expenditure £ 00 does not bear so great a proportion as halfacrown does to the expenditure of many an individual among the selfmaintaining poor—useful arrangements taken by the postoffice relative to this head since the first penning of this paper but these arrangements do not altogether come up to the present purpose neither the least sum nor the retribution being quite small enough nor does the post in all places reach the cottage of the poor† this part of the business of remittance might be managed by the assistance of the company in and from the several industryhouses for the benefit of the lowest paid classes with proper checks such as the letters being sent open c to save the benefit from being usurped by those who have no need of it the accommodation will of course be the more valuable the more frequent and regular the intercourse between the several industryhouses and the parishes within their respective circuits by the use proposed to be made of each vestryroom in the quality of a suboffice to the proposed system of frugality banks the demand for this intercourse would naturally be increased leaving other days to casual opportunity sunday the day of universal leisure and social intercourse among the poor might be a day of regular communication between each industryhouse and the several parishes within its circuit special messengers would seldom be necessary the visits which the inhabitants of each industryhouse would of their own accord be making to their friends in the respective parishes would in general be sufficient for executing these and such other commissions as there might be occasion to give them from the house—for the facilities that might be given to conveyance see the next chapter chap vii distant conveyance facilitated to the poor— use of the industryhouses in the capacity of frugalityinns and frugalconveyancestages—mean distance from house to house on one supposition fifteen miles on another but ten miles and twothirds inns are altogether unnecessary where comparing the distance between house and house with the ability of the traveller in respect of selfconveyance he can make his way from house to house without stopping for a nights rest but houses for stopping at in the day time are not necessary to the poor traveller repose he finds at the worst upon the ground food he carries in his pocket from

connexions whom he wishes to visit though it were at the remotest part of south britain if able no loss for want of his labour need be incurred ten or even fifteen miles aday would scarcely make too large an addition to his ordinary days labour even if it were of the hardwork kind none at all if it were of the sitting work or other slightwork kind when not employed for travelling as above the asses attached to proper vehicles might serve for giving open air in conjunction with exercise to the children beneath the selfconveying age and to the bedridden—especially on sundays—see book iv pauper comforts ii use to the selfmaintaining poor—travelling all over the country wherever their occasions lead them—setting out without money and arriving with money in their pockets at present this cannot be done because there is nobody in a condition to give employment at such short warning in large or small quantities as it may happen to persons unknown coming in any number a man having money in his pocket might work or not work as he chose—taking the benefit of the diet and lodging at the cheap price of the house instead of using a publichouse under the obligation of paying for expensive food and liquors domestic ties would be strengthened and social affections cherished by laying open in this way to the poor those opportunities of occasional intercourse and uninterrupted sympathy which at present are monopolized by affluence persons under engagement to or in relation to whom this accommodation might be particularly convenient—  soldiers   militiamen   seamen   marines—on

england as advertised in the companys employmentgazette—see ch i—so many industryhouses as a man were thus led to visit so many establishments alike prepared in the capacity of frugalitybanks and remittanceoffices to enable him to lay up improve or remit whatever savings he may have made—see ch v and vi iv confined hands—persons travelling in custody—  suspected hands arrested and to be passed on mesne process or in execution   delinquents by delinquencies of an inferior class arrested and to be passed on mesne process or in execution   debtors arrested and to be passed on mesne process or

ward with provision for appropriate separation and aggregation carried to the utmost extent see book ii ch ii and capable of affording assistance upon occasion to constables and bailiffs thus would be superseded the necessity of irons for suspected hands and the expense of occasional extra guards for confined hands of all classes debts would thus be payable by industryhouses though not by prisons—see the ensuing chapter chap viii imprisonment rendered unexpensive and reformative— efficient causes of corruption—  idleness i e want of honest occupation   corruptive aggregation   exemption from tutelary inspection   access to the means of intoxication—efficient causes of reformation the reverse of the above   industry i e honest and profityielding occupation   tutelary as well as innoxious aggregation   constant tutelary inspection   seclusion from the means of intoxication—the presence of all these causes of corruption is of the essence of a prison a few of the lately improved prisons excepted where an imperfect dose of the efficient causes of reformation viz industry absence of corruptive aggregation and seclusion from the means of intoxication but without tutelary aggregation or constant inspection is purchased by means of separate lodgment and thence at an enormous price the perfect absence of all the efficient causes of corruption the perfect presence of all the efficient causes of reformation—is equally of the essence of a proposed industryhouse† none of these requisites of a prison except confinement are to be found in any ordinary prison all of them would be to be found in every industryhouse practical consequence—common prisons ought to be extirpated as common nuisances and their function supplied by a     strong ward in each of the proposed industryhouses an industryhouse would need no howard—no paul—no pitt—every man might be a howard without danger difficulty trouble or merit any man by looking at the companys journal might know incomparably more of every industryhouse the prisonerpart of its inhabitants included than howard could ever know of any prison the passing moment filled the measure of his knowledge—terror and safe custody are the only purposes answered at present by the use of ordinary prisons those securities being indispensable prisons of some sort or other must still be employed though corruption instead of reformation be the price paid for the advantage some men must be sent there or the fear of being sent there would not find its way into the bosoms of the rest prisons are what they are because they have been what they are when prisons were first built not an idea of the system of antiseptics here exhibited had ever presented itself to view in process of time the whole system of imprisonment might be undertaken by the company to the universal advantage of all parties interested—debtors and delinquents from the higher lines of life are the only classes of prisoners who could not be accommodated to advantage in a proposed industryhouse without additions for the purpose precedent debts due to creditors at large might as well be worked out upon the selfliberation plan as debts due to the company for sicknessrelief administered in advance chap ix domestic morality enforced— at present unless the disease be violent indeed imprisonment the only remedy besides being mostly placed out of reach by the expenses natural and artificial of procedure being but an aggravation of the disease domestic disorders are as it were without remedy a fit remedy would for the first time be brought into existence by the proposed industryhouses i classes to whom an industryhouse might be of use in the capacity of a reformationhouse—  bad apprentices—at the instance of the master—  bad children—at the instance of the father or guardian—  bad wives—at the instance of the husband—at the instance of the father by the mere parental authority—in the other cases by adjudication of one or two magistrates ii conversely it might be little less useful in the capacity of an asylum against domestic tyranny—  from the power of a bad master—  a bad father or guardian—  or a bad husband—in this latter case adjudication it should seem would be scarcely necessary without serious illtreatment a wife would hardly exchange matrimonial comforts an independent abode and the government of a family for celibacy under inspection—in company of her own sex only and not of her own choice spite or a project of governing the husband by fear of the privation would hardly go such lengths—neither malice nor ambition are to such a degree stronger than selfregard—preferableness of such an asylum to a domestic one in the present case though it were under the protection of a parent or elder relation of the same sex—elopement though it were to the house of a natural guardian is seldom exempt from danger never from suspicion during the attractive age infidelity when it was not the cause being in such circumstances but too natural an effect on reconciliation the industryhouse like a wellregulated convent but free from the objections that attach on convents would restore the fugitive without spot or suspicion to the marital arms† there as in a convent conjugal infidelity become scandalous might moreover receive its punishment from a tribunal of magistrates—sitting in private unless publicity with or without the intervention of the ecclesiastical court or a jury be reclaimed by either of the parties‡ iii utility of the industryhouse regimen to divers classes comprised within the principal design of it in the character of a certificate as well as of a pledge of good behaviour in their respective spheres   and   to outofplace domestic servants of the female sex it would be a preservation of chastity and of reputation of chastity so of the habit of industry and regular obedience in both sexes   and   to repentant prostitutes and to friendless females at the approach of the perilous age it would be an asylum for the benefit of the lower classes that is the great bulk of the community doing upon a universal scale and without expense that sort of good which is endeavoured to be done upon a minute scale but at no minute expense by two magnificent as well as benevolent institutions—in a style of accommodation congenial as is but natural to the habits and sentiments—not so much of the classes into which they are to be returned   0 as of those higher classes to which they are indebted for their support iv under the plan already traced the employment gazette itself see ch i will be a perpetual school of morality—an inexhaustible fund of unexpensive premiums for good behaviour the more points of good character a man can muster the better and speedier his chance for employment and the better the terms upon which he will be received the inference is natural from theory and there will be the evidence of experience—published experience—to show whether it be not just let it not be imagined that because the place is the same the treatment given in it may not be infinitely diversified there is nothing either in relief or in correction that should render them incapable of being administered—administered to the pinnacle of perfection—within the compass of the same walls even now the same chamber is witness to the caresses given to the dutiful and the chastisement given to the froward child it is in truth but through want of wisdom not by any law of nature that the disparity has remained hitherto so wide between penal justice and domestic discipline good order is a condition not less necessary to the delicacies of domestic comfort than to the utmost severities of public justice the presence of the fostering hand is not less necessary to the infant of the feeding hand to the hungry of the assisting hand to the infirm of the healing hand to the sick of the soothing hand to the afflicted or of the ministering hand to the luxurious than that of the avenging hand to the criminal who is to be punished for his crimes the one thing needful was a perfect and general instrument of good order—an instrument not to be constructed without the aid of the inspectionarchitecture the desideratum being found good order may be introduced into any system of management and applied to all purposes that end in utility however wide of each other they may appear to spread at the first stage chap x national force strengthened without expense— section i land force— another collateral benefit of a most important nature deducible from the proposed industryhouse system—without effort—without disbursement—without expense to anybody—a nursery—a supplement—and in part a succedaneum—to the existing system of national defence one of the members of the official establishment a drillserjeant—on sundays to act as such in training the fencible part of the apprenticestock after an appropriate prayer—on weekdays in the capacity of a clerk—arms for exercise whatever have been condemned as unserviceable as far as they will go—age of training from fourteen or earlier—age of requisition from eighteen seventeen or even sixteen—numbers to be expected by the time the accumulation of the apprenticestock has attained its maximum according to a basis of calculation not now relied upon but to which the eventual number if deficient might by the means of extension hereinafter suggested beyond a doubt be raised from sixteen to eighteen       from eighteen to twentyone       from sixteen to twentyone       the establishment of officers would be framed of course upon the existing constitutional plan—some of the inferior the crown might perhaps find a convenience in selecting out of the official establishments to whose authority those privates will have been in the habit of paying such unvarying obedience—the superior from the landed strength of the country as at present utility of a corps thus constituted not only against the rare and contingent danger of invasion but as an eligible and universally present succedaneum to the less popular assistance of the regular force against casual tumults the result of sudden and partial discontents sequestered from the world at large the intercourse as between house and house written as well as personal being altogether at the companys command that is through the company at the command of government and of that public on which government depends for its existence no existing body of military force could be equally proof against seductions and combinations completely trained by so many years of exercise at the expiration of their apprenticeship and consequent diffusion into the mass of the population they would form an ample fund of disciplined force ever ready in the hour of exigency not the slightest idea of hardship could attach upon this gentle and selfexecuting institution under the military conscriptions that prevail in russia austria and prussia the discipline is severe the service constant and frequently foreign the danger frequent and in full prospect here the service is purely homeservice the duties occasional only the dangers no other than what they will have been prepared for from birth and those contingent and unless at a moment like the present scarcely to be looked upon as probable—the whole concern instead of a terror an exercise a pastime and a spectacle—no need of their lodging any of them anywhere out of an industryhouse unless in case of an immediate approaching invasion were even the service ever so irksome and the dangers ever so serious there are none surely on whom the lot could fall with equal justice as upon those who indebted to public charity all of them for maintenance and education many of them for life itself may literally be termed the fosterchildren of the country inconveniences attending the militia establishment on its present footing—the obligation falling by lot on individuals many of them illadapted to it by disposition none of them prepared for it by education—married men taken from their families and the burden of     maintaining those families thrown upon the public—a great and recent addition to the burden of the poorrates—all of them exposed to the influence of corruptive aggregation and initiated since such is the custom into habits of idleness and dissipation—all thrown out of employment—a means of existence which on their return to their families and homes many of them may find it difficult to recover section ii naval force— the maritime industryhouses adjacent to the seacoast or great rivers would be a natural nursery for the navy—private as well as public—a suitable turn might be given to the education of the apprenticestock—swimming universal†—here they might be initiated from the earliest age in the exercise of the handicraft arts practised on shipboard—examples—oakumpicking—ropesplicing—sailmaking—netweaving—even ship and boatcarpentry alternately with land trades in peace time practised exclusively in war time—see book ii ch viii—navigation the literary part of it might be added here to whatever schoollearning were taught on sundays on the principle of the sunday schools—minds as well as bodies being thus prepared for this branch of service by original destination education example and habit the male youth of the maritime industryhouses would constitute a sort of naval militia—but should at the same time be trained to the land exercise as well as those of the inland houses in situations where the fishing business could be carried on at ordinary times without loss upon occasion of a glut instead of degrading this valuable food to a manure the opportunity might be embraced of victualling the circumjacent industryhouses to a considerable distance—inland as well as coastwise‡ could any use be derived from the maritime industryhouses towards forming a chain of signals the chain of maritime industryhouses might form a valuable addition to the existing stock of sources of relief against shipdistress and shipwreck by means of an outpost or two here and there betwixt house and house a chain of telegraphic communication embracing the whole coast might thus be kept up at a comparatively small expense section iii naval timber— by report   th of the commissioners for inquiring into the land revenue printed in      the stock of shiptimber in the country is lessening and growing precarious—the nature of the proprietorship in the case of the proposed company would be peculiarly favourable to the rearing and maintaining of a stock that can be depended upon the landlord here would neither be forced by necessity nor so much as have it in his power to cut timber at a premature growth—elsewhere it requires a numerous and uninterrupted succession of frugal and uninterruptedly prosperous landlords to preserve an oak to its full size here the vegetable hopes of the nation would not be left at the mercy of careless malicious or predatory tenants no persons having access to the plantations but such as would be more under command than either the neighbours or the inhabitants of a private estate and incapable of enjoying the fruit of depredation without discovery the preservation of the plantations might be rendered the joint interest and concern of the company and government the company at the same time might lie under a perpetual injunction as to the cutting of timber otherwise than with the allowance of government and might be under an obligation to keep a perpetual account of it tree by tree—a sort of obligation to which ordinary proprietors cannot be subjected a periodical state of the timber verified by oath of proper eyewitnesses might be included in the companys periodical reports the plan of bookkeeping would of course be extended to this most valuable part of the stock the plantations delineated upon a scale in which from the first the number of plants within a given square and after thinning the place of each remaining plant might be marked and the plant denominated by a number—annual surveys enumerations and valuations—plantation book—in which every plant as it disappears shall be marked off and the cause or supposed cause of its disappearance entered under heads—as natural decay—blown down—destroyed by animals—naming the animals when ascertainable as hares rabbits c—places for a plantation in every industryhouse demesne where soil and situation permitted would be   the wardseparation belt—  the exteriorsequestration belt viz the belt planted for the purpose of contributing to the general design of sequestering the apprenticestock from promiscuous association with individuals at large—see book ii ch ii and iii chap xi rate of infant mortality diminished— under the head of childnursing book ii ch ix together with what bears relation to that subject in the chapter on the principles of management ch iv a plan has been sketched out by which the rate of mortality during the whole of the apprenticeperiod but more particularly during the trying period of infancy bids fair for being reduced to its lowest terms—lower much lower—for what should hinder it—in this hitherto neglected line of life than in those higher     lines—the highest not excepted—which command every attention that opulence can procure under the head of education including what bears relation to that subject in the chapters on the principles of management and on employment a plan has been sketched out by which under that important head the condition of the companys wards promises to be placed upon a footing obviously more eligible than that of the children of the selfmaintaining poor even in the highestpaid classes—condition in life is better and better in the ratio of the stock of ways and means to that of wants here the ratio is increased at both ends the stock of wants reduced to the lowest limits by being confined from the beginning within the circle traced out by nature the stock of ways and means on the other hand augmented by a multiplication of talents and employments and thence of securities for future livelihood hitherto without example but should it appear that the condition of a companys apprentice is more eligible in every point of view—probability of life and health good conduct and assurance of future livelihood than that of his fellows withoutdoors and of this superiority such part as is demonstrable which is the case with so much as regards life and health should stand continually demonstrated to the eyes of all men upon the face of the reports natural affection would in many cases join with economy in disposing a prudent parent to put his children in possession of the same advantages an arrangement of this kind would operate to the unspeakable advantage of all parties the causes of good management would be reacted upon and strengthened by this collateral effect good management bestowed on the indispensable or freeschool part of the nonadult stock—the bound apprentices—would procure a stock of volunteers in the character of boarders and as the profits derivable to the company and its agents from these boarders would operate when the time came so would the prospect of it operate from the beginning as an incentive calling forth and applying their utmost exertions to the rendering the condition of these their wards as advantageous in every respect and as conspicuously and unquestionably so as possible by the reduction of infant mortality among the pauper stock the way would thus be paved to a similar reduction among the offspring of the selfmaintaining stock and the prospect of this latter reduction and of the profit that might accompany it would tend in the most powerful degree to promote and increase the original reduction in the instance of the pauper stock sow causes and you will reap effects—can it be wondered at that the crop of good effects should in this field have hitherto been so scanty when the list of good causes sown is so mere a blank by the defalcation of all factitious wants—by the reduction in the expense of inspection—the result of the inspectionarchitecture principle and of the advantage of operating on a large scale—the expense of rearing youth in the best manner may not only without the smallest prejudice in regard to probability of life health or comfort but with increased benefit in all those respects be reduced to a pitch considerably below the amount of what a sufficient allowance of the stock of articles deemed necessaries according to the customary mode of living among the working classes could be afforded for in a private family of the working class the difference betwixt the customary expense of maintenance and the necessary expense of maintenance upon an improved plan would be found so great as to admit of the companys reimbursing the amount of the receipts upon as many of their boarders as happen to die under their care reserving still a profit sufficient to afford to the company and its agents an ample recompense for every exertion they can bestow† here or hereabout might be the maximum rate of receipt and profit—under this the     terms might be accommodated to the circumstances of the parents at the discretion of the company in favour of the lowestpaid classes as to the state of those circumstances in each instance the company being master of its own favours upon its own terms there could be no difficulty about evidence the existence of a positive value in the case of an average child in this situation for the period between birth and twentyone being a point supposed to be established the child would stand as a security for the expense of its board on this condition the terms of payment might be accommodated to the convenience of the childs friends except that if the score were not cleared by the end of a certain time say a twelvemonth the child should become forfeited i e considered as bound till twentyone in the character of an apprentice regular payment should be required at any rate for some of the first weeks lest a child supposed to be likely to die should be brought to the company for the purpose of its dying under their care a result by which besides the expense of burial c the reputation of the management in this respect would be injured at whatever age a boarder of this sort happens to die under the charge of the company the whole of the money that has ever been paid with him should be returned though it then will of course make the reduction greater and greater the older the child is at the time of his death it will not however by the time of his arrival at the age of selfmaintenance have reduced the profit so low as to eighty per cent for the purpose of this eventual receipt a testamentary guardian appointed by the will of the surviving parent might stand in the parents place in default of such appointment the money might lapse to the company and the child remain to the company on the footing of an apprentice the older the child when first placed with the company on this footing the greater of course the advantage to the company since so much more of the expense of the unproductive period will have been defrayed and so much more of the period of greatest mortality will have been got through if a parent able to pay in this way for a childs board chooses rather to bind him to the company on the footing of an apprentice the money that would otherwise have been employed in paying for his board would if invested in the frugalitybank have produced by the time of his arrival at twentyone a very considerable sum which at that time might even serve as a capital to set him up in business or in case of a female would afford her a marriageportion—without interest £       s with benefit of compound interest at four per cent about £   —at five per cent about £   —on this plan in the event of the death of the child before his arrival at full age the parent would in compensation for the wound suffered by his affections find himself not only relieved in pocket but enriched examples of classes of persons in whose circumstances it might be particularly eligible to a man to have his children taken care of from birth or soon afterwards for the first years say the first two three four five six or more years according to circumstances and who would naturally be disposed to profit by the opportunity could they have and at the same time be known to have as full assurance of the childs being preserved in life health strength and good habits as they could have were it to be kept at their own homes or at any other private house—  domestic servants—in whose case it would have the farther good effect of removing an obstacle to marriage   widowers among the selfmaintaining poor left with small children   more especially widowers of the seafaring and other classes whose occupations carry them frequently to a wide distance from home   married men with young children and diseased infirm or illbehaved wives   married men whose wives were engaged in business for themselves or whose whole time was wanted for the assistance of their husbands   fathers who having young children have given them stepmothers in proportion as the success of the plan came to be demonstrated and the proposition established that a childs probability of life is greater in an industryhouse than elsewhere parents even of the superior classes who otherwise would have put their children out to nurse or to an early boardingschool upon the ordinary footing would see the advantage of trusting them to the company in preference at least up to that period at which a child begins to require as supposed a mode of treatment adapted in point of society and instruction to the rank and circumstances of the circle in which it will afterward have to mix and if averse to avail himself of the pecuniary saving a man might make what further recompense he thought proper to the company or its agents or give the whole or any part of it to be applied in his own way in augmentation of the fund for pauper extracomforts—see book iv means of ascertaining the rate of mortality particularly at the first years of life in the community at large to serve as an object of comparison with that of the pauper community particularly at the same years of age under the companys care for the purposes above proposed—the company by its agents at the respective industryhouses to procure at stated periods copies or sufficient abstracts of the registers of the several parishes comprised within the circuit of each industryhouse such copies or abstracts attested in each case by the resident minister and parish     clerk might be periodically transmitted by the clerk to the chaplain of the house each parish being visited for that purpose by a pauper of the house whose connexions lay that way—see ch v—from these returns tables to be made under the care of the chaplain exhibiting the rates of mortality absolute and comparative for the several ages as between the population of the industryhouse and the general population of the industryhouse circuit in which it stands of these tables regularly published at weekly or monthly intervals the result might be read and exposed to view in the churches as proposed in ch i and would thus be perpetually presenting itself to the eyes as well as the ears of parents of all classes the poorest not excepted such are the documents necessary for demonstration and for which therefore it would be necessary for a parent to wait if nothing less than demonstration could satisfy him in such a case yet where the security is in itself so strong and the appearance it affords of attention at least so much beyond anything that is to be had from any other quarter the number to all appearance would not be small to whom the principle itself without waiting for the result would appear a sufficient ground for confidence the above securities for infant life not only have hitherto lain altogether out of the reach of parents but are not so much as capable in their full extent of being afforded on any other than the plan here proposed—requisites the concurrence of which is necessary to this purpose   capital for the maintenance of a stock of children in sufficient number to fill up the whole time of a set of nurses acting as checks upon one another several at a time and relieving one another in such manner as to continue the attendance without interruption night as well as day   ditto for the maintenance and pay of the nurses themselves   ditto for a sufficient stock of suitable superintendence medical as well as economical constantly present   ditto for a building adequate in point of magnitude to the above purposes   ditto for ditto suitable in point of construction i e constructed upon the centralinspection plan   system of bookkeeping regular suitable and allcomprehensive   means of exhibiting the relative rate of infant mortality in the establishment as compared with the average rate without doors—where children are taken in to nurse on the ordinary plan the nurse having a house and a family to manage besides can spare but a part of her time for attendance on the children and is therefore scarcely looked upon as capable of taking care of so many as from six to eight children at a time what she receives for these children must therefore besides defraying the expense of their maintenance be sufficient to defray the personal and house expenses of the nurse not being secure of a sufficient number for a constancy she could not afford to take them upon the lifeassurance principle hence when the preservation of infant life has been made a capital object as in the foundling hospital and the employment of the dutyandinterestjunction principle recurred to as a means the only modification of it employed has been the giving extra pay in the way of a premium in the instances where the object has been accomplished—that is when the child has been kept alive to a certain age though the terms and place of boarding would be peculiar to the establishment the method of treatment would if crowned with success spread itself of course in the community at large by means of the girls employed in the house as nurserygirls who when out of their time or by the allowance of the company before that period would naturally be sought after in private families hence too one sort of postemancipation provision for this part of the apprenticestock to exhibit the rate of mortality under this management in private families returns might be required to be made by each nurserygirl of the result of her management in every family she served—stating how long she served in each—whether she left the child dead or alive—if alive whether in good health or under any and what infirmity c from these returns it might be collected how much was owing to local situation or mode of life observed in the family and how much to management—except in as far as the plan of management learned in the industryhouse happened to be counteracted by the family for obtaining these returns so long as a nurserygirl continued in the service of the company on the apprenticeship footing the authority of the company would suffice to insure the communication after the expiration of the apprenticeship the company might be empowered to cause a bond to be given by each girl conditioned for her making the proposed returns—a certificate of good behaviour would if customarily given by the company come of course to be required by each private mistress upon this certificate might be printed a memorandum of the bond with instructions how to make the entries accordingly and blanks for the making of them by this means a girl could never avail herself of her certificate without exhibiting to view the obligation imposed on her in that respect and showing how far she had fulfilled it chap xii useful knowledge augmented and disseminated— observation and experiment compose the basis of all knowledge this basis in proportion as it spreads in extent swells in solidity and value hitherto the stock of relative data or known facts the     materials of which this basis is composed has been in almost every line and more especially in the most useful lines scanty accidental irregular incomplete both as to time and place—the scattered fruit of the uncombined exertions of unconnected individuals the institution of the proposed company would afford the first opportunity ever presented to mankind of enriching the treasury of useful knowledge by contributions furnished on a national scale and on a regular and allembracing plan and would thus form an epoch—not only in political economy but in many and many another branch of science the sciences which now await this epoch for a degree of improvement altogether unattainable by any other means would thus be raised to a pitch of certainty to which neither example nor till now so much as conception has perhaps ever reached the advancement of knowledge is performed—partly in the way of extension or augmentation—partly in the way of propagation or dissemination—in the way of extension in proportion as new lights are added to the old stock in the way of dissemination in proportion as the multitude of individuals to whom any part of the existing stock of lights has been communicated is increased i augmentation of useful knowledge—examples of branches of science in respect of which the proposed institution may be made productive of this effect   medicine—the therapeutic branch surgery included the collection of sick and ailing books of the industryhouses kept according to a universally preestablished plan with proper abstracts periodically made and published—exhibiting in the instance of a multitude of individuals amounting at the outset to suppose forty or fifty thousand and capable of being increased by the accumulation of the apprenticestock to a million and upwards—congregated in from two hundred and fifty to eight hundred establishments spread over the surface of the country at uniform distances   medicine—the dietetic branch a as to what concerns food—sources of information—the messbooks as compared with the sickbooks and the progressbooks—exhibiting the effects of food upon health and strength under the diversities in point of quality and quantity established for this purpose b drink—result of the total abstinence from fermented liquors in the instance of at least the apprenticestock and newcoming stock of all ages to which might be added by way of contrast the result of the indulgence that might be given in respect to the whole or a part of the oldstagers—sources of information as before—c

thermometrical observations also of the entries in the housewarming or fuel books d commencement of sexual intercourse—result of the early marriages proposed to be permitted and encouraged in the apprenticestock previous to the proposed respective periods of emancipation of the two sexes—sources of information the sick and ailing books and progress books as before   and   mechanics and

industryhouses everything that concerns management in manufactures belongs either to mechanics or to chemistry or to both together what comes under the department of mechanics is in general too well ascertained to afford much matter for registration but this is not the case with what comes under the department of chemistry—examples brickmaking limeburning mortar and plaistermaking pigments or impregnations for wood glassmaking pottery tanning bleeching papermaking c c all of them included in the system of pauperemployment by the principle of selfsupply appropriate details cannot be given without plunging into the details of particular manufactures—for analogous examples see what has been said in relation to the several branches of domestic economy as above—sources of information—the several manufacturing progress books as compared with the manufacturingconsumption books to which may be added such particular derivations according to the nature of the subject as may come from time to time to be minuted down by zealous and intelligent superintendents in the different branches at the instance of the company or of their own accord   husbandry—including agriculture and gardening—sources of information—husbandryprogress books compared with the husbandrystock books also the meteorological journal or register of the weather as below—the framing a set of husbandry books with instructions for the use of them would be a noble field for the exertions of the board of agriculture§—abstracts of the results of these books when kept to be periodically made and published under the direction of the board—utility of an official relation between the companys directionboard and the board of agriculture—the board of agriculture as a department of government to operate as a board of control over the agricultural proceedings of the company so far as concerns the reporting opinions to the king and council and to parliament as to the national consequences of any extensive measure but without the power of directing or negativing—being thus to the companys agriculture what the board of trade is to trade in general—unexampled interest as well as facility which the company would possess with regard to the devising ordering and registering agricultural experiments weighing the result and applying it upon the most extended scale to practice the benefit and opportunity of extension being greater than what exists in the instance of any individual landholder or landowner in the proportion of the number of industryhouse farms from two hundred and fifty to five hundred to

companys periodical accounts as published in the companys gazette  0 logic—in respect of a division of the branch of it termed by bacon ars traditiva—the art of communicating ideas—in the present instance the art of communicating ideas to uninformed minds—sources of information—schoolprogress book containing minutes of the course of instruction pursued in each industryhouse in relation to the several branches in which instruction is administered to the nonadult class—regard being had to age sex choice and order of subjectmatters of instruction quantity of time employed number of scholars

expressly taught or points of management practised with success in the above or any other ways in the system of industryhouses would upon the emancipation of the apprenticestock be disseminated along with them through the community at large   they would in a less direct and certain way be disseminated more or less in the way of adoption and imitation through the bulk of the selfmaintaining poor and in both cases to a degree of extent and with a degree of rapidity proportioned to the number of central points the industryhouses which the light of instruction would thus have to issue from†   in the case where lessons were given in form to the apprenticestock or any other branches of the population of the house nonadults and others of all ages among the selfmaintaining poor without doors might be admitted on these occasions in quality of auditors this by means of the structure of the building see the plate might easily be arranged without any infringement on the separationprinciple   what was learnt by the house poor rather by habitual practice than positive precept might in some instances be communicated to those without doors in the way of lesson by courses of instruction directed especially to that purpose iii dissemination of knowledge continued—branches of knowledge in relation to which instruction might be given in a special degree to visiters from without doors beyond what came of course to be administered to the population of the house the art of medicine in the most extensive sense of the word as applied to the several sorts of animals maintained for the use of man‡ the medical curator of the house if he has received that course of instruction without which he ought not to be received into the house cannot be altogether a stranger to this important branch of science—and a part of the qualification required of him might be the having given himself the benefit of the valuable course of instruction which of late years the neighbourhood of the metropolis but of the metropolis only has afforded in this line opportunities more or less ample of keeping up and enlarging his acquisitions in this way will be afforded by the live stock of the industryhouse farm these acquisitions it might be made part of his duty to communicate to visiters from without doors in a course of lectures to be read on any day of universal leisure on the principle of the sunday schools pursuing the plan originally devised by the learned and truly reverend dr derham the instruction rendered not merely physical but physicothcological might be impregnated by the spirit and rendered subservient to the sacred purpose of the day previous attendance on divine service in the chapel of the house might be made an indispensable condition—a small fee applicable to the augmentation of the stock of pauper extracomforts of which in the next book might be required or not from visiters of the superior classes and a ticket of recommendation from the inferior classes a system of instruction being thus provided and rendered universally accessible the having partaken of the benefit of it might be rendered a condition necessary to the faculty of practising anywhere in the character of a farrier this might be accomplished in the instance of this occupation without private hardship or public expense which in regard to occupations     in general has been so vainly aimed at and at the expense of such an enormous mass of hardship by the statute of apprenticeships private zeal sharpened if necessary by encouragement from the company would exert itself in bringing in as occasion served those necessary materials which in this as in so many other instances may be termed the food of science a domestic animal overtaken by natural death would instead of being thrown by or employed at once as carrion be conveyed to the nearest industryhouse that the seat and causes of the disease may be subjected to examination and the loss sustained by the individual compensated in some degree by the accession derived from it to the general stock of useful knowledge in this way the good which has been the object of so much exertion on the part of a respectable society as well as of parliamentary encouragement bestowed with so much judgment though at the public expense might without further expense to the public be multiplied from two hundred and fifty to two hundred fold so much for the augmentation and dissemination of useful knowledge on this collateral topic thus much must suffice at present were this application of the proposed industryhouse system the only use might it not even then be styled a polychrest—an instrument of many uses in this point of view at least bacon from whom the word is taken would not have regarded it with indifference—would the several uses in any respect impede—would they not rather promote and fortify each other to the several scientific societies—medical philosophical and economical—this source—this inexhaustible source of information would be a perpetual treasure—nor is it in the nature of science to be ungrateful for the assistance she would thus receive so many classes of wellinformed inquisitive and communicative observers to whom an interest would thus be given in the copiousness and accuracy of the information brought to view—so many unpaid and incorruptible inspectors—so many discerning censors and enlightened applauders—so many ready instructors and advisers—of the various classes of persons from whom the information would have to come chap xiii voluntary charity assisted and directed—   officiating in the character of trustee is one mode in which the company may afford an indisputable and much wanted assistance to the purposes of private charity what is every mans business being no mans business funds bestowed for this purpose are universally and notoriously exposed to depredation no adequate or comparable security is afforded by the existing order of things private trustees render no account but to the court of chancery nor to that unless called upon by some individual who for the chance of obtaining that satisfaction must begin with dividing between government and the profession a sum sufficient to maintain a multitude of families for a multitude of years and the account when obtained at the end of a certain number of years and at this expense exists after all but in manuscript among the rubbish of an office—under the company everything of this sort would find its place of course in the most diffused of all publications the companys gazette   another and very important assistance is by conveying to the hands of the poor under its care a very large mass of the fruits of private charity which though destined for the use of the burdensome poor has by a strange though scarcely avoidable fatality been intercepted by the whole body of the rich whatever falls in from any casual fund so much the less comes to be drawn for upon the standing fund whatever donation therefore is meant for the poor in general and unaccompanied by the designation of the individuals who are to receive it scarce ever finds its way and indeed on any other than the proposed plan could scarcely ever find its way in any case to the hands for which alone it has been designed a sum in gross say £ 0 is sunk in toto an annual sum given in annuities amounting to less per head than the necessary expense of pauper maintenance suppose  0s sinks in the same manner a sum about equal to that expense say £  produces where there is a poorhouse the difference in point of comfort between homemaintenance and communitymaintenance in the poorhouse the pecuniary benefit being shared in toto among the body of the rich if to suppose the most favourable case but that a rare one the amount of the annuity rises as high as to twice the necessary expense of maintenance say to £ 0 then indeed the poor for whom the whole was designed do profit by it viz to the amount of half the remainder a tax of £ 0 per cent being levied upon the patrimony of the poor for the use and benefit of the rich where in the view of guarding against this misapplication the benefaction has been appropriated by the terms of it to poor persons not receiving parish allowance the effect of the appropriation has still been rather nominal than real at the time of his being pitched upon for the benefaction a man has not as yet become burdensome to the parish yet had it not been for the benefaction he might have become so perhaps immediately under the proposed system though scarcely under any other this grievance is capable of receiving and may easily receive an effectual remedy every circumstance by which the condition of an individual can be influenced being remarked and inventoried nothing being left to chance caprice or unguided discretion everything being surveyed and set down in dimension number weight and measure a certain mass of comforts is marked out under the name of comforts of course as what shall be inseparably annexed to the lot of a pauper under the companys mangement and     served out by means of their efficient causes to all individuals without distinction at the companys expense other articles which though of less necessary complexion are not incompatible with the plans and arrangements of the company may in the instance of each individual be added or not according as the amount of the expense necessary for the providing of them can be obtained from the voluntary charity of individuals or from any other of the sources of extracomforts the list of which will be exhibited in its place the ground being purposely and carefully prepared for the reception of the superstructure what comes to be given with the view of its being applied to the use of the poor and of the poor only in augmentation of the stock of ordinary and universallyimparted comforts may thus be certain of being conveyed to its destination without misdirection or loss—borne aloft upon the platform of public charity what private charity gains thus in power is like what the dwarf acquired in prospect when mounted on the giants shoulders in the arrangement of the proposed industryhouse plan special care is taken that each distinct claim to extra comforts whether on the ground of special merit or past prosperity or peculiarly afflictive infirmity shall be held up to notice in the view of receiving though it were at the companys expense the indulgence competent to it the existing poorhouses know of no such distinctions they know of no such claims everything lies prostrate upon the same dead and dreary level the virtuous and the vicious the habitual beggar and the man of fallen fortunes the healthy and the agonizing—all are confounded together in the poorhouse as in the grave the abovepromised list of extracomforts will be of use to private charity—not only by serving to guide the application of voluntary donations but even by swelling the amount each article of comfort might have its receivingbox appropriated to it the boxes ranged by the side of one another and over them an assurance that whatsoever should be put into each should be faithfully and exclusively appropriated to the destined purpose along with these particular boxes a general one to receive such donations the application of which shall have been trusted by the donors to the discretion of the government of the house accounts to be regularly published of the produce of each box and of the application made of it that the charitablydisposed before they give in their contributions to any head of comfort may see what degree of supply the want in question has received in comparison with the other articles in the list to a second glance at least the effect of these specifications may not appear so trifling as it may be apt to do to a first pity like other emotions is never so strong as when called forth and excited by particular impressions it is the observation of some particular want—some particular instance of distress—that gives birth to that pain of sympathy which can no otherwise obtain relief than by the idea of the cessation of the suffering thus witnessed or imagined to be assured that not only the condition of the object will upon the whole be meliorated by what is given but meliorated in that particular way—meliorated by the removal of that very distress to the idea of which the pain of commiseration and the consequent desire of affording relief owed its birth—such an assurance is not only the most suitable but the only perfect satisfaction which that desire can receive even setting aside any particular distresses which in their intense degrees a man may have witnessed or imagined on the part of others those which in an inferior degree he may have experienced in his own person an experience which the most opulent are not exempt from occasionally partaking of will have a particular tendency to summon the hand of charity to their relief chilliness will thus suggest to charity the importance of warm clothing—good appetite or a love of good cheer will propose additions under the head of diet—an experience of the discomforts of disagreeable society will produce oblations to the fund for augmenting the number of peculium huts or outlying cottages—and so on charity in a word will act with the utmost advantage possible when thus enabled to address herself to each individual by his particular experiences and sensibilities even the propensity to censure may thus be productive of useful fruit and lend its aid to the purposes of benevolence be the scheme of provision ever so perfect it is not in the nature either of man or things that it should give satisfaction to every individual on every point to some it will appear deficient in one article—to others in another of the observation of any defect a natural consequence is—a wish to see it corrected every such wish is as it were a handmaid in the train of charity—the existing system chills in a variety of ways the spirit of benevolence—under the proposed system it is kept to work and preserved in its full vigour   0   lastly a very great though indirect assistance will have been given to the fund applicable to the purposes of private charity by the extirpation of mendicity the money which is now so much worse than thrown away on beggars will then be left free to be applied still under the orders of charity to purposes of pure and real use book iv pauper comforts section i introduction— we now stand upon

comforts of a common residence separate from that of the multitude might still be enjoyed by both taking ten per cent in the way of rent for capital thus invested—taking  0s ayear for instance for a cottage that cost £ 0—the company would in little more than ten years have reimbursed itself for the expense at that period it could very well afford to add one out of every two of these rented

at all desired the comforts of which a distinct mention will be made under this head accompanied with an indication of their respective efficient causes as discoverable in the plan of management are such the value of which to render it particularly apparent requires a comparison to be made under the same heads between the condition of these children of the company and that of their fellows in age

most important points—works and what is more practice according to these works† and these in exhibiting the     improvements that have been devised show how great the room for improvement is under the current practice compare now the lot of the companys apprentices with that of any other class of the same age the very highest not excepted—survey it in its whole extent—probe it to the bottom—and judge whether they are so much to be pitied as to be envied against pains of all sorts better security than is to be found in any existing situation without exception desires not crossed but prevented—obstacles not moral but physical—not terror but ignorance among enjoyments the coarser though more indispensable—those which attend the satisfaction of the appetities of hunger and thirst—purified—i mean from pains the more exquisite—for i speak of nothing that is not common to the species—nothing that is the peculiar fruit of extra culture in particular minds being to the purpose here—the more exquisite not only in like manner purified but accelerated—increased at the earliest and best stage—at the stage at which their intensity is at the highest—increased in the only way in which the mass of them is susceptible of being increased in the article of diet no unsatisfied longings no repinings—nothing within knowledge that is not within reach—that he who has been habituated to poignancy and variety of diet suffers on being reduced to simple and insipid fare is not to be doubted but that the enjoyment of him who has never known any sort but one though it were the most insipid sort does not yield in anything to that of the most luxurious feeder seems equally out of doubt—in this way all the efforts of art are but a vain struggle to pass the limits set to enjoyment by the hand of nature asterisks in the original there is an intimation that the communications are to be continued but though the matter of books v and vi is unsupplied there are no farther

observations on the poor bill introduced by the right honourable william pitt written february      note by the editor of an edition printed for private circulation in      the observations were written forty years ago and were recently found amongst mr benthams manuscripts they have never been printed but from some correspondence it appears that he was in communication with some of the influential members of the legislature and that the observations powerfully contributed to the abandonment of the measure in question the provisions of the bill as compared with the principles set forth in the observations may be adduced as a specimen of empiric as compared with scientific legislation to those who may be masters of the principles of the new poor law it will be manifest that had the measures embodied in mr pitts bill been brought into general operation for any length of time the effects would have been more disastrous to property and through property to the ultimate welfare of the labouring classes than the most disastrous revolution in modern times the new poor law is perhaps the first piece of legislation based upon scientific or economical principles the main principle for the administration of the law being however a principle which neither mr ricardo nor mr malthus had seen when they gave the weight of their opinions against the institution of a legal provision for the compulsory relief of the poor the preparation of the new measure by laborious inductions from a large mass of facts specially examined may be recommended for imitation where safe legislation is required for large subjects to those who are unacquainted with mr benthams works as the greater number even of his professed followers undoubtedly are since the best refutation of some of their favourite doctrines are to be found in his writings the observations will furnish a fair specimen of his mode of treating such subjects another of numerous instances of his great perspicuity for practical purposes is to be found in his plan of frugality banks published during the year      see above p  0  in this plan will be found the anticipation of the improvements which some years of trial have suggested in the institution of savings banks particularly the addition of the provisions for annuities to the labouring classes made by the act of   will iv c     th may      chapter i introduction though no determinate system of arrangement presents itself as having been adopted for the purpose of this bill or at least as having been steadily pursued throughout the course of it the whole matter of it at least may be conceived as distributable under four     heads or compartments one part taking up the outallowance or homeprovision system and opening new sources of relief in that shape a second taking up the homeprovision system and the small establishment system jointly and in a system of working places under the names of schools of industry establishing throughout the southern division of the united kingdoms a system of employment and industrial education of which the scene is to shift in a manner between the public schoolroom and the private home a third occupied in establishing a system of superintendence to watch over the management of these schools of industry and the fourth taken up with a set of regulations in the way of procedure and a few other arrangements of a technical nature such as it is commonly deemed necessary to tack to the end of statutes creative of new powers to be exercised by particular authorities on looking into the portion of matter relative to the subject of home provision we shall find it distinguishable into two main divisions the one occupied in the distribution of occasional or temporary allowances the other in giving commencement or security to a system of what may be termed superannuation annuities humanely destined to diffuse a gleam of comfort over the evening of life on looking into the amendments applied by the bill to the plan of relief afforded by the homeprovision system in the present state of the law we shall find them introductive of the following extensions in section   a supplement is meant to be provided for whatever deficiency in point of earnings may result from any deficiency in point of ability with reference to work this clause i shall take the liberty of distinguishing by the name of the underability or supplementalwages clause in section   another supplement for whatever deficiency in respect to the means of maintenance may be produced in families by an overcharge of helpless children this may be termed the familyrelief or extrachildren clause in section   power is given to whom not mentioned to administer relief in the shape of capital to be employed in the purchase of a cow or other animal yielding profit this may be termed the cowmoney clause in section   a provision is made that property visible property though it amount to £ 0 or perhaps more shall not operate in exclusion of relief this may be termed the reliefextension or opulencerelief clause and in section    provision is made for conferring on the scholars of these schools in certain cases the benefit of apprenticeship at the public expense this i shall term the apprenticeship clause i shall now consider the several clauses in the order in which they have just been brought to view† chapter ii   underability or supplementalwages clause liv and be it further enacted that if any poor person residing in any parish under the authority of this act and not being able to earn the full rate or wages usually given in such parish or the parish or parishes united therewith shall with the previous consent of the person or persons appointed to the management of the poor of any such parish or united parishes contract and agree to work at any inferior rate or wages which wages shall not be sufficient for the maintenance and support of such poor person singly or in conjunction with his or her family it shall and may be lawful for such officers of the poor with the approbation of one or more justice or justices of the peace in the district to make up such deficiency as may be necessary for the support of such poor person and his or her family regard being had to the earnings of such family out of the rates made for the relief of the poor without compelling such poor person to be employed in any school of industry or in any other manner under the authority of this act     by the underability or supplementalwages clause provision is made that if any poor person entitled to the benefit of this act the efficient cause of title is not otherwise specified not able to earn the full rate or wages shall agree to work at an under rate the deficiency may be made up to him out of the poor rates without compelling such poor person to be employed in any manner under the authority of this act what sort of persons this class is intended to be composed of is a question respecting which i must confess myself unable to satisfy myself not being able to collect who the persons are entitled to the benefit of this act thus much however i understand from the clause that there is a class of persons to every one of whom upon condition of their working in any manner and receiving for their work a rate or wages falling short to any amount of the full rate usually given in the parish somebody or other i do not perfectly see who shall have it in his power to make up the deficiency at the public charge the inability of the lowest class i mean the worst paid class of working hands in this country viz the labourers in husbandry to make such provision for the sustenance of themselves and families as shall be constantly adequate to the purpose—that is under every variation which the ability as to work the facility of obtaining work and the magnitude of the burden resulting from the condition and multitude of the infants and other helpless branches of the family are susceptible of—is a point which i fear has been but too incontestably established to this inconvenience such remedies as in the course of the preceding observations presented themselves as the proper and only proper remedies have already been pointed out the remedies proposed by the bill in general and the part now in question in particular must be confessed to be of a different stamp as to the casual inadequacy of the earnings of the individual compared with the demand for subsistence on the part of that same individual two expedients have presented themselves one is to fix the rate of wages and thereby of earnings viz of the rate to be paid to individual labourers by individual employers the other is leaving the rate indefinite to make up the deficiency whatsoever in each individual instance it may happen to amount to at the public charge the fixation of wages is an operation which on different occasions has been proposed and on some occasions even practised with opposite views—to prevent what has been looked upon as excess and to cure what has been looked upon as defect it is with the latter view that it has lately been proposed with reference to the case now before us against the fixation of wages with a view to prevent deficiency there is however this objection viz that thereby you exclude from employment many persons who might otherwise have obtained it you aggravate the distress of the very persons or at least a considerable proportion of the persons whose condition you propose to meliorate what you can do let it be admitted is so to order matters in behalf of the object of your benevolence that if he receives anything he shall not receive less than what you wish him to receive but what you cannot do is so to order matters as that under these circumstances he shall receive anything at all to give him that sufficient rate of wages is an obligation not imposed upon any employer whatsoever it is therefore an expense to which no employer who does not think he shall find his account in it will ever think of subjecting himself in a word a regulation fixing the rate of wages so as to prevent its falling below a certain rate is in effect a regulation of the prohibitive kind excluding from employment all such hands the value of whose labour does not rise to a level with that rate a prohibition enforced by a specific and unavoidable penalty and that penalty is the difference whatsoever it may be in each case between the highest sum which the labour of the workman is worth and the lowest sum which the employer is allowed to give true it is that upon a minute scrutiny the exclusion will not be found altogether so universal as at first glance it might appear in some instances partly from motives of a personal nature under the difficulty of getting another hand but at an extra price partly from motives of compassion rather than have an industrious workman destitute an employer who otherwise might have got the labour of the feeble hand in question at an under rate proportioned to his diminution in point of ability will pay him that full and intended legal rate which with reference to that ability will be an extra rate but the effect of the principle thus operating in limitation of the exclusion has its bounds an employer may give  s a week for example to a labourer whose labour is worth but  s or  s but he will not give the  s to a labourer whose labour is worth but  s or  s he will rather give for his  s worth of labour  0s or   s or   s to one workman in full ability importing him if necessary from another parish than   s among three labourers whose labour taken altogether is worth no more than the  s besides the general danger the danger of idleness inseparable from the homeprovision system a particular source of danger seems to be opened by the particular wording of this clause by his character for negligence or idleness a man though in respect of bodily ability not unequal perhaps to the fullest rate of earnings shall have so ordered matters that no master will employ him but at a rate more     or less inferior to that rate in that case it will be perfectly true that to use the words of the bill he is not able to earn the full rate or wages usually given for whatever may have been the original cause of the inability the existence of it is not the less real so far then as this cause of inability extends that is so far as the class of the idle the negligent and the dissolute extends a multitude the increase of which seems but too much to be apprehended from the operation of this clause the effect of it seems to be the putting the idle and negligent exactly upon a footing in point of prosperity and reward with the diligent and industrious if conjecture may be allowed the circumstance that gave rise to this clause in the breasts of those who framed it seems to have been the humane consideration that when a man does his utmost it is hard to leave him in a worse condition than his neighbours on account of an infirmity which is his misfortune merely not his fault but the extreme difficulty of forming in each individual instance a wellgrounded judgment to whomsoever it belongs to form it in the question fault or no fault and if fault in what degree may perhaps by this time have been perceived but fault will not ought not to be imputed without special and full proof and perhaps the blameable conduct the blameable cause of the inability the bad character in which the inability to obtain the ordinary rate of wages originated—this cause though continuing and operating in full force is susceptible of no proof but what is confined to a period long since past this being the case and supposing all possible ability as well as integrity on the part of those by whom the claim to this bounty is to be determined i must confess i do not see how it can be otherwise than a frequent not to say general case that idleness should upon the establishment of this clause find itself in as good plight as industry under this difficulty of drawing the line an expedient which i must confess i expected to have found adopted was the confining the title to some such efficient cause or causes as should be out of the reach of counterfeiting as well as of fabrication old age stands in this respect on the highest ground in point of eligibility after that come specific modifications of infirmity such as loss of limbs loss of the use of limbs rupture epilepsy nervous afflictions complaints which according to the greater or less difficulty of ascertaining the matter of fact will constitute so many efficient causes of inability more or less clearly and certainly exempt from blame—more or less exempt from the danger of opening an inlet to abuse whether all the precautions that could be taken all the precautions which the nature of the case admits of would be sufficient to confine the mischief within any tolerable bounds is what i cannot but entertain some doubts of but at any rate so long as no such checks are applied the danger from this clause supposing it to stand seems very serious for how opposite soever the views and intentions of the contrivers in the two cases the equalization system as applied to wages seems hardly less threatening to industry and thence to property to say nothing of the expense than as applied to property it would be to property and thence to industry against these and all other dangers of abuse the dependence for a remedy and safeguard is of course on the wisdom and integrity of those into whose hands the execution of the act may come from time to time to fall but not to mention how multifarious the ingredients sine quibus non of the mixed class called wisdom are wisdom may be wanting in one quarter integrity in another both together in a third and after all we know not who they are besides that as we have seen the cases are various and of frequent occurrence where the union of both qualities and both in the highest degree would be of no avail to oppose all new powers on no distincter ground than that all powers are open to abuse would be the effusion of undistinguishing imbecility or of political jealousy run mad but when a system of provision is on the carpet involving in its essence a system of powers particularly open to abuse the danger may at least operate as a motive for inquiry whether there may not be found some other system less obnoxious to abuse what in such case shall be deemed this full rate or wages which is to be made up at all events is another point that seems as necessary as it may be found difficult to be settled in the compass of england and wales some hundred thousands ayear may be at stake upon this single point   is it the full rate or wages of the highest paid species of labour in the district in question certainly not in every case   is it the full rate or wages of the highest paid species of labour where the employment of the individual in question happens to be of that species if so we may have bad shipwrights pensioned at  s aweek or a guinea according as day work or piece work is taken for the standard or bad mathematical instrument makers at half as much this therefore was not intended   is it the full rate or wages according to an average taken of the earnings of all the species of employment exercised within the district put together this requiring a vast previous assemblage of highly interesting but hitherto uncollected documents is what for that as well as other reasons can hardly have been intended   is it the full rate or wages earned in the species of employment most abundant in the district as the words usually given might seem to import i should suppose nor that neither   is it the full rate or wages earned in the lowest meaning the lowest paid species of employment therein exercised this i should rather think is what is meant or at least upon this view of the     diversity would be meant because this construction would be the least dangerous but this is not anywhere expressed take even the lowest paid species of employment the quantum of the earnings will be found to admit of great variation in great towns the metropolis for example compared with distant country places there are country places in which it is not higher than  s aday in london and the neighbourhood it can hardly be reckoned lower than  s with all this enormous difference in the habitual rate of supply the necessary means of living are scarcely cheaper anywhere than in london are so many thousands of bad workmen then with or without families to receive near £   ayear as a minimum when less than £   ayear is proved by experience to be enough for good ones and who will stay in the country at single allowance if he can secure double allowance only by coming up to london which partly by a late act partly by this intended act everybody is enabled to do without disturbance an answer is that as at present and in practice necessity is measured for the purpose of relief so in future and under this act will wages be measured for the same purpose the reply is no such thing as far as the intended law is obeyed as far as it produces the effect it aims at the measure at present used for this purpose will not be employed but laid aside under the existing order of things the relief granted is measured by and adjusted to what in the breasts of those to whom it belongs to judge is the proper quantum of the demand on the score of indigence but this mode of measurement is precisely that which will not satisfy the liberality of the framer of the act for this is what the act declares if it declares anything full is a word not only of precision but of energy the full rate that and nothing less is the rate without which the legislator has declared he will not in future be satisfied and whosoever presumes to give less than that full rate disobeys that such disobedience would not be uncommon is what i will not say either i should hope or i should fear but what at any rate i should except but where would be the expediency of that law of which the sole trust were to be in the disobedience it might excite meantime disobedience eligible or ineligible pardonable or unpardonable will not be universal five standards as we have seen for the measurement of the bounty five standards rising one above another in liberality will be in every parish open to a mans choice in each instance be his inclinations what they may ever so weak ever so lavish ever so heedless within the prodigious scale raised up by these five standards a man may without much straining find a warrant in this part of the intended act but at any rate to one or other of them he must conform himself if he pays any regard to the act—five standards the lowest of them little less than sufficient as we have seen to double the poor rates overwhelm the metropolis and depopulate whatever part of the country is not covered by a town chapter iii   familyrelief or extrachildren clause xxxvii and be it further enacted that any father entitled to the benefit of this act and having more than two children under the respective ages of five years and part of his family unable to maintain themselves and any widow being so entitled and having more than one such child and part of her family shall have such allowances from the parish or united parishes where he or she shall reside in respect of all such children of such father beyond the number of two and in respect of all such children of such widow beyond the number of one to such amount as the person or persons appointed to the management of the poor of such parish or united parishes with the consent of the visiters of the district in rotation or any two of them shall deem sufficient for the maintenance of such child or children under all circumstances or as two justices of the peace in the district on appeal from the allowances made by the consent of the said visiters shall order and direct and that such allowances so made shall continue in respect of such child or children above the number of two and one respectively until such child or children in respect of whom such allowances are made can and shall maintain themselves by their labour and that all and every the child or children of any such father or widow being respectively of the age of five years or upwards in respect of whom any such allowance as aforesaid shall be paid shall upon request made in pursuance of this act be sent into the school or schools of industry established in or for any parish or united parishes and shall be received into such school or schools of industry to be instructed and employed in such business as shall be suited to the age and strength of such child or children and not dangerous or prejudicial to the health of such child or children unless the parent or parents of him her or them will undertake diligently to instruct and employ and shall diligently instruct and employ such child or children at their own homes in such business as the person or persons appointed to the management of the poor of such parish or united parishes or the manager of the said school or schools of industry shall from time to time direct and which such persons respectively are hereby authorized to direct to be done in conformity to the provisions of this act and that such allowances so directed shall continue to be paid until such respective children can maintain themselves by their labour     and that the earnings of every such child to whom any such allowance shall be directed to be paid except such part thereof as is hereinafter directed to be allowed to the parent or parents of any child or children who shall be industrious and conform to the rules established by or in pursuance of this act shall during the continuance of the same go in aid of the fund for the support of the said school or schools of industry and that any child or children whose parent or parents is or are not able to maintain them and in respect of whom no such allowance shall be paid or payable by virtue of this act may be received into such school of industry to be therein instructed and employed in such work or employment as shall be suited to such child or children as before directed or in such other place and under such instruction as shall be agreed upon in the manner before directed and under such terms and conditions or at such rate or wages as shall in pursuance of this act be settled to be paid and performed in consideration of the work done by such child or children and the earnings of such lastmentioned child or children except such part thereof as shall be allowed as aforesaid shall go in aid of the fund for the support of such school or schools of industry in this section clause   two classes of persons are instituted who on the condition of their respectively having a certain number of children parts of their respective families and unable to maintain themselves shall be entitled to a weekly allowance considered in respect to its quantum this allowance is not to amount at any rate to less than  s aweek for each extra child and it may amount to ever so much more considered in respect to its duration it is to continue not only till each such extra child shall be able to maintain itself by its own labour but till it actually shall maintain itself by its own labour—can and shall maintain themselves by their labour says the act   measuring the extent of this clause we shall find it i much fear at once too ample and too narrow too ample to be reconcileable to the interests of private industry or of public economy too narrow to cover the extent of the demand for the relief which itself provides to judge of the demand in point of necessity and utility for the bounties given by this clause let us observe upon what footing the title to relief stands under the existing order of things at present supposing the discretion properly and successfully exercised demand and supply are proportioned to each other from those who have not wherewithal to maintain themselves and families be those families ever so small relief will not be withholden to those who have wherewithal to maintain themselves and families be those families ever so large relief will not be given under this clause a family may labour under the severest distress and derive no benefit from the intended act a family may wallow in abundance and derive an enormous pension from it to entitle the head of the family to the allowance—to the pension or congeries of pensions thus provided it is not necessary that the family taken together should be unable otherwise to maintain itself it is sufficient if the extra children the children taken in the extra number should separately taken be unable to maintain themselves the heads of families in question as described are first a father having more than two children unable to maintain themselves and second a widow having more than one such child as to the difference made here between fathers and widows that in general the ability of the male sex in this respect will be greater than that of the female is not to be disputed but will it in every instance be exactly in that proportion may not there be some instances in which a woman with a good trade will be better able to maintain two children than a man to maintain the same number with a bad one may not the instances be many in which a man with or without a wife shall be better able to maintain three children than a widow to maintain two and may not there be instances where a widow with two children shall be better able to maintain herself and family than a widow left pregnant for instance with one child in arms or in a state requiring still more attendance may be able to maintain herself and that one doubts remain with regard to the import that are material to the effect this inability with regard to the maintaining themselves is it sufficient if it extend to the supernumerary children or must it extend to all the children and in either case is it sufficient if it be partial or must it be entire   as to the quantum of the pension under the existing system if  d aweek for example per child be requisite and sufficient to make up for the deficiency of earnings  d aweek may without any further addition be allowed under this bill  s aweek requisite or not requisite must if anything be allowed shillings in any number may be allowed and that more than one should in general or at least frequently be allowed seems to be intended for that less than  s requisite or not requisite should not in any case be allowed is expressly stipulated a shilling aweek is £    s ayear  d aweek is £   s  d aweek is £    s  d aweek is   s thirtynine shillings almost £  ayear or even   s or even   s ayear repeated upon forty or fifty thousand children amounts to no small sum granting what is a good deal to grant that less than the shilling aweek cannot in any situation or at any age be made to suffice for the maintenance of any child—what cannot possibly be granted is that this deficiency in the amount of earnings cannot exist in the shape of any less sum than the entire amount of the sum necessary for the childs maintenance in situations     where money is oftener reckoned by millions and thousands than by pounds and shillings the saving that might be made upon a pitiful shilling aweek is apt to appear as nothing but where a penny comes so often to be repeated an error to the amount of a few pence in this low pensionlist may amount to a source of profusion not only more abundant in quantity but much less warranted by use as well as much more pregnant with mischief than even the high pensionlist which is the object of so much jealousy as well as so much envy   the duration of the allowance presents another topic of observation the continuance is to be until the children in question actually shall maintain themselves by their labour while their earning anything will depend of course upon the head of the family who through wilfulness or negligence or indolence may keep the children either in idleness or employed in labour which however useful to the family cannot or need not be brought to account in the shape of a fixed sum so long as the allowance excessive or moderate is to continue the maintenance it may be said will be afforded and that in the fixed shape in question by the wages which the child will receive for the work which the head of the family must send the child to perform at the school of industry on pain of receiving none of the benefits of the act it may be so but however it may be otherwise the children may some or all of them be under the age five years is the age at which this schooling is to commence sec  0 in a thinlypeopled part of the country the burthen of the school with its schoolmaster and schoolmistress and warehouse and warehousekeeper will if the parish be single be by far too heavy for it if several parishes are put together the school put it where you will by its distance will be rendered inaccessible to a great part of its scholars the pensions are to commence in july next sec      not a school can be begun to be built till at the end of a chain of administrative operations such as in known instances has taken up years and of which the first link cannot take place till after michaelmas sec  0 and it is in aid of the fund for the support of the schools and not in aid of this pensionfund that the earnings whenever they do take place are after all to be applied a circumstance that renders the danger the more formidable is that the two currents of profusion the allowance on the score of extra children and the allowance on the score of supplemental wages may for anything that appears to the contrary mingle together and flow with united force first comes the pay of the idler made up to an equality with the earnings of the industrious then come the extra children of the idler to be put in whatsoever number upon the pensionlist regard it is provided shall be had to the earnings of the family regard it is provided shall be had to the allowance from a fund not named but which appears to be what i call the superannuation fund but of any regard which may be had to any such allowance as that on the score of extra children no mention is to be found no deduction is therefore intended to be made on any such score the overnarrowness of the provision with reference to its evident object the scantiness of it in a particular point of view comes now to be considered to characterize the head of a family on whose labour the subsistence of the family is considered as depending father if of the male sex widow if of the female are the only terms employed but there are other relations which are either charged by law or at least apt to be engaged by shame or affection in the maintenance or at any rate in the guardianship of their infant or other helpless relatives within this sphere of duty perfect or imperfect for i will not plunge into discussions of positive law for the purpose of drawing the line grandfather and grandmother brother and sister uncle and aunt may at any rate be considered as comprised in whatever point of view the matter be considered if the claims of the two relations specified are to be regarded as strong enough with reference to the intended bounty those of the six relations not specified present themselves as still stronger in the instance of these comparatively distant relatives if bound by law the burthen of the obligation unaccompanied as it is in their case with those matrimonial comforts which constitute the equivalent for parental burthens is so much the harder if not bound the act of taking up the burthen is so much the more meritorious and stands so much the more in need of foreign inducements to give it birth to give consistency to the provision by the supply of these omissions is a task which though certainly not impracticable would be found not unaccompanied with difficulty and if the expediency of the provision considered in substance be liable to doubts this difficulty will add force to them complication is of itself an evil and such an evil as requires no inconsiderable mass of benefit to outweigh it chapter iv   cowmoney clause lxvii and be it further enacted that whenever any poor person entitled to the benefit of this act shall want relief for himself or herself or his or her family and such person shall be possessed or can obtain possession of land or is entitled unto common of pasture sufficient to maintain a cow or other animal yielding profit whereby such poor person by care and industry might in addition to their other earnings acquire a competence to maintain     himself or herself and his or her family without further parochial relief it shall and may be lawful for any two justices of the peace in the district on the recommendation of the persons appointed to the management of the poor in such parish or united parishes aforesaid and of two of the visiters of the district in rotation certifying that such person is of good character and that in their opinion an advance in money for the purpose mentioned in the said certificate and which purpose shall be set forth in the certificate of such persons appointed to the management of the said poor might tend to increase the income of such person and thereby ultimately tend to diminish the parochial burthens and which certificate shall be in the form no  in the schedule hereunto annexed and which justices are hereby authorized and empowered on receipt of such certificate and on due consideration to order and direct the payment of such money in advance as in the judgment of such justices will be necessary for the purchase of such cow or other animal or to direct security to be given for the rent of such land and which money so to be allowed shall not exceed what shall be necessary to increase the income of such person by the profits to arise therefrom to the amount to which such person would be entitled to relief for himself or herself or for his or her family i now come to the cowmoney clause the benevolence which suggested this clause is expressed in the most conspicuous characters on the question of policy the following observations have presented themselves hitherto the danger of profusion has confined itself to income it now threatens capital in the preceding clauses the allowances authorized how much soever too ample continued to be as they are under the existing system in the first instance occasional only at the worst gradual accommodated as to their rate of efflux to the influx of the fund from which alone they could be derived here capital is given under the very name of capital and as a substitute to income the pension during pleasure is instantly converted into a pension for years or during life and that pension at the same instant bought out by a gross sum leaving the demand for a fresh pension to recur at any time to be again bought off and so toties quoties the spigot was there opened here the bunghole it would be something in the way of security though surely not much if the cow were but safely lodged in the cowhouse of the indigent to whom the possession of her is to be an inexhaustible spring of affluence but even this security slender as it is is not provided the capital is to be advanced not in the shape of the cow but in the shape of hard money with which the object of this extraordinary bounty is left perfectly at liberty to lay in a fund either in milk or gin according to his taste the cow dies or is stolen or what is much more likely is supposed to be stolen being clandestinely sold to an obliging purchaser at a distance what is to be done want of relief warranted the first cow the same cause will necessitate a second—limit who can the succeeding series of cows the disappearance of the first cow it may be said will excite suspicion the disappearance of a second cow will strengthen suspicion true but upon a mere suspicion without proof will a family be left to starve the utmost security then amounts to this that to a certain number of successive pensions thus bought out will succeed a pension which will not be bought out by donations or loans of this sort made by gentlemen of high amount to deserving individuals selected from such of their tenants or dependants as have been fortunate enough to be comprised within the circle of their notice good is said to have been done in certain instances i make no doubt of it milk is a wholesome as well as pleasant beverage milk is particularly good for children thirty pounds twenty pounds or even ten pounds cannot but form a very comfortable accession to the property of an individual who happens at the time to be suffering under the pressure of indigence when at his own expense a man administers charity in so large a mass it would be extraordinary indeed if he did not pay a considerable attention to the propriety of the application of it and should the object prove less deserving than was supposed or the benefit less permanent than was hoped there is at least no immediate perceptible harm done to any assignable individual but while the hands by which the bounty is to be dealt out remain in the clouds or were they even lying upon the table it seems rather too much to expect equal attention or even in general sufficient attention when the praise and the thanks are reaped by the hands which thus disseminate the bounty     while the burthen of it rests on the shoulders of third persons over and above the general love of popularity motives of a more personal nature may intervene and that most naturally and frequently to no such light amount a man to all appearance wanting relief for himself or his family and who to all appearance would be enabled by the advance of money for purchasing a cow to maintain himself and his family without further parochial relief may besides being to all appearance a very industrious and deserving man have the good fortune to possess a vote no matter what the situation high or low—parliamentary or having nothing to do with parliament for a county for a borough or for one of those situations which gives votes for boroughs if he himself does not possess the vote the father or his son or his brother or the father or brother of his wife or sweetheart may which may come to much the same thing to any man thus circumstanced and the multitude of men thus circumstanced is not likely to be small this cowmoney clause will be a matter of particular convenience to give the value of a dinner to such a purpose might be an act of imprudence as well as a matter of expense and as experience has shown might be fatal to the cause a bounty for good votes a bounty to the amount of £ 0 as we have seen or £ 0 or £ 0 might under favour of this clause be given with the most perfect safety and without a farthing expense it is the profusion i must confess that frightens me the topic of corruption i leave to more brilliant pens figures of arithmetic and not of speech are the figures that govern me standing even upon this frigid ground i can see no bounds i must confess to the profusion where the incentive remaining in full force the main checks all the checks which preserve any tolerable uniformity of operation are thus to be taken away even the shape of the bounty seems to my unfortunate apprehension as objectionable as the quantum of it if the £ 0 or the £ 0 or the £ 0 must be given i had rather have seen the disposal of it left altogether to the dispensing hand than clogged with the condition enforced or not enforced of converting it into a cow   a resource which is to supply a permanent deficiency should be permanent as that deficiency here the deficiency is deemed permanent since an occasional or temporary allowance is deemed inadequate to the supply of it the probable remainder of the life of a cow already in a condition to yield an annuity in the shape of milk is limited sickness and casualties apart to about eight years after which she may sell for about half price   a resource which is to supply a permanent deficiency should in the variations if any to which the amount of it is subjected or exposed keep pace with any variation in the deficiency or if that cannot be should remain constant and invariable so as to afford a solid ground of dependence without any partial much less total cessation during the period that the demand continues in unabated force but the annuity paid by a cow undergoes a necessary suspension—frequently of four months continuance never of less than two months—average say three months or a quarter of a year   a supply allotted as a resource to indigence should be of a nature rather to strengthen by exercise than to weaken by omission or disuse the spirit and habit of industry a dairy of cows would do this attendance upon a single cow is a species of industry if industry it can be called which is of anything that can bear that name the nearest of kin to idleness   in the general account of the national wellbeing nothing is gained but a good deal lost if paul be stript of as much as is bestowed on peter setting aside the accidental faculty of profiting by the toolittleknown opportunities afforded by husbandry in its highest and freshest state of improvement—to the maintenance of a cow the possession of land will be indispensable this land must either be land in separate ownership or land in the state of waste and common land of land in separate ownership about three acres is looked upon as necessary to the constant maintenance of a cow those three acres how are they to be had are they to be bought and given along with the cow this the clause does not go so far as to say are they to be hired and the rent paid for them—not to mention cowhouse and dairy for which articles shifts it may be said will be made nor for this neither does the clause go so far as to make provision the cow then is to be turned upon the common but no sooner is the cow upon the common than the expiration of the annuity of at least by far the greatest part of it five six or seveneighths is certain and near at hand in the existing state of population on the one hand and husbandry on the other it is a point pretty well ascertained—a common will afford airing ground to a milch cow but it will not afford maintenance it will keep the animal alive but it will not keep alive in her the capacity of yielding milk in a quantity amounting to a resource while the annuity is thus sinking so is the value of the capital itself after a years existence upon a common a wellfed cow turned out in the increasing vigour of her youth will instead of gaining have lost in value but before the cow was turned upon the common the common was already overcharged the common which is not already in this state it will i believe be difficult to find the accession of this new mouth will not add to the quantity of the pasture so much therefore as the owner of this cow gets so much do the owners of other cows lose capital therefore cannot be given in this shape without being paid for at least twice over     even laying out of the question the certain and enormous depreciation in value once by the amount of the purchasemoney again by the amount of the annuity or rent charge thrown by the depreciation of the amount of the pasture upon the other commons a depreciation equal at least to the utmost gain accruing to the commons thus favoured if £ 0 then be the money paid and £ 0 be the value of the cow to the individual on whom she is bestowed £ 0 at least would be the loss to the community the receiver of the bounty deducted—£ 0 the clear loss to the whole community the receiver of the bounty included by donations in any shape you may take a few favoured individuals out of the class of poor and place them in the class of people of easy circumstances but this which is only the system of monastic charity upon a great scale giving the beef whole instead of dealing it out in broth is limited in its extent as well as pernicious in its effects and in relieving present indigence sows the seed of future the system to be sought for is a system which shall make the supply of means keep pace with that of wants and that by a preestablished chain of causes and effects whatever be the rapidity or anomality of the progression this problem has been the object of a good deal of reflection embracing the subject in all its relations and dependencies and the solution of it is supposed to be effected consistency may be another point to be considered while the bill with this clause in it for the surcharging of common lands is depending another bill is depending or at least in contemplation the professed and sole object of which is the diminution of the quantity of the land thus circumstanced the principle in the one case is that the existence of land in this state is advantageous to the community in the other case that it is disadvantageous an option between these two conflicting measures seems very requisite to be made the tendency of the general enclosure bill seems alike favourable to the interests of the rich and poor it does perhaps without much seeking all that can be done of what appears to be sought to be done by the present bill its most direct and prominent object is the giving facility to the wealthy towards the augmentation of their wealth but at the same instant it effects with equal certainty an object of still higher amount the raising of the wages of labour in favour of a class among the poor and that the only one in which the wages of labour have been shown to be in many cases unavoidably inadequate to the purpose of maintenance i confine myself to the cow because the cow alone occupies the foreground there are indeed other animals in the offscape but the species are indiscernible and i have already plunged but too deep into the details of husbandry i should incline to the sow as absorbing less capital as giving more exercise to industry and affording a resource less precarious in its nature but there are those that will tell me that in the government of the dairy swine are dependent upon cows nor will the expensive beneficence of the author of this clause content itself with so inferior a resource looking beyond the sow i see everything or nothing a rattlesnake is yielding profit to the hand that shows it and no common is surcharged by it the resource presented by a loom is a permanent one it may be rendered an unfluctuating one a loom eats nothing is not apt to be sick does not sink in value by underfeeding has no legs to be driven away upon and is not exposed to sudden death the working of one loom need not hinder the working of another a loom is but one example of a machine but protesting against the donation of capital in any shape protesting against the principle i will not dive further into the mode chapter v   reliefextension or opulencerelief clause lxviii and be it further enacted that no person shall be excluded from parochial relief or the benefit of this act in any particular beforementioned on account of any real estate hereinaftermentioned or on account of any visible property not exceeding the value of £ in the whole and of the description hereinafter mentioned that is to say if such property shall consist of a tenement or cottage with the appurtenances whether such person shall hold the same or any part thereof in his or her own right or in the right of his wife and whether severally or as joint tenant or as tenant in common or shall occupy any tenement or cottage with the appurtenances belonging to his or her lawful child or children or the issue of such child or children being respectively part of his or her family and whether as guardians or otherwise of whatever value the said tenement or cottage with the appurtenances may be and also if such property shall consist of tools or implements of trade or household furniture wearing apparel or other necessaries suitable to the condition of such poor person not exceeding in value in the whole the sum of £  but that every person in the situation and condition beforementioned and not able from other circumstances to maintain himself or herself or his or her family shall be   0 entitled to the benefit of this act as fully and effectually as if such person was not possessed of such property as aforesaid we come now to the reliefextension clause or opulencerelief clause in reading the above system of donations a natural and i am apt to think a scarcely avoidable supposition is that it is for the indigent and the indigent only that they could have been intended whether they are really confined to the indigent whether the field open to them be not so ample as to comprise what in the instance of people of the working class may be styled opulence is a question on which it will rest with the reader to decide the proviso is that no person shall be excluded from parochial relief or any of the benefits of this act on account of the possession of any tenement or cottage with its appurtenances whatever may be his or her estate or interest therein or on account of any other visible property not exceeding in the whole the value of £ 0 which shall consist either of tools or implements of trade or household furniture wearing apparel or other necessaries suitable to the condition of such poor persons under these words what seems tolerably clear is that a man may be worth £ 0 of visible property to say nothing of concealed or nonapparent property and still come with as irrecusable claim to the above list of pensions and donations as if he had not property to the value of a single farthing what to myself i must confess is not by any means clear is to what higher pitch the opulence may rise without striking the proprietors name out of the book of indigence let us consider it in the first place as not exceeding £ 0 a document naturally enough to be wished for by one who would wish to form a just estimate of the effect of this clause is a comparative statement setting forth on one hand the number actual or probable of individuals whose property rises to the height of this minimum on the other hand the number of those whose property falls short of it should the indigent list as thus defined be found as i cannot help vehemently suspecting it would be found to include a vast majority of the good people of england five six or seven millions for example the system of home provision as thus explained would be found i much fear to amount to a plan for throwing the parish upon the parish the nature of the process by which the mass of national wealth is accumulated was i doubt not sufficiently considered in the formation of this bill to judge by this clause in particular it looks as if certain hypotheses somewhat of kin to the following had been assumed—that wealth is the gift of nature not the fruit of industry that every human creature male as well as female comes into the world with £ 0 in its pocket and that this sum is what it belongs to the government to guarantee to every man the undiminished possession of against misfortune and imprudence as it guarantees to him the possession of his two arms and his two legs against the attacks of injury the apprehension of doing undesigned injustice to the intentions of the bill is an apprehension that pursues me through the whole tenor of it but really i know of no means of coming at the intention of an instrument unless it be through the words judging of it then from the words £ 0 is the mass of property which every person without exception may it is supposed possess and yet be in a state of indigence in a state so low so much below the natural state of man as ought not to be suffered to continue this minimum the guarantee we see thus made of it is not confined to families collectively taken it is not confined to heads of families it extends to every human being whatsoever having a family or none living under the head of a family or living by himself a head of a family may have his own £ 0—£ 00 may be the amount of the family estate and all the while the family hanging on the parish if consistency be an object in legislation it may be worth while to compare this intended pauper relief with the pauper law relief act of geo i which exempts or seeks to exempt persons whose circumstances fall below a certain pitch of supposed indigence from the sort of general outlawry in which that proportion of the people stands involved against which the weight of the expense howsoever heaped together has shut the doors of justice five pounds is the sum assigned in that case £ 0 not to say £ 00 is the sum assigned in the present case according to this proportion it will be matter of some curiosity to observe how much easier a man will find it to get other peoples money than his own and how many there will be in possession of the former faculty while they stand excluded from the latter that it is by no means clear that under this clause the specified sum of £ 0 is the highest which a man might retain of his own while he was maintained at the charge of others has been already hinted and the more closely the clause is scrutinized into the greater the difficulty of ascertaining the real limit will appear my doubt is in the first place whether in the computation of the visible property the moveable is or is not to be added to the immoveable whether the words in the whole are meant to be confined to the other visible property or to be extended to the tenement or cottage that they were not meant to extend to the tenement or cottage and that therefore a man may without standing excluded from any of these bounties be possessed of £ 0 worth of visible moveable property in addition to the feesimple of a cottage may be thus argued from the word appurtenances it may be     inferred that the cottage may have more or less land annexed to it especially when it is considered that under the cowmoney clause it is intended a man shall keep a cow but even without land  0s or even  0s ayear is but an ordinary rent but an ordinary annual value for a cottage and as in the instance of immoveable property small concerns coming within the reach of a greater proportion of purchasers are apt to sell for more years purchase than large ones twenty years purchase upon  0s ayear that is £ 0 may be taken for rather a low estimate allow but the £ 0 for the value of the dwelling this will not leave a farthing for the furniture tools clothes and other necessaries it does not seem to accord with the views manifested in this bill that the property of the cottage a man lives in altogether unaccompanied with any other necessary should debar altogether from a share in the bounty so liberally bestowed when the annual value of the house is no more than the ordinary rent of the abodes of the worst paid class of labourers but if the value of the cottage is not to be included in the £ 0 it is then to be added to the £ 0 £ 0 worth of immoveable property upon a low estimate may thus be added to £ 0 of immoveable property and the possessor not excluded by this £ 0 from the right of obtaining cows supplemental wages and pensions on the plea of indigence the pursuit of the strict rules of grammar might raise up other difficulties in abundance on the ground of this single clause but this specimen may suffice the more conspicuous the spirit of humanity that shines through every clause the more sincerely one regrets to see it in such straits what seems to have led the author of the bill into the difficulty in the present instance is the often painted and always melancholy picture of an industrious family reduced by blameless misfortune from a state of comfort and independence to a state perhaps of confinement at any rate of wretched dependence from which a small relief if administered in time might have rescued them dependence on scanty and in point of quantity precarious charity confinement to the idleness and discomfort and ignominy of an ordinary poorhouse—come in and give up your all or stay out and starve such is the harsh though unavoidable alternative presented by poorhouse charity in the existing state of things an alternative the more excruciating when the all thus to be given up for a mess of pottage is as it sometimes will be found to be the sad remnant of fallen opulence sufficient at one time to place its possessor above the necessity of manual labour this is one of the many cases in which compassion is as laudable as in a feeling heart it is unavoidable but compassion is one thing relief efficacious and unmischievous relief a very different thing the one may be always bestowed and in any quantity the other should never be attempted to be bestowed especially at the expense of the community and upon a scale extending over the whole community till after the strictest and most comprehensive inquiry whether the undertaking lies within the sphere of practicability and whether the removal of the evil if possible be not inseparably connected with the introduction of still heavier and more extensive though less permanent and immediate evils we commiserate darius we commiserate lear but it is not in the power of parishes to give kingdoms to banish not only indigence but dependence it would be necessary to banish not only misfortune but improvidence to guarantee to every man a subsistence is practicable and practised to guarantee to every man the perpetuity of his station in the scale of opulence would be altogether impracticable the very attempt mischievous and perseverence ruinous what seems not to have been sufficiently considered is that betwixt the absolute refusal of relief and the exaction of the absolute surrender of permanent property in return for transient relief there is a medium which is the granting the relief to the extent of the property on the footing of a loan this middle course the only feasible one the only unpernicious one is practicable for it is practised a mode of practising it and practising it without expense forms one leading feature of the largeestablishment system in the shape and magnitude hereinabove supposed meantime although it were regarded as an established point that cottages any more than kingdoms cannot by the hand of public charity be secured against decline let us not conclude that the misfortune is altogether beyond the relief of remedy it is in this quarter of the region of distress that we may behold a part of the extensive field in which private charity as well as domestic friendship may exercise and feast itself without prejudice either to industry or justice nor let it remain unheeded that so long as there is propriety or even established character with but a tolerable prospect of repayment if no assisting hand can be obtained either from domestic connexion from neighbourly intimacy from special patronage or from widespreading though private charity the presumption though not absolutely conclusive is at any rate not weak not only that extraordinary merit but that ordinary good conduct has been wanting and that the pangs of falling prosperty are but the just and useful punishment of improbity or improvidence thus stands the account of the mischief the apprehension of which has been excited by the view of the destined amendments to the existing system of outallowances what possible good can arise out of those amendments in any instance i must confess myself unable     to conceive under the existing system indigence does actually receive such and taken in the lump at least as much relief as is necessary the plan of distribution remaining untouched what was the task that could remain for these amendments either to do nothing or to administer relief where it is not necessary against the system of outallowances setting aside these objections on the score of economy and industry which have been urged by way of objection to the system itself the great and general complaint as far as i have had occasion to observe is not that it is insufficient but that it should be necessary that is that many industrious hands should be continually thrown upon the parish as the phrase is who ought as certainly they ought if possible to be enabled to maintain themselves without being subjected to any such degrading obligation but the keeping them from thus falling upon the parish is what the bill neither does nor so much as professes to do so far from it as far as it does anything it throws them there it throws them in greater numbers it throws them with greater weight the grievance is that the industrious poor should be so liable to be indigent that the independent hand should be so liable to fall into dependence whether the cure be possible is another question but be that as it may the bill does not attempt it what i had all along been considering as a point understood to have been established was the inferiority of the wages of husbandry as compared with those of other labour what i had in consequence understood to have been the object of the bill as far as outallowances are concerned was to confine the bounty to the class which presents the title to it but unless the benefit of the cowmoney clause be thus confined which it can only be by forced implication for there are no words of limitation to perform the office i can see no branch of the bounty to which working hands in general have not a claim as irrecusable as any that can be made by this particular though not very ample class all are equally invited none excepted manufacturers handicraftsmen even domestic servants and others the high paid and pampered inhabitants of large towns if necessity it may be said be equal no matter what the class true but in any other class necessity is not equal at the same time that in every class the full rate or wages whatever be the class and whatever be the rate the full rate or wages be the work worth anything or nothing is guaranteed by the bill to every hand without exception which with ever so little goodwill or fruit will set itself to work the bounties it provides are bestowed for anything that appears not only upon the worst paid classes but upon every better paid class up to the best paid and upon these the quantum of the bounty it bestows is not a quantity limited by that which is necessary but a superfluous quantity rising up to the height of the highest pitch of superfluity which the earnings of the best paid class are capable of furnishing it relieves them not according to the measure of their necessities nor according to the quantity of relief they really want but according to the full rate or wages usually given—given one knows not to whom unless to them in a word according to the means they have had in their hands of placing themselves above the necessity and above the bounty chapter vi   apprenticeship clause xl and be it further enacted that all poor children who shall at any time have received employment under or by virtue of this act and shall obtain a certificate of his or her good behaviour during the time of such employment from the person or persons appointed to the management of the poor of any parish or united parishes with the consent of two of the visiters of the district in rotation and confirmed by the guardian of the poor for the county or division shall be entitled to be put out as apprentices or hired servants by the person or persons appointed to the management of the said poor with such rewards as hereinafter mentioned by writing under their hands according to the form no and no in the schedule hereunto annexed or to that or the like effect and that every male child of the age of fourteen years and every female child of the age of twelve years or at an earlier age if it shall be thought fit may be bound apprentice to any reputable person in great britain to be taught any art trade mystery or occupation or any handicraft business or manufacture which they are respectively fit for for any term not exceeding seven years and so that the term of such apprenticeship shall not endure beyond the age of twentyone years for male children and of nineteen years for female children and in any employment of husbandry for such time not less than three years for such child or children respectively and as the major part of the persons hereby authorized to bind such apprentices shall think most suited to the circumstances of such respective child or children or until such child or children respectively shall attain the ages if a male of twentyone years or being a female of nineteen years or such persons respectively may if they shall think the strength or capacity of any male child or children suited thereto cause him or them to be employed and bound as apprentices in the sea service for the time and in manner aforesaid and according to the laws in force for binding poor apprentices to the sea service and that every writing made in pursuance of this act shall be as binding as an indenture between the master mistress and apprentice and the guardian of the poor for     the county or division confirming the same and his successors and shall in all respects have the same effect and operate as an indenture for apprenticing poor children whose parents are not able to provide for them made and executed in conformity to any of the laws now in force relating thereto and shall be enforced in like manner by the guardian of the poor for the county or division for the time being according to the directions of this act herein given with relation to any property belonging to any parish in such county or division and all and every child or children of the respective ages beforementioned or at an earlier age if it shall be thought fit may be hired to any reputable householder or husbandman in great britain by such persons as aforesaid with such allowance of the visiters as before is mentioned to be domestic or menial servants in husbandry housewifery or otherwise for any term not less than one year or until such child or children shall respectively attain their ages if male of twentyone years or if a female of nineteen years or until marriage at such competent rate of wages as shall be in that behalf agreed upon and at the end or other expiration of such hiring may be taken into employment in the said school or schools of industry or otherwise under the authority of this act or may be again hired for such term as aforesaid and so from time to time until they shall respectively arrive at such ages as aforesaid and that upon every such binding or hiring as aforesaid the persons joining in such contracts on the behalf of such poor apprentices or servants shall take care that they shall be sufficiently clothed and maintained according to their respective wants and conditions and that the wages if any to be paid to them shall be paid to or laid out for the use and benefit of such child or children and the said person having authority to join in making such contracts may with such consent as aforesaid pay out of the funds provided for the relief of the poor by virtue of this act or any the laws now in force such reasonable fee or consideration for the binding out of such poor apprentices as they shall deem necessary and may also provide such poor child or children so bound out as apprentices or hired as servants with such suitable clothing as shall be necessary at the expense of the parish or united parishes and as a reward for the good behaviour of such child or children during their said employment in such school or schools of industry or other places aforesaid in which they shall have been employed before the commencement of such apprenticeship or hiring as aforesaid and that such fee or consideration so paid or contracted for or such suitable clothing so provided shall not be charged or chargeable with any stamp duty whatever by this clause every child of a certain description is declared to be entitled to be put out as an apprentice or hired servant with certain advantages not specified this clause being but a frame and the picture not hung up but why not hung up a criticism on the picture may appear chargeable with precipitation reasoning under this disadvantage what occurs to me on the subject is as follows—in the matter of apprenticeship three points may be distinguished the legal subjection during the continuance of the relation thus contracted—the exclusive privileges attached to that relation by a particular law in a numerous class of instances—and the comparative rank in life it confers in a still more extensive class of instances as compared with the condition of an unprivileged hand occupied in ordinary labour   of the utility of the legal subordination my conception is the same with that which stands apparent on the face of the bill conceiving of it as calculated to operate in a certain degree as a source of instruction and in a yet higher degree in the still more important function of a security for good behaviour every accession to the number of the instances of its existence presents itself to me in the shape of a public benefit   as an instance of the monopoly in trade i know of but one opinion relative to it—oppression in the instance of the individuals excluded from the occupation thus engrossed—excessive earnings in the instance of the partakers of the privilege whence the alternation of penury with excessive plenty in a rank of life where sensual excesses supply the demand for occupation in a vacant mind—enhancement of prices in every article connected with the subjectmatter of the monopoly—such appear to be the consequences to the several parties interested—to individuals excluded individuals favoured and the community at large   as a source of exaltation so long as the superiority it confers is confined to that which is the natural result of the improvement and augmentation of natural powers the situation presents nothing but what appears to be the unavoidable consequence of any such improvement—a consequence beneficial perhaps in some points of view pernicious in none but so far from being either necessary or useful it seems pernicious to wit on the accounts just mentioned if in any respect it be the result of coercive law but this property is what may be attributed to it in either of two cases if a man be excluded from the situation by a direct prohibition to engage in it or if public money be employed to pay a man for helping a boy to get into it in the one case the coercion takes the shape of restraint in the other case of compulsion in the one case the monopoly is a direct one in the other case an indirect one produced by an addition made to the general mass of taxes considered as confined to the lowest that is the lowest paid class of working hands i     see an uncertain chance of improvement in point of morality to be bought at a certain expense i am not disposed to underrate morality but in the present instance i am not able to obtain what to me appears a requisite assurance that the chance purchased will be worth the price in the instance of each apprentice thus taken in consideration of so much public money i want sufficient means of assuring myself in relation to both of two points that an apprentice would not have been taken without the money and that the portion of morality paid for by the money will be worth it in the first case the business seems exposed to the following dilemma if the fee be small it will not be sufficient to turn the scale it will produce no more apprenticeships than would have been produced without it if it be large it opens a proportionably wide door to profusion and abuse in the second case the fee large or small holds out to improper hands a temptation which without it does not exist he who takes the apprentice without money can propose to himself no other advantage than what is to be derived from the service and thence the instruction employment and morality of the apprentice he who takes the apprentice with and for money may have employment for the money without having any for the apprentice all this while let it not be forgotten there are existing laws under which the taking of apprentices in the employment in question without money is compellable and which are more or less enforced hence a source of complaint and jealousy and injustice real or imagined while one man in a parish is compelled to do for nothing that which another man is paid for under these doubts though really they are but doubts with regard to the value of the purchase the vis inertiæ would i think if it depended on me be sufficient to keep the money in my pocket especially while there are so many purchases to be made with it the value of which is beyond doubt among which the purchase of so much security in respect of property as is constituted by the leaving the money in the pockets of the contributors ought not to be forgotten to judge of the clear benefit resulting from this or that application of a sum of money compare the gross benefit with the mischief of the most mischievous tax—for instance the taxes operating in prohibition of justice this test i consider as a principle in finance and it is for aught i know a new one—of the expenditure that will abide it the utility ought it should seem to stand pretty clear of doubt if the occupations into which it is proposed to force hands by public money be of the high paid class the question of the expediency of the provision presents itself under a different shape if the individual thus forced into apprenticeship in this class by dint of the fee be one more than would have existed in the class without the fee this addition as far as its influence extends goes to the reduction of the monopoly and tends accordingly though in a microscopic degree to the diminution of the mischiefs of it if on the contrary he makes no addition to the number of the sharers in the monopoly but only occupies the place of some other individual who but for the fee would have occupied it then no effect is produced but the throwing away of so much money reasons for apprehending that the addition upon the whole may be rather apparent than real are not wanting this expedient for forcing hands into the class of employment in question has no tendency to increase the quantity of employment in the species of employments belonging to that class its real tendency is of the opposite kind to send hands to the employment not employment to the hands but viewing the whole mass of employment of the species in question in the lump while the demand for the work—for the produce of the employment—is not increased no fresh hand can be forced into the employment in question without forcibly keeping some other out of it the individual who would thus have been kept out in any instance by force of the bounty—the individual who but for this bounty would have been received into this extra paid and superior class—is more likely to be one belonging to that same class than one belonging to the inferior class for no reason can be assigned why the superior class should not in the way of natural increase be as capable of keeping up its numbers as the inferior class and the offspring of the superior class has better opportunity of an introduction into his own superior class than is likely to fall to the share of a member of the inferior class if this then be the case it seems to follow that as often as the child of the labourer or impoverished tradesman thus gets a lift the consequence is that some other child of a tradesman by finding the condition of the tradesman shut against him must receive a fall let me not be understood as pleading in favour of any forced system of casts all i contend for is a system of equal and unexpensive liberty where no partitions are set up or kept up by the hand of law good fortune and merit on the one hand ill fortune and improvidence on the other will keep up every degree of mixture which the interests of hope and industry can require the conclusion seems to be that in this instance as in the other no advantage is near so certain as the expense if the bargain—natural advantages and bounty taken together—be worth making candidates for a share in it are not likely on either part—on the part of master or apprentice—to be wanting the individuals it lies open to are every child who shall at any time have received employment by virtue of this act and shall obtain a certificate of his or her     good behaviour during the time of such employment according to the form no  in the schedule annexed if then £  for example be the apprentice fee £  may be the price of a days service while a patron exists in whose judgment a douceur of this kind whatever may be the amount of it may be worth the acceptance of an obsequious client howsoever it be with other manufactures the manufacture of apprentices need not stagnate whether an article of this sort be worth throwing into any such fund as the election fund is a question that must wait its answer till the picture above spoken of has been inserted into its as yet vacant frame the facility thus provided might have been regarded and intended in either of two lights in the light of a distinction or reward or in the light of a general benefit in either case it may have been regarded as an instrument of morality though exercising its operation at a different period in the two cases in the one case at the period previous to the apprenticecontract acting upon the individuals concerned in the quality of candidates for the advantage in the other case at the period subsequent to the formation of the contract acting upon them in the quality of persons subject to the powers conferred by the contract in which of these two lights it was considered is what i do not clearly see the question is not altogether immaterial for the purposes do not exactly harmonize at least in the quantity of expense they call for there is a considerable difference in the one way the magnitude of the benefit is in the direct ratio in the other in the inverse ratio of the numbers on whom it is conferred the facility of admission being so great the attainment of the advantage being so easy it follows that unless the facility were the result of inadvertence the direct general benefit rather than the indirect one resulting from the operation of the distinction in the character of a reward was the object principally in view for the certificate of general good behaviour being a matter of course unless where some very flagrant and special instance of illbehaviour can be proved can scarcely be considered as drawing any other than an accidental line the difference between the quantity of money that may be requisite in the two cases is such as may render this point minute as it may seem worth settling call the average number of parishes in an union five this for the  0000 parishes in england wales included makes  000 unions annual average number of boys and girls capable of being put out apprentices in each union suppose ten  0000 in the whole annual total amount of apprenticefees at £  £ 00000 at £ 0 £ 00000 suppose distinction and reward to be the object rather than immediate and universal benefit then instead of the five one apprenticeship for each five in the course of the year will let us say suffice in this way the expense would he reduced from the £ 00000 or the £ 00000 to £ 0000 or £ 0000 the refusal of the certificate will be a stigma fewer or more what is to become of the individuals thus stigmatized who will give them employment who will have anything to do with them that can help it they who have been thus pronounced unfit either for apprenticeship or service those for whose good behaviour security is most wanted these are they in whose instances the security is refused once more what should we say to that pharmacopæia which for those who are in good health should provide aurum potabile and other expensive drugs but for those who are sick nothing whether found sick or made sick by it as here the considerations thus brought under review will be apt to appear minute and somewhat vague but that the utility of a provision should turn upon considerations to which those epithets are applicable and that too a provision by which public money is scattered without being weighed or counted—is not that a circumstance sufficient of itself to present the provision in a questionable shape is the supposition above made of the ten apprenticeable youths per union to be regarded as a reasonable one this is but one out of a multitude of arithmetical questions all equally pertinent which may have presented themselves in crowds under this as well as every other of the clauses touched upon for all such questions i must confess myself to have but one answer—utter ignorance the blame however if i may venture to say as much lies not with this humble comment but with the text which while heaping up so immense a mass of bounty knows nothing of the numbers of those by the number of which that bounty is to be multiplied nor consequently of the expense general remarks on home provision the grant of this indulgence is limited it is true to the case of a mans being a person entitled to the benefit of this act but how this point is to be ascertained is a matter which i am much inclined to believe will be found beyond the comprehension of those who are to judge—it most certainly is beyond mine—and in the meantime the family must not be left to starve but for all those bounties a fund it may be said is provided and that an ample one the fund arising from the whole stock of as yet unemployed ability now for the first time to be turned to use to this i feel myself compelled to make two answers one is that i doubt the real produce of this stock when put in motion will turn out to be little or nothing to say no worse another is that be it ultimately what it may it cannot for a long time be in readiness to honour the drafts thus largely made upon it     on the first of these points i shall have occasion to touch separately the other is more particularly to the purpose here the impediments to the union of profit with reliefemployment and thence all profit to be drawn from employment on the one hand and relief and the distribution of the bounties on the other are these—  st that the distribution of the bounties is to commence at the very commencement of the act viz on the  0th of july in the present year but by section  0 it is not till after the   th september following that the first link in the long and complicated chain of causes and effects on which the commencement of the means of employment is to depend can be begun upon a work which where it finds willingness on the part of the great variety of persons whose cooperation is necessary can scarcely do otherwise than take up years and which in those districts in which there is any want of such necessary cooperation will so long as such want continues not be begun upon at all meantime the distribution of the bounties is running on full swing for immediately from and after the commencement of the act as aforesaid it begins as soon as any father is entitled to the benefit thereof according to the provisions hereinaftermentioned for the purpose of entitling a man to the benefit of the act there is nothing anywhere specified from the beginning to the end of the act unless it be the qualification of wanting relief the qualification spoken of in the   th section nor yet to disentitle a man but the act of refusing employment or instruction the disqualification specified in section    on such refusal a man is made to stand precluded not only from the benefit of the act in short not at all from the benefit of the act by name but from relief itself from every species and degree of relief whatever but till a man has made the refusal in question the disqualification does not take place and till tender shall have been made refusal cannot have taken place but tender of employment cannot be made till the means of employment exist that is till the establishment for affording employment has been set upon its legs the only assignable disqualification then cannot take place in any district till nobody can say when while the only assignable qualification the wanting relief exists in itself already and exists in the shape of a qualification under the act as soon as the act itself comes into existence—that is on the  0th of july next another circumstance that stands in the way of the coincidence between disbursement and supply is the impracticability of performing the condition on which the bounties are made to depend viz the acceptance of the instruction and employment an impracticability that will be found to take place in many cases that the children are not to be lodged in the schools in which they are to work seems pretty clear that the adults are to be lodged in any such common dwelling does not appear the districts though not upon anything like what i have termed the largeestablishment scale will so it seems consist of a considerable number of parishes laid together the greater the number of parishes that may come to be laid together the greater the distance between the school wheresoever situated and the houses of the greatest part of the number of the scholars who are to be of all ages from five years upwards here then comes a sort of dilemma if the district is small the expenses necessitated by those parts of the establishment of which the expense is incapable of diminution will be so great as to cut out every possible profit that could be made out of the earnings of so small a number of working hands if the district is large whether from the proportion of the time consumed on the journey to and fro or from inability to perform it or inability on the part of the parents or managers to enforce the performance of it the labour of a great part of the intended scholars will be out of the reach of being collected the exclusion thus put by distance in the instance of infancy is coextensive it is evident with the inability whatever be the source but wherever the performance of the condition meant to be annexed to the receipt of the bounty is or is deemed impracticable and that without any supposed fault on the part of the intended object of the bounty the condition sinks of course and the bounty stands alone after what has been said on topics of so much more weight a hint of this topic will probably be deemed sufficient to follow it up and apply it in the way of calculation would be matter of some difficulty and occupy more space than can be allotted to it here a third reason is that from the mode of payment a large proportion of the hands must be fully paid while their work is worth nothing so far from being worth enough to pay for its own charges the mode of payment prescribed and prescribed without limitation or exception is payment by the piece i do not say that this is not the best mode of payment in many instances perhaps in by far the greatest number of instances but in some instances it is impracticable because the degree of advance made in quantity of work done is unsusceptible of mensuration in other instances it is apt to be disadvantageous on account of the difficulty of ascertaining the goodness and quality of what is done and in proportion to the difficulty of ascertaining quality will be the certainty of bad work and work may in many instances be so bad as not only to afford no profit but to destroy the value of the materials but in all instances there will be a certain period the period of instruction during which with all imaginable diligence and honesty on the part of the workmen the work will be worth nothing but while the work is acquiring     its value the workman must live and will be made to live accordingly by section    if the sum allotted for the support and maintenance of the family whether under the name of wages earnings or allowances proves deficient the deficiency is to be made up payment by time instead of the piece will then take place in the first instance through necessity and having taken root the interest which idleness will give a man in its continuance will render it not very easy to eradicate i do not dispute but that it may in most instances be eradicated under a proper system of regulations and inducements adapted to the nature of the case all i mean is that i see no great probability of the growth of any such good economy under the auspices or rather the rod of a system of legislation which after enacting that practicable or not practicable the working hands that they may do so much the more work shall be paid according to what they do enacts in the same breath that they shall go on for an indefinite time receiving whatsoever may be thought proper to allow them under the name of maintenance although what they do shall continue to be worth nothing and this without so much as the inconvenience of quitting their own homes had the application been left to individual discretion a hint coming from so high a quarter might as a hint have been of no small use but the precept being thus peremptory and unbending its tendency would rather be to bring the principle into discredit than to promote the use of it essay on the question—who are the persons for whom the several bounties provided by this bill are intended when a system of bounties so various in its appearance so vast in its magnitude and in its apparent burthensomeness to the public so formidable is provided a natural question is who are the persons destined to partake of it the answer i must confess myself unable to give had i been able it is the answer i should have given not this essay or rather as the question would have been needless the question would not have been started the benefit of the act—the word benefit as employed with reference either to the act in general or to some part of its contents occurs either in the singular or the plural number in nine sections in five of them           0 in the singular on which five occasions such of the effects of the act as are considered as being of a beneficial nature are considered as comprising one entire undistributed undiversified mass of benefit in two others in the plural sections      and in the two remaining ones the benefits spoken of are spoken of as resulting from particular provisions therein mentioned and not as resulting from the entire body of the act in neither of these two sections therefore is to be found the benefit of the act the first time the phrase occurs which is at the very opening of the act a sort of promise is made to give the elucidation here sought any father entitled to the benefit thereof viz of this act according to the provisions hereinafter mentioned the accomplishment of this promise if it be one is unfortunately forgotten provisions there are enough which speak of this benefit which allude to it which like this provision speak of it as indicated but there are none that indicate it had the task been mine having settled with myself who the persons were whom it was my view to benefit my first care i must confess would have been either to have found or to have made for them a name this name and no other is the name i should have called them by as often as occasion recurred for speaking of them having fixed a name for them little should i think of discarding that name for any circumlocution much less a circumlocution so enigmatical as that contained in the words the persons entitled to the benefit of this act a designation of this sort may be pleasant in a riddle but whether pleasant or no is certainly not profitable in an act of parliament if it seemed to me a fit occasion for a riddle i should at any rate think it incumbent on me to give the key to it and how little soever conformable it be to the usage of riddles i would give the key along with the riddle in the first instance i would say the persons entitled to the benefit of this act are such and such persons but it is evident how much better it would be to say simply such and such persons at once leaving the benefit to speak for itself to state who the persons are who are intended to be bound by an act is matter of necessity—of equal necessity and facility because when new obligations are meant to be imposed if nobody is bound by them nothing is done but to state and discriminate who the parties intended to be benefited by it are is perhaps never a necessary task and would seldom be found an altogether easy one the very existence of benefit in any shape may be problematical and supposing it ever so undisputed the wider it is in its extent and the more pregnant in its consequences the more difficult it is to trace should the benefits of this act prove such as the benevolence of the authors of it has been expecting to see and such as the author of this essay on it would most sincerely wish to see result from it the more rich the benefit the more difficult to discriminate of this act it might truly be said as is said by the poet of i forget what else—   æquè pauperibus prodest locupletibus æquè   æquè neglectum pueris sembusque nocebit so diversified so extensive so lasting so prolific the benefit it would be difficult to say     whether rich or poor old or young enjoyed the largest share of it but little as it seems necessary in the text of an act to make mention of its benefits what seems indispensably necessary is to state and that in the clearest terms who the persons are who may be considered as entitled to such of the benefits or supposed benefits of it for which there is anything to be done in other words how a man may know whether he is or is not entitled to whatever he may be disposed to claim under the notion of its being a benefit and consequently if anything for that purpose is to be done what that is which becomes thus requisite to be done the necessity of being thus explicit will appear the more indispensable when it is considered out of what description of persons those for whom the most immediate and largest share of the benefit appears to be intended are to come—the class of all others to and for whom information of every kind is most wanting and most necessary in such mouths a most natural and surely not altogether an unreasonable question is if the writer knew which of us he meant why did he not tell us and if he did not could he expect that we should whatever situation in life be considered that of the poor or lowly who are to receive the main benefit of the act or that of the exalted or magistrates who are to dispense them—of this as of every other act all and singular the benefits depend upon its being understood and its being understood depends upon its being intelligible whatever is given in such abundance by the act—headmoney for children—supplemental wages in default of ability and industry—cowmoney—is expressly confined to those who are entitled to the benefit of the act who are they i dont know where is it said who the persons are that are to be considered as entitled to this benefit nowhere in five of the sections as we have seen sections          and  0 the beneficial result of the act is spoken of as one undiversified indivisible or at least undivided mass and then the persons in question the persons alluded to are spoken of as entitled to it viz to the whole of it insomuch that nobody who has any part of it can have or at least is intended to have less than the whole of it in two other sections   and    benefits in a countless or at least uncounted multitude are spoken of as flowing from the act and now a man may have some of them without having others by section   no person shall be excluded from parochial relief or any of the benefits of this act on any of the accounts there specified by section    employment and instruction—employment and instruction two most desirable benefits are destined for certain persons but to come in for his share of the benefits it is expressly provided that a man must be entitled to all the benefits of this act before he can have these two or either of them he must take out his title to every other before he can obtain the smallest particle either of employment or of instruction this vacant this neglected this uninstructed this altogether unfurnished mind must possess a degree of instruction—i fear to state it—a degree of instruction with respect i speak it such as does not appear to be possessed by even the legislator himself—a degree of instruction i much fear beyond the power of any man that lives he must have comprehended the act comprehended it in all its parts traced it through all its consequences investigated and catalogued without exception all its benefits and this as an operation preliminary to the inquiry whether it be his good fortune to be entitled to any the smallest share in so rich a prize confessing myself not possessed of anything like the degree of instruction exacted with so little mercy of the forlorn objects of the intended bounty i will endeavour to the best of my ability to make out the list of these benefits i articles which in themselves would appear to be entitled to be comprehended under the list of benefits though not expressly characterized by that appellation but rather expressly excluded out of it   benefit of receiving headmoney for supernumerary children   benefit of receiving supplemental wages at the public charge in addition to such wages as individuals will give   benefit of receiving cowmoney—money to buy a cow—section   this is however expressly mentioned as neither constituting the benefit of the act nor so much as any part of it since the being entitled to the benefit of the act is mentioned as one of two conditions which must concur in order to give a man his chance for receiving this species of bounty the same observation is equally applicable to both those other clauses in one sentence our inquirer might be tempted for a moment to fancy himself on the point of possessing the object of his wishes—but disappointment would be the termination of his hopes in section    after providing that no person shall be excluded from parochial relief or any of the benefits of this act on account of the possession of certain property therein described it goes on and adds but that every person in the situation and condition beforementioned and not able from other circumstances to maintain him or herself or his or her family shall be entitled to all the benefits of this act absolutely if this be the case then the problem is solved is it then absolutely alas no but comparatively only section    as fully and effectually as if such person was not possessed of such property as aforesaid property or no property so the property be not above the mark a man will be equally entitled to these benefits     but still the question remains unanswered what must i do to be entitled if this concluding reference had not put out the light which for a moment appeared to show itself the introductory one would have done the business—would have been sufficient to render the obscurity equally impenetrable to be entitled to all the benefits of the act it is necessary a man should be in the situation and condition abovementioned and in travelling over the three preceding sections to see what that situation and condition is it appears to be the situation and condition of him who is entitled to the benefit of the act who then is a person entitled to the benefit of the act who why a person entitled to the benefit of the act in one place section    a case is mentioned in which a certain class of persons therein specified may receive certain advantages therein specified and a sort of person therein also specified shall it is said with the consent of two other persons therein specified two justices of the peace in the district take order for the administering to them these benefits this though something like light and the most like it of anything that is to be found in the whole compass of the bill is not however that light the advantages there spoken of are special in their nature the description of them being contained in and confined within that single clause neither are they spoken of under the name of benefits they are benefits if to be instructed and employed and maintained are benefits but they are not therein spoken of under the name of benefits much less as the benefits comprising the benefit of the act if they were we might cry with archimedes ευϱηϰα we have found it for to these benefits the statement of the title is as explicit as could be wished who are the persons entitled to these benefits—answer all persons wanting relief if these were the same persons as those alluded to by the expression any person entitled to the benefit of this act with what advantage in point of brevity as well as precision might the former expression have been substituted to this latter if then it be really the case that by the words every person entitled to the benefit of this act is meant neither more nor less than all persons wanting relief the secret is out—the mystery is unravelled but if all persons wanting relief are really to be let in why are they to be thus muffled up why all this pains to put them in masquerade throwing away the surplusage about benefits and titles why not say simply all persons wanting relief or even more simply still all persons for if relief is to be had in such quantity and on such terms it may be difficult to say who it is that will not be wanting it the adjunct wanting relief may be the more easily spared and added to the heap of discarded surplusage inasmuch as if a man wants relief it is intended he should have it and if he does not want it he will not ask for it unfortunately we are still at sea the hope of a safe landing though at such an expense of words and after so much buffeting from clause to clause is still but a pleasing dream the want of relief is not sufficient to entitle a man to the benefit after all for in the   th section the case is put of a man wanting relief and it is if not expressly stated yet necessarily implied that a man may want relief and yet not be a person entitled to the benefit of the act in case says the bill the person wanting relief shall be a person entitled to the benefit of the act so that now we are as much at a loss as ever moreover in section   the being entitled to the benefit of this act is one thing and the wanting relief another for both conditions it is there expressly provided must concur before a man can be admitted to receive the bounty there provided namely money to buy a cow another thing which we learn from that same clause concerning the benefit of this act is that the receiving money to buy a cow does not constitute the benefit of this act nor indeed so much as any part of it since the benefit of this act is a distinct thing which a man must absolutely be entitled to before he can take his chance for receiving this money for the purchase of a cow i said but now if this clause is to be trusted to but that this clause is not altogether nor exclusively to be trusted to will appear from another section to which however it makes no reference should any one in the course of his pursuit after the true intent and meaning of the bill be led to take any such stride as that from the   th section to the   st he will there find it written that in regard to relief if that be the benefit or among the benefits of the act in order to be entitled to this benefit for such it will not be denied to be whatever may be thought of the benefits of the act it is not altogether sufficient to be a person nor yet to be a person wanting relief for that there is a sort of person who be his want what it may is not to be considered as entitled to any relief from any parish or united parishes—no poor person who shall refuse any work offered to him or her under the authority of this act which he or she is able to execute or to receive instructions for executing such work or who shall not on request made according to the directions of this act permit all or any of his or her family who are able to work and cannot otherwise support themselves to be employed under the authority of this act shall be entitled to ask demand or receive any relief     except as hereinafter is provided here if anywhere one should have thought was the place for speaking of the benefits of this act in which case if we had not learnt in direct terms who are entitled to those benefits   0 we should at any rate have learnt who are not which is one step towards it instead of that we have the very general and extensive word relief thus much the mention of the word relief will be apt to do to put a man in mind of the benefits of the act but this is to raise doubts not to solve them is relief precisely the same thing with the benefits of this act it covers a great deal of the same ground certainly but if tried in the geometrical way of superposition we should find it in some parts of its extent perhaps overhanging the benefit in other parts at any rate falling short of it the advantage of being put out apprentice can hardly be termed relief and yet this wherever the bill has more benefits than one belonging to it is surely one of them instruction if instruction be a benefit is another of the benefits of the act yet this is certainly not comprehended under relief for it is expressly put in contradistinction to it no instruction no relief and so with regard to employment besides in the cowmoney clause section   as we have already seen the benefit of the act is one thing relief another thing the benefit is a sort of thing he must be entitled to the relief a sort of thing he must want in order to take his chance for getting the cowmoney yet while it thus falls short of the full measure of the benefit or benefits of the act it extends or at least wears the appearance of extending beyond the act for it extends to whatever relief can be found to be provided by all the existing poor laws put together this sends our inquirer upon the hunt over the whole body of the poor laws for the purpose of picking up the several crumbs of relief the several constituent elements of the general mass of relief provided by those laws for the purpose of taking measure of the aggregate and comparing it with the aggregate mass of the benefit or benefits provided by this act it may here occur that in proportion as the difficulty of finding out receivers for the bounty increases the arguments that turn upon the alarming magnitude of the bounty will be losing their force and that if after all no claimants for it should be found the mischief of which so much has been said in this comment will be as ideal as the benefit of which so much is said in the act but not to mention that the benefit of a parliamentary revisal is yet in store let it not be thought that because the draftsman has not perfectly succeeded in finding out the objects of his bounty bill there may not be others who will find them for him hunger says the proverb will break through stone walls it will find still less difficulty in making its way through mists and whether it be from humanity for humanity howsoever misguided ought not to be robbed of its name whether it be from humanity or from some of the less pure motives above hinted at the efforts of those who may conceive themselves invited to put in their claim to the bounty are not likely to pass everywhere unseconded by the corresponding efforts of those who may conceive themselves called upon to dispense it in a word the obscurity may plague the magistrate but it will not prevent the mischief obscurity is the source of every mischief it is a remedy to none the conclusion is that i am altogether ignorant who they are that are entitled to the benefits of the act and how to find them and in this i am altogether positive should anybody else be more fortunate it is not easy to be more diligent—any one of the million for example who have been set a gaping for these benefits—let him accept my congratulations and my envy i envy him and give him joy conclusion to give a short specimen of prolixity to give a clear picture of confusion is no easy task one efficient cause of unintelligibility pervades the whole bill open it where you will you find a benefit or supposed benefit spoken of as designed for somebody who is that somebody the sort of person for whom the benefit is designed question what is to accommodate answer to accommodate is to accommodate explanation as if i were to accommodate you or you were to accommodate me question   who then is the person to be accommodated answer the person to be accommodated explanation the person entitled to the accommodation given by the act the person for whom the benefit of the act is intended it would be something if there were but one benefit or soidisant benefit running through the whole unfortunately there are as many benefits or supposed benefits almost as clauses with as many different sorts of persons into whose laps they are showered down by the hand of the learned draftsman who through the whole of its vast expanse may be seen dealing out his favour like merlin in the masquerade in the character of fortune howsoever it may be with regard to contrivance there is no want at least of felicity in the result a composition of such bulk and such texture is examination proof the lightest comment would find itself sunk down without redemption to the very bottom of the gulf of oblivion by the ponderosity of the text when observations to this effect having this or any other production of the same pen for their subject are made and the occasion presents itself as often as any such production presents itself one answer is ready and a distinction is at hand how much the world of industry is a gainer by the division of labour is well known it can be no secret to any one who has ever opened a page of adam smith it is thus that in one branch of the department of the revenue the province of the cocket reader has been separated from that of the cocket writer it is thus that in a higher branch of the same department the offices of statute     writer and statute interpreter with or without that of statute understander annexed have undergone a similar separation the latter having by an arrangement of some years standing been allotted exclusively to the noble and learned lord who presides so worthily in the court of kings bench at the end of a certain number of months or years and at the end of a certain number of hundreds of pounds apiece the poor of this country such of them as have more money than they know what to do with may know by a knock at the noble interpreters great gate which of them this and that benefit was intended for and then it will be as if this or that mountain of words had been left out and this or that word or two were inserted which to a plain and unlearned understanding might as well have been respectively left out or inserted in the first instance this being the case so long as westminster hall the great mine of certainty is open to all who have a golden spade to dig in it with it seems perfectly well understood as well at the treasury as in westminster hall that whether a bill or an act be or be not intelligible in the first instance is a matter of indifference to enrich it with a proper quantity of surplusage is a necessary work but to drop into it a single grain of original intelligibility would be a work of supererogation certum est says a maxim of law quod certum reddi potest certain is that which certain can be made the capacity of being rendered intelligible is an attribute that constitutes the proprium in modo as logicians term it of an act since whether it has or has not a meaning of its own the court are bound to construe it that is to find a meaning for it so that in fact it would be but an idle sort of business to be at the pains of giving a meaning to a composition which whether it have a meaning or no can never be in want of one carrying modesty to excess it assumes no other title than that of heads of a bill as if there were not such thing as a word of surplusage to be found in it on the contrary so rich is it in surplusage that a man might find enough in it and to spare not only for a bill or for an act but for a whole session full of acts and as to heads a head is the thing of all others of which there is the least trace or appearance to be found in certain circumstances to denominate is to characterize to class is in effect to criticise this and this alone is the sort of criticism which a work of the nature i mean of the bulk and texture of that which i have before me will admit of with this single dissertation the reader is now let off want of the necessary time despair of attention despair of fruit to these he is indebted for his dismission even at this late period certainly not by any means to any want of matter in the text fifty is the number of pages here bestowed on it considered in this limited point of view considered in the same point of view the same or thereabouts is the number of volumes that might have been bestowed on it and with about equal cause the same is about the number of volumes that may at any time be bestowed with about equal cause on almost every law while the form in which laws have hitherto been expressed continues to be observed reform in the mode of composing the laws reform in the laws considered as laws is reform in the instrument in the very instrument by which all the work is done reform in the poor laws or in any other branch of the laws is but a reform in this or that branch of the work bad instruments can make nothing but bad works

formed any conception how slight soever of the state of political society in spain and in particular of the enormity of the shares possessed by the privileged orders in the landed property of the country—by the clergy not less than a third of the whole by nobles of different classes estates equal in extent in some instances to an average english county and those estates so entailed as to be unalienable—to any person so informed it can scarcely be matter of wonder that endeavours should have been employed to insert into the spanish constitution in addition to the assembly composed of the representatives of the whole people privileged and unprivileged together an assembly composed exclusively of the representatives of that comparatively small though still too large portion with powers to this small part in pursuit of its own particular and thence sinister interest to frustrate all measures proposed by the representatives of the whole for the good of the whole this is legitimacy and social order under the matchless constitution the envy and admiration of the world this is what accordingly was proposed to be made legitimacy and social order in spain a curious question is—how it should have happened that the old man of the sea whose gripe still continues on the neck of the modern utopia should not in the early days of the spanish national assembly have fastened himself upon the neck of spain yet somehow or other such is the escape on which spain from early times and from her portugal in these times have respectively to congratulate themselves that in such a state of society endeavours to that end should have been employed is nothing wonderful the wonder would have been if they had not been employed the wonder is how they should have failed of being successful while corruptionists and their dupes are in extasy at the sight of their utopia with her stagneck and three old men of the sea fastened upon it spain and portugal are congratulating themselves on having each but one of them and his hold growing every day looser and looser while they are cheered by yankeeland whose neck has for these forty years been free from all such vermin and who bids the habitable globe observe and declare whether in any and what respect she is the worse for it at a time when these prospects which are now so happily realized had not so much as opened the name of bentham had become familiar to whatever was liberal in the great southern peninsula of europe that exclusion which the system of corruption has hitherto put upon it in england the united force of censorships and inquisitions has never been able to effect either in spain or portugal spite of both those bars scarcely had those works of his which were edited in   0  by m dumont made their appearance in france than they found their way into both the two adjoining kingdoms those works with which neither in oxford where he took his degrees nor in either of the other church of england universities not to speak of scottish ones any candidate for the loaves and fishes could confess     an acquaintance without blasting the prospects of his life—not only now are but almost immediately after their publication were taken in hand and fed upon at salamanca and coimbra fed upon with a delight the fruits of which have in both countries manifested themselves in the acts of the sovereign body as well as in the speeches made in it and ere these pages have issued from the press will probably in this country meet the public eye in different parts of spain were read it may be imagined with what secrecy courses of lectures of which those works formed the textbooks lectures upon those gratuitous terms which to patriotism and philanthropy are so natural to legitimacy and social order so suspected and formidable one of these lectures had a lawyer for its reader it was that mora abovementioned another a churchman for it is only in england that to lawyers and churchmen with only here and there an exception and still fewer that dare show themselves everything that tends to reform or genuine improvement—everything in a word that tends to the advancement of the greatest happiness of the greatest number—is an object of horror and abhorrence of the abovementioned works of bentham notice has reached this country of no fewer than three if not four translations as being finished and ready for the press besides extracts in periodicals but on the one hand such is the unavoidable bulk of those works on the other hand such the scarcity of money and the smallness of the market for literary productions in general nothing in that way from the spanish press has yet reached this country except a sort of analytical view in a hundred and forty  vo pages having for a first title espiritu de bentham and for a second title systéma de la ciencia social por el dr d toribio nunez jurisconsulto espanol breathing in every page the most rapturous admiration and devoting to public reproach the government of his country in case of their neglecting to make their utmost profit of the treasures thus offered to their hands under these circumstances it is not impossible that the portuguese language may get the start of the spanish the regency of portugal having in obedience to a special order from the cortes dated the   th of april last already given commencement to a translation of the whole assemblage of such of his works as are not entirely out of print according to the list that will be added to these pages while the great question above spoken of was in agitation the distinguished spaniard spoken of in the former tract just published was urgent with mr bentham to come forward and throw his weight into that one of the two contending scales towards which the inclination of his opinion was so naturally anticipated of that application the present tract is the result upon its arrival at madrid it was with all despatch translated into spanish by the gentleman by whom it had as above been called for as soon as an opportunity could be found a plan of proceeding having been settled amongst some leading members of the cortes it was read in full assembly in its character of an address from mr bentham to the cortes and received with loud abundant and all but unanimous applause an entry there is reason to believe was made of the transaction in the journals of that house but whatever be the cause as yet no copy of any such entry has in this country been received a document expressive of the sensation made by it in one of the most distinguished and influential of the political clubs by which the power of the tribunal of public opinion was then and by some of them continues still to be exercised at madrid had better fate being read at one of the meetings of the celebrated club mentioned in our newspapers as being held at the sign of the cross of malta it was commented upon in an unvaried strain of eulogy in conclusion it procured for the author the quality of honorary member of that society as testified by a letter the translation of which is subjoined below accompanied with a formal instrument of adoption conceived in diplomatic language some months however had elapsed before the instrument reached london such is the difficulty and uncertainty with which the intercourse between this country and that inland capital is embarrassed before the advice thus submitted by mr bentham to the sovereign body of spain had been presented to that assembly advice of a contrary tendency had as may naturally be imagined not been altogether wanting an illustrious house in this country has the reputation—if not of giving birth to it at least of having with no small care and fondness fostered it be this as it may some time before the question was brought before the cortes endeavours were used to form a ground for the proposed     institution by a reference to the place it occupies in the frame of the english government of panegyric there was of course no deficiency of the existence of a determinate constitution as belonging to that government the neverfailing assumption was of course made the opulence power and prosperity in every shape so conspicuous in england were on this occasion as on so many other similar ones brought to view and magnified the fallacy so regularly employed on those occasions was employed on this of causes obstacles and uninfluencing circumstances the usual olio was made whatever feature or degree of prosperity the institution in question had not been able to exclude it received of course the credit of if not in spanish at any rate in french there was blackstone and there was de lolme upon this stock with the addition of whatever assistance may have been received from the abovementioned great house a man of distinguished literary celebrity and influence don felix josé reynoso set to work and under the title of examen de los delitos de infidelidad examination of the offences of infidelity published a book in which the desirableness of an upper house in the representative system of spain was much insisted upon what was the precise species of transgression meant on this occasion to be designated by the word infidelidad the same in root and everything but termination as our english word infidelity—to what part of the field of thought and action the error thus imputed was meant to be represented as belonging—whether to that which regards conduct or that which regards opinion—is more than can here be stated nor under that or any other interpretation does it seem altogether easy to discover the course taken by the ingenuity of the author in making out the connexion if any such there be between either of the alleged errors abovementioned and the service promised to the people by the introduction of a set of delegates chosen by a comparatively small portion of the people with interests opposite to those of the greater number and with power to frustrate every endeavour which should have the greatest happiness of that greater number for its end in view whatever was the course so taken the ingenuity displayed on this occasion by the spanish admirer of english monarchical and aristocratical vetos in his endeavours to involve the subject in the customary cloud seems not to have been altogether unsuccessful at the then approaching election of deputies from the province of seville to the cortes a man of whose regard for the greatest happiness of the greatest number no doubt seems ever to have been entertained riego so well known in england as well as everywhere else as one of the three military men to whom spain is principally indebted for her deliverance scrupled not to propose him as being preeminently fit to serve in the cortes for that province nor on that occasion to support him with all his influence the virtues moral as well as intellectual of the illustrious publicist were by the still more illustrious soldier enlarged upon in the warmest strain of panegyric whatsoever may have been the case with regard to the moral class of these virtues to whatsoever was said in attestation and praise of those of the intellectual class the most unqualified assent appears to have been attached the more irresistible his powers of persuasion the greater it was said will be the danger if in such a situation they should come to be employed in giving their support to such a cause to a proposed new part by which so sure as introduced the force and effect of whatever is good in any of the other parts of the fabric would be destroyed the opinion of the people in question had been formed formed after everything that had been said to them by the echo of the great english house against the offence of infidelidad and in favour of an additional sovereign body composed of and chosen by a set of laymen already favoured above the rest of their countrymen nobody could say why and a set of churchmen of whom the best that could be hoped for was—that as in england deans prebendaries and canons are they should be sinecurists all that the felicity of don felix could find to say on that side they had heard and for anything that hath as yet appeared nothing had been said to them in print by anybody on the other side all this notwithstanding their opinion was decided against the spanish house of lords whether that opinion was altogether a groundless one is a question in finding an answer to which it seems not impossible that the following tract may afford to the english reader some assistance to the english reader the question cannot indeed be anything more than a mere matter of curiosity so closely does he feel himself held in the embrace of the grand boa constrictor with a coronet on his head not so to the man of norway for somehow or other in that country whether for want of food or from what other cause the crested and bonecrushing dragon is found not to thrive on the declivity of an elevated rock scarce able to keep his hold he may be seen lying in a languishing state the men whose bones he would once have crushed have become too many for him the sceptre indeed as it could not fail to be is outstretched to save him glory to the man should any such arise by whom this instrument of despotism and misrule shall have been rightly dealt with dealt with as the boa where he is in vigour deals with the peoples bones     jeremy bentham    0 tract no i letter to the spanish nation on a then anno    0 proposed house of lords men of madrid members of the cortes people of spain—if the old man who thus addresses you is an intruder listen to him with indulgence he is not a spontaneous one he would not have spoken had he not been called among the subjects which i understand are before you none is of more importance—none perhaps of so much importance—as the question whether in addition to a sovereign assembly composed of representatives whom the subject many have appointed and can remove there shall be another composed of those whom the subject many neither will be able to remove nor will so much as have appointed if i may rely on the perhaps too partial anticipations of some amongst you—my works on legislation having been fortunate enough some of them to be honoured by your notice and among the works of men foreign to your nation these having been the only ones thus honoured—even my opinion though it were but an opinion and nothing more might for the present have its use in presenting you with it—naked or little better than naked of reasons as you will see it—the necessity of the case compels me to break through a habit which till now has been a law to me i mean that of placing my whole reliance on the force of specific reasons keeping my own insignificant personality as completely out of view as possible to cover with these reasons to the best of my ability the whole field of legislation has been the labour of my whole life on these reasons on every part of that field i have placed my sole dependence as to opinion—my own opinion—considered in the character of an authority—of a leaningstock for the opinion of other men—let any man set it at as low a degree as he may in the scale of value he cannot set it lower than it is set by myself such as it is however i have been called upon to give it whosoever among you may be pleased thus to honour me may behold it in this page in addition to a supreme assembly composed of agents whom the subject many have appointed and can remove shall there be another composed of men whom they will not have appointed nor will ever be able to remove spaniards by the simple statement of it is not the question already answered spaniards think for yourselves think whether between an assembly of the ruling few thus constituted on the one part and the interests of the subject many on the other part there exists not a pointblank opposition and that opposition an unchangeable one think whether there be a single reform—think whether there be a single considerable improvement in any shape—which a body of rulers unappointed and irremoveable by the people will not on one account or another deem it for their interest to oppose and oppose with full effect for this they will have avowedly full power and for what purpose can any such power—for what purpose can a veto—be asked for but to be used so far as in their own view their own interests coincide with yours so far indeed they will go but the unchangeable nature of man considered can you on any substantial ground entertain any the slightest expectation of their going any further and the rendering the separation of their own interests from yours as complete and as wide as possible that yours may be made a sacrifice to theirs can this ever fail to be their constant study their study will it not on every occasion be to give to the expenditure of government and thence to the burthens that press upon you the greatest extent possible that out of that expense they may in the shape of official emolument extract the greatest possible profit for themselves and their connexions lawyers themselves or in league with lawyers their determination will it not be—to keep the amount of expense in judicial procedure and thence of factitious delay and vexation as high as possible for the sake of lawyers profit extracted out of the expense for this cause will they not be inexorable in the determination to keep exposing the unopulent many to remediless injury at the hands of the opulent and at the head of them the ruling few denying justice to all but these few and selling it to them at a price which they would not endure to pay but for the impunity and the power of oppression which they buy with it to keep the necessity of having recourse to lawyers as cogent as possible will they not keep the rule of action in a state of as complete uncertainty as possible will they not even keep that indispensable instrument of security from so much as coming into existence the boon which even napoleon granted—the matchless boon of a really existing and accessible body of laws—will they not remain for ever determined to refuse if on these points your own experience will not suffice for you look around you look to the men alike situated the men cast in the same mould the men of law in every other country and in particular in that from which i write you have heard of our english constitution—of highborn virtue as the cause of it and consummate happiness as the fruit of it circumstances have it is true rendered the government of the few less bad here than in any other country that happy america alone excepted which took from it all the good leaving all the bad behind circumstances have     rendered it less bad here than elsewhere but as to virtue judge of it from one fact—you have heard of our two parties the tories and the whigs the tories oppressors and plunderers in possession the whigs their successors in expectancy can you believe it according to a set of principles openly and deliberately avowed by both parties making fortunes for the ruling few at the expense of the subject many is the very end of government you must all of you have heard of our late minister william pitt you must some of you have heard of his righthand man george rose both leaders of the tories you must all of you have heard of burke edmund burke the most illustrious of writers among the whigs each of these men published at different times his pamphlet on the subject of finance—each of them such is the depravity of the ruling few feared not to speak of this as an acknowledged principle i for my part have at different times published two defences of economy one against that same george rose another against that same edmund burke for long before the tory pamphlet was written or thought of burke adding treachery and imposture to rapacity had constituted himself an advocate for economy for the very purpose of betraying it i consigned these papers to a periodical publication called the pamphleteer mixing them thus with government pamphlets that they might present themselves unawares to this or that eye which by interest or interestbegotten prejudice would otherwise have been closed against them i have there shown that consistently with the conduct or even with the avowed principles of these men not a maravedi would be left in the pockets of the people—not a maravedi which the ruling few would be able to extract for their own use but in this unhappy country to stop the progress of irresistible oppression and depredation what signifies what   what anybody can write the contest low is—not between tories and whigs for though divided against one another in the contest for plunderage these it has been for sometime seen are by a stronger community of sinister interest united against the people no not between tories and whigs but between the ruling few on the one part and the subject many on the other is the real contest the subject many if you believe their enemies are enemies to property their aim is—to take it all of it from its present owners and divide it amongst one another no say the subject many no such design either ever was or ever could be entertained by anybody by any body of men large enough to make any the smallest commencement towards it for long before the property could have got into the undisturbed possession of the supposed intended sharers the destruction of property would be complete all property destroyed all life would be destroyed with it and earlier than those of the proprietors the lives of the destroyers themselves scarcely out of our seventeen millions could you find a thousand men blind enough not to see this neither then have we any such design nor can you believe we have but this design which you so shamelessly impute to us—this design which carried to the extent you speak of and in the situation of the persons on whom you throw the imputation of it is so plainly impossible—this design of enriching ones self at the expense of others—this very design not only you yourselves have from first to last been harbouring it but you have all along been carrying it on carrying it on to the utmost extent which you have found possible for us to enrich ourselves at your expense is not possible for you to enrich yourselves at our expense is a design not only possible but actually and continually carried into effect carried into effect and to the utmost extent to which it has been possible of late years since the french revolution afforded you a pretence so rapid have been your advances that the increase of waste and corruption—waste for the purpose of corruption corruption for the purpose of waste and both for the purpose of depredation—has almost reached its limits taxes are added to taxes and produce is not added to produce with the exception of the few that have owed their rise to trade think whether among those families which we behold seated on the summit of that emmence which is composed of power opulence and factitious dignity there can have been any who have been raised by any thing better than depredation licensed and irresistible depredation depredation by that swarm of harpies which in the field of government have never been fabulous—by the harpy in the shape of the soldier by the harpy in the shape of the lawyer by the harpy in the shape of the placeman by the harpy in the shape of the priest thus it has surely been with us think whether it can have been otherwise with you think whether it can have been any otherwise with any pure monarchy with any aristocracy with any mixed monarchy with any other government than the pure representative democracy—the truly matchless and unperishable government of the american united states leave then to each individual harpy the undisturbed possession of what he has leave it to him on the sole condition of his remaining quiet but do not equip him for fresh mischief as our cockfighters do their cocks do not in addition to the claws which he has arm him with new and iron ones do not give him a veto a veto upon every constitution that can tend to set limits to the plunderage magnanimous spaniards for years to come not to say ages in you is our best if not our only hope to you who have been the most oppressed of slaves to you it belongs to give liberty to europe yes to all europe nor in europe is there that other nation that has a more incontestable or more urgent need of it than that in which i write now is your   0 time or never fear not from this country any effectual opposition true it is that the worst mischief the french ever did you was kindness in comparison with that which our rulers would do to you rather than you should save yourselves as they dealt with genoa as they dealt with naples as they dealt with the netherlands as they dealt with poland as they dealt with germany so would they deal with you so and as much worse as were necessary to prevent your salvation cooler more determined more inexorable enemies mankind never had nor ever can have but no such mischief no nor any considerable mischief is it in their power to do to you true it is that neither against french any more than against english rulers could you have any security but from their impotence this however you most happily have at present and this you will continue to have long enough for the consolidation of your independence true it is that the despots have each gang of them force enough for the destruction of its own subjects but they have not any of them—no nor all of them together—force enough to destroy you men indeed—oh yes men they have and in superabundance but money they have none and without money and money in large masses men cannot be made to move oh yes my friends put everything to hazard rather than let in the menaced veto the manyheaded the alldevouring the insatiable monster worthy successor of the trojan horse in vain would any one pretend that its interest is the same with yours to be free from arbitrary imprisonment from forfeiture from death from torture this it is true is their interest not less than yours true but then in their own eyes at least they have to themselves a dearer and counter interest by which this vulgar and common interest is sure to be eclipsed the security—the blessing which they could not hold without having you to share it with them—this they behold with disdain this is without value in their eyes the power—the factitious dignity by which they are distinguished—distinguished from you and above you—this with them is everything for his own security then will each of them be content to trust to other sources to his own good fortune to his own address to that prostration before the footstool of power—to that prostration of understanding and will to which to make everything else sure he is determined there shall be no bounds that prostration of understanding and will which in so many words his lordship of london preaches to us spaniards in you is our hope for this long time our only hope save yourselves you save us save yourselves or we sink what you till so lately were we at this time are if you had your slaughterers we have ours if you had your torturers we have ours if you have your embroiderers we have our tailors as to our liberties—our so much vaunted liberties—inadequate as they always were they are gone corruption has completely rotted them preserved they cannot be if ever in future possessed by us they must be regained our government is already become a military one if but a child cries a troop is sent to quiet it as to our lawyers they whether on benches or on seats are what they have always been and so long as monarchy lasts always will be—tools of power tools to the government all of them as soon as they can get into it tools to the opposition some of them that they may show themselves and till they can sell themselves even in our soldiers more hope have the friends of good government than in our lawyers as it is the forms of it are all that remain the substance is all gone the shell we make a show with the kernel is rotten seated—not by us but by money or by terror or at the best by themselves or one another we behold in our representatives as they call themselves the most mischievous and most implacable of our enemies i who write this haste to write to you while i am still able i say while i am still able for all sense of security has long been fled from me cartwright

advertisement to tract the second the occasion on which the paper that forms the subject of these remarks was published is that of the evermemorable massacre perpetrated at cadiz the principal seaport in spain the principal seat of commerce in that country—the city next in population to the capital the day on which this tragedy was acted was the tenth of march    0 for its declared     object it had the preservation of that state of things which under a despotism is designated by the words social order—for its perpetrators those who profit by—those whose particular and sinister interest is interwoven with—the maintenance of that order for its instruments perfidy and treachery in the great contest which now for about half a century has been carrying on in the field of the habitable globe—in the contest between the many and the few—this has not been one of the least conspicuous scenes impatience and cruelty have everywhere characterized the deportment of the ruling few longsuffering and forbearance that of the subject many in this contest the object of the greatest number has of course all along been that which on pain of their extinction it can never cease to be—the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the ruling few under the like impulse the greatest happiness of the ruling few by the greatest number—by the subject many—their object—their real object—has nowhere—has never—been disavowed it has not been it never can be an object for them to be ashamed of by no motive could they have been led to disavow it by the most irresistible impulses they have everywhere and at all times been impelled to the avowal of it all their prospects of success have depended on the extent given to the avowal made of it not so the ruling few consistently with common decency consistently with common prudence consistently with any hope of advantage consistently with any assurance of security to themselves at no time nor anywhere can their object have been or in future be avowed to say to the subject many sacrifice your happiness to ours would be to say be fools that we for our own profit and at your expense may be knaves being thus by the very nature of their claim precluded from the use of reason in support of it they have been driven by necessity to lay hold on custom as the only support that could be found for it the government—the unbridled government—of one being the simplest possible form of government and that to which in the early stages of society each horde found itself under pain of immediate extirpation necessitated to submit itself during its warfare with the neighbouring hordes of which warfare either the existence or the immediate expectation was incessant—this was the form of government that succeeded everywhere to primeval anarchy for a long time if on any occasion power felt any such sense as that of restraint it was only from momentary and easily assuageable dissatisfaction not till after a long course of mutual and variously terminating struggles could it have anywhere as here and there it has done found itself under the necessity of submitting to any determinate and settled limitations in comparison with the political communities in which all such limitations remain still unknown few are those in which any such galling shackles have had or have place hence it is that subject or not subject to this or that limitation submitted to for the purchase of the voluntary support of the subruling few everywhere has the government of one had custom for its support hence it is likewise that while monarchy and custom have everywhere had reason for their adversary with exceptions to a correspondently small extent and those of scarce any other than a recent date they have had reasoning and reasoners for their support everything being to be hoped from the support given to the claims of the one and the few nothing to be hoped but everything to be feared from support given to the cause of the many and on this part of the field of discourse the great mass of the language as it stands having had for its manufacturers those reasoners upon paper who all the while have been reasoning under the yoke of this sinister influence the language furnished by custom for the occasion has been everywhere a tissue of fallacies spread abroad for the support of it hence as part and parcel of that tissue the jargon the contents of which on this field custom has engaged men to accept at one anothers hands in lieu of reason over and above those fallacies which require each of them a sentence or perhaps a paragraph to give expression to it and of which a list in some detail has been given in another work—hence those still more commodious fallacies for the propagation of which a single phrase or even a single word is sufficient witness dignity of the crown dignity of the throne splendour of the crown splendour of the throne matchless constitution english institutions witness legitimacy order social order by a custom commenced by paid and enlisted reinforced by gratuitous and deluded scribes all these imaginary and verbal blessings have been placed in the catalogue of things to be cherished and maintained to be maintained all of them with equally ardent devotion and indefatigable perseverance of the greatest happiness of the greatest number nowhere till of late years in the united angloamerican states nowhere without absurdity could it anywhere have been stated as belonging to the number of those things which ought to be maintained why it could not will be seen as soon as mentioned that which is nowhere established cannot anywhere be maintained no objection it is true is this to its being put upon the list of those things which ought to be established accordingly now that in that only seat of established good government it is already upon the list of those things which ought to be maintained and now that in some political communities it has been put upon the list of those things which ought to be established     and which with all their energy men are labouring to establish—even the best paid even the most hungry even the most strenuous supporters of the claims of the ruling one and the subruling few see no hope of advantage from any direct denial opposed to so uncontrovertible a position as that the greatest happiness of the greatest number ought everywhere to be established in the diverting of mens attention from that sole basis of good government is their only hope and hence it is that from thrones and houses and benches the ears of the people are so indefatigably plied with the confused and senseless din composed of matchless constitution english institutions wisdom of ancestors dignity of the crown splendour of the crown dignity of the throne splendour of the throne balance mixture of classes wash or something else that works well holy religion licentiousness blasphemy atheism jacobinism legitimacy order social order with et ceteras upon et ceteras let reason be fruitful custom barren is among the aphorisms of lord bacon in saying this he said what he wished to see assuredly not what he saw in the field of government—in this field beyond all others—reason and we have seen why breeds like a shemartin custom like a doerabbit finding themselves hemmed in on all sides—sure of discomfiture and overthrow should they on any occasion venture to act upon the field of reason—always dissatisfied with themselves—always condemned by conscience always beholding in the prevalence of reason and the spread of intellectual light the downfal of their power—the temper prevalent among the oppressing tribe has always and everywhere been congenial to this their situation their conduct to their temper their temper feverish their conduct sanguinary and atrocious in the many the sacrifice of whose interest to their own has been their constant object and perpetual occupation they could do no otherwise than behold so many constant objects of their contempt and hatred of contempt for their actual patience of hatred and that notwithstanding the contempt never altogether clear of alarm from the unassuageable apprehension of the ultimate cessation of that patience makers and masters of the laws death and torture in rich variety of shape they have spread over the whole contexture of those laws for the gratification of those angry passions and for the maintenance of that order to which every word from the voice of reason sounded in their ears as pregnant with disturbance hence the apparatus of gibbets halters axes pillories chains and dungeons hence the anxiety and abundance with which the musket and the sabre are at all times kept in store kept in store and by the despatch and extent given to their operations held in preparation to anticipate support and relieve the labours of the judicatory hence the implacable enmity to the liberty of the press hence the indefatigable exertions for the extinction of it hence the association selfstyled constitutional headed by the heads of factitious religion and standing armies at the invitation and to the emolument of lawyers the too real association formed for the protection of a nonentity by the destruction of whatever good was ever spoken of as belonging to it the causes have now been seen of that contrast which since the commencement of the great contest above spoken of has at all times been exhibited between the conduct of the ruling one and subruling few on the one hand and that of the subject and suffering many on the other of the two so opposite systems of political action—that which has for its object the greatest happiness of the ruling few and that which has for its object the greatest happiness of the subject many—would you see at one view an exemplification as striking as it is instructive look to the now so happily independent angloamerican states look back to the state of things in that country at the period of the great contest of which it was the scene note well the several systems of warfare on which the two contending parties were prepared to act look first to legitimacy and matchless constitution mark the fate which in case of success to their side they had prepared for their adversaries strangulation for necks amputation for heads laceration for bowels severance and dispersion for quarters and lest all this should not be sufficient for the punishment of the sostyled guilty denial of justice for creditors purposed indigence for untried and unaccused wives and children purposed indigence even for indeterminately distant kindred whether sharers in unapprized of or even adverse to their designs—for all these in indeterminable and unheeded multitudes for such is the inscrutably complicated result—wiredrawn nobody knows when by nobody knows what kings creatures in the situation of ever removeable judges out of so short and irrelevant a phrase as corruption of blood a phrase invented by the corrupt in will and understanding for a mask to the atrocity by which in such countless multitudes the confessedly innocent are pierced through and through for the chance of conveying an additional pang to the bosom of the sostyled guilty whose proper powers of sufferance it is thus proved were still after being put to the utmost stretch insufficient for satiating the appetite of groundless vengeance vengeance against which it was assumed that nothing could be said—because law had been made the instrument of it and allcomprehensiveness and perpetuity had been given to it such being the system in pursuance of which in case of success under the orders of the allruling one the ruling few were on that     occasion prepared to act as in such contests they never have failed nor in case of success ever can fail to act—mark now the system of counteraction employed in that country by the oppressed and subject many for their protection against those destined perpetually impending and perpetually threatened horrors look in the first place to the commencement of the contest mark well the character of the measures of resistance organized and put in action before the sword was as yet resorted to to treasonlaw as above described including corruption of blood as above described what was it they opposed neither more nor less than the infliction called tarring and feathering and this tarring and feathering what was it the substituting to a part of the sufferers usual clothing a covering composed of feathers made to adhere to his body by a coating of tar humiliation by means of scorn and derision was accordingly it may well be concluded a suffering actually sustained but to this mental what corporal sufferance was added none whatever to the sufferance thus inflicted in the name of punishment on the person of the alleged offender to this properlyseated punishment—what addition was made in the shape of misseated punishment what punishment was purposely inflicted on those to whom no offence was so much as imputed none whatever look in conclusion to the termination of the contest look to saratoga look to york town what in the eyes of the victors were the prostrate vanquished not rebels not traitors not anything but what englishmen have been wont to be to french victors frenchmen to english victors—unfortunate yet not the less respected enemies of the manner in which in the season of ascendancy the subject many bear their faculties would you see another exemplification cast a momentary glance on ireland behold the vast majority of the people in that country objects of inveterate oppression and legalized depredation victims of a system of studied and inexorable misrule carried on through centuries under such provocation mark their deportment when circumstances had placed the power of retaliation in their hands look in the first place to the five or six years period between the years      and      compare the state of the country in that period with the state of it not only before but ever since compare the conduct maintained there in relation to one another by those same universally contrasted parties both of them having the contest in america and latterly the termination of it full in view favoured by circumstances favoured by the happy weakness of their tyrant neighbours linked in the bands of a no less peaceful than free and voluntary confederacy open to all whom situation permitted and affection disposed to enter into it behold the oppressed many rising up in arms scarce had they begun to show themselves when without a life sacrificed without a blow struck they saw the votaries of corruption by the mere apprehension of what they were able to do and of what had been deserved at their hands laid prostrate at their feet for five years and more by the confession of the most adverse parties by the testimony of all journalists of all historians—the whole power of the country was in their hands what was the use they made of it what use in the zenith of their power did these irish insurgents make of those english supports of legitimacy and social order—axes and gibbets with their et ceteras as above what use made they even of the american instruments of selfpreservation—tar and feathers none what in fine viewed in every point of view was the true the universally undisputed the indisputably proper appellation of this period of irish history yes it was the golden period the no longer fabulous—the visible golden age† behold now the sad reverse unhappily for both islands peace was at length restored to england the hands of english tyrants were thus set free what was the consequence to ireland the golden age vanished the age of iron returned the age of iron and with it that scene of oppression and legalized depredation—of insolence on the one hand of ever just and ever boiling howsoever smothered indignation on the other thereupon came that conspiracy among the few having for its avowed object the extermination of the many—that conspiracy of which it is so well known to everybody that it need not be said by anybody who the men are who so lately were avowedly and because not now avowedly are not the less determinately and effectively at the head thus much as to the catastrophe now as to the actors the men by whom this golden age was thus created and so long preserved—what were they what but the men of universal suffrage yes and by them in that island and from that island in this within a few years after its establishment in united america would the system of universality secrecy equality and annuality of suffrage have been established and the no longer fabulous golden age have been thus extended and     perpetuated but for the unhappily restored peace abovementioned in conjunction with the treachery of certain of the peoples pretended friends one of whom in the teeth of that same five years fresh experience had the effrontery to speak of universal division and consequent destruction of property as the certain consequence of that very state of things which having under the eyes of all men but in a more particular manner under his own been so recently experienced had produced none but the most opposite—unprecedentedly opposite effects look at this moment to portugal behold that now magnanimous and regenerated nation casting off at once the double yoke of a domestic and foreign despotism before the auspicious day arrived think what had been the oppression on the one hand the forbearance on the other the wretchedness in consequence read it in the documents of the time since that auspicious day inquire what has been the vengeance inquire ever so sharply no such thing will you find warmed by the subject the pen has been running riot recollection commands it back to cadiz on the  0th of march    0 at a moment of general festivity—the assembled multitude being no less peaceful no less unsuspecting no less crowded no less defenceless than in the preceding august they had been at manchester—at the instigation—not of a simple priest but of a bishop—a selection carefully made from the refuse of the army fell upon the people and not with cutting weapons only but with firearms commenced an equally indiscriminating slaughter as to the number of those slain on the spot accounts vary from three hundred to between four and five hundred as to the wounded they agree in estimating it at a thousand the triumph was not of long duration the cause of the people finally prevailed the authority of the law such as in that country it is was restored but the law thus restored was itself the law of tyranny it was a system of law which had for its end in view the same as that of matchless constitution envy and admiration of the world which had for its end in view in a word need it be mentioned the establishment of the greatest happiness of the ruling one and the subruling few at the expense and by the sacrifice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number amongst other tribes of the ruling few the establishment of the greatest happiness of the lawyertribe—manufacturers of an unassailable tyranny the necessary and ever ready instrument of every other tyranny in spain as with scarce an exception in every other of the countries governed by romebred law—effectual care had been taken that in all cases in which the sinister interest of the ruling one was concerned the fate of the accused should be completely at the disposal of an everobsequious instrument of that same ruling one a judge nominated and at all times removeable by his fiat and that for that purpose the proceedings in general and the collection of the evidence in particular—of that mass of information on the collection of which the result of every cause necessarily depends—should from first to last remain covered with a veil of impenetrable secrecy in england only in cases where property is at stake does this lastmentioned security for injustice corruption and official depredation—this secrecy in the collection of evidence stand as yet established any designs formed by the head of the law upon jury trial—any such designs howsoever intimated not having as yet been particularized and brought forward and though when the whole of the richest mans property is at stake property is thus disposed of by the instrumentality of secretly collected or as in bankruptcy cases by that of uncrossexaminable evidences—still in smaller masses it is left to be disposed of by a system of evidence which how replete soever with absurdity and inconsistency is upon the whole somewhat less flagrantly and completely hostile to justice tract no ii observations on judge advocate hermosas panegyric on judicial delays on the occasion of the impunity as yet given by him to the loyal authors of the cadiz massacre a counterpart to the manchester massacre explaining moreover the effects of secrecy in judicature complaints i observe have been made of the delay experienced in the case of the cadiz massacre of a paper signed according to the english translation sanlucar de barrameda  0th august    0 the judge of instruction cormel fiscal gaspar hermosa the professed object is—to satisfy the spanish people that from this delay misconduct is not in any shape justly imputable to that judge the business in question is the business of the day     but on the occasion of this business i see principles avowed the influence of which is of as lasting a nature as that of the system of law of which they make a part and from which they were imbibed i remind the public says this judge i remind the public that delay in judicial proceedings is a tribute which is due to justice and as it were the price at which the security of the citizen is purchased that the judicial forms are—if instead of are he had said ought to be his proposition would have stood rather clearer of dispute—that the judicial forms are—the shields of liberty and precipitation the most dangerous rock in the way of justice this defence of his excepted from no individual fact do i see any reason for suspecting that the functionary in question is chargeable with misconduct in any shape that for example he has any improper connexion with the parties accused or any of them any improper connexion either by complicity unity of affection fear of displeasure bribery or corruption in any other shape of the particular facts belonging to the individual case all that is known to me is known to everybody and they are all of them in his favour namely that on this melancholy occasion both actors and witnesses must have been in a degree seldom if ever exemplified in the annals of judicature numerous and that whatever be the occasion the greater the number of the persons to be examined the greater cæteris paribus must have been the quantity of time requisite to be occupied in the examination what on the other hand is but too true is—that if to a man in his situation the above charges were all of them justly applicable and accordingly applied—this is the exact complexion of the sort of defence that he would make it is the sort of defence which any man in what degree soever guilty would have it in his power to make and which every man who is guilty would if he saw any probability of its being received and productive of effect be sure to make it is the sort of defence which i will not say no man who is innocent would ever make for innocence does not necessarily give right discernment either to the person who pleads or to those before whom he pleads but which an innocent man if he has right discernment would naturally avoid employing and for this plain reason—because it is the interest and necessary object of the man who is innocent to render his case as clearly distinguishable as possible from that of the man who is guilty yes when a man is really innocent the course he takes will naturally speaking be exactly the reverse of the course thus taken it will not consist of vague generalities such as the above of aphorisms without applications no but as far as time and space will permit he will hold up to view in all their circumstances the individual facts by which his innocence may be made manifest in the present instance for example number of days of sitting and hours in each day number of persons that have been examined on the several days number of persons that as far as known remained to be examined c c instead of this or anything like it what does this judge addressing himself to the spanish public as a schoolmaster to his scholars he recalls to their minds in the form of maxims certain lessons which in his view of the matter are in danger of not being sufficiently present to their memories to each of these several maxims i shall proceed to give a separate examination namely to the end that it may be seen how far they are conducive or repugnant to the incontestably proper ends of judicature if in my view of them the evil tendency of the principles thus inculcated were confined to the screening of one individual or a limited number of assignable individuals from just censure never would this pen have employed itself in a task so illadapted to the situation of one who is a stranger to the country in which the facts had place but in my view of them the tendency though it were too much to say the object is—to provide a screen for malpractice in every shape on the part of all judges to the prejudice of the subject many in all places and at all times a screen for all individuals in that situation and at the same time for the system under which they act a system which in my view of it has all along had misrule in that shape for its very object as well as for its effect a system on the utter extirpation of which in my view of it the ultimate salvation of spain and of every country that has broke loose from the trammels of despotism depends   maxim the first—maxim as to delay delay in judicial proceedings is a tribute says he which is due to justice and as it were the price at which the security of the citizen is purchased that to the operations in the performance of which judicial procedure consists as to operations of every other kind time is necessary is a truth of which if that was his meaning it needed not a remark from a public functionary to remind us but by the mention of the word price what is insinuated is this—namely that whatsoever be the occasion the greater the quantity of time is that elapses before a definitive decision is known to have been pronounced the greater the probability is that the decision will be conformable to justice for generally speaking the higher the price     you are content to pay for your goods the better the goods are that you will have but if in the case of delay this were true the surest way of pronouncing a right decision would be never to pronounce any decision at all for in that case the price paid would be the very highest price possible on the other hand may be seen a truth or two of which our instructor himself seems to stand somewhat in need of being reminded namely—that though operations are performed in time they are not performed by time that the professing to be employing ones self in the performance of an operation and the being actually so employed are not exactly the same thing that while delay increases recollection weakens and the very sources of evidence vanish that delay in judicature is so long as it lasts denial of justice and that a panegyric on delay is therefore a panegyric on denial of justice true it is that to the quantity of delay that by possibility may be necessary to rectitude of decision there is no certain limit why because there is no certain limit to the quantity of time that may be necessary to the collection of this or that piece of evidence but mind the artifice under the sanction of the pretence formed by vague generalities such as these what is true of no more than one cause out of a hundred is applied to the hundred a cause which might be despatched in twenty minutes—and of this sort is by far the greater number of causes—is made to occupy twenty years and a cause which by the attendance of both parties in the presence of a single judge in an open judicatory the bystanders rendering the service that is pretended to be done but never can be done by a judicatory of appeal might be terminated without expense—is for the sake of the profit upon the expense nursed and kept alive kept alive till the party whose condition in respect of pecuniary circumstances is least favourable is—if alive alive in the pit of ruin and his adversary more or less near to it unfortunately for justice and for mankind in regard to the use made of the word delay an imperfection there is under which language seems very generally to labour two objects there are for the designation of which there is but this one word though between the objects themselves the distinction is not only clear and perfect but for the most important purposes is continually requiring to be brought to view namely on the one hand an addition stated as being made to an already allotted quantity of time that statement not being accompanied with any consideration of the propriety of the so allotted quantity on the other hand an addition the quantity of which is considered as being excessive in this unfortunate ambiguity the supporters of all systems of judicature contrary to the ends of justice find a most useful instrument of defence delay is frequently necessary to justice namely delay without excess therefore so say they is delay in excess for delay in excess is delay and delay you cannot deny is necessary to justice such is their argument and such the logic of it on the present occasion speaking as he does of delay as a tribute due to justice in which of these two senses would this professor of justice wish us to understand the term he thus employs delay without excess the proposition is a nugatory one what ought to be done ought to be done such is the instruction conveyed by it delay in excess the proposition is an absurd and false one   maxim the second precipitation is the most dangerous rock in the way of justice here after another subject of which presently has been passed on to up comes the same fallacy again in other words precipitation what can be meant by it but despatch or promptitude in excess as to the maxim setting aside the rhetoric of it what is the plain import of it that the quantity of time you employ—or at least profess to employ—in the operations of judicature ought not to be insufficient it ought not to be what it ought not to be let it but mean anything—give it but a determinate meaning—the very reverse of it will be seen to be true numerous indeed are the modes of malpractice to which the term precipitation might without impropriety be applied speaking in general terms in regard to any operation whatever that in the case in question happens to be necessary to right decision the omitting to employ the whole or any part of the quantity of time necessary to the performance of the operation and thereby putting an exclusion upon the operation itself in particular putting in this way an exclusion upon such or such an evidentiary document upon the attendance of such or such a witness upon such or such a material question to such or such an attending witness upon the answer or any part of the answer that would or might have been given by him to such or such a question upon such or such a comment that would otherwise have been made upon his evidence but the sense in which of all imaginable senses it seems most likely to be understood is—the omitting to employ more or less of the whole time that would have been necessary to a man to form by means of reflection a right decision on such grounds of decision as in all shapes taken together have been actually presented to his view in a word a deficiency in the time necessary for reflection precipitation in judicature being thus understood and admitted to be a rock now let us see whether of all imaginable rocks this is really the most dangerous look to english judicature adverse as in so large a part of its extent the system is—uncontrovertibly adverse—to the ends of justice—still taken as a whole it is perhaps the least so of any as yet anywhere established     strange indeed it would be if it were not much less so than that of spain of the two distinguishable branches of this system of procedure namely the natural and the technical the only branch commonly in view is the technical branch of this branch the part most highly most generally and least undeservedly esteemed is that in which the judicatory is composed of a professional judge with a company of nonprofessional judges under the name of a jury the jury in the exercise of their functions acting in so far as it is their choice to do so under the guidance of the judge now then in this case how stands the dangerousness if in the business of judicial procedure the danger from precipitation were so great as supposed in other words if the mischief from it is so great and so frequent as supposed here it will be seen we have a case in which it would display itself in its utmost possible magnitude but how stands the fact so small if any is the mischief that in no one instance perhaps as yet has it ever so much as attracted notice in no one instance at any rate is complaint known to have been produced by it now then note how the case stands no sooner is the evidence with such comments if any as have been made on it by the parties or advocates on both sides closed than without so much as a moments delay taken for reflection comes if at all the opinion of the judge opinion or no opinion immediately again comes thereupon as often as not the decision of the jury the promptitude thus displayed—is it in the power of precipitation taken even in the bad sense to exceed it the same promptitude again has it ever on the part of any person been the subject of complaint no never when promptitude in this degree has place does it ever enter into any ones mind that any such condemnatory or disapprobative appellative as precipitation is on that account applicable to it no never if promptitude in such a degree and in no higher degree can it have place is precipitation precipitation so far from being the most dangerous rock on which judicature can strike might with much more propriety in the language of the same rhetoric be spoken of as the harbour towards which it is to be wished that its course should be directed never surely was aphorism more unfortunate what is the evil to which in the scale of evil the highest place is assigned by it the very evil which not only is in every country the least mischievous but in the country in which the warning is thus given the least probable delay as above—delay so long as it lasts—is injustice for it is denial of justice and whether blame accompany it or not the effect to the parties is the same in precipitation unless misdecision be the result of it there is no injustice with it there may be folly but from it there is no injustice in regard to delay thus it is as to its immediate effects in both branches penal and nonpenal taken together and considered with reference to its effect in the particular cause in which it has place in the penal branch consider now its effects on the whole complexion and character of that branch in so far as punishment has place from delay in excess comes severity in excess for by delay and in proportion to the delay the value and effective influence of the punishment is diminished diminished by diminution of propinquity and thence also of certainty but on the back of this evil comes another evil what is wanting in propinquity and certainty is then endeavoured to be made up for in magnitude and thus we have severity in excess but again from severity in excess and thence as above from delay in excess comes inefficiency for as the punishment increases in magnitude here again it loses in certainty for the efficiency of the punishment depends cateris paribus upon the frequency of the known instances of its infliction compared with that of the known or suspected instances of the delinquency which called for it but infliction depends upon conviction and conviction depends upon the cooperation of all operators necessary necessary in the several characters of informers arrestators witnesses judges and functionaries acting under the command of judge and in all these classes to an extent proportioned to the degree of humanity that has place in the character of the age and country those who would otherwise be cooperators shrink from the task in spain of all countries warn judges against precipitation warn then the snail against running herself off her legs rhetorician if you must have a rock keep to your rock then but reverse the name of it for precipitation say delay and you will speak true delay not precipitation will then be your name for your most dangerous rock in the way of justice thus then you have a rock on which in spain ever since romebred law with its system of procedure has been ruling justice has been splitting a rock on which unless that chaos with its rocks be speedily annihilated justice will ere long split to pieces and the constitution along with it when the justice necessary to the keeping of society together cannot be had from judicature it is looked for from despotism then does despotism itself as being the minor evil put on not only the colour but even the character of good as such it is looked for called for exercised     and not altogether without cause even applauded and this is among the causes why in the eyes of the lovers of despotism a system of procedure repugnant in the extreme to the only true ends of judicature is an object of indifference or even of complacency those who will have rocks cannot object to harbours when factitious delay the artificial rock set up by the confederated ingenuity of official and professional artists stands in the way of justice—despotism calm unruffled despotism is the harbour in which whatever security is regarded as obtainable will be sought to the artists themselves the change would be no evil were they the only harbourmasters but when in the hands of lawyers despotism fails recourse is had to priests and soldiers   maxim the third the judicial forms are the shields of liberty the judicial forms—what judicial forms what is not said but what is insinuated and doubtless meant to be understood is—that such are the judicial forms of the spanish edition of the system of romebred procedure—the system under which the preacher of wisdom in this shape was acting and under which by the help of these convenient and wellworn aphorisms he is thus endeavouring to find shelter liberty indeed what liberty whose liberty what in his dictionary means liberty what unless it be liberty to rulers to oppress subjects and to lawyers to plunder suitors liberty indeed why thus keep hovering over our heads in the region of vague generalities but that he finds his procedure unable to stand its ground on the terra firma of individual and appropriate facts be this as it may how stands the case in reality these judicial forms what are they what but the means employed by judges in their progress towards the ends or objects to which the course of the proceeding is directed whatsoever are these ends now under the romebred system of procedure in general and under the spanish edition of it more particularly what are the ends towards which the course pursued by those who framed it has at all times been directed by those who from time to time have been employed in the framing of it not to speak of the course pursued by those who from time to time have been acting under it i will tell him what are these ends they are the ends diametrically opposite to the ends of justice they are the ends pointed out by the personal and other private interests of those by whom this power has been exercised ends standing in constant opposition to the interests of the rest of the community but more particularly to the interests of the subject many in respect of the ends of justice they are the sinister ends to the pursuit of which the ends of justice have to a greater or less extent been everywhere made and still continue to be made a continually repeated sacrifice liberty indeed shields of liberty under the romebred procedure anywhere—under the spanish edition of it more particularly—is it of liberty that the forms employed are the shield o yes if instead of liberty we may read despotism oppression depredation and corruption with this one amendment the maxim may be subscribed to without any the smallest difficulty what are the ends—the proper—the only defensible ends of judicial procedure direct allcomprehensive and positive end—rectitude of decision collateral and negative ends reducing to the least possible quantity the evils unavoidably produced by the pursuit of the direct end namely the evils comprised under the three heads of delay vexation and expense such being the only proper ends what then are the actual ends—the ends actually pursued by those by whom in this as in every other instance the system of judicial procedure has been framed if they have been men these ends have everywhere been their own personal ends the advancement of their own particular interests and what have been those particular interests on every occasion on which in each mans view of it his interest would be better served by misdecision—misdecision accordingly on all other occasions rectitude of decision this being pursued according to the best of the mans judgment for reputations sake for reputations sake that so by probity practised where it might be practised without sacrifice power might be increased that power for reputation is power under favour of which improbity coupled with impunity might be practised as often as advantage presented itself in any sufficiently tempting shape as the fruit of it thus much as to what regards the direct end of justice then as to what regards the collateral ends the swelling to the utmost amount the aggregate mass of delay vexation and expense the expense for the sake of the lawyers profit extractable out of it the delay with its attendant vexation for the sake of the opportunities which it affords for addition to the amount of profityielding expense of profityielding expense in all cases and of misdecision in every case in which it presents itself as prescribed by personal interest in any shape as above the founders of this same system were they men or if not what were they if men then so it is that in the circumstances in which they acted unchecked as they were free as they were from all check applied or applicable by the subject many whose interests they were thus disposing of—such in the framing of the system could not but have been the ends that from first to last they had in view for on the constantly prevailing habit of selfpreference does the human species depend—depend not merely for its happiness but for its existence no rule more important for the legislators guidance no rule on which with stronger determination his eyes should on     every occasion remain fixed no rule against which the eyes of men in general are more obstinately closed yes selfpreservation it is that is the necessary occupation and with the exception of maternal care the only necessary occupation yes on any extensive scale social sympathy and the conduct that flows from it is an article of luxury—the luxury of the most highly polished life the habitual enjoyment of it the privileged endowment of here and there a superior and superiorly cultivated mind delay vexation and expense—these in conjunction with misdecision compose in all its modifications the aggregate mass of all the evils to which taken by itself the system of judicial procedure is liable to give birth add uncertainty an evil in the generation of which the main body of the law whether by its silence or by its language shares and vies with the system of procedure add these together you have the aggregate mass of evil of which is composed the patrimony of the fraternity of lawyers of the man of law in all his shapes of lawyers of all classes and all ranks of the attorney of the advocate of the judge of his ministerial instruments of these and above them all of the patron by whom the judge in all his shapes is appointed delay vexation and expense as well in their natural and inevitable as in their factitious and purposely organized forms of evil in all these shapes as well in that in which it is the purposed work of man as that in which it is the work of that power into the designs of which no human eye can penetrate no in no branch whatever in no place at no time whatever can any system of government that we see or ever have seen established have been directed to any other object than the particular good of those by whom it has been established to the good of the subject many no further than in as far as it appeared to the ruling few that by serving those beneath them they were in some shape or other rendering service to themselves from the eyes of the multitude these truths incontestable as they are have almost universally been hidden hidden by a covering of the thickest and most universally and indefatigably employed imposture yet only in proportion as those same eyes are open to these same truths can man be freed from the oppression depredation and debasement under which in every country he still labours in every country yes even in the angloamerican united states for though not at all by despots nor much by priests even there is he deluded yes deluded he there is and in proportion to the delusion preyed upon and oppressed by lawyers by englandbred lawyers whose ironrod having been in the night of servitude is still in the days of independence suffered to be wiredrawn out of a system of sham law and that of foreign growth—the english common law the good whatever it be that is derived from the judicial system from whence then is it derived from those things which are actually done in a small degree yes but in a very small degree in a much greater degree from those things which in the case in question it is how erroneously soever supposed would if the experiment were made be done in the teeth of their own experience deluded by those false conceptions which in books and speeches the lawyertribe with one accord are so indefatigable in disseminating it is among the expectations for example of englishmen in general that for injury in any shape law will afford them an adequate compensation all the while the fact the incontested and incontestable fact is that to a vast proportion probably to more than ninetenths of their number the obtainment of any such compensation is in every case impossible and for the opposing a perpetual bar to any increase in the number of those to whom it shall be possible leaders in both factions corruptionists in possession and corruptionists in expectancy stood up but tother day stood up in declared confederacy stood up and where even in that house the very name of which is so happily become a name of reproach in europe thus stands the matter in england the country in which till the birth of the angloamerican united states the plague of lawyers was least destructive but if thus in england how in spain can it fail to be still worse to return to our official preacher of delay the no less learned than gallant advocate of forms in the great cause of forms against substance the body of his sermon is now it is hoped understood come we now to the practical inferences on my zeal says he i exhort them the public to depend on his zeal for what thus the explanation is at the same time given his zeal to do what he is professing to do placing myself says he above the influence of the passions and listening only to the voice of justice and this zeal—by what was it called into action by those laws of course under which he was acting by the laws he speaks of as those which regulate the order of proceeding those inviolable laws so he terms them which he says are the only safeguard of liberty neither with the person of the gentleman in question have i any acquaintance nor in relation to the reputation he bears have i received any the slightest intimation in relation to him all that i have any conception of is—the official situation he was occupying and the principles of the system of law under which he was acting now of that situation indeed my conception wants something of being determinate but of the system of law in question my conception is so far as regards the present purpose as determinate as i could desire it to be this premised it will i hope be sufficiently understood that in whatever i   0 may find occasion to say of him it is to the species only and not to the individual that it can have been intended to be applied and so then of this string of phrases is composed the ground on which the gentleman expects us our eyes shut all the while against the manifold matters of fact which the case furnishes us with expects us to rest the unbounded confidence which by the word depend he calls upon us to repose as if these words were not just as easy to write as an equal number of other words of the same length as if acting were less common upon a bench than upon a stage as if it were not just as easy for the most dishonest as for the most honest man upon earth to commit to paper or to the air phrases of this sort in whatever quantity the purpose were thought to require as if the most notoriously rapacious and sordid hypocrites this country knows were not every day not only pouring forth professions of virtue such as these but confirming them with appeals to god and everready tears in answer to this call as one of the public i will here take the liberty of stating to him my conception of the course which under the invitation given him by those same inviolable laws i depend upon his having pursued for the gratification of those same passions to the influence of which for no other reason than that he has been at the trouble of saying so he desires us to believe him to be so effectually superior he has been employing these facilities which for that same purpose under the cover of that veil of impenetrable secrecy which they have so religiously thrown over all judicial proceedings those same laws have in their bounty and their wisdom been so careful to place in his hands proceeding then according to established order for everything is as nothing in comparison with established order he has begun with taking an account of all such delinquents whose power of hurting him is such as to exempt them from the necessity of coming to market for his services in favour of these the power the unlimited and irresponsible power of pardon which by the wisdom of those same laws has by its not being nominal been rendered but the more effectually real—has been exercised gratis another class which he may or he may not have taken the trouble of forming has been composed of those towards whom he has found in the sentiment of sympathy—in any shape public or private—a motive of sufficient strength to engage his exercising the godlike attribute upon the same disinterested and magnanimous terms these two unprofitable classes being deducted remained the class composed of all such other persons in whose instance upon due inquiry a capacity of showing gratitude in the pecuniary or any other more refined though not less valuable shape has been found and in these instances he would have been wanting in what was due to both parties if he had not taken the requisite measures for improving the capacity into act uniting in his person if my inference from his official title be not erroneous the military character to the judicial he would have been an offender against the laws of gallantry had he neglected the opportunity afforded him by those same inviolable laws for applying beauty to its appropriate use in civil cases under the french edition of romebred procedure the goodness of a mans title depended nominally upon contracts or conveyances really upon the beauty of a wife sister or daughter in the eyes of the most influential judge it was manifestly for this amongst other reasons for there could not have been a better that under that system personal solicitation was not only permitted but exacted when using the word depend i said—this is the sort of conduct that i should depend upon his having pursued it was because in the translation of the judicial document in question depend was the word i saw before me here lest i should be doing injustice as well to the gallant and learned gentleman as to myself depend it may be proper i should confess would in my view of the matter be rather too strong a word for the case dependence on the part of the contemplating mind corresponds to certainty on the part of the event contemplated probability though a greatly preponderant probability is all that i see here such are the diversities in human character that when corrupt laws the fruit of corruption have done their utmost to lead men into temptation this or that individual there will still be in whose instance effectual resistance will have had place but utterly unacquainted as i am with everything belonging to the gentleman in question except his situation and the system of law under which he has been acting if i were obliged to lay a wager i would lay at least twenty to one not to say a hundred to one that with any such degree of inflexibility as that in which we have seen him professing resistance he has not resisted to make anything like a complete statement of the grounds of this abovementioned persuasion would require a volume it would require a complete exposure of the system of those same inviolable laws but for the justification of such a persuasion one single feature in that system is quite sufficient and that is—the impenetrable darkness in which the whole procedure is enveloped you have seen already the use and reason of this darkness in spain a man must be more or less than man if he does not put it to this use for spain put portugal italy germany take any country where romebred law reigns the case will be little varied cases excepted too minute to be here worth mentioning take this for an incontestible rule—where there is no publicity i speak of judicatories there is no justice oppression depredation corruption—all that     there is—everything rather than justice under romebred law in the pleadings of advocates in here and there an instance perhaps you will see publicity admitted in pleadings yes but upon what ground upon no other ground than that which is formed by evidence manufactured at pleasure under the veil of secrecy the cause thus corrupted in its vitals and in the judicatory responsibility destroyed destroyed—the thing itself and thence the sense of it—by the multitude of the judges from the stage at which by forming a sort of partial succedaneum how inadequate soever to an ungarbled public the multiplicity of judges might apply some restraint to corruption—from this stage it stands excluded the stage at which it cannot be of any such use that is the stage at which it is admitted by the presence of almost any man much more by the presence of one invested with equal authority a judge might by the fear of divulgation be deterred from any such palpable injustice as the putting an ungrounded exclusion upon a witness or suppressing or falsifying any part of his evidence but when after a decision already pronounced by one judicatory a question comes in the way of appeal before another and that other a manyseated one nothing is there to hinder any one member of it from giving to his vote the direction whatever it be that corruption indicates as to fear of divulgation no place is there for any such thing how should there be there is nothing to divulge so far as concerns individuals all this being mere supposition let us close with another supposition which to every generous and feeling mind will be a so much more acceptable one the conduct of the functionary is now in perfect conformity with his professions it is without spot how irksome must it then not be to him to be all along acting under a system under which while he is acting he cannot by any discerning mind be regarded as otherwise than more or less corrupt a system by which he is placed in so degrading a situation—how odious must it not be in his eyes how anxious must he not be to embrace with the utmost promptitude every the smallest chance for seeing substituted to this foul and technical system a pure and natural one foul i have said and technical but when applied to a system of judicial procedure foul and technical will one day be universally understood to be synonymous terms technical being said of it foul will be put aside as superfluous as to the screen for corruption—the screen made out of the panegyric on delay and forms i have seen it in use these five and fifty years the name of the manufactory is visible on it esprit des loix the manufactory montesquieu and co the name of the firm a more convenient or fashionable article was never made in montesquieu as in blackstone whosoever has misrule in any shape to attack or to defend may find this and that and tother thing that with more or less exactness of application may be seen or made to fit his purpose if your wish is to put the business off quote montesquieu—you may put it off as long as you please if your wish is that it shall come to nothing there is montesquieu who will do this for you likewise in addition to increase of delay vexation and expense the forms invented by the lawyer tribe have had everywhere for their object the enabling them to bring a suit to nothing whenever they are so disposed what has been done is found to be unconformable to this or that same rule or form to a rule or form already made if there be an already made rule or form that is near enough to the purpose if not to a new form which on pretence of being found ready made is made to suit the purpose behold here the key to a part perhaps the greatest part of the absurdities portentous as they are which may be seen swarming in every system of procedure that was ever made made to which must be added—or pretended to have been made in so far as it is not exhibited in any other shape than that of common alias unwritten alias imaginary alias sham and counterfeit law montesquieu was a man of gallantry—a bel esprit—a fine gentleman and a philosopher but before he was anything of all this he was a lawyer a lawyer bred up in the corruptions of romebred judicature a french judge with the rank of president in one of those oppressive and predatory corporations called parliaments a name which in all its senses will one day be as universally a term of reproach as the inquisition is already with all his merits—and preeminent most unquestionably they were—it could not escape his sagacity how intimate the connexion was between his rank in society and the respect entertained for the abuses by which that rank was conferred a man who has an abuse to defend must for that purpose were it only for decencys sake have a something with which he may be supposed satisfied as to the something here in question if our colonel fiscal was more of a fiscal than of a colonel it is no more than he himself may naturally have provided himself with and kept for use if he was more of a colonel than of a fiscal some other person who was a fiscal without being a colonel put it perhaps into his hands it will continue to be needed and to be used so long as any particle either of the nuisance called roman common law or of the nuisance called english common law remains unextirpated the disorder has been seen it admits but of one remedy the disorder has for its cause a system of procedure produced in a dark age by interests and designs directed to ends opposite in the degree that has been seen to the ends of justice the remedy if it ever has any will be constituted by a system of procedure     produced in an enlightened age by interests and designs directed from the first towards those only legitimate ends and from first to last pursuing the same undeviating course the difference between a work directed to the one and a work directed to the other of these opposite objects will in and by such a work have been rendered visible to all eyes in the hands in which the power of the country is—in these hands will be then the choice advertisement to tract the third in the beginning of november    0 not long after the time when the last of the four letters just published on the liberty of the press and public discussion was sent to spain—the letter now for the first time printed in the original was sent by a mercantile friend of mr benthams to a correspondent at lisbon to the intent that it might be there translated into portuguese and the translation published of that paper whatever was the cause of the failure no tidings could ever be obtained when all prospect of its answering its purpose at lisbon was at an end another copy was at length sent in the same manner to oporto and had better fate that at oporto it found a translator and the translator a printer and that copies of it found their way to lisbon is out of doubt of that translation indeed no copy is yet known to have reached england what is much more to its advantage the work has however since then received a translation and that translation publication from the masterly pen of dr rocha in his monthly paper intituled o portuguese in which the matter of it is applied and enforced by comments as well as recommended by the warmest eulogiums not long after the news arrived in london of the formation of the portuguese cortes at lisbon a packet containing a copy of mr benthams works such of them as could be collected was sent for that metropolis in the same manner the design was—that communication should be made of the contents in such manner as should be found practicable and judged most proper to the newly constituted authorities—it was equally unfortunate the failure being at length ascertained another such parcel was sent and produced that sensation of which a communication to mr bentham from the cortes a translation whereof is annexed in the form of an appendix to this paper contains the expression by him nothing had been written on the occasion or on the subject either time to any person either here or in portugal  st july      jeremy bentham tract no iii letter to the portuguese nation on antiquated constitutions on the spanish constitution considered as a whole and on certain defects observable in it in particular the immutabilityenacting or infallibilityassuming the nonreeligibilityenacting the sleepcompelling and the biennialityenacting clauses portuguese you hear me from england you will have heard of me from spain hear the voice of an unbought an unexpectant friend hear a voice which for more than fifty years has been labouring to qualify itself for addressing you as it does now   first as to constitution take example by your friends in naples do as they did adopt it as a mass time admits not of picking and choosing exceptions few in number simple in conception mighty in import i will point out presently in the scheme of representation you see the basis take it for all in all nothing as yet practicable can be so good for you for them it is good for you it will be still better this you shall see to find ready made a work already so suitable is a blessing too great for expectation an advantage beyond all price somewhat which i should otherwise have said i am stopped from saying by an odd accident with the exception of some details which necessity excluded from spain it is exactly the same with the scheme which without concert i was planning exactly at the same time mine ere you receive this will be courting your acceptance in both you may see universality secrecy equality and annuality or bienniality of suffrage in mine annuality in the spanish bienniality substituted to annuality by a local necessity—a necessity which you will see and which unless you make it so is not yours in mine as in the english one stage of election in this spanish four oh monstrous complication but perhaps it could not there be otherwise i am sure it could not have been as mine is   now secondly as to cortes look abroad or not a cortes you have of course but under     the same name lurks the difference between life and death the question is between fresh and stale the stale was bad even when fresh what then would it be now the last you had was in    0    0 is not    0 these figures suffice for proof the cortes of    0 is that which the late regency would have given you it therefore suited their purpose it therefore would have defeated yours another short argument yet of itself a sufficient one before that of    0 had there been a thousand in none of them would the interest of the subject many have been the first object of regard in none of them any other than that of the ruling one and that of the subruling few the one thing needful is that by which the interest of ruler is made the same with that of subject of representative with that of constituent this is what the spanish constitution may be brought to do for you this is what your old stale constitution never did nor ever would be brought to do for any body exceptions i have prepared you for exception   the immutabilityenacting alias the infallibilityassuming clause this is what my respect for spain makes me almost ashamed to name amendment—none for eight years to come and nobody can say for how much longer as well might it have been said no amendment till the end of time the longer the thing continued without change the stronger would be the reasons against change the longer would be the experience of the needlessness of change immutability in the work assumes infallibility in the workman infallibility for such was the hurry without so much as time for thought i who have been thinking of such matters for more than fifty years would no more think of giving a twelvemonths immutability to any such work of mine than i would set myself up for that being who is as immutable as infallible nor though infallibility were conceded would it reconcile the arrangement with sanity tying up all other hands the legislator tied up his own in the same bonds the infallible of today will he not be at least as infallible tomorrow or would infallibility decrease as experience increased alas this is not the only instance in which what is most absurd upon the face of it may be made not only reasonable but necessary by a reason which is not because it cannot be avowed for this absurdity glaring as it is spaniards so they tell me had a reason and i fear too good an one what was feared was a relapse the resource was—to anchor the constitution at the highest mark at which the flux should carry it and thus to guard against the reflux which the remnant of despotism could not but labour to produce the anchor dropped as often as any retrograde proposition shall be made a short answer is now ready for it the constitution is unchangeable you have sworn to it this measure would change it portuguese thank heaven this reason applies not to you you are not cursed with the everlasting presence of an archenemy an enemy who if a man is in his situation necessarily an implacable one   exception the second the nonreeligibility clause articles  0    0 the clause which excludes from the next cortes all the members of the first experience is the mother of wisdom says a proverb which can hardly be peculiar to the english language no says the author of this arrangement not experience but inexperience either that is what he says or this—in a legislative assembly wisdom is worse than useless oh but says somebody men might but for this give each of them perpetuity to his power oh yes so they might and would were it not for the power which you give to the people—that power of removing them—all and each of them—at the end of every two years which two years were it not for ultramaria would be but one year what is it then so sure a thing that under a free mode of election should the majority of the representatives show themselves unfit the majority of their constituents would reelect them notwithstanding and that such would be the ordinary result if so then not only is this system of representation radically a bad one but so is every system of representation whatsoever appropriate moral aptitude—appropriate intellectual aptitude—appropriate active talent—in these may be seen the three elements of which in this as in every other situation the perfection of appropriate aptitude is composed which of these elements is it that by this exclusion it is intended to secure as to appropriate moral aptitude—the inhibition does not merely prefer untried men to tried it puts an inexorable exclusion upon whoever has been tried either it prefers chance to certainty or to secure certainty it excludes it apply this to appropriate intellectual aptitude or to use the word of parade wisdom here the absurdity is still more glaring moral aptitude or if you please probity having more in it of a negative than a positive aspect if at the commencement of a mans career it is entire habit cannot as to its principal part make any addition to it not so intellectual aptitude especially with reference to a situation such as that in question is it possible decay of faculties apart that at the end of the mans career be it long or short it should not be greater than at the commencement and in regard to active talent the case is too nearly the same to need distinguishing if rawness is a security for aptitude let not the public in any part of the field of thought and action be without the benefit of it apply it to the fine arts apply it to the ordinary arts when a history painter has practised painting for two years—i should have said for eight months for in the spanish cortes     year there are but four months—inhibit him then from practising it any longer at any rate till an interval of two years has elapsed and so in the case of the smith the carpenter and the weaver or is the perfection of appropriate aptitude so much more quickly as well as surely attained in legislators work than in smiths and carpenters work note now the application which this same nonreeligibility clause makes of the power of punishment and rewards when no delinquency is so much as imputed it inflicts punishment without mercy the utmost punishment which it is in the power of constituents to inflict on representatives in case of the most enormous and flagrant breach of trust is—forbearing to reelect them this punishment the clause inflicts without discrimination upon the most guilty and the most meritorious upon the most meritorious upon no other ground than that of a possibility of their having been guilty refusing to them the possibility of proving themselves not to have been guilty in the eyes of their natural judges those judges who in each individual case have before them all the means of judging which the case affords while the legislator has not any true it is that after two years of destitution the capacity of being reelected revives but this circumstance only gives complication to the case without making any material change in the mass of argument and without making any change in the practical conclusion thus to neglect details and proportions is among the effects and marks of rawness in the business of legislation against some experienced or apprehended evil an expedient presents itself as affording the promise of a remedy imagination heated by selflove swells it it takes possession of the mind fills up the cavity and keeps the door fast shut against all counterconsiderations in case of delinquency deemed such by the competent judges in case of delinquency how pernicious and flagrant soever it secures the delinquent against the natural punishment—the punishment flowing without need of prosecution—flowing as it were of itself out of the offence—arising without any of that uncertainty delay vexation and expense which in a greater or less proportion is inseparable from judicial procedure and which in the system most eulogised is swelled by an enormous mass of all those evils artificially accumulated this punishment consists in the suffering produced by the loss of the power so misused a result for the production of which nothing more is needed than a sort of negative operation if so it may be called in the situation to which the power stands attached on the other hand at the same time in case of good conduct it excludes him from the correspondent and natural reward in case of good conduct how preeminently meritorious soever to obtain admission for such a regulation something more must of course have been said but i should be curious to see this something and to see it confronted with what is above let me recollect a something more i think i have sometimes heard of of the annual recurrence of the capacity of being removed the result i have heard say is the perpetuity of inaptitude to its paradoxicality does this position seem to me indebted for whatever reception it may have obtained when from a mind to which a certain degree of sagacity is ascribed a position wearing upon the face of it a hue of absurdity is seen to come credit is apt to be given for some latent truth at the bottom of it but in this case mark the logic of the supposed effect—namely inaptitude in some shape or other—the existence is in the first place taken for granted taken for granted but on what ground for it there is no evidence against it there is—there never can fail to be a host of evidences—the opinions of all who by concurring in the election have given their attestation to the mans aptitude sitting in his closet taking in hand this or that individual case the author of the paradox takes representatives in the lump without evidence and without other ground than this theory of his pronounces them unapt and what representatives all that have ever sitten or can ever sit a second year after having sitten a first or if these numbers be objected to let him change them till he comes to say—all who have sitten a fiftyfirst year after sitting a fiftieth individually taken what does he know of them next to nothing perhaps nothing while the electors know each of them of the representative he had voted for as much as he pleases but the electors those too in their situation he pronounces unapt unapt to form any judgment respecting the aptitude of their representatives these electors—how many of them does he know—know in any such sort as to be qualified for pronouncing a judgment on their aptitude not one perhaps in a hundred   exception the third the sleepcompelling clause articles  0   0  duration of the time for business three months of each year in course one month more at the utmost nor this but at the instance of the king or of twothirds of the deputies forced sleep eight months or nine months so much for actual law now as to reason and expediency if there be one thing more impossible than another surely it will be—the saying at any time of the year upon any sure grounds what time may be requisite and sufficient to the business to the business that may in the course of the remainder happen to require to be done if such must still be the case—in a year when everything has long been settled how much more necessarily must it not be the case at a time at which scarce anything has as yet been settled if such be the case where the business is familiar to the majority     of the hands how much more necessarily must it not be the case when as yet whether by necessity or as above by institution there can be no hands to it but new ones if such be the case in a nation which like the french is more apt to go beyond the proper pace than fall short of it in how much greater a degree must it not be the case in a nation which if proverbs are not slanderers is so much more apt to fall short of the mark than to go beyond it under these circumstances comes the spanish legislator and inhibits himself and his fellowworkmen from working more than three months out of the twelve in ordinary cases more than four months at the utmost in the most extraordinary cases thus then it is that the union of king and cortes—the supreme power in the state is doomed to impotence to impotence and by what by a spell composed of half a dozen lines for which at any rate not a grain of reason has been assigned or produced whatever may have been found   example the fourth the bienniality clause another amendment my friends you may perhaps see reason to make though it shrinks into insignificance when brought into comparison with any one of the three former this is the substituting annuality of election to the spanish bienniality of the bienniality the cause is evident enough it lies in ultramaria had the duration given to the trust been no longer than one year a quantity of time equal to the whole of the time allotted to the business they will be sent for might have been consumed in voyages and journeys to and fro as it is scarcely more than half this proportion of time will perhaps be thus wasted ultramaria being thus mentioned let me congratulate you my friends on your being unencumbered with this nuisance the king of the brazils has already eased you of so much of it of that part in comparison with which all the rest is next to nothing this remnant i take for granted you will sit still and see him keep or take without any attempt to hinder him john the sixth will not wage war with john the sixth the european king with his american self the constitutional king with the as yet nonconstitutional king you will look down with an eye of sympathy on your neighbours the spaniards who are still encumbered and drained by the sort of nuisance of which you are rid unite yourselves to those same neighbours by the closest bonds i dare not speak the nature of them you have the same interests you have the same dangers at the worst forbear to add to those dangers by any disagreement between one half of the peninsula and the other half note now one in particular of the bad effects of an immutabilityenacting clause inhibiting legal it necessitates and produces antilegal changes to amendment it substitutes violation—violation of the law—and by whom by the legislator himself by him whose example is the highest and most impressive of all examples if in his breast the propensity to violation finds no bar how can it be expected it should in any inferior ones such then is the tendency at least of an immutabilityexacting clause to plant anarchy and to destroy confidence now for an example in article  0  the deputies it is said shall be renewed entirely every two years lest this should not be precise enough by article   0 the deputies cannot be elected a second time without another deputation intervening that is adds the zeal of the english translator a member is not eligible to two successive parliaments thus stands the law how under this law stands the fact amongst its members this second cortes beholds in multitudes and beholds with universal congratulation those who had sitten in the last preceding cortes in the decree by which the constitution was established was any amendment made as to this clause if yes then was the immutability clause violated if no then was the nonreeligibility clause violated which of the two was the case has not reached the ear of jeremy bentham asterisks in the original edition there is an appendix of documents relating to a communication from the portuguese cortes to mr bentham respecting the translation of the whole collection of his works into portuguese by order of the government these will be found already     printed in codification proposal vol iv pp      nos     and   the appendix is followed by this addendum— in the traveller of tuesday july         appeared and from thence in other papers appeared the following paragraph sent from the postoffice as being a translation from a portuguese paper— lisbon june   —in the sitting of the cortes of the   th a letter from mr jeremy bentham was read and the president said the assembly could not but be highly gratified with the approbation given to their labours by the first political writer of europe it was ordered to be printed in portuguese and english not to lose the force and beauty of the expression     letters to count toreno on the proposed penal code delivered in by the legislation committee of the spanish cortes april   th      written at the counts request by jeremy bentham esq first published in              advertisement the history of the present publication is as follows at the writing of the ensuing letter in so far as a judgment which it has more than once happened to me to hear pronounced is correct—the writer of it—the conde de toreno—one of the deputies to the spanish cortes from the province of asturias of the     european deputies the only one whose name is a titled name—was one of the most influential men not to say the most influential man in all spain on the  th of august      without any antecedent intercourse or previous expectation on my part i had the honour of receiving it from him it is in the following terms— le comte de toreno   août      paris monsieur j bentham paris le   août      monsieur j bentham monsieur notre commun ami mr bowring veut bien se charger de vous faire passer le volume cijoint qui comprend le projet du code pénal présenté par le comité à la deliberation de cortes qui doit avoir lieu lhiver prochain vous y verrez des choses bonnes dautres fort mauvaises nallez pas pourtant vous effrayer monsieur des articles qui parlent sur la religion celà ne passera pas le tems des persecutions en espagne nexiste plus et malgré toutes les lois il y a dans le fait une tolerance très grande je soumets monsieur à vos lumières et à la profondeur de votre esprit et de vos connaissances ce projet ayez la complaisance de me faire passer vos observations dici aux derniers jours de septembre que je dois retourner en espagne je vous en serai extrêmement redevable jen profiterai dans la discussion a qui pourraisje en effet mieux madresser quau constant defenseur de lhumanité et au profond écrivain de tant douvrages célèbres sur la legislation soyez sûr monsieur du plaisir et même du devoir que je me ferai découter vos conseils dans cette matière et de lempressement que je mettrai toujours de vous offrir lhommage de mon admiration et de ma profonde considération le comte de toreno on the   d of that same month august      and not before i received the work which it announces on the   th of september      the count being still at paris i sent off in manuscript directed to him at that capital by the post the first of these seven letters the succeeding ones were directed either to him at paris to the care of the spanish mission there or to him at madrid the day on which the last of them was sent off was the second of november      the reader as he proceeds can scarce fail to be more or less curious to have some conception of the result produced by it on the part of the two distinguished statesmen principally concerned—comte toreno at whose instance the observations were made and communicated and mr calatrava chairman of the legislation committee of cortes composed of five members by whose names the work which is the subject of them stands authenticated to this curiosity such imperfect satisfaction as is in my power is here afforded its principal aliment will be—a second letter of the   th september      from the same illustrious hand the reader will naturally enough expect   0 to find it in this place but as at that time the three first of these letters of mine were on count torenos table any conception which could be conveyed by that letter of his to a person not acquainted with the contents of those same letters to which his bears reference would be altogether inadequate for this reason—this together with all such further explanations as can be given are referred to the conclusion of these letters and will be found under the head of supplemental advertisement suffice it in this place to mention that by that second letter of the counts his consent to that intention of publication which the reader will find declared by me is signified note—in letter i p     the reader will see certain positions mentioned as designed to accompany the offer of an allcomprehensive and rationalized code and to serve as heads to so many sections in that address in the list of these positions though substantially they remain the same considerable changes in respect of order and expression have presented themselves and the tenor of the offer is intended to undergo a correspondent change in the four first no change is proposed to be made but to the seven succeeding ones the eight which here follow are now intended to be substituted   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires—that for the function exercised by the drawing of the original draught of such a code the competitors admitted be as many as without reward at the public expense can be obtained and so for that of proposing alterations in such draught as shall have been adopted plan for obtaining competitors   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires—that for the drawing of any such draught no reward at the public expense be given   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires—that every draught so given in be from beginning to end if possible the work of a single hand   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires—that such original draught being the work of a single hand it be known to be so   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires—that such original draught being the work of a single hand it be known whose the hand is  0 the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires—that for the drawing of the original draught all foreigners be admitted into the competition and that in so far as applicable—unless it be in all particulars taken together decidedly inferior the draught of a foreigner be employed in preference    on the part of an individual proposing himself as draughtsman for the original draught of a code of laws willingness or unwillingness to interweave in his draught a rationale as above is the most conclusive preliminary test and that an indispensable one of appropriate aptitude in relation to it    on the part of a ruler willingness or unwillingness to see established an allcomprehensive code with its rationale as above is among the most conclusive tests of appropriate aptitude in relation to such his situation jeremy bentham sept         westminster letter i occasion—inadequate this examination—a preestablished standard wanting—a standard announced—this correspondence must be public—why queens square place westminster sept         sir— on the  th last i received in due course through the house of our friend the letter with which you have been pleased to honour me on the   d last and not before i received the work which it announced proyecto de codigo penal and to which it bears reference so far as regards myself that letter of yours will assuredly not be lost nor yet to the world at large so far as there is any truth in the supposition that any beneficial effect in any shape will be produced by any thing that comes from my pen for among the testimonials which i may ere long have occasion to produce it will shine with its due lustre when in speaking of the effects producible by the treasures you have put in my hands i have said thus much i have i fear said little less than all which there is to be said for by any particular remarks which i could find occasion to make on the work in question i see i must confess but very little probability of my being able to render any service worth your notice no such remarks could present any chance of being of use otherwise than by means of a reference made by them expressly or tacitly to some standard of right and wrong considered as already established of no attempt towards the establishment of any such standard do i know other than that which is contained in my own works which standard i am about to endeavour at the completion of and should life last me a year or two longer not altogether without hope of success this standard i term the rationale of the code and in the code which i am about to begin to draw up the matter of it will be interwoven throughout with that of the several proposed arrangements     which it is employed to explain justify and show the grounds of here then apt or unapt will be a standard by which if it be thought worth while the work in question may in any part be judged of but without it were i to take the proposed code in hand with a view to the making remarks on particular parts of it i should never know where or how either to begin or end by the whole tenor of your letter as well as the declared and only possible object of it i am not only authorized but compelled to believe that the more extensive any communication made by me on the subject may be the more acceptable it will be to you for the subject to which you are pleased to invite my attention is no less than the whole of the projected penal code not merely this or that one of the particular arrangements contained in it now then as to this matter the case stands thus—exactly what you express your wishes to see me do it is not in my power to do with any the least prospect of good effect in process of time however i am not only willing and desirous but actually endeavouring to do that and a great deal more in the following positions which form the heads or titles of so many sections the sort of work i am alluding to is expressed more correctly as well as concisely than i could in any other way express it positions designed to accompany the offer of an allcomprehensive and rationalized code they form the titles of so many sections the matter of which gives the proofs section   in every political state the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that it be provided with an allcomprehensive body of law   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that such body of law be throughout accompanied by its rationale i e with an indication of the reasons on which the several arrangements contained in it are grounded and by which they are elucidated and justified   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that these reasons be such throughout as shall show the conduciveness of those several arrangements to the allcomprehensive and only defensible end thus expressed   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that in this rationale the several reasons or sets of reasons be contiguously attached to the several arrangements to which they respectively apply   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that of this allcomprehensive body of law with its rationale the whole groundwork or first draught be if possible the work of a single hand   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that being the work of a single hand the work in question be known to be so   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that the work in question being the work of a single hand and known to be so it be known whose that hand is   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that aptitude in other respects not being inferior the hand of which the discourse in question is the work be that of a foreigner rather than that of a native   the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that the work be if possible performed in the ordinary sense of the word gratuitously in such sort that no determinate factitious reward in any shape at the hand of any person shall be either received or expected for it but that under that restriction the number of rival works be the greatest obtainable  0 on the part of any proposed draughtsman willingness or unwillingness to interweave in his draught a rationale as above is the most conclusive test and that an indispensable one of appropriate aptitude in relation to it    on the part of a ruler willingness or unwillingness to see established an allcomprehensive code with its rationale as above is among the most conclusive tests of appropriate aptitude with reference to such his situation of these positions the design is to form the ground of an offer to compose the sort of work therein described viz the first draught of an allcomprehensive and rationalized code for whatever nation or nations it may find able and willing to give acceptance to it this paper is very nearly finished and when revised endeavours will be used to get a copy or copies of it conveyed to madrid if in print as i believe it must be copies shall be endeavoured to be sent to you in any number you may be pleased to command and through any channel or channels you may be pleased to indicate copies will likewise be sent to portugal where consistently with the disposition already manifested acceptance can scarcely be refused as to any other countries to which it may happen to them to be conveyed the nature of the case renders any express mention of them unnecessary on this occasion an idea i must beg of you to bear in mind is—that in whatever i write with a view to spanish law as above the greatest happiness of the greatest number as per articles   and    of the constitution is the object i have in view and employ my labours such as they are in the endeavour to give increase to and that accordingly subordinate to that end must necessarily be whatever i can do in compliance with the wishes of this or that individual how exalted soever his situation and reputation may be sometime ago i received from mr antonio     arguelles the honour of an invitation similar to this of yours it had however a determinate and comparatively limited subjectmatter—the use proper to be made of the institution of a jury that gentleman had already received copies of all such of my works as i had been able to collect he had even without my knowledge from the spontaneous and selfsacrificing generosity of a friend of mine received duplicates of a considerable number of them not long after my receipt of his letter a work of mine on a part of that subject viz special juries a work which after having been printed had for ten years been suppressed by the fears of a bookseller was obtained of that bookseller by another and published the spanish mission took charge of a copy for mr arguelles no letter accompanied it i have not heard whether it has been received taken up out of its proper order anything that i could find to say on that or any other particular subject without reference to the toutensemble could not be anything like satisfactory to my own mind it could not contain anything that i should choose to abide by i have however at different times dictated to an amanuensis a few premature and undigested thoughts which i may perhaps endeavour to forward to him but whether in manuscript or print i cannot yet determine at any rate sooner or later they are intended to appear in print on the occasion of an intercourse such as this public virtue and the greatest happiness of the greatest number stand exposed to a danger of which sir you are perhaps not aware the functionary consulting has points of his own to compass for support he looks out for this or that individual whose reputation with reference to the subject is more or less established he applies to him for his opinions—on the whole subjectmatter or on particular parts or points in it the opinions come what is the consequence in so far as they suit his views he makes use of them in so far as the name of the author appears needful to give support to the opinions mention is made of it in so far as this is not the case the matter is sunk or appears under another name a short supposition will serve to exemplify my conception of the effect i say—let the code pass but the duration given to it will be i hope but temporary you say—let the code pass even bentham after all he has said against it says so supposing this your wish what should hinder you who could even blame you all this you see is but supposition but it will serve to convey to you my conception of the mischief in question just as well as if it were fact as in part indeed you will find it to be so much for the functionary consulting now as to the individual consulted flattered with the notice taken of him he gives opinions and to whatever extent suits his purposes but whether for the sake of the public or no at any rate for the sake of his own reputation and the pleasure of seeing exercise given to his power his wish is to see effect given to the thoughts he communicates in respect of these his wishes he feels himself at the same time in a state of entire dependence on the individual by whom he has been consulted to render his communications as acceptable as may be to this patron of his is therefore an object he must not lose sight of how is that to be done by rendering his suggestions as favourable as may be to the patrons supposed wishes that is to his supposed particular interests and prepossessions if no opinion contrary to his own is delivered in this view at any rate he forbears to give any opinion which in his expectation would give offence to what good end indeed should he nothing that the functionary consulting finds unpleasant to him can the individual thus consulted entertain any reasonable expectation of seeing employed by him here then is an individual native or foreigner no matter whose thoughts on the subject in question on the supposition of his competence the statesman in office is desirous of seeing is it for his own sake his desire will be to see no more of them than what may suit his particular purposes and these he will keep to himself or make use of in such proportion and manner as may be best adapted to that purpose is it for the sake of the public his desire will be to see the whole without limitation to see it displayed to the best advantage and to see the whole public in possession of it proceeding upon the supposition that my notions on the subject of legislation have been fortunate enough to obtain a place in your reregard all therefore that i can do consistently with the principles above submitted to you all that i can do i mean except the trifle which i shall mention presently and which i cannot do but in the particular way which i shall also mention and i have accordingly taken measures for it is to beg your acceptance of a copy of three pamphlets in which i have at different times used my endeavours but as yet for the most part with very little success to submit to the spanish nation my ideas on several points of cardinal importance they are as follows   the tract on the once proposed chamber of the privileged orders in the cortes this stands first in one of those three pamphlets a translation for which i was indebted to the pen of mr mora was read if i may believe the newspapers in the cortes it was even fortunate enough to be followed by unequivocal tokens of approbation on the part of that august assembly if i may believe the information received through various channels public and private unconfirmed as it is by any communication from the assembly itself   observations on judge advocate hermosas     panegyric on judicial delays c it stands second in the abovementioned pamphlet a copy was with a view to publication sent to mr mora and in process of time on presumption of its failure another copy was sent by our friend to a friend of his at cadiz i am not certain whether the receipt of the first copy has ever been acknowledged and i am certain that no acknowledgment of the receipt of the second copy has been received here   the letter to the portuguese nation chiefly turning on some supposed imperfections in the spanish constitutional code it stands  rd and last in the abovementioned pamphlet this found i know not what translator and publisher at oporto it would therefore be rather extraordinary if some copies of the translation have not long before this found their way to madrid   the pamphlet on the liberty of the press and public discussion of this two copies the second on the presumption of the failure of the first were sent to madrid addressed also to mr mora and in a letter written by that gentleman i believe it was during the time of his being in confinement he mentions his having gone about half way in a translation of it   the remaining pamphlet of the three intituled observations on the restrictive and prohibitory commercial system especially with reference to the decree of the spanish cortes of july    0† was not like the abovementioned ones sent to spain or anywhere else in manuscript at a time considerably posterior to the transmission of the latest of the abovementioned tracts by the spontaneous care of my friend mr bowring whose name stands on the title page it was committed in the first instance with additions from him to the english press and if i am not much disappointed a copy must ere now have reached your hands so likewise of the two others of this you will ere long i have reason to think see a spanish translation in print if the spanish press be open to it in addition to the abovementioned little assemblages of my ideas covering as they do but a small howsoever important portion of the field of penal legislation—you have all along through that language of which you are so perfect a master had in common with that part of the spanish public which is acquainted with that language access to those assemblages of my ideas by which in a certain way the whole of that field is covered in detail it is true not much but in principle in a manner more or less particular indication of not much less than everything that comes within the field of the officially proposed penal code is there given if the opinion expressed in terms so flattering to me continues to be entertained what i have just indicated will afford an ample stock of matter by means of which that opinion may manifest itself in practice all this while my wish is—to pay what obedience is in my power to commands so honourable to me and at the same time without exposing either of us to any such imputations as those abovedescribed for this purpose should i on the present occasion find any use in submitting to you principally i must confess with a view to my abovementioned offer a few scattered thoughts—an effectual and the only effectual course that the nature of the case admits of and which i shall accordingly take is—the giving to our correspondence whatever publicity it is susceptible of in the liberty i thus venture to take you will not i am confident see any cause of complaint on your part on no anterior occasion either in person or in writing has any intercourse had place between us in this letter of yours no desire of secrecy is expressed no reason for ascribing to you any such desire on my part do i see in it on any future occasion should it happen to me to receive the honour of any further communication from you accompanied with an intimation that in the whole or any part of it secrecy is desired your commands to any such effect shall most punctually be observed on running over the remarks which a few irregular dips into the document in question made in the double view already mentioned have already suggested i find the aggregate quantity too bulky by a great deal to be forced into the compass of the present letter with as much despatch as weak eyes the labour of which in the revision of the work of a copyist is indispensable will admit—i propose however to transmit the substance of them in a series of future letters of the respective contents of which some idea may in how imperfect soever a manner be conveyed by the following titles—here follow the titles of the succeeding letters jeremy bentham letter ii on the course taken by the legislative committee to prevent otherwise than by punishment eo nomine the free examination of their proposed penal code sir— i continue on the subject of the word free as here applied a word or two in explanation may have its use misconception and ungrounded imputation of error may be obviated by it when in speaking of action on the field of     government use is made of the word freedom—of freedom considered as designative of a possession capable of being infringed or violated—it is pretty generally understood though perhaps not quite so generally as it were to be wished that it is not merely by physical force or fear or sufferance of evil in this or that shape but likewise by hope or receipt of good that the infringement or violation of it is capable of being produced it is in the case of election to office that this extended acceptation seems to be most distinct and general but in regard to formation and manifestation of opinion be the subject of consideration what it may it will be found no less proper and needful as evil is more easily producible and capable of being carried to a higher pitch of intensity than good fear of evil as applied to the purpose in question is upon the whole the more efficient instrument of the two but though there are some cases in which the smoother instrument cannot be employed at all and others in which both may be employed together other cases again are not wanting in which while the rougher is altogether inapplicable the smoother may be employed and is continually employed with perfect facility and sure effect examples may perhaps offer themselves sir to your view before this letter closes i proceed in my desire to give the utmost extent in my power to whatever service my labours may be capable of rendering to my fellowcreatures—neither the nation nor the government of which you bear so distinguished a part could fail to be included to the endeavours already directed by me to this particular effect you are not altogether a stranger nor yet i believe to the difficulties which hitherto these same endeavours have found in their way of these difficulties of course not the least effective has been the aversion with which the foreign productions in question have but too unquestionably been regarded—regarded by that same committee on whose work you were pleased to call for my observations and to speak plainly yet i hope not improperly the consequence is—my fixed apprehension and that a very serious one that as far as depends upon the gentlemen in question unless some change should take place in their sentiments the spanish mind will be rendered inaccessible to me the liberty of the press is a topic on which as above i have already touched in one of those recent tracts which i hope are ere this in your hands but that little work was completed and printed before this authoritative work of the spanish legislation committee was in mine so paramount in my eyes is the importance of this liberty to good government—more so perhaps supposing the separation possible than even the form of government itself—so intimate at the same time the connexion between the liberty thus denominated and whatever chance any work of mine may otherwise have of becoming productive in spain of any part of the effect aimed at by it—that on this occasion in the course of my endeavours to obtain the access in question i find myself unavoidably led to make some addition to what i have there said and what renders me the less scrupulous about troubling you on the subject is—that thereby to how small an extent soever my remarks as far as they go will be so many testimonies of my desire and endeavour to pay obedience to the commands with which sir you have been pleased to honour me the subjectmatter in question being a proposed code of law sure like every other human work to have its imperfections the consequence is—that if any remarks on it come to be received as desired only in so far as to an extent more or less considerable indication is given of its imperfections can any such remarks be productive of any use of any such imperfections simple indication is of some use and by an operation of this sort some service is rendered to propose a corresponding alteration if and in proportion as the alteration is well adapted to the purpose is to render an ulterior and still greater service on the presumption of its contributing to the melioration of the subjectmatter alteration is in the language of english legislation adopted into the french termed amendment amendment is either omission insertion or which is a compound of the two substitution if this be true of this cast therefore and this only—of this disapprobative cast and not of the approbative cast—are the remarks which a workman really solicitous for the ultimate goodness of his work will be desirous of receiving and use his endeavours to receive to the truth of the above position one exception indeed there is and to preserve the statement from the imputation of error or oversight though the exception has no place in the present case i will mention it if so it be that the work in question has been made the subject of delusive remarks or insufficientlygrounded conclusions of the disapprobative cast then so it is that by counter remarks of an approbative tendency—in a word by remarks of a justificative cast with reference to the work service may also be rendered such then and such alone are the sort of remarks by the communication or receipt of which the greatest happiness of the greatest number can on the present occasion be promoted receipt namely by the two descriptions of persons to whom in their respective situations it belongs to judge by the legislators that for the benefit of their constituents they may themselves put the remarks to use by their constituents that they may judge how far their representatives have put to use the information furnished to them and thence how     far they have given themselves a title to a renewal of confidence unfortunately in the eyes of legislators themselves in the eyes of public trustees in whatever situation no remarks of any such disapprobative cast is it their interest to see received by their principals no such remarks would it be altogether agreeable to them to receive themselves even if what can scarcely be they were assured that the remarks so received would not ever find their way to any one of those same principals as to what regards liberty of discussion the truth is how should it be otherwise in every country so is human nature constituted what every man desires is to see all other men in possession of the most perfect liberty of making public all such ideas by the publication of which the accomplishment of his views and purposes would in his view of the matter be promoted to see no man in possession of any such liberty as that of making public any such ideas by the publication of which the accomplishment of his views and purposes would in his view of the matter be impeded if it be of human beings that the population of spain is composed this account of the matter will be no less applicable to that country than to any other in every political state without exception it has been the practice of rulers to employ the power attached to their situation in the endeavour to give effect to this desire in both its branches in every political state but one this is still their practice you will not i hope sir insist on my speaking of spain as being that one in my pamphlet on the liberty of the press and public discussion i have already pointed it out the angloamerican united states correspondent to this desire is in that same commanding situation the regard entertained for all such useful truths in general as belong to the field of government ever anxious is this regard but the expedient employed for securing access and acceptance to all such truths at the hands of other men is in case of diversity of opinion actual or possible to prevent men from hearing anything about the matter from any other than one side what that side is may without much difficulty be imagined as this one side is of course the side fixed upon by these same tenderlysolicitous and allcommanding functionaries the partiality thus manifested might be productive of some danger were it not for that conjunction of infallibility with impeccability the belief of which it is their equally solicitous and allcomprehensive endeavour to inculcate into the minds of men in general but of course more particularly into the minds of all those whose happiness it is to live in subjection to their power twenty years if i misrecollect not was the term during which it was at one time the determination of a national assembly of france that the constitutional code framed by them should continue exempt from all alteration at the hands of any set of men and in particular of any set of men elected by their constituents in the same way as they themselves had been not quite so intense perhaps was the persuasion of their being in possession of the same useful pair of attributes in the breasts of the authors of your already established constitutional code not greater than eight years was the term appointed for this purpose this for a finite term but at the end of this finite quantity came another on the face of which a colour not altogether unlike that of infinity is visible but of this i have spoken in one of those tracts of mine already mentioned it cannot i think appear questionable to you sir that it is by these same universally prevalent dispositions that on the occasion in question the conduct of the gentlemen of the committee in question has with no small degree of exactness been regulated regulated in relation to two kindred objects to the connexion between which your attention has been above invited namely the liberty of the press in general and the faculty desired by me of submitting to the consideration of the whole body of the representatives of the spanish nation a series of works the first of them having the same subjectmatter as that of the work laid before them by that same committee when brought home to individuals the idea which on the present occasion stands associated with it is not a pleasant one yet for clearness and that the state of the case may be immediately and distinctly seen i must een ascribe to it its proper relative character and call it a work coming in competition with theirs a work which with reference to theirs is a rival work i shall first speak of the policy in question as it may be seen applying itself to the more extensive and major object the liberty of the press at large i shall then take leave to request your more particular attention for the bearing which it has upon the particular work in question—the proposed rival work but even from the first this minor object will unavoidably be ever and anon peeping out and offering itself to view good operating in the way of reward evil operating in the way of punishment—these i think have been already mentioned as the instruments and the two only instruments by which on an occasion such as that in question for a purpose such as that in question the minds in question could in any direct way be operated upon applied to the purpose here in question the matter of reward not only admits but requires some refinement in the mode of applying it on the present occasion the object which gave room for such an application was the obtaining at the hands of the cortes at large in the first instance and ultimately and finally at the     hands of their constituents the people at large acceptance for the proposed work though not in name nor in the shape of a determinate sum of money already deposited in a bag the faculty of making application of the matter of reward in its principal shapes money power and reputation could not in the nature of things fail to be virtually at the disposal of men in the situation in which the gentlemen in question were acting between the whole legislative body of which they were and are such distinguished members between this body on the one part and the immediate and avowed givers of all the abovementioned political good gifts namely the monarch c on the other i need scarce remind you how intimate the connexion is which cannot but have place turning to article     to the king by his sole authority i see it belongs no    to nominate and remove if separar means to remove the ministers of state and despatch namely the seven ministers of whom art     the gobierno is composed no   to fill up if proveer means to fill up all civil and military employments no   to command the army and navy and to appoint the commanders no    to nominate ambassadors ministers and consuls no    to order the application of the funds appropriated to each branch of the public administration no   to grant honours and distinctions of every class according to law no    to pardon delinquents according to law now then sir it being so completely in the power of the members of the cortes to obtain for themselves and their connexions an undefined indeed but thence a boundless share in the aggregate mass of all these good things and this in the instance of each of them without so much as a pretence of meritorious service in any individual shape or of any probable expectation of any such service must it not if there be any difference be matter of increased facility to them to obtain for other persons shares in that same vast mass by reference made to incontestably existing service service rendered in such well defined as well as universally conspicuous shapes as those which stand recorded in so many portions of written discourse having for their subjects matters so superior in extent and importance to those which form the ordinary subjects of official service the gentlemen in question may perhaps assure you sir and i should not wonder if they did that this notion of their having any such good things at command is my mistake for that in articles       0 the constitution has by express prohibition taken care to preserve their virtue against temptation in every such shape and that in article  0  of their own proposed penal code by forfeiture infamy and expulsion it has been their care that that same article in the constitutional code shall not be a dead letter a prohibition excuse me sir speaking with respect the mistake is not mine but theirs not prohibition but permission is the effect and can i avoid adding the object of these same selfdenying ordinances—of the severe virtue thus displayed by the constitutionmakers of the first cortes and of the rigour with which the gentlemen in question have proposed to enforce it true it is that by article     no deputy while such can receive for himself any employment of the number of those which are conferred by the king alas no if he is unfortunate enough not to see any person whom he can trust to receive it for him he must een wait for it till the unexpired part of the term of his deputyship namely till from two days to not much less than two years has elapsed by the next article   0 if a pension or a lot of factitious dignity be the object of his wishes he must even wait one year longer for the fulfilment of them moreover what he is there declared incapable of receiving for himself admitir obtenir he is by both articles taken together prohibited and during the same length of time from soliciting for another solicit no to be sure no such thing ought he ever to do it would be beneath his dignity it is for the creatures of the crown to solicit and at his hands the honour which a member of the legislative body would do to them by his acceptance so much for the process of solicitation a process it must be acknowledged ill suited to a person so exalted accordingly the trouble and humiliation of it is saved to him the benefit remains untouched and pure the severity thus displayed is indeed most exemplary but the act in the proscription of which it expends itself is an event that can never happen what can solicitation be necessary to a man to produce the supposition that money power or factitious dignity for himself or his connexion are among the things he would like to have such sir is the footing on which the prohibition meaning always the permission stands in the constitutional code this is the footing on which in the projected penal code gentlemen found it placed and on this same footing have they left it the faculty which under your constitution the representatives of the people have of making their bargains with the advisers of the crown and thereby so it be in a number sufficient to compose a majority employing the whole force of government in the exercise of depredation and of oppression in all its other shapes at the expense of their constituents—this disastrous faculty comes in here it must be confessed but as in a parenthesis it is however that sort of parenthesis which can scarcely on any occasion avoid obtruding itself for what is the occasion in which the state of things thus alluded to will not be exercising its irresistible influence yes sir it is the necessary result of the existence of any race of irremoveable functionaries whatsoever with a certain quantity     of the objects of general desire at their disposal the legislator who gives to any such race this power gives the invitation the peoples representative who is content to act as such without using any endeavours to remove the power out of the hands so situated and so filled gives his acceptance a tacit indeed but not the less effectual acceptance whether in your circumstances anything better could have been done is another question meantime be it ever so bad that which is done is not the less done on the part of the representatives of the people during the first days of such a constitution before things are come to a settlement and persons are come to an understanding fear or ambition may produce refractoriness little by little however if the constitution keeps upon its legs by mutual interest a sort of agreement will be produced and a sort of partnership concern always at the expense of the people established and carried on partnership carried on and in some proportion or other variable according as individual character varies—division of the common stock of the objects of general desire continually made day by day stock and power of enlarging it will receive increase day by day the purse of government will be replenished day by day the hands of government will be strengthened strengthened by that course which death in hand death for everything gentlemen i see have already been exerting themselves with so much energy in marking out an energy some samples of which it will lie in my way sir to submit to your consideration yes sir a state of contest and illhumour such as seems to have place at present or a state of agreement such as that i have just been giving intimation of and gentlemen with their code have thus been making preparation for—such in every nation on whose shoulders an irremoveable chief clothed with any such body of power as above or anything approaching to it is fastened—such sir is the only alternative well sir my parenthesis is at an end but says somebody this reward that you speak of as being held out to annotators—in what shape is it that you see it held out sir in no shape in no shape and thereby in all shapes in all shapes in which it may be regarded as being either immediately or by the intervention of other hands capable of being administered to such as shall use their endeavours to be thought to merit it from no such quarter as that in question can be invitation given but reward of itself places itself at the back of it seeing the invitation you see the reward seeing the reward you see it in all the shapes that imagination warmed by hope can give to it now then as to the invitation itself in the preface to this proposed code see the preface p xii you may see the invitation in question given invitation and to what service to the service that would be rendered by the composition of an entire work on the subject in question of any work fashioned throughout by a single hand of the advantage attendant on this plan of operation you see sir the exposition i have announced rival works indeed on this or any other occasion have gentlemen given encouragement in any shape to rival works not they indeed and why not the answer is almost too obvious to bear mentioning suppose a rival work produced—a work to any amount howsoever great more eminently conducive than theirs to the end professed to be aimed at—suppose this done the work would not have been theirs the praise would not have been theirs the rewards in whatsoever shape looked for would not have been theirs—at any rate would not have all of them been theirs how then could any such idea as that of a rival work have been an endurable one be this as it may this was not the service called for see then what was that service it was the taking in hand the existing work the only work which so far as depended upon them gentlemen would suffer to come into existence the taking in hand this work and the sending in remarks upon it remarks—but of what description of that description which alone could with reference to the greatest happiness of the greatest number of your fellowcountrymen sir be of any use remarks in a word of the disapprobative cast already mentioned remarks indicative of imperfection with or without proposed amendments oh no such was not the sort of remarks wished for to remarks of this cast no prohibitive bar it is true stands opposed but to what purpose should any such bar have been opposed what need of it could the nature of the case admit of in what shape by any man of common sense could reward in any shape be expected from any such remarks yes peradventure from indication given of this or that little spot or supposed spot in the sun just for the sake of showing what it might be in the power of the observer to discover in other luminaries if it were made worth his while yes a drop or two of gentle censure but tempered with becoming diffidence and apology sweetened by an ample infusion of panegyric and atoned for by intimations of more unreserved obsequiousness on a more favourable opportunity thus it is that even supposing it were in the terms of it held out to all a reward offered for such a service would in the interpretation put upon it be unavoidably narrowed narrowed by the consideration of the situation from whence it came the situation as above described considered—descriptions of persons more than one may be named from whom how well soever qualified the probability could not in the eyes of the gentlemen in question be great that without special invitation any such remarks should come take for an example of one of these classes natives known to     be not well affected to the recently introduced order of things take for another example foreigners to them unless the design had been to prevent remarks from being sent in by them—to them should special invitations have been addressed and why not why not even to the most hostile from a hostile hand out of a hundred remarks suppose ninetynine not only in their form hostile but in their tendency mischievous so long as there is one that is beneficial to reject it for no better reason than that of its coming from a hostile quarter is it consistent with common sense because this or that man has laboured to hurt you is that a reason why you should refuse to convey a benefit to those for whom you are in trust so much as to undoubted enemies but from the foreigner as such nothing of hostility could have been apprehended knowing the prepossessions he would have to encounter by what inducement but the hope of rendering or that of being thought to have rendered useful service could he have been led to impose upon himself the labour necessary to the making trial whether it would be permitted to him to render it such if i do not mistake the matter being the course which a preferable regard for the greatest happiness of the greatest number of spanish citizens would on the occasion in question have caused to be taken in relation to foreigners be pleased now sir to observe the course actually taken advertisements were proposed to be inserted and doubtless were inserted in the national gazette—advertisements inviting remarks from all hands inviting them with the most eloquent energy imaginable tercero says page xx que asimismo por anuncio en la gaceta se invite á todos los literatos y personas instruidas que de este modo quieran concurrir á una empresa tan recomendable y de tanto interes para toda la nacion espandose que las cortes apreciarán sobre manera el que lo ejecuten y dén este testimonio de patriotismo y amor á la causa pública at that very time one hand was not unknown—one hand from which with wellgrounded assurance gentlemen might have expected—if not exactly the sort much more than the sort of service thus called for the interval and more than the interval allowed for these communications namely between some day previous to the   st of april      and the  st of july      had passed away and by that hand no intimation to any such effect had been received whatever information now in the middle of september the individual in question is possessed of it is to yourself sir that viz on the   d of august and not before he became indebted for it was it that his name or his works were unknown to them no assuredly for in the hearing of the gentlemen in question one of those works had been read with others he is not without reason for believing that of old some of them had been familiar others again and in no small number had to their knowledge been presented to the illustrious body of which they are such distinguished members and if he has not been egregiously misinformed presented and with no very common tokens of approbation accepted is it that the way to the scene of his labours—is it that the way to his hermitage—was unknowable or unknown to them sir not to speak of private correspondence through the spanish mission at the court of london the finance minister of the day in his public capacity the minister of the interior of the day in his private capacity the whole gobierno of the day the whole septemvirate of ministers had found the way to it but no not merely on that one foreigner—no but on all foreigners without exception was the exclusion meant to be put witness the word patriotismo for the spanish being the nation in question whatsoever were the service rendered by any foreign hand whatsoever were the generous affection manifested by any such service it is not any such word as patriotism that could be the name for it on this word patriotismo a not uninstructive comment is supplied by the affront put through the medium of the french papers on one of the members of the french legislative assembly and on the present which doubtless in the presumption of a due regard on the part of the constituted authorities of spain for the interest of their principles—he had ventured to make to the cortes little of course could that distinguished representative of the french people think that for the good he was seeking to do to the spanish nation evil in that or any other shape would be the requital this of course has for its ground the supposition of a participation on the part of the gentlemen in question in the affront so given what truth there may be in it can scarcely be unknown to a person in your position sir but is altogether unknown to me only from what is known to me namely that which is known to everybody can any judgment of mine be formed in that case what there was of purposed affront out of the question if any real injury was done to what party or parties was it done to the individual by whom the information whatever it was was thus presented no but to the people who see in the gentlemen in question their appointed agents and trustees is it not to them sir that the injury if any was done—an injury the magnitude of which will be in the direct ratio of the relative usefulness of the information thus rejected oh but spanish wisdom such is the transcendency of spanish wisdom by it all the assistance that could be had from the whole world besides is rendered superfluous and useless thus it is that selfregard and selfsufficiency think to hide themselves under a cloak of patriotism to every mans vanity a bribe is thus offered in the shape of a compliment     and such a compliment and for this bribe it is that he is called upon to give the reins to particular and sinister interest in the breast of these his agents and to make sacrifice of whatever benefit to an amount altogether boundless might have been the result of the assistance it accepted assistance given to inexperience by experience on a field of action at once the most important and the most difficult that can be named true it is that in a certain way in speaking of what they have already done mention is made by them but in the most general terms imaginable of their having taken cognizance of foreign codes—an alleged token of zeal industry magnanimity and prudence for which by the very mention made of it praise is claimed as this was no more than what every eye would look to them for as a duty no praise was to be had for the avoidance of it on the contrary it was only from the alleged performance of the task that anything in the way of praise could be expected but information in the field of legislation being the thing to be looked for for what reason look for it in the works of men clothed in power—in works too in and by which that very power has been exercised—for what reason look for it to such works not only in preference to but even to the exclusion of the works of men not so distinguished supposing the greatest happiness of the greatest number of their constituents their end in view there were two reasons why to unofficial even the preference should have been given over all such official productions in the very nature of the situation from which they have come what is made manifest by all such official productions is—that they were produced under the irresistible influence of a sinister interest an interest separate from and throughout the whole field of legislation in numerous and important points diametrically opposite to that of the greatest number in a word a particular interest to which throughout the whole extent of such opposition the universal interest would of course be sacrificed in regard to the official productions this was matter of certainty it could not be otherwise in regard to the unofficial productions though by the unavoidable exposure to the temptations held out by the ambition of having a place among the ruling few the like result is in each mans case rendered but too probable yet there was no such certainty as in the other case so much as to what depends upon moral now as to what depends upon intellectual aptitude from the situation of the unofficial publicist something in the way of a rationale might be expected expected and even with full assurance why because on this would be his sole dependance for whatever influence he could hope to exercise to the work of the official publicist in question—if the writer whose writing whatsoever might be the purport of it was to have the force of law—no such needless encumbrance had ever been seen attached from that situation prisons and gibbets such as the gentlemen in question have prepared such abundant work for they saw everywhere set up in the place of reasons and by those irresistible instruments the proverbially feeble one as they saw but too plainly has in all such works been in the judgment of the workmen at least rendered needless and superfluous thus it is that in a kindred and congenial sinister interest the sinister interest to the operation of which the gentlemen in question in their situation stood so inevitably exposed found a natural ally while the indiscriminating prejudice which power by whomsoever possessed and how ill so ever exercised has everywhere found means to establish in favour of itself and its own operations gave its sanction to the expectation that in works of that description fit models and objects of imitation for their own work would be viewed works of which accordingly in that character i cannot but hope to find sir that in your opinion but too much use has been made the truth is—who can deny it—one exception alone excepted—as between the rulers of every nation and the rulers of every other there exists a community of sinister interest and correspondent sympathy in particular in the union of impeccability with infallibility may be seen a pair of attributes the belief in which is to all of them alike convenient and in the assumption of which they accordingly fail not any of them to join with equally plenary and unqualified selfsatisfaction and assurance true it is that to be inferior in the conjunct scales of moral and intellectual virtue to those whose place is inferior to their own in the conjunct scales of power and opulence is a condition entailed upon them by the unalterable nature of things for in the direct and not in the inverse ratio of the need he has of voluntary good offices at the hands of his fellowcreatures will be the strength of a mans solicitude and endeavours to stand high in their esteem and to deserve well at their hands but the certificate to the contrary which with an unanimity that only within these few years has begun to experience any disturbance—this most convenient and comfortable certificate which under the same sinister influence has been signed by almost all writers from whose works men have derived that instruction by which mind is formed—has as yet kept minds for the most part shut against a truth which when once received will be found pregnant with all comprehensive practice upon the sort of service in question at the hands of foreigners friendly or unfriendly with what pretension to consistency could an exclusion in any shape direct or thus indirect be thus put i mean always on any such supposition as that the greatest happiness of the  00 greatest number of their constituents was the end in view for that they derived whatever service was in their eyes capable of being derived from foreign codes is what gentlemen themselves declare p xii and even give themselves credit for by any such accidental circumstance as that of its having received the sanction of a government in a foreign country is it in the nature of the case that the utility of any arrangement with reference to spain shall have received increase and in that case let the draughtsman have been who he may was he anything more than one out of an indefinite number of his countrymen from each of whom equally wellgrounded expectation of the like service might with equal reason not to speak of the superior reason abovementioned have been entertained with perfect consistency however it must be acknowledged might that be done which was done on the supposition that it was their own particular interest in preference to and to the exclusion of that allcomprehensive interest that gentlemen had in view for in the case of the codes the service said in general terms to be profited by being already rendered was a service the rendering of which it was not in their power to prevent coming into existence and the individual by whom it had been rendered not being known could not rob them of any part of the lookedfor rewards in any shape whereas in the case of any foreigner by whom an invitation given by them had been accepted the individual by whom the service had been rendered would have possessed and naturally speaking have exercised the faculty of making himself known and thereby have come in for his due share whatever it might have been of the reward at any rate of the praise as to foreignership at large—foreignership in unofficial situations—this condition which by the gentlemen in question has been taken for a cause of effective exclusion is the very one which in the paper above referred to you may have observed me employing in the character of a ground for preference the reason is—the comparative inaccessibility of that situation to all corruptive influence after what has been said i would rather hear you answer than say myself whether it was not by the consideration of this very inaccessibility among other circumstances that the exclusion was determined but not only is the door thus shut by them against all information from foreigners and from opponent fellowcitizens but with still more effective and inexorable rigour is it shut against the greater number of those individuals how well soever affected whose happiness it cannot but have been gentlemens wish should be understood to have been their end in view you see already sir that it is of ultramarians that i speak of such of those whose distance from the seat of legislation precluded them from the possibility of causing any information on the subject to be delivered in from them within the appointed time that is to say of all of them in the lump those only excepted to whom in a number scarcely equal to that of frenchmen it may have happened during the interval to have had their residence within the spanish part of the peninsula no political bar it is true here nothing more than a physical bar but the physical bar is as insuperable as those political bars which your legislature pardon me sir has been in so much haste to set up—i mean those which belong to the prohibitive and restrictive anticommercial system—are feeble and inefficacious your thus excluded fellowcitizens such of them as still remain to you—what think you will they say to this to a proceeding in which so far as regards them even the common exterior forms have not been observed if spaniards are lovers of forms—and they have not unsparingly been spoken of as being rather too much so for their own interest—if spaniards are lovers of forms how will the matter be taken by these your distant kinsmen are they spaniards are they nonspaniards if spaniards what treatment is this that has been given to them if nonspaniards where is your right to legislate over them where is so much as your pretence when speaking of information from foreign hands it is of themselves p xii that of course they speak as the persons of all others to adopt whatsoever shall be most analogous to the political state of the nation ah sir should you ever see the remarks i have ventured to make and the arrangements i have ventured to propose with an equal view to the greatest happiness of peninsular and ultramarian spaniards you will see perhaps how much more analogous to the political state of the greatest number is the system proposed by one foreigner at least than the one proposed by these so highly distinguished and selected spanish citizens yes sir with no eye other than an equal eye could a person not exposed either to sinister influence or to interestbegotten prejudice have considered the interests and claims of the two so unhappily conflicting parties and in the unendurableness of all useful and impartial information on that subject may not the aversion to receive any such service from any such hand have had one at least of its causes ah sir it is not only from what it may be in mens power to do but likewise from what it may be in their inclination to do that to have any chance of proving correct our inferences must be deduced and whatever be the meaning of the phrase analogo al estado politico de la nacion— whatsoever be the meaning of this so conveniently nebulous insinuation—think sir if in all its parts your system of legislation were equally analogous to the political  0  state of those spaniards who in greater number are inhabitants of ultramarian spain as of those who in lesser numbers are inhabitants of peninsular spain where would be the advantage that could possibly be derived by the lesser number from the dominion claimed by them over the greater but this is among the parts of the field of thought and action on which that their view of them may be the clearer men in your country as in every other are so unhappily confirmed in the habit of shutting their eyes at any rate of striving might and main to keep shut the eyes of their fellowcitizens o yes if ultramarian could as easily be shut as peninsular eyes then would all be peace and amity such being the descriptions of persons against whom with their remarks the door is shut a word as to those to whom it is left open these are natives of the peninsular spain at large and one particular class—the class of lawyers see p xix to the invitation given to natives at large apply those observations which need not be repeated as to lawyers being already comprehended in that general description to them no special invitation no second invitation could naturally have been given but for some special purpose what can have been that purpose if there be a class of men whose particular interest is in a state of diametrical and immoveable opposition to the best interests and greatest happiness of the greatest number it is the class of lawyers it is their interest that in regard to every possession for the security of which men look to law uncertainty should be at the highest degree of the scale at which it can be consistently with the sufficiency of the fund from which the professional profit must be drawn it is their interest that the expense with its sources and accompaniments the delays and vexations attached to the purchase of a mans claim for justice be as abundant as possible for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense in this profession the state of the mind—is it not to a first view that of a perfect indifference as between right and wrong for the defence of either of which as it may happen a man is hired to a nearer view a predilection in favour of wrong as being the most dependent and most profitable customer the assassin so called is the malefactor who for the hire he receives risks his life the lawyer is the malefactor who for the hire he receives risks nothing risks nothing but on the contrary like the conqueror obtains at the hands of the foolish and corrupted multitude applause and admiration in the direct ratio of the quantity of human misery he has produced if there be a profession by which a man is prepared for the perpetration of mischief in a profitable so it be an unpunishable shape is it not the profession of the law if there be a profession by which by the power of continual practice and continually received remuneration all regard for truth is completely eradicated—a profession by which insincerity is by the same means with correspondent effect injected and fixed is it not the profession of the law if there be a profession by which by the same perpetually recurring operation a man is more effectually prepared than by any other for the letting his faculties out to any person for any purpose for which reward in apposite shape and adequate quantity is to be got—if there be a profession by which for even the most inconsiderable reward a man is prepared so it be without personal hazard to himself at the instance of any one who is able and willing to give him that reward to render to the greatest amount a sacrifice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number—is it not the profession of the law these considerations—all which stand on the surface of the case—these considerations which so stare every man in the face can they have been a secret to the gentlemen of whom i speak was it possible for them to doubt of the object and tendency of any remark that consistently with the nature of man could come from such a source was it possible for them to be uninformed of the alliance between the particular and sinister interest of this class of men and whatever particular and sinister interest their own situation exposed them to the action of i shall presently sir have to request your notice for a sort of auction which in this preface of theirs gentlemen have set up—an auction at which the lots on sale are composed of recommendations to be given by them to the favour of the givers of good gifts and the biddings are to be in expressions of praise bestowed upon this their own work the first bidding above which all others are to rise in a sort of indefinite height having as you will see been made by themselves supposing the auction to find bidders can there have been any doubt in gentlemens minds of the spirit with which biddings would come from the class of purchasers thus exclusively distinguished not that the door ought to have been shut against lawyers any more than against any less determined enemies of good government and good laws only that it should not have been thrown open to them so much wider than to friends in a word than to all the world besides on an occasion such as this in the force of public opinion any man even though a lawyer would if it were in his own single person that he came forward with his remarks find some restraint some restraint on the effusion of particular and sinister interest in one situation seeking to be admitted into partnership with particular and sinister interest in a situation more elevated and effective even of this restraint on looking at the terms of the special invitation thus addressed to lawyers it seems  0  as if the removal were among their objects copies of the proposed code are ordered by them to be sent—sent whither to the three sorts of bodies corporate thus denominated namely universities tribunals and colleges of advocates by whom in such a case might it most naturally have been expected that the returns if any made to all this magnanimity would be made by whom unless it be by the several bodies to whom before all other persons if not to the exclusion of all other persons it was to be and i cannot but conclude has been made known but by any body in the situation of this committee—from any of the bodies so addressed by it what consistently with the universal principles of human nature as evidenced by universal practice could be expected what unless in the accidental case of discord produced by particular interests could be expected but one uninterrupted chorus of ecstatic praise will it be said that by the words employed in the designation of these bodies nothing more was meant than to make known the channels employed for conveying the great work to the cognizance of individuals and that it was from the members in their individual capacity and not from the bodies that is to say not from some of the leading members released by their union from all responsibility as towards public opinion that the remarks were looked for but had this been the meaning where could have been the difficulty of finding expression for it whether this could have been their meaning you sir from your situation perhaps know by us at our distance no conjecture can be made but from such details respecting lengths of time compared with lengths of work and space as gentlemen themselves have been pleased to supply us with i say from lengths of time c the twentyfirst day of april is the day of the date attached to their preliminary discourse and thereupon come the authenticating signatures latest day allowed for the sending in of remarks the first of july then ensuing interval two months and nine days the document to which on that day these signatures were affixed—in what state on that same day was it in the manuscript or in the printed state if in the manuscript state then to find the time left for distribution receipt and composition and transmission of remarks will be to be deducted the time employed in the printing of the work of a work containing in the preliminary discourse  0 in the body of the work      to pages in either case it is from the secretary of this same committee or through the medium of the gobierno the septemvirate of ministers that the packets had to go to go to the utmost bounds of your extensive country not very advantageously distinguished for the goodness of its roads or for the facility of its communications of any kind now suppose one of these packets arrived at the residence of the official person to whom it has been addressed thereupon whatever further distribution it can have has to wait his leisure and the determination of the individuals within whose reach the several copies shall be placed will depend more or less upon his choice upon his choice either singly or in conjunction with the individuals whoever they may be in whom he sees his necessarily consultable colleagues now sir within any such space of time taking it at its maximum to this display of condescending magnanimity what was the sort of return—the only sort of return—that could have been looked for indication given of particular imperfections with or without indication of means of remedy grounded on the separate consideration of the several articles could any such instructive indication have been of the number of the communications that were expected or of the communications that could have been made no surely but if not what others the answer is sufficiently obvious in the form of addresses laudatory orations conceived in the most general terms and vieing with one another in intensity of admiration as above of time for these whensoever inclination had place—for these in any number there could be no want for no remarks of the other cast in a condition fit to make their appearance—for no remarks of any such unwelcome cast even supposing inclination ever so alert could there have been anything approaching to a sufficiency of time thus it is that independently of all those other securities under the ingenuity thus displayed the mere circumstance of time served to secure to whatever communications could be received that laudatory character which if any it had been determined they should possess praise was the one thing needful praise was a thing gentlemen were determined to have this i have been forced to say over and over again but what i have not yet said or if i have not yet shown is—that for fear of accidents some they were determined to have that should be of their own making i have spoken of the auction of the lots to be sold at it and of the prices in expectation of which the lots were put up to sale i have spoken of their being themselves the first bidders and of their bidding as being the price at which each lot was put up be pleased now sir to look at the terms of it it will be worthy of being reckoned says p xix among the most celebrated codes of cultivated europe it will merit the esteem of wise nations it will merit the gratitude of the spanish nation it will merit the veneration of the present age it will perpetuate the memory of the legislature of      in all future generations now what sir is the work thus spoken of what is it but that which has been the fruit of the united wisdom of the gentlemen themselves who are pleased thus to speak of it true it is that before it has been raised to  0  this pitch in the scale of excellence not to speak of the remarks sent in in no time as above it will have had the benefit of such remarks and consequent amendments as shall have been made by the legislature at large but the remarks and amendments made on it by the legislature what will they have had for their groundwork this same work of the gentlemen in question this and nothing else now what at the utmost can be the amount of any alterations which after anything like an adequate discussion can by possibility be made within the quantity of employable time so anxiously and effectually narrowed as it has been by the constitutional code time sufficient for adopting each several article by acclamation—yes even on the supposition that before the acclamation each article is not only to be read but read well for this operation the quantity of time left applicable to the business may be sufficient but suppose anything that could be called a discussion to have place long before the first title could have received any tolerably wellconsidered amendments the whole quantity of time applicable to the business will have been consumed all this while selfabasement there is—and that in no small quantity as well as intensity magnification of the burthen and of their inability to bear up under it great reliance professed in the assistance looked for from without looked for from the zeal not only of colleagues and fellowcitizens but of foreigners speaking of the heavy charge la pesada carga which they felt pressing on their shoulders and of the debility of those same shoulders que gravitaba sobre sus debiles hombros they speak on the other hand of the alleviation which they promise themselves from the assistance of wellinformed men of divers descriptions concluding with estrangeros but all this is in p xi and page xix is the page in which this selfconfidence having in the interval risen to the degree just mentioned the desire of receiving assistance from strangers gives way to the anxiety for the exclusion of it the selfdiffidence has the air of an introduction employed to prepare the way for the selfconfidence the selfdiffidence looks as if drawn from some treatise of rhetoric the selfconfidence as if drawn from some other source such as you have been seeing sir is gentlemens persuasion of their own appropriate aptitude thus transcendant and consummate is it in their own eyes but not to speak of their colleagues in the legislature their constituents—if eyes they have what will it be in the eyes of their constituents for the support of any such claim not a particle of ground as far as i can find have they any of them in any shape at any time made anywhere right of succession can that be their ground impossible for you will see how energetically they have negatived it if that were their ground—at the very lowest point if they themselves are to be believed would their station be in the scale of aptitude if to their judgment if to their pointedly declared judgment any confidence is due down to the moment at which this function devolved upon them never can there have been anything more consummate than the inaptitude by which the productions of all who have gone before them in the same track have been characterized their constituents—what will they say to them the assent of their constituents—will that be given to this judgment of condemnation to a condemnation so severe so universal and at the same time so pregnant with practical inference well suppose the assent given the gentlemen themselves—what will they be the better for it from this rule sweeping as it is the confidence with which they look for an exception in their own favour is indeed entire but this confidence—on what ground does it stand none as i have already said—none whatever have they made for it of their aptitude of the existence of which in their imagination everybody stands persuaded—persuaded as if it had been made manifest by the strongest evidence what evidence have they to show have they so much as their own evidence not they indeed not so much as their own evidence unless an event altogether supernatural and miraculous be to be believed believed upon the ground of this same evidence true it is that while page xix was writing their persuasion of their own aptitude was such as is there described but at the time when page xii was writing—what was it this too you have seen so that if they are to be believed the change from a state of selflamenting debility to a state of exulting vigour took place within the interval occupied by the composition of these seven pages it is from spaniards be pleased to observe—from these same spaniards that with a declared exception in favour of themselves and one other which the rules of politeness could not fail to add in favour of the company present and a presumable one in favour of the author of the constitutional code this assertion comes of a universal state of inaptitude with reference to the work of legislation on the part of all spaniards so much for these spaniards now as to this same point what would naturally be the judgment of an impartial foreigner as down to this moment according to their own conviction men born and bred under spanish government have been in so eminent a degree unskilful the probability is he would say that even now at this moment they are not so consummately skilful that assistance from abroad should be peremptorily rejected rejected under any such notion as that of its not affording so much as a chance of being of any use on their own assertion as you have seen rests the notion of their own aptitude upon their own assertion and that a selfcontradicted  0  one for to no other proof have they so much as made reference of the inaptitude of their predecessors their notion stands on somewhat better ground in proof of this they have given statements and references of which i cannot resist the temptation sir of presenting you with some specimens scarcely can language furnish expressions more energetically declarative of consummate worthlessness the essence of the national legislative wisdom they found concentrated they inform you in a compilation—the work of the then impeccable and infallible but now extinct council of castile a mass composed say they p xi of collections made with a view to the amendment of the law disgust is the sensation declared to have been produced by its contents a parcel of rough drafts loose remarks incoherent and undigested pages dissertations half religious half political extracts from various penal laws with notes exhibiting coincidences and repugnances apparent destination of the whole furnishing patchwork for insertion into a new edition of the statutes at large recopilacion plan the old plan salutary innovation none convenient reform none sole object preserving and giving support to the antiquated and vitious system basis the same punishments the same with a vast heap of laws and titles unsuited to the present day under the notion of reform the best thing that had been thus proposed to be done was—the giving a new edition of the old system in the old spirit and upon the old plan of which old system they had already in p vi spoken in terms in which every vitious quality a system of law is susceptible of is spoken of as exemplified by it in the highest degree conceivable incomprehensibility in the style absurdity and iniquity in the regulations atrocity in the punishments employed for giving effect to them and so forth at the end of what is said of the above plan for the amendment of those same laws p xii—that the spirit of them may be anticipated from the nature of the subjects examples of those subjects are brought to view holy trinity—catholic faith—jews and their expulsion from the kingdom—moors and moriscos—heretics and persons excommunicated—diviners sorcerers and soothsayers—oaths and perjuries—sacrilege—moneylending and usury—eccentricities of the sexual appetites in respect of species and sex these and others which they conclude with saying ought not to have any place or direct insertion in any good criminal code thereupon sir comes a natural question—what answer shall i give to it the depravity so unreservedly ascribed to the whole body of the law—to the whole of the law then and even still in existence—by what causes was it produced was it not by sinister interest by interestbegotten prejudice by authoritybegotten prejudice by inbred intellectual weakness the fruit of bad education in a country into which no good book unless by stealth could ever penetrate of a minddebilitating and mindperverting system of education and those habits of thinking and acting that could not but have kept flowing from it throughout life all these causes of inaptitude—is it in the nature of man that at any point of time whatever the influence should all on the sudden cease the explosion by which some of the instruments of tyranny were driven from about the throne and some of its victims cast into their places—this or any other political convulsion is it in the nature of it to change with equal rapidity the whole texture of mens minds gentlemen speak of new lights p vii ix xix even the kings proclamation to the ultramarians april       0 speaks of new lights it was by these new lights or if not by what else that this selfconfidence of which sir you have been seeing such abundant testimony was inspired but these new lights—from what sources were they derived from spanish sources no even by gentlemen themselves this supposition you have seen is energetically negatived from what sources then from what but foreign ones yet that from these sources—from the only sources from which the lights which form their sole dependance have ever come—any fresh lights should come this is what they cannot endure the thoughts of instead of eulogy suppose melioration the thing desired—what in advertising for remarks would have been the course taken would it have been any such close course no sir it would have been a course as open as the nature of the case could possibly have admitted send in your remarks it would have been said send in your remarks whoever you are they shall be printed not only to our eyes shall they be presented but to the eyes of all our constituents of all our and your fellowcitizens in a word of all mankind of all those beings on whose condition in respect of happiness your remarks will exercise their influence exercise it yes—in proportion to the value possessed by them in the first place in the eyes of the selected and official judges in the next place in the eyes of all men sitting as judges in the tribunal of public opinion send in each of you his work without name or other token by which antecedently to the time for its being put to use the judgment passed upon it might be perverted perverted by good or illwill as towards the person of the workman send it in without any such public notification and be assured that if for drawing aside the impartialitysecuring veil any private intimation be conveyed—the avenging eye of the public will be on him by whom the corruptive information is conveyed and on him whoever he be on whom it is productive of the effect it aims at  0  p s i should be curious sir to know if the thing were possible how many and what the communications are that in pursuance of the invitation to send in remarks on their draught have been received by the legislative committee received antecedently to the appointed day july the first or at any time since what received and from what public bodies and what individuals respectively sent in and from what places and of those received what have been printed and published for the information of constituents beginning with the people of madrid it might to any one be matter of curiosity to say no more to see what sort of agreement there has been between the facts and the inductions above hazarded in relation to them hazarded by a man whose eyes or ears no positive information whatever had ever reached jeremy bentham letter iii on the course taken for preventing by means of punishment eo nomine all effectual indication of imperfections in the existing political system the proposed penal code included sir— the efficient power of the matter of reward is great but its applicability is limited it is limited by the limits which the nature of things has set to the quantity of the matter of good to which this destination can be given and by the number of the persons to whom it is possible to flatter themselves with the hope of a share in it in the present instance their number falls short—very short—of the whole number of those on whose part for the attainment of the end acquiescence at least has been regarded as necessary to produce acquiescence at the hands of the vast majority no instrument of less force and applicability than punishment was looked upon as sufficient follow a few samples of the use made of it of the acts marked out for punishment one is—that which consists in the endeavour to make an alteration of any kind in the political constitution of the spanish monarchy for this offence the punishment appointed is death the article by which the anxiety to secure obsequiousness is thus expressed is the very first in the whole code and as in this as in any other work the commencement is that part to which the attention of the workman will naturally have been most closely applied it may at least without intentional injustice be taken for a sort of sample of the whole whatsoever may have been the design—here already so far as regards effect and tendency two intimately connected objects may be stated as being in a certain way provided for namely the securing order in the legitimate style and the keeping at a distance two troublesome sets of men—impartial critics and impertinent and presumptuous competitors indication of alleged imperfections indication of arrangements calculated to effect the removal of those same imperfections indications of other codes in and by which the removal or exclusion of those same imperfections has been effected—of indications of any one of these three sorts separately at any rate of any two or of all three conjunctly if the design be not to produce alteration in the system of which they are the subject i know not what design they can have in the midst of all the care thus taken of the liberty of the press an apprehension appears to have presented itself an apprehension of a certain overweening scrupulosity to say no worse on the part of this or that judge the effect of which might be—to exempt the traitor for such is the name given to the offender from the lot so justly merited for the tranquillizing as it should seem any such apprehension for in whatever i say in regard to any of the designs that seem to be indicated in and by this code i speak with unfeigned diffidence for greater security at any rate—by article     provision is made of a more lenient visitation six years seclusion in a fortress nothing more than this except that the situation of the fortress may be and is to be in one of the islands the quantum of the suffering being accordingly susceptible of such undescribed and undescribable additions as the case may be found to require without any of those unsuitable alleviations which the eye of so troublesome a public as the public of madrid might be disposed to look out for if access were possible to it true it is that to the sort of offence which seems to have been in view in both cases the wording given in this latter case is by article     not exactly the same as that given in the former case by article     in that former case a characteristic word is alterar to alter in this latter case guardarse to be kept but that by this change in the language any change is meant to be made in the idea conveyed is more than i can see not that in this case any more than in the other i can take upon me to say but that in the view taken of the matter by this or that person in the situation of legislator or in the situation of judge a milder might eventually in preference to the more efficient interpretation be the proper one but here comes in the misfortune if not the policy two periods are here in question the period anterior and the period posterior to the sanctionment of the law to the anterior period lest legislator or constituents should be more or less alarmed the milder interpretation is without  0  doubt or difficulty the best suited comes the posterior period and then according as the decision falls to the lot of this or that judge and according as the side in support of which the obnoxious act has been done is the wrong side or the right side the interpretation put upon the words is the milder of the two or the more efficient when confronted with some of the other articles by which tongues and pens are endeavoured to be tied this article     with the word guardarse in it throws me into no small perplexity by this article every spaniard who by word of mouth or in writing shall endeavour to produce any such persuasion tratore de persuadir as that in spain or in any of her provinces the political constitution of the monarchy in the whole or in part ought not to be kept guardarse is to be chastised castigado as a subversor of that same constitution in the first degree whatever be meant by the first degree for the explanation of which no reference do i see and suffer imprisonment for six years which if it be in the peninsula that he has been condemned is to be in some fortress in one of the adjacent islands as above not to speak of et cœteras but by article     as above if a man do but conspire to subvert this same constitution trastornar he is to suffer death much more surely by parity of reason must he on the assumption made by that same article     namely that he has actually been a subversor of it which being admitted he whether the fact be so or not is to be deemed and taken to have subverted it under the two articles taken together what then is to be done with him under article     he is in the first place to be put to death—put to death in the first degree or put to death as if he had been though he has not been a subvertor of the constitution in the first degree whatever is meant by the first degree which is more than i can take upon me to divine and when the breath is out of his body then it is that he is to be shut up in the fortress and so forth as above now sir suppose prosecution under these two articles one or both of them figure to yourself advocates pleading and think what a widows cruise of learned arguments learned arguments upon the proper meaning of the two momentous words trastornar and subvertir whence subversor learned arguments for the purpose of settling whether the two modes of action thus differently designated are different or the same but two articles after that comes another art     according to which every spaniard who by word of mouth or by writing propagates any other maxim or doctrine which has a direct tendency to destroy or subvert destruir ó trastornar that same constitution is to suffer imprisonment imprisonment from two to six years besides loss of employment and so forth but nothing is here said of fortresses or adjacent isles as to other it means as it should seem though this is not said other than what is specified in the last preceding article     more learning poured forth upon the question wherein consists the difference—the difference between the endeavouring to persuade men that the constitution ought not to be kept and the propagating a maxim or doctrine tending to destroy or subvert that same constitution supposing a difference the latter of the two offences seems to a plain understanding to have in it the larger dose of illwill and if there be any mischief in the case of mischief for my own part i have had the misfortune to conceive and the temerity to declare in print an opinion that in this same constitution there is this and that article that had better not be kept than kept but notwithstanding all the imperfections i think i see in this same constitution i set much too high a value on it to use my endeavours or so much as to harbour a wish to see any such fate as can be aptly expressed by the words destruction or subversion befall any part that to me seems good in it not more than three articles after this comes article     which says whatever person and this is not confined to spaniards whatever person by word of mouth or by writing shall provoke any one to the nonobservance of the constitution with satires or invectives shall suffer—what death and then imprisonment as above oh no in the course of half a page all such severity seems already to have been forgotten what he is to do now is to pay a fine of from ten to fifty dollars duros or else suffer arrest arresto for from fifteen days to four months and if he be a public functionary the punishment is in both cases to be doubled to so plain a man as myself the endeavouring to provoke men to a purposed nonobservance inobservancia of the constitution—under which words i should suppose that any open and avowed disobedience to this or that one of its ordinances would be regarded as comprehended—seems to have rather more of mischief in it than the using a discourse the object of which were simply to produce an opinion that it ought not to be kept under which words it would seem to me that any discourse might be comprehended having for its object to show that it would be for the advantage of the nation that by the competent authority this or that article in it should be repealed or altered if so i do not see how in any view commonly taken of the matter—how it is that by the employing on this occasion satires or invectives whatever be meant by satires or invectives words loose enough to call forth learning in abundance how it is that by the employing of poisoned weapons in either of these shapes the malignity or the mischievousness of the offence if it has any should be diminished it seems to be by some principle though from a principle which i am altogether unable to reach so much as by conjecture that  0  the comparative encouragement thus given to satires and invectives was prescribed in article     compared with that which stands next after it i find another proof of the influence of this same principle whatever it be by article     the offence described is that of him who by word of mouth shall excite or provoke directly directamente to disobedience to the government gobierno or to any public authority this is one branch of the offence then comes a second or to resist or impede the execution of any law or other act of those acto de los quere whether those acts or those persons expressed espresados in article     so much for the description of the offence thereupon comes the description of the punishment reclusion or prison prision for from six to eighteen months if the excitation or provocation has not taken effect in the opposite case so i understand pero en este caso from one year to four years thus much for article     in which nothing is said of satires or invectives then comes article     here the description of the offence agrees as to part of it with the description given in the last preceding article of the first branch of the offence created by it he who by word of mouth or by writing as before shall provoke the word excite is now omitted with satires or invectives to disobedience to any law or to the gobierno or other public authority so much for the offence now for the punishment instead of reclusion or prision for from six to eighteen months arrest for from fifteen days to two months at the utmost with an alternative of a mulct of   0 dollars with loss of employment c if the offender be a public functionary c the wording and pointing being so ambiguous as to leave it at the option of the judge to let off the offender with the fine in case of his not being a public functionary c thus then you see sir if in the endeavours used by him to provoke men to the disobedience in question a man abstains from all satires and invectives he may suffer as much as eighteen months of reclusion or imprisonment nor can he suffer less than six months but if on this same occasion he indulges himself in satires and invectives in this case his arrest cannot last longer than two months and may be limited to fifteen days note that as to what is meant by the laws or other acts said as above in article     to be expressed in article     you are sent for it of course to art     when you have got there you are sent to article   0 and when you are at   0 you find yourself in a labyrinth the clue to which i should scarce hope to be able to find if my life depended on it but at the end of it what i do find is four years of reclusion next to this article and for the declared purpose of an explanation of it comes article     for the meaning of which you are further sent to four articles more all in the lump namely             and     when you are at     you are sent to     and to     when you are at     you are sent to the whole cluster of articles contained in title iii of part ii and to another cluster contained in chapter iii of title vi of that same part ii in the entanglement produced by the indirect mode of designation above exemplified may be seen a sort of instrument of which considered as applied to the field of legislation the gentlemen in question so far as recollection serves me are the inventors in some instances the reference is in the simple form from one article you are simply sent on to another and here you suffer nothing worse than useless labour but in other instances and these most unhappily numerous words significative of relation are employed—equally igualmente in the same manner whatsoever may be the decoration added by this contrivance not small is the price paid for it paid for it by the subject citizen in the shape of serious inconvenience suffered by it is thus imposed upon the reader the task of comparing the article which is clearly to the purpose with another which may be to the purpose or not as it may happen and in either case the task of establishing the fact of the identity of signification or in case of difference the nature and extent of the difference neither in the memory nor in the conception can an article be lodged without being coupled with another or others which do not belong to it thus a burthen which taken at its minimum is but too heavy receives from this artificial contrivance an indefinite increase and as the result may in each instance be a degree of perplexity and uncertainty to which no limits can be assigned as little can any limits short of death be assigned to the mischief to which in case of an interpretation deemed erroneous by the judge the citizen may be subjected for such may be the mischief in a case in which death is the appointed punishment which case as above is that provided for by art    —the very first of the offencecreating articles in the code the citizen when thus perplexed if rich enough to take the chance for saving himself repairs to a lawyer which lawyer perhaps finds himself equally perplexed but for the suffering of the perplexed lawyer compensation to his own satisfaction is made while by his unhappy client in addition to his perplexity comes instead of compensation the burthen of affording the compensation to the professional man by whom the perplexity has or has not been decreased and by whom security against the mischief has or has not been afforded asimismo as well tambien and so forth and here to the simple labour are added not unfrequently perplexity and uncertainty to an indefinite degree such is the entanglement that has place when there are but two articles thus unnecessarily and incommodiously connected when with the article with which you have to do no  0  more than one other with which you have nothing to do is linked what then must be the embarrassment when from the only one with which you have anything to do you are sent on pain of not knowing what it means to a second with which you have nothing to do from the second to a third from the third to a cluster of others from each of them perhaps to another or others but such is the frequency with which this mode of designation occurs in this same code that scarcely have i opened a page without finding instances of the employment given to it quite sufficient one should have thought are the difficulties inseparable from the subject without its being clogged by any such useless and factitious instruments of uncertainty and embarrassment having no example in anything that was ever written on the subject nor any particular use that i can discover this mode of expression presents itself to me as having something of a colloquial cast as such it operates in confirmation of the suspicion before intimated that in the course of gentlemens studies the fascinating art of rhetoric has obtained rather too much of their attention at the expense of the repulsive art of logic thus much by the by for a specimen of the use made of references but of the proposed code there are certain parts which it should seem gentlemen make sure of finding lodged in the memory of every individual who stands exposed to the temptation of committing an offence in any shape of these parts one is—that in which an enumeration is made of the several modes of punishment being able to read and having time sufficient to dip into some parts of this composition though not to read so much as perhaps a twentieth part of it my good fortune had conducted me to page  0 in which that enumeration is commenced i was thus preserved from an error into which i might have fallen otherwise seeing how far this composition was from any steady observance of that indispensably useful instrument of certainty in a law ideis eisdem verba eadem to the same ideas the same words the words reclusion prision arresto might have passed upon me as meant to be designative of the same punishment turning however to art    i found that reclusion is one sort of punishment the scene of it being a house of hard labour prision another the scene of it a fortress both of them ranged under the head of corporal punishments looking for arresto i found it to my no small surprise at a distance from the other two and under the head of punishments not corporal and in explanation of this word it was that i found but in words of the loosest texture intimation given of some further punishments which were to be considered as attached to all punishments ranged under the head of corporal punishments for the conveying of this intimation the words civil effects are the words employed and for showing what is to be understood by these civil effects no reference do i see in my code every word the signification of which is not beyond all danger of dispute settled by universal usage receives a definition and all words so defined stand distinguished by one and the same particular type and thus by means of an alphabetical index all ambiguity and obscurity may be cleared up in the shortest space of time in the code is thus contained a law dictionary that dictionary a complete one and having the same authority as the text with every word of which it has been confronted sir what you have seen hitherto is no more than a part of what i was led to by art     being the very first of all the articles in which any description is given of particular offences when i have done with this same proposed code scarcely perhaps shall i have read onetwentieth part of it to what end should i no use would there be in my reading it any further than as i write about it and if my determination was to go through with it and say all that it occurred to me to say of it my life would assuredly be at an end before my comments were at an end sir you have already had before you that one specimen before i have done you may perhaps have before you a few others what if the whole work should be found to be of a piece with these specimens of it oh but this is not what we meant we meant so and so this is what i figure to myself gentlemen saying should it happen to you sir to present to their view this or that passage in which it might happen to them to suspect that a change might be made not altogether to its disadvantage gentlemen only from what the code itself says not from what either in private or even in public you may any of you be pleased to say your meaning was while penning it—only from what in the eyes of everybody the code itself says to the exclusion of whatever may have been said of it by this or that individual can the meaning of it in any part of it be understood sir there is a very dry dry indeed but at the same time not unuseful branch of art and science denominated logic upon it where government is the field of operation—upon it as well as upon politics and morals—hangs life and everything else that man holds dear to him upon it depends the choice of words of those words by which according to the interpretation put upon them man is destroyed or saved if in the instance of the gentlemen in question this wearisome and unamusing art has been among the objects of their studies the success of those studies has not i fear been quite so great as their constituents may perhaps see reason to wish it had been of all the several articles by which either particular delinquency is described or particular punishment appointed the very first you see sir is among those in which this laxity on  0  the one part so incompatible with security on the other has been manifested to inquire how far onwards a habit so unfortunate has extended its influence belongs not to the present occasion nor on any occasion to any design of mine to speak of it in the gross in my view of the matter it is a radical indisposition having its root in the method which has been pursued and not curable but by another and very different one of this imperfection if it be one i may perhaps have occasion sir to submit to you here and there a few other indications opposite stands a very brilliant and fascinating art called rhetoric in which the preliminary discourse i have had such occasion to advert to evidences no ordinary proficiency if the time bestowed upon this instrument of fascination had been bestowed upon the instrument of sound instruction the character of the proposed rule of action would naturally have been somewhat different and as far as regards national peace security and contentment would not so it seems to me have been the worse if by rhetoric men are sometimes saved from destruction as well as sometimes consigned to it it must be by logic and in proportion as it is well applied if they are secured against it in their preface page xii gentlemen state the manner in which the whole of their work was parcelled out amongst the five if so it be that of that same work the method is not altogether what might have been wished of whatever imperfection there may be in it one cause i am inclined to think might be found in this partition treaty in the observations made in support of my codification offer section   draughtsman why single c the disadvantages thought to be attached to every such plan of operation are brought to view apropos of doctrines or maxims what if the doctrines or maxims call them which you please the direct tendency of which is to destroy or subvert the political constitution of the monarchy—what if these doctrines or maxims for the propagation of which every spanish propagator is by article     to suffer imprisonment from two to six years with et cæteras should be found in the constitution itself in such a case is the punishment to receive an inexorable application by its doctrines being to be found in that place does it the less come under the description here given of the offence for an example of a thus destructive or subversive doctrine or maxim take the doctrines or maxims by which in articles   and    the greatest happiness of the greatest number is stated as being the only proper end of government for an example of the tendency of such a doctrine to destroy or subvert the political constitution of the monarchy namely by putting the office of monarch out of it take the following consideration by a statement which i have before me taken in the years           from spanish sources the expense of maintaining that one functionary was about onefourth part of that of the whole expenditure of government that is to say the ordinary avowed settled and officially stated expense over and above whatever was extraordinary and unavowed though not the less constantly repeated at present i should not expect to find it quite so much but be it what it may an inference presents itself as one the conclusiveness of which would not be materially varied by any denomination which that portion of the public expenditure has experienced or seems to be in any likelihood of experiencing the giving any such application to any part of the public expense how may it not be asked is it conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number especially when the whole income is not sufficient for the effective protection of the people against the neighbouring pirates not to speak of the insurgent privateers or of the expense of defending almost all ultramaria against its inhabitants of the office thus endowed what is the specific beneficial effect produced in any shape what effect more obvious or more indubitable than the giving establishment to a set of men who partly by legal power partly by force partly by corruption have it so completely in their power to weaken and in time to destroy the constitutive power given to the people—to destroy it yes and through the medium of the share possessed in the operative power by their representatives two authorities does this projected code exhibit—two conflicting authorities who the one of them with one portion of it in hand the other with that which is next to it will if it be but sanctioned and carried into execution be waging a war of extermination till the one or the other of them is exterminated in the political constitution of the angloamerican united states there is no such office and for this omission in what respect is anybody the worse of the arrangements thus proposed for putting to death all persons by whom any conjunct endeavours shall have been employed for remedying any imperfections in the constitution what was the object to preserve the liberty of the nation if the gentlemen in question are to be believed contrary to the liberty of the nation according to them is any such endeavour for at the very head of the offences against the liberty of the nation do i see it placed—tit   cap   capitulo primero de los delitos contra la libertad de la nacion as to this word liberty it is a word the import of which is of so loose a texture that in studied discourses on political subjects i am not i must confess very fond of employing it or of seeing it employed security is a word in which in most cases i find an advantageous substitute for it security against misdeeds by individuals at large security against misdeeds by public functionaries security   0 against misdeeds by foreign adversaries—as the case may be in the present instance if by the word liberty as thus employed security in any shape—security against persons of any description considered in the character of public functionaries or persons acting under the orders or in support of public functionaries—was intended and meant to be afforded—it must have been security not only for individuals but for a certain class of public functionaries against enterprises on the part of another class of public functionaries be it security be it liberty that was the blessing here in view i should not i must confess have supposed that anything in favour of it had been intended to be done by any such arrangement as that to which i have had occasion sir to request your attention had it not been for the assurance given in this same title seeing the course taken by gentlemen in their endeavours to preserve the liberty of the nation i could not but be alarmed when i found that—not content with preserving in their way the liberty of the nation they had taken up the determination to preserve in the same way the liberty of the press i should have said indeed the preservation of that liberty against abuse still however it is the liberty of the press that in a section of the code exclusively allotted to the purpose i see taken in hand titulo noveno de los delitos y culpas de los impresores libreros y otras personas en el abuso de la libertad de imprenta cap único art     such being the hands into which i saw this instrument of liberty taken—taken by means of a body of arrangements separated and distinguished from all others by a title of its own i could not but tremble for the fate of it nor after a glance at the contents has my anxiety been removed sir i know of one individual of whose desire to see the press in possession of all that liberty which is conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number and of no more than all that liberty i cannot entertain a doubt it is your humble servant in no code drawn by him will there be any such title i know even of a government of whose desire to see the press in possession of all that liberty which is conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number and of no more than all that liberty i cannot entertain a doubt it is the government of the angloamerican united states sir in their code there is no such title for the state of the law in that seat of ever undisturbed internal peace concord tranquillity and amity i must een beg leave once more to refer you to that one of my pamphlets which has for its subject the liberty of the press and public discussion under that government from the   th of july      to the  d of march   0  there existed a law having much the same objects as titles i and iii and ix of the proposed code viewing the whole of it together and comparing it with the matter of those titles taken together—viewing both in the lump for of any such task as that of analyzing either of them there would be no end its utmost rigour you will see was tender mercy being however the whole of it plainly useless and much worse than useless—creative of a disease which otherwise would not have had existence—having but one good thing belonging to it which was its temporariness as above—it was suffered to expire the authors of it at that time the leaders of one of the two then contending parties lost thereby the public confidence and with it their political influence that party the aristocratical having expired—ask there for parties no such thing will you find in every code in which i see any such title as the liberty of the press i look of course for the destruction of it i look to the committees code and i have not been disappointed in no one of all the angloamerican united states is any desire more universal or more intense than that of seeing this liberty preserved accordingly in no one of the codes is there any such title what i shall have to say on the subject comes in of course and no otherwise than in an incidental way under the head of offences against reputation to offences of this class where the individuals injured are public functionaries considered as such my code so far from regarding the circumstance as a cause of aggravation gives some indulgence the indulgence has for its ground the great importance it is of that no misdeeds of men in that situation should remain unknown and the more than ordinary facility which in case of the groundlessness of the imputation they have for defending themselves for defending themselves or rather of being defended by others without having the trouble to defend themselves see my accompanying tract on the liberty of the press but this indulgence i confine to the case of temerity for in the case where the falsehood disseminated by the disseminator himself is known to be a falsehood though in this case disproof and refutation are so much more easy to men in power than to men not in power still i see no need nor therefore any warrant for manifesting indulgence to immorality in a shape so mischievous a distinction which on this occasion i am careful to make is that between defamation and vituperation defamation the imputing to the person in question the having done this or that specific act of a punishable or disreputable nature vituperation the mere expression of dislike to the individual in terms of a reproachful and offensive nature of these in proportion as they are understood to be unmerited the punishment naturally attached falls of itself on the head of the offender and with small if any assistance from factitious punishment suffices for the purpose in case of defamation the law of england it is that part of the law which is made by judges and reporters of their decisions disallows the proof of the truth of the imputation in the     character of a cause of exemption from punishment for the law made by these creatures and dependants of the monarch has for one of its effects it is needless to add its objects the providing a screen for delinquency in every shape on the part of themselves and of their associates in the system of misrule bad as it was in principle even the exploded angloamerican law just mentioned gives express allowance to this proof a rule which has been established by lawyers in england and which i should expect to find adopted by the fraternity in the united states prohibits indeed in case of defamation the interrogation of the party defamed for the purpose of proving the truth of the fact imputed to him and prohibits it—not only in a civil suit in which he is the avowed plaintiff but also in a criminal suit which while it has the king for the nominal has the individual for the real plaintiff my code allows it in most cases and in particular where the party defamed is a public functionary defamed as such in one of the two abovementioned cases the prohibition has its foundation in an illexpressed latin rule made nobody knows when by nobody knows who namely nemo tenetur seipsum accusare as if confession were accusation in proportion as laws are tyrannical this contrivance for giving impunity to delinquents is beneficial nor could i think of expunging it out of any such system of law as in england we have or from any such as if the force of law is given to this proposed code spain will have suppose the laws not tyrannical the rule and the imaginary law made out of it is purely mischievous on better ground in tenderness to the accused defendant would all other testimony be excluded for who is so little likely to give false testimony to a mans disadvantage as the man himself is but in such a government as we have and spain seems in danger of having in a word in a government which has for its object the sacrifice of the many to the few the best thing that can happen is—that all offences that are such merely against government should go unpunished and be followed by their designed effect of this portentously absurd rule those according to whom the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the only proper end of government lay fast hold for the sake of the application made of it to offences against government—to offences against those laws which having for their end in view the sacrifice of the happiness of the greatest number to the separate interest of the ruling few by whom they were made would of course if carried into anything like full effect render the greatest number miserable lovers of the people cherish the absurd rule for the sake of this particular application which cannot be refused to it lawyers cherish it for the sake of the protection and encouragement it gives to delinquency in all shapes giving proportionable increase to the number of their customers for this reason in every country it is the interest of lawyers to see depravity consummate accordingly in every country it is to the utmost of their power their endeavour to keep or render it so this collection of arrangements in which such special care is taken of the press—such anxiety manifested for preserving its liberty from abuse—this collection of arrangements—stands exhibited in    articles namely those from     to  0  inclusive and occupies   out of the   0 pages of the code i have glanced over it the result is—a confirmation of the conception above brought to view namely that at any rate on the   st of april      that being the declared day of signature the wish and endeavour of the gentlemen in question was at the prices there expressed in the shape of capital and other punishments to prevent as far as possible the diffusion of all ideas whatsoever that should in any degree be productive of sensations of an unpleasant nature in their own minds or in the minds of any person in connexion with them trusting as they would naturally do that by the same interests prepossessions and affections—their successors whosoever they were would by so universally convenient an arrangement as this of theirs be fixed in those same wishes and endeavours that in this view their endeavour was—to keep the eyes of their fellowcitizens for ever hermetically sealed against all written or printed discourses the tendency of which should be to produce any such unpleasant effect and that it is in this same view that by article  0  they have extended the exclusion to discourses in the spanish language printed elsewhere than in spain and by articles     and  0  to discourses of the like tendency in any language other than the spanish wheresoever printed if there be any one foreigner who more than any other not to say more than all others put together has been the object of their jealousy who can it be sir but your unfortunate humble servant and if such were their wishes in relation to him even from the first what will they be should ever any such provocation meet their eyes as cannot but be afforded by so unwelcome a proof as this is which is now given in obedience to your commands for the purpose of keeping matter such as the above from the eyes of constituents what then is the punishment which the proposed code provides sir you have seen already—the punishment of death from this punishment fortunately for him true it is that by remoteness from your country the person of your abovementioned humble servant is kept safe but by the terror of that same punishment any the most useful of communications which in his eyes it would be worth his while to make are not the less effectually excluded on this occasion permit me sir to recall to     your view that same leading article article     in which death is the punishment appointed for every person by whom endeavours shall have been used to bring about any alteration in the political constitution of the spanish monarchy in speaking of that article one word nor that an altogether immaterial one i must acknowledge the having omitted the mention of this is the word conspirare—to conspire the omission had not for its cause either oversight or any deceptious design or in short any other cause than the convenience there is in speaking of no more than one thing at a time no such effect had it no such effect had the omission i mean as that of narrowing or otherwise varying the description of the offence unless in the breast of a man who is not insane any such endeavour or design can be supposed to have place as that of effecting an alteration of the kind in question by his own single power without aid from any one else the truth is—that on this occasion it was my own unfortunate case that occupied the first place in my view for saving all proper exceptions such is the nature of man self will on every occasion be intruding itself among my own endeavours as well as designs has been that of causing to be printed in the spanish language and circulated in spain written discourses more than one in relation to which i cannot flatter myself with any the faintest hope that in the minds of gentlemen the sight of them could fail of producing though to my own most sincere regret sensations of a cast more or less unpleasant nor in regard to some of those same writings can i help being sincerely apprehensive that in the eyes of the gentlemen in question the endeavouring to give publicity to them would be the endeavouring to produce an alteration in that same political constitution true it is that on this occasion so far as regards my own personal safety i do not from any such conception in those or any other spanish breasts see any cause for apprehension but an endeavour of this sort could not be used without assistants without assistants who in the language of the proposed code would be accomplices nor by and between the principal and such his accomplices could any correspondence be carried on without that which in the same language would be a conspiracy among these accomplices would in this case be a translator a printer and a bookseller of these the translator might possibly be one who would not be in any greater danger of death or whatever were the other punishment than myself and to the case of the printer the same consoling possibility may be found applicable still there remains the bookseller without whose assistance my plot for the contributing in conformity to articles   and    of your constitution to the greatest happiness of the greatest number of your fellowcitizens whatsoever in this shape or in any other may be in my power could scarcely by any means set itself to work and thus it is that if the wish that seems to be entertained as to this matter by the gentlemen in question as evidenced by this part of their proposed code is carried into effect—mine stands on the verge of hopelessness even if the net spread by the word alterar in article     were not sufficient to catch us i mean myself and my accomplices another net of not much less amplitude i see spread for us in the next article by the words embarazar sus sesiones y deliberaciones penalty death as before for of the arrangements that my temerity might find to propose what embarrassment it might happen to this or that one to produce in the deliberations of the august body should they ever come under its view if it were during the time of its having the happiness of numbering the gentlemen in question among its number i tremble but to think of on this occasion one little difficulty in particular there is the effect of which could scarcely fail to produce more or less of embarrassment in the deliberations in question should any endeavour be thought fit to be used for the solution of it in pursuance of any such mortally wicked design as those above described should a man content himself with doing what at present i am doing—that is with the employing a nonspanish language in the composition of such his political poisons—in this case such is the lenity manifested by article     his portion of punishment is to be no more than the half of that which he would suffer were it in the spanish language duros yes anos yes   but i hope i am not using satire and i am sure i am not using invective when i observe that neither in euclid nor in any other book would gentlemen be able to find any process for the bissection of a punishment of which death is to be the result one manifestation more and that a finishing one of the care taken by gentlemen for the preservation of the press from abuse remains yet to be brought to view it is the establishing—yes the establishing in regenerated spain—an index expurgatorius an index expurgatorius and by whom composed composed by no less an authority than a new species of supreme legislature proposed to be established for this single purpose a legislature in which the initiative function is to be exclusively in the gobierno the septemvirate of ministers every one of them appointed and at pleasure removeable by the king the initiative function in this gobierno and the consummative in the cortes of this proposed new legislature i find mention made—not only in the cluster of articles which form part of those especially destined to the preservation of the liberty of the press from abuse namely in articles      00 but in that preceding cluster which has for its special destination the preservation of the spanish mind from     error on the field of religion and on both occasions the existence of an instrument of this sort framed by the new authority just mentioned is supposed and in a manner taken for granted it is therefore in their zeal in support of religious truth that in the exercise of the conjunct attributes of impeccability and infallibility above spoken of this manifestation of zeal for truth in general in the breasts of the gentlemen in question appears to have taken its rise and what cannot be denied is—that by him whoever he may be by whom for the happiness of mankind those same divine attributes happen to be possessed exercise too extensive cannot be given to them but in proof of a mans being so gifted evidence something more conclusive than his own insinuation nay even than his own assertion however positive may it should seem not altogether unreasonably be required before this finishing measure for the consummation of political security receive the sanction of law there is one other thing sir which i could not but be glad to see recommended to the consideration of the august assembly not to speak of the supremely influential body—the gobierno of whatever individuals it may at this moment be composed this is—supposing this extraordinary duty on their shoulders and anything like adequate time for discussion allotted to the business—whether from years end to years end for the fulfilment of their ordinary duties there would be so much as a single moment of time left i have spoken of logic as an art which though not quite so agreeable has with reference to the greatest happiness of the greatest number rather more of the useful in it than the brilliant art of rhetoric there is moreover another dull and plodding kind of art which if a recommendation from me could promise to itself any weight i would take occasion from the incident here in question to recommend to the attention of gentlemen in your exalted station it is the art of mensuration i do not mean as applied to land or timber but as applied to time to time on the one hand compared with the quantity of business to be done in it on the other from a want of proficiency in this art such as it is two effects both of them of rather an unpleasant nature are liable to be produced the exclusion of good measures and the adoption of bad ones the exclusion of good ones for want of their being so much as proposed for consideration the adoption of bad ones for want of their being in a sufficient manner made the subjects of consideration if of this lastmentioned effect an example should be desired a not uninstructive one may i am inclined to think be found without much difficulty in the recently established prohibitive and restrictive commercial or as i should rather say anticommercial system under which trade was to have been increased by the exclusion of customers gentlemen having in the manner you have been seeing sir shown their sense of the necessity as well as importance of the office of censor—having moreover assigned as and for the whole or a part of its business the composition and continual completion of this same instrument of legitimate order i mean the purifying index—it being also considered how natural on the part of the inventor of any instrument the wish is—to see the application of it placed in his own hands—what if the powers—the whole powers of it were to be conferred on the gentlemen in question i mean on all five of them and in a state of exemption from all other cares during their respective lives in this power for further security might be included not only all actually existing works in their entire state but all such doctrines or maxims as if they were in existence would be possessed of the destructive or subversive tendency so often mentioned in this case however if it were in my power to make conditions one little condition i would venture to propose to them and that is—that they would not insist upon attaching to the publication of the books in question or of the maxims or doctrines in question any of those severities by the proposal of which their religious and patriotic zeal has on the present occasion manifested itself no sir if in the eyes of the public at large their intellectual worth be but half as great as from the above quoted passage in their preface it should seem to be in their own the authority of their names when employed in marking out for exclusion from all eyes and ears the obnoxious works will be quite sufficient without the aid of penal visitation or physical repression performed in the proposed or any other shapes after all thus much must be confessed—be the instrument what it may destroy the instrument you prevent the abuse of it destroy eyes you prevent the abuse of eyes destroy ears you prevent the abuse of ears destroy hands you prevent the abuse of hands destroy liberty you prevent the abuse of liberty such would be the effect supposing the destruction total and thence impartial but so far as either the liberty of the press or the liberty of discourse through the medium of any other instrument is the subject the destruction which the gentlemen in question aim at effecting—the destruction which they even profess to aim at effecting—is not total and thence impartial but decidedly partial and being so the effect of it in so far as it has any will be—not to prevent but to establish and secure the abuse of the liberty of the press in a word of the liberty of discourse of the whole of that branch of liberty which they thus take in hand for wheresoever by any person on any controverted point a judgment is to be pronounced—what can be a greater abuse of the faculty of discourse than the keeping all the arguments on one side in a     state of suppression or though it be but restriction while those on the other are left in a state of liberty of absolute or even though it were but comparative liberty in regard to this matter one very simply expressible mistake seems from first to last to have taken possession of gentlemens minds and guided their operations i mean the mistaking a cause for a remedy the taking for a remedy to the disease they have had in view—for a remedy and that an indispensable one that very morbific cause but for which the disease would not have had existence supposing that to be the case apply the supposed remedy you produce the disease burn the remedy you kill the disease such after a three years experience of the imagined remedy was the practice of the angloamerican united states and after twenty years of uninterrupted experience the salutary efficacy of that same practice has received in the face of all mankind as complete perhaps a confirmation as any practice political or even physical ever yet exhibited jeremy bentham letter iv on the severity of the ulterior means employed for securing against amendment all imperfections in the political system and for preventing the national will from manifesting itself sir— in the title of this fourth letter as it is announced in the first the words severity of the were i fear omitted they are requisite however for giving expression to the idea which in reviewing that part of the matter and penning a title for it was uppermost in my mind on a second glance along with what bears special reference to that circumstance i find some matters of which the same thing cannot i must confess be said with equal propriety on the other hand the subject on which it touches is one of which special notice is taken in your letter what is said in relation to it will help to prove the respect with which your commands have been attended to and whatever may be the offence committed against the laws of method as above it is on this circumstance i must rely for whatever atonement it may be in my power to make pena de muerte pena de muerte pena de muerte by these words i see with grief of heart a war of mutual extermination organized code in hand i see partisans of the king and partisans of the people under the name of partisans of the constitution slaughtering each other and thus maintaining order in the legitimate style no man can serve two masters so at least i have read somewhere and i am inclined to think there may be some truth in it looking to the people of your peninsula i see two masters made for them one all head without body the other all body without head no man being able to serve both masters i can see no man who is safe in the angloamerican union no man has any master and there everybody is safe in that seat of universal security there were for a course of years two parties and between them war was waged with a fury not to be exceeded even among you the weapons however were words only not swords or bullets satires and invectives met in incessant clouds but they met taxfree no duros were ever paid for them ink flowed in torrents ink on both sides but of blood not a drop on either side little by little the less liberal party was silently absorbed into the more liberal finally there is no party and now even in words it is all peace yes sir between the death to preserve liberty tit   cap   and the death to preserve monarchy tit   cap   i see every man between two fires remembering the use made on a former occasion of the word corporation as mentioned in my tract on the liberty of the press c i see in article     a somewhat more efficient use found for it a sympathy i hope not unpardonable places before me on this occasion my brethren of the cross of malta if they are tired of life the words ò á que se radiquen en otras corporaciones ó individuos may upon occasion help them to get rid of it but perhaps the citizens who all over the kingdom if our newspapers do not deceive me are still meeting for the purpose of considering what under articles   and    of the constitution may be most conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number if it were only that they may learn how to give their votes—may not be quite so eager to see themselves killed as the committee seems to be to see them killed and if they are not altogether pleased at the thoughts of being killed under the name of citizens i should not expect to find that the thoughts of being killed under the name of members of corporations would render them more so for how many things which they themselves have done and which i cannot but applaud them for having done do i not see gentlemen appointing this same punishment of death the only punishment the mischief of which is in case of misapplication altogether out of the reach of remedy right that which at the moment suits us wrong that which does not suit us—this or something like it is it not the principle as it is with vituperation and defamation     so without much difference is it with sedition insurrection and their et cæteras in a government that has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number little or no need is there for any such denominations with exclusively appropriated punishments a public functionary is a man gentlemen do not seem to me to be altogether aware of this with my respectful compliments do me the favour sir to convey to them the information of it a public functionary is a man not only is his reputation the reputation but his person the person his property the property of a man by sedition and so forth if any real mischief is done by it it is to the person or the property of some man that the mischief is done ill indeed must the public functionary whoever he is—the monarch if there be one ill indeed must he have comported himself if on the part of the people at large there is not on every occasion and in all manner of ways more promptitude to afford protection against injury in this or any other shape to him than to an individual not so distinguished in a country the government of which has for its end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number let a man seditionize—let a man insurrect—see what he will get by it he will be laughed at laughed at as an untoward lamb might be if seen running and butting against its mother he would be laughed at and there would be an end of it colonel burr insurrected colonel burr tried to make himself emperor of mexico colonel burr thought to make himself emperor of the united states many is the laugh i have had with him about all this—i who write to you in the united states has he had his entrails torn out of his body a man in his place would have been so dealt with in england has he seen them burnt before his face no there he is in new york subsisting quietly as other lawyers do upon the indiscriminate defence of right or wrong now at the end of his career just as he did at the commencement of it ask miss wright sir if it be not so—see what her book views of society and manners in america by an englishwoman translated ere this into french says of him in one of the notes out of the    —that being the whole number of the articles in the code deduction made of those general ones   0 in number which are not occupied in the creation of particular offences or the appointment of particular punishments—out of this number of     not more than    had i run over before i had counted    as the number of times in which this same punishment of death had been attached to so many different offences true it is that in speaking of penal laws to speak of the multitude of the laws as a conclusive proof of severity on the part of the whole system—to speak of multitude in this case without notice taken of extent—is i am fully aware a mode of speaking no less pregnant with misconception than it is frequent in the english chaos for example where stealing or destruction is the mischief to be obviated you have one law for one sort of vegetable another for another and so throughout a plan according to which the vegetable kingdom would of itself if all other penal laws were abrogated furnish matter for between  0000 and  00000 of them and still leave all but a small part of the field of mischievous delinquency uncovered but in the present instance the rigour of the punishment will be found not mismatched by the amplitude of its extent but the striking and deplorable circumstance is—to find the highest lot in the scale of punishment attached to so great an extent to acts in regard to which in that system of law which is productive of the happiest effects it is after such a length of experience universally understood and acknowledged that there exists not any demand for punishment in any shape as to the taking of these cases or any of them one by one and by a regular application made of preestablished principles considering in the first place whether the act ought to be placed upon the list of offences in the next place whether death would be an apt punishment for it and if not what other would be—no such discussion sir can i upon the present occasion think of attempting to trouble you with in any code of my drawing this would be done and in a manner which in my eyes would be complete at a much less expense of words than the least that could be bestowed upon it in any work having for its subject a code by another hand even supposing the particular arrangements determined by a set of preestablished and declared principles and not like the one in question so completely and even avowedly unprincipled that a volume might be occupied in the endeavour to reach by conjectures antecedently to examination the considerations that in the character of reasons may have given birth to this or that one article on the subject of religion indeed it being the only one which has received any special mention in your letter i had at the time when the first of these of mine were sent off written a few pages to which i thought of giving insertion in this but by a second glance on this part of the proposed code observation was insensibly and perhaps unfortunately elicited in a quantity much too great to be consigned to a letter in which any other subject were brought to view should it ever reach your hands sir it will accordingly be in the form of a  th letter written in addition to those announced in the first one word more about death about the grim tyrant and the once established and established or not everywhere honoured code by which the door was shut against him seeing the use made by the gentlemen in question of this instrument hardly should i have expected     to find that of these most esteemed european codes the wisdom of which as p xii of their preliminary discourse informs us they had made theirs this same tuscan code had been one this same tuscan code in which of this same instrument no use at all was made either my memory deceives me greatly or in some authentic statements made at the time i read that after the innovation thus introduced—though anything like the whole of the benefit which by its leniency the code was calculated to produce had not yet had time to manifest itself—the number of those crimes to which the punishment of death had been used to be attached had not received increase yet so it is that not only the code of the french constitutional assembly of      but this same celebrated tuscan code had passed under their review so in page xv of their preliminary discourse they expressly tell—us i was going to say—i beg their pardon sir i should have said tell—their colleagues p s before this letter goes to the post i have just time to acknowledge the receipt of a  d letter from you dated paris    sep      though what was said of me by our friend was the pure result of his own generous zeal and altogether without warrant from me—the consequence which has resulted from it is—not in the less but in the greater degree a source of gratitude in my mind as towards him as well as satisfaction and pride on my own account for never was declaration more sincere than mine was when i spoke of myself as receiving honour as well as pleasure from such a correspondence few things could have contributed more strongly to confirm me in that sentiment than the frankness of your consent to that publicity by which whatsoever service such a correspondence may be capable of rendering to that country which is the object of our common affection will be so effectually cleared of the inconveniences with which it would otherwise have been clogged at the same time believe me sir it is not without the sincerest sympathy and unfeigned uneasiness that i can reflect as i have but too much and too frequent occasion to do on the invidious and unpleasant situation in which it has been impossible for me to avoid placing you by the necessarily unwelcome freedom which i have all along found myself compelled to use in speaking of this production of your illustrious colleagues for how can they do otherwise than behold in you the cause of so many strictures of which should they be thought to amount to anything sensations of a nature very far from pleasant cannot but be the result but in the opposite case and in proportion to the importance of any of the suggestions which it has fallen in my way to submit to you the warmer your love for that country of which you are one of the most conspicuous and brightest ornaments the more valuable in your account will be the indemnification which in the character of a spanish citizen and a representative of the spanish nation you will receive jeremy bentham letter v further grounds for the apprehension that by the proposed code the interest of the subject many is designedly or undesignedly sacrificed to that of the ruling few strange indeed unexampled indeed would the case be if it were otherwise but so far from being a reason for the omitting the mention of any instances in which it is exemplified the strength of the propensity in human nature to produce such sacrifices is a reason why the search after them should be the more rigid and the display of them the more complete to attempt to bring to view the several particulars by the observation of which a supicion to this effect was produced would be to attempt to bring to view little less than the whole contents of that same official and preeminently important work i must content myself with a few samples but they shall be such as are either allcomprehensive in their extent or do not want much of being so example   fundamental principle neglected what i have here in view is—the profound silence as to the fundamental principle of the constitutional code as to the two leading articles   and    into which by far the greatest part of its merit and beneficial influence is condensed namely the so often mentioned principle by which the greatest happiness of the greatest number is laid down in form in the character of the proper end of government and as the object to the attainment of which the several arrangements of detail included in that same code were meant to be understood as having accordingly been directed the application which this your troublesome humble servant makes of this instrument of spanish construction—you see sir how continual and indefatigable it is it is a light by which every step in his career is lighted such is the use made of it by an englishman the gentlemen in question being spaniards how comes it that all the time that they have been at their work this matchless spanish instrument has been lying in its case how comes it that these articles to which from first to last reference express or tacit could not consistently with consistency have been omitted remains from first to last a dead letter in their hands these same articles of this code—for what purpose were they put there was it only for show the authors of that same code—was     it not their intention the principle should be made use of the articles—were they placed there in no other character than that of so many flowers of rhetoric but the authors of this proposed penal code it is with them that our concern is at present of the neglect in which they have left this light of lights what can have been the cause sir can it have been any other than this namely that it did not suit their purposes from what follows your judgment on this point may perhaps acquire some assistance example   rationale rejected what is above leads me immediately to the matter of the rationale of my plan the rationale is an essential i should rather say the characteristic feature but what does it consist in in neither more nor less than the undiscontinued application of the abovementioned fundamental principle an application of this basis of your constitution to every the minutest line in the several arrangements by the making of which the operations of the legislator are carried on in the very act of proposing this accompaniment a sort of challenge to all legislative draughtsmen was contained from the challenge thus given the gentlemen in question shrunk why sir did they shrink from it to their constituents as i have shown to the subjectcitizen as such it would have been at once a source of interpretation—a fund of instruction moral as well as political—a source of security satisfaction and comfort a source of security against arbitrary rule in the hands of the legislator and against arbitrary interpretation in the mouth of the judge to the judge a continual guide but at the same time as continual a bridle to the body of the law in the whole and every part of it an anchor giving stability just so far and no further as reason assisted by experience shall have shown that stability will be conducive to the allcomprehensive and allcommanding end so often mentioned this being among the undeniable properties of the instrument in question why sir i ask once more did gentlemen shrink from it when offered to their hands sir i will tell you plainly they had two reasons for turning their backs upon an instrument the matter of which is composed of reasons in another sense in it they saw a guide but a guide whose course it did not on every occasion suit them to pursue in it they saw a guide but in it they at the same time felt a bridle and all this in both their capacities that of legislative draughtsmen and that of sanctionative legislators to which may perhaps be added that not impossibly in their view of the matter to construct and make undiscontinued application of an instrument of this nature was not quite so easy as to propose it in that paper of mine the heads of which i have had occasion to submit to you in the first of these my letters the two last heads are section  0 on the part of an individual proposing himself as draughtsman c willingness or unwillingness to interweave in his draught a rationale as above is the most conclusive preliminary test and that an indispensable one of appropriate aptitude in relation to it section    on the part of a ruler willingness or unwillingness to see established an allcomprehensive code with its rationale as above    is among the most conclusive tests of appropriate optitude with reference to such his situation among the most conclusive i said speaking of a ruler in whatever rank and in whatever department and when speaking of a ruler in the rank of supreme legislator or in that of possessor of a share in that allcommanding power might i not have said absolutely the most conclusive sir the time at which these propositions with the demonstration of them were penned was by a long time anterior to that in which by your favour the proposed code with the preliminary discourse prefixed to it came into my hands to my mind no otherwise were the authors of that work present than all other men by whom that same or the like preeminent situation shall have been filled were are and will be present but if and so far as that which of all men without exception in their situation is there said is true—of them in particular it is true nor can it consistently either with sincerity or consistency be retracted in that work of mine in which of the sort of instrument in question with its use a description more or less particular is given—in that work the existence of which was assuredly no secret to any member of the spanish cortes nor to any of the gentlemen in question in particular—in that work is even contained a sample of the application made of this same instrument—a sample of the mode of applying it and of the sort of work produced by it to judge from a paragraph in their preliminary discourse it looks as if somebody or other had even been troublesome enough to endeavour to draw their attention to this same part of that same work—and what say you to this will not you give us something of this sort in your code—one would think these or some such questions had been put to them put to them and in so troublesome a way that to this matter in that same preliminary discourse something by way of excuse for their silence on the subject was thought necessary at any rate that on this subject something should be said be this as it may in that same page of theirs on this same subject something actually is said what is it sir it is what i am truly glad to see for as you have seen already in the way of allusion at least statement being referred to in another paper as in this way in my dull logic you have seen reasons for the use of reasons—so here in their brilliant rhetoric we have gentlemens reasons against the use of reasons first comes their allcomprehensive determination—their determination respecting all     such parts taken together as come within the field of their labours then come exceptions six in number exceptions speaking of six points in particular in relation to which thus as it were in a parenthesis such reasons as it has seemed good to them to submit to your consideration follow with regard to the tout ensemble their determination being—not to give any reasons bearing separately upon the several arrangements or any of them with the exception of the six just mentioned—in the place of the excluded reasons they give you one reason—one reason which in their view is a conclusive one—for not giving them this reason what is it ah sir disallow it if you can—disallow it if you can find it in your heart to be so ungenerous sir in the allsufficiency of that unerring test of right and wrong which you all sir have the selfsatisfaction of bearing in your own breast—it is in that security that they find a succedaneum to everything which on any occasion it would be in their power to find in the shape of a reason a succedaneum so fully adequate—a substitute so much better than merely adequate that anything in that way on their part would be worse than useless to the conclusiveness of this antirational reason what objection can you oppose sincerity will suffice to prevent your disputing it in your own instance politeness in that of any of your colleagues after an observation respecting the matter of the title termed by them the preliminary title—namely that giving as they do the whole of it they do not give any part of it over again regarding as they do any such repetition as useless—because say they we regard every such addition as useless a conception in which no man can i think refuse concurring with them after so saying they go on in page xiii and say as little will the committee—as little will it give any exposition of the reasons raziones on which it has grounded the several articles respectively for that they meaning doubtless the reasons in question cannot have kept themselves hidden from the superior perspicacity illustration of the congress meaning the cortes into the ears of which in full assembly the stream of this eloquence i take for granted was pouring itself forth by this illustracion a term for which in the sense in which it seems here to be employed i find not in my own language any exact equivalent—for illustration will not serve—by this one endowment that which gentlemen appear evidently enough to have in view is—the pair of contiguous organs to which i had occasion to make allusion in the second of these letters namely the same to which dr spurzheim would after a sufficient inspection give the denomination of the organs of impeccability and infallibility organs which without need of any such assistance as that of the ingenious anatomist all rulers in chief except of late years those of the angloamerican united states have so universally felt upon their own foreheads and of the extraordinary prominence of which in their own instance the authors of your constitutional code so well followed up by these successors of theirs have given such extraordinarily prominent demonstrations now sir as to these same colleagues of yours the matter must be left to themselves but as to yourself sir pardon me—if so it really be that you are a sharer with them in the good fortune of being in possession of these same organs or either of them it is plainly more than you yourself know of you might as well not have had any such things of the possession of any such useful implements had it happened to you to be conscious never could i have received any such letter as that by the receipt of which your humble servant received that honour of his gratitude for which you see the fruits in the course of the contest for your favour here sir you have two compliments to choose out of which of them is most in accordance with truth which of them is most in accordance with your taste for the reason abovementioned to their colleagues say the gentlemen in question—to all these representatives of the spanish nation without exception—any such implement as that same rationale would have been useless well for the moment and for the purpose of the argument be it so but these same distinguished citizens whom to the number of from   0 to  00 they are thus addressing—in the whole spanish nation were they the only individuals by whom either the faculty called reason or the faculty called sensibility was possessed the privileged organs in question by which governors have hitherto regarded themselves as distinguished are they in your country in the possession of the governed likewise if so what need can there be of governors and here alas comes one of the proofs of the position which gives title to this letter—namely that in and by the official work in question the interest of the subject many is designedly or undesignedly sacrificed throughout to the interest of the ruling few look sir to the excluded foreigner look to these your select your native legislators—the whole body of their fellowcountrymen their security their satisfaction their instruction—which of all these objects has ever been forgotten by the foreigner which of all of them was remembered by these their representatives in this effusion of their eloquence but their colleagues for whose ears the compliment had been composed—these colleagues were present objects constituents all of them distant ones—all of them distant from their thoughts—by the interest of the select and present and associated few the whole field of their vision was preoccupied the interest of all was in their eyes too minute an object to be a perceptible one six however though no greater than six is the number of those points to which in the opinions of these your selected colleagues your     allsufficiency sir yours is of course here plural did not at that time extend accordingly in relation to these several points they proceed or at least profess to lay before you their reasons why because these were the points in relation to which amongst certain persons not named or indicated the most considerable controversy had had place in this controversy it is that they find the source of an obligation by which they feel themselves called upon to be thus particular solo se cree obligada á indicarlos motivos que en algunos puntos muy controvertidos la inclináron á la opinion que ha abrazado p xiii the points are in brief as follow     drunkenness—shall it in any case have the effect of warranting any mitigation of the punishment answer no     transportation—shall it be employed as a punishment—answer at present no in the contingent future yes     stigmatization—shall it be employed as an ingredient in any lot of punishment answer yes but in no other case than that of condemnation to hard labour for life     asylum—on the ground of its connexion with religious worship shall any place continue to possess the property of affording impunity to delinquents answer no this unanimous     pardon—power of pardoning shall it be continued to the monarch answer yes but subject to certain restrictions allusion is made to them but no reference in figures     judicatories of exception—shall there be any answer two only namely military and ecclesiastical military for military offences ecclesiastical for ecclesiastical now then comes a question allsufficient with regard to all other points in the legislative compass how comes it that gentlemens organs fail them when applied to this halfdozen compared to what is left untouched these are but as so many drops in that ocean to which as above they have given the character of the pacific and so in the conception of these gentlemen only in so far as controversy has had place can there be any demand for reason sir among the points touched upon in my code whatever may be the number of those to which it has happened to have produced controversy the number of those to which no such accident has happened i should expect to find still greater is it only as an instrument of victory sir that reason is of any use on the above points of exception to say anything more would be wandering from the announced purpose of this letter one alone namely judicatories of exception upon looking into the article on this subject in the proposed code presented matter which seemed not inapplicable here and with this the present letter will close example   method antipopular employed—method indicative of disregard to the interests of the subject many in my own code the method pursued was suggested partly by considerations of a purely logical nature partly by considerations of a moral and political nature those of a purely logical nature belong not to the present occasion those of a mixed nature partly logical partly moral and political apply to it and by a principle of connexion of which it has not happened to me to see any notice taken elsewhere in regard to the order to be given to the several groups of acts converted by prohibition and punishment into offences considerations of a moral and political concurred with those of a logical nature in producing the determination that was pursued where of one of two objects a perfect conception may be conveyed without any conception conveyed or entertained of the other while the converse of this does not hold good—give the first place to that one the conception of which is thus independent of that of the other on the opposite plan two objects will unavoidably be spoken of at the same time the one directly and explicitly the other indirectly and in the way of allusion and confusion will thus throw its clouds on the whole texture of the discourse to the domain of logic belongs this rule by it has arithmetic been guided in the order given to the numbers in the numeration table apply this to the matter of a penal code of offences against individuals—against individuals determinate and assignable—the mischief is intelligible to all intelligible in all its shapes upon the bare mention of it intelligible without any the least need of reference to offences against this or that particular class of not assignable individuals or to any of those against the government or the nation at large the offences of which two last divisions have for their common character that the mischief produced by them affects not any one individual or class exclusively but if it affects any one affects the whole of offences of the first description the mischief may be said to be actual in the case of those of the two last descriptions considered as such it is only in tendency that the act is mischievous in this or that instance the mischief which is but in tendency may indeed have actual mischief to any amount for its accompaniment in which case the author may be dealt with accordingly but when it stands clear of any such accompaniment the demand whatever it be for prohibition and punishment may still remain of that mischief which is in tendency only the correspondent actual mischief forms the sole and indispensable basis from those of which the mischief is but in tendency suppose it ascertained that no actual mischief can in any shape result the ground for placing them   0 in the catalogue of punishable offences vanishes note that to be actual mischief must consist either of pain or loss of pleasure pain in some determinate and assignable shape or loss of pleasure in some determinate and assignable shape such being the order prescribed in the first instance by logic observe now the consequence of it with regard to morals and politics at and from the very commencement of a code commencing in this way—every man perceives at first view the benefit it has conferred on him the care which the legislator has taken of his interest—of his happiness let a man but open the code by the very first glance he casts upon it a conception thus satisfactory how can it fail to be conveyed to him what man is there that has not in some shape or other a body a mind a reputation property a condition in life in the prohibition and punishment attached to acts by which through injury done to those several possessions of his his happiness is liable to be diminished he sees the protection which in these several shapes has been provided for him by the law in the legislator he beholds a kind guardian to whom his welfare in all its shapes has been an object of allcomprehensive and laborious solicitude instead of offences against individuals let offences against the government now occupy the first place everywhere but in the angloamerican united states religion being seized on and converted into a stateengine employed in giving support to the power of the rulers—the care for the support of religion in this character will in some way or other be combined with the care for the support of government the protection he now sees afforded to whom does he see it afforded to himself no but either to an almighty being to whom it cannot be of any use or to another man or set of men among whom he is not included here then you see sir the advantages that have just been brought to view vanish returning now to the former case—suppose the legislator by what considerations soever induced whether by the above logical rule or by the political consideration—regard for the greatest happiness of the greatest number—suppose him to have in his penal code begun with giving the first place to the class of offences against individuals this point settled suppose him to have taken up the subject of offences against government the government in question is suppose a monarchy chief functionary the monarch what follows seeing in this man neither more nor less than a man he would perhaps as in the angloamerican united states have regarded the security of this man as being sufficiently provided for when provided for in exactly the same way as that of all other men if not he would at any rate have inquired whether in this case any difference should be made and if yes what and on which side and on what account and so on in regard to all classes of persons functionaries or not by whom or in whose behalf he found privilege in any shape enjoyed unfortunately in those same codes of greatest credit and reputation in europe p xii drawn as they have all been by men employed by a supremely ruling one and themselves belonging to the class of the ruling few—and of course careless to what degree they made sacrifice of the interests of the subject many to the interests real or supposed of the said ruling few and supremely ruling one—in these exclusively consulted codes no such simple and natural order of insertion has been observed how should it have been no such order would have suited the purposes the ordainers of them had in view in my view of the matter title to regard is determined and degree of regard measured by the numeration table two have title to twice as much regard as one three to thrice as much and so on accordingly in my penal code my first care being to make provision in the most immediate way for the security of all—thus it is that no objection to this plan of arrangement presenting itself nor any special use as derivable from any different one it is by the cluster of arrangements employed in the establishment of this security that the first place in that same code is occupied and thus by this political consideration has the order originally suggested by the logical consideration in my view of the matter been confirmed not so in the view taken of the matter by the bespeakers nor consequently by the makers of those same supremely accredited codes in their view of the matter title to regard is determined and measured by dignity a sort of phantasm created by power in the imagination of imbecility for its own use shaping their practice to this theory—in the ruling one—in the monarch who is upon earth—they have seen the vicegerent and express image of the person of him who is in heaven in him they have seen the one for whose use all others were created in the subject many those who were created for his use in him they have seen all excellence in them all depravity between the one and the other they have seen an intermediate class composed of individuals whose respective places in the scale of excellence moral and political are in correspondence with their places in the conjunct scales of power opulence and factitious dignity—endowments derived all of them from the grace and pleasure of the ruling one of this theory an immediate practical consequence always more or less acted upon and sometimes even avowed is—that in the instance of every person to whom the protection     is afforded the punishment employed in the affording it ought to be high in proportion to the height of the level occupied by him as above in that same conjunct scale looking then in the first place to the heavenly monarch—in his instance taking for his opulence that which it has pleased him to make over to his professional servants they behold power and dignity infinite looking in the next place to his earthly representative they behold power opulence and dignity next to his in both cases the practical consequence follows as of course as for the protection of the mind the reputation and the peculiar property of the heavenly monarch—so for the protection of the body and condition in life as well as of the mind reputation and property of his earthly representative—no punishment can be too afflictive buonaparte and his draughtsmen saw in every regicide a paricide a more convenient vision has been seldom seen in this same vision the gentlemen in question i see have been partakers and so—to beget and to kill to feed and to exhaust to clothe and to strip to love and to despise are one and the same thing buonaparte—o most puissant prince—buonaparte upon looking round him found he had begotten all whom he had left unslaughtered thus it is that rhetoric—oever ready prostitute—prostitutes herself to despotism by the purely logical consideration if i remember right was the order of consideration and expression here in question suggested to me—by the clearness which not only in this but in all other cases is the result of that course of consideration in which things connected with one another are taken as far as may be one at a time ample at the same time was the confirmation which in the present case the logical rule was found to receive from those considerations of a moral and political nature which belong in a peculiar if not exclusive manner to this same case intimate accordingly in this case is the connexion between the logical and the political considerations by the logical rule it stood ordained that in the arrangements by which protection and security were in the way in question afforded all men without exception should come in in the first place before any place was assigned to any such arrangements as those by which additional protection and security came to be afforded to men standing in this or that particular situation but thereupon comes the political consideration—in so far as distinction and opposition between interest and interest has place by whom is presented the best title to regard at the hands of the impartial legislator by whom is presented the title to a preference by the few as such or by the many as such the question once put the answer could not be dubious the question itself presented it to me it was presented between  0 and  0 years ago by i know not what little pamphlet of dr priestleys by your cortes ad      it was adopted and in articles   and    of your constitutional code it stands established and thus it is that not only for order of consideration and discourse but for title to regard and degree of regard you have at once a standard and an example in the numeration table a plainer a more universally known a more familiar a more universally understood a more indisputable standard—can it be desired judging of everything by this standard i saw that if to any one more than another power in any shape were given to be exercised over the rest it could not consistently with this standard principle be given to him in any other character than that of agent and trustee and in that shape servant to the rest hence for as much as in respect of money power or factitious dignity nothing could by any legislator be done for or in relation to those same servants of the people but at the expense of their principals—hence in my view of the matter judging by that standard for these same servants so long as the interest of their principals was equally well provided for too little could not be done not so in the view taken of the matter by the gentlemen in question—not so in the view taken of the matter in any of those most accredited codes of civilized europe from the virtue and wisdom of which a portion more or less considerable of theirs had been imbibed no sir on that subject—as everybody knows and feels—on that subject everywhere but in the angloamerican united states the universal and allruling notion is—that for these same servants it is not possible to do too much and accordingly the first thing that is done—everywhere done—for them is—to declare them masters masters yes and in such sort masters that the character in which their natural masters thus converted into servants ought to be considered is—that of so many animals of an inferior nature created by an allbenevolent and allwise being for the use of these same selfconstituted masters their masters or as the more polished language of english aristocracy sometimes phrases it their betters such then are the beings who in the first place together with whatever belongs to them are to be taken into account spoken of and provided for in the first place are stationed their peculiar endowments—the power the wealth the factitious dignity with which they are invested the peculiar endowments together with the peculiar protection employed in affording a peculiar degree of security to the possessors of these same endowments the peculiar protection and security and thence the peculiar punishments by the terror of which all hands that might otherwise be tempted to make any motion by which the enjoyment derived from these endowments might be lessened are to be arrested under the late nonconstitutional monarchy the object of the first care not to say the only     care was the providing this security for the monarch and his particular connexions under the existing constitutional monarchy the objects of gentlemens first care is—the power of that illustrious class of citizens of whom they themselves constitute so distinguished a part the care taken of this object is in their language the care taken for the liberty of the nation their next care is for the power and person of the monarch who from the condition of absolute has by a precedent care been removed into the situation of constitutional king correspondent in the eyes of the bespeakers and framers of the most accredited codes of cultivated europe and consequently in the eyes of the authors of this which is so soon to be numbered among those same accredited codes—correspondent to the excellence of the illustrious masters is the depravity of those inferiors who in the character of servants are placed under their rule inbred is the refractoriness of those unworthy servants wilful and perverse the blindness by which that excellence is concealed from their perception insolent obstinate and incessant the efforts they ever have been and ever will be in the habit of making in the flagitious endeavour to withdraw their necks from under the too well deserved and altogether necessary yoke for stopping a propensity thus perverse what chance can be afforded by any image less appalling than that of the dance of death perpetually staring them in the face full of these ideas sword and axe in hand gentlemen fall to work accordingly they begin with killing all those who in any view and in particular in the view of reinstating the king in the defalcated portion of his power have the audacity to meditate any diminution of theirs to make any alteration in any of all those things that have been done in their favour when these are despatched the next set to be disposed of are—all those by whom anything has been done to the prejudice of the sovereign partnership concern against the person or authority of the original parties whose names stand at present but second in the firm death on the one hand for all those by whom towards the restoration of the old authority anything shall be attempted or conspired to be attempted in diminution of the new death on the other hand for all those by whom for the augmentation of the new authority or any other purpose anything shall be attempted or conspired to be attempted in further diminution of the old when under chapter first of this title one half of the people whose greatest happiness is gentlemens object are disposed of and under chapter ii the other half what will be the number left alive—for the solution of this question no very deep skill in arithmetic seems necessary for all this riddance though if life be worth anything nothing surely can afford a justification the wisdom of the most accredited codes of cultivated europe at any rate—leaving out of the case the most celebrated of any of them—the tuscan—affords it must be confessed but too natural a cause and not only but too natural a cause but in so far as on the part of those in whose hands the care of the happiness of millions is intrusted blind imitation affords an excuse but too good an excuse true it is that for giving security in its several shapes to the whole number of those of whom the community is composed appointment must be made of some men in particular to whom in various capacities and ranks this occupation shall in a more especial manner be assigned not less true is it that nothing could be more palpably absurd and mischievous than such a denial if to those by whom security is thus afforded to others that security which is necessary for themselves should in any shape or in any degree be denied but even supposing what is more easily supposed than proved that in the instance of these trustees any additional security over and above what is given to them as principals is necessary still it will remain to be shown by any one who thinks he can show it what use there can be in setting this ultrasecurity to stand first how naturally and frequently does the mischief aimed at by injustice recoil upon itself how natural and frequent an effect of the too much is the too little when it is in no other character than that of a member of the community that a public functionary applies for protection against injury—all affections all hearts and all hands are on his side when it is in a distinct and privileged character many hands as well as many more hearts will pretty certainly be against him well would it be for the country whatever it be if on this occasion instead of many one might say all this however is unhappily not the case since be the distinction ever so absurd and mischievous and in consequence of it the conduct of the functionary in question ever so unwarrantable so it is that in every country by the laws of which such distinctions are made community of sinister interests will have secured to him partisans and supporters in vast multitudes and interestbegotten prejudices—the prejudices begotten by that same sinister interest—perhaps still more so much for theory look now sir to experience in the angloamerican united states no instrument of ultra security has place none whatever and what is the consequence that the security enjoyed by the functionaries in question—that the security enjoyed by the community of which they are functionaries—is the less entire no but that it is much more so take for example the chief for injury done or intended in any shape to the     president of the united states no greater or other is the punishment provided than for the like injury to the man if there be a man who blacks his shoes what is the consequence is he the less safe not to speak of asia exists there in all europe a monarch by whom anything like equal security is enjoyed oh no nor ever will or can there be the monarch is a mark for every madman to shoot at and not only for every madman but for every man who in his own eyes has reason to regard himself as suffering injury at the hands of the uncontrolled arbiter of his fate and to what place can the monarch betake himself without being encompassed by multitudes to whose minds notions to that effect may for aught he can tell be incessantly present vainly would any one say—ours is a monarchy and in a monarchy these distinctions together with a thousand others in the same strain are indispensably necessary this necessity so lightly assumed how comes it to be known to you what ground have you assigned what ground can you assign for it absolutely none—what experience there is is all against you experience for you there is none suppose it were even as you say what would it prove only that monarchy is no fit form of government and that this part of your constitution stands in need of alteration and certainly not the less for the slaughter which gentlemen have been employing in their endeavours to prevent it were they aware—were they not aware—of the importance of the limitation when to the field of that legislative wisdom to which theirs disdained not to have regard they assigned the limits which europe has for its bounds be this as it may had america—free and liberalized america—been within their view and taken for their model—sir you see the consequence taking europe for their model they violated the spanish constitution in its most essential and fundamental articles they took for their end in view how erroneous soever may have been their conception of it the greatest happiness of the ruling few—of that class of which they themselves are such distinguished ornaments had they taken for their guide those essential articles of their own constitution they would have taken for their end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number and no such articles as those with which these two chapters of their code are filled would have been found in it sir it was their own doing—it was their own spontaneous doing—the heaping up all this pile of so much worse than useless punishments by no article in the constitutional code were they compelled to it by the code the powers were indeed created and conferred but as to the punishments if any which should be employed in the endeavour to give effect to those powers—on this head nothing can i discover but a blank nor because accordant with and confirmed by a principle of a democratical character is there anything in this plan of arrangement—in this order of insertion—that should prevent it from being pursued in a monarchy in a monarchy limited or even absolute in a word under any other form of government for some time to come it is not by every nation that so much as the desire of living under a democratical government will be entertained and of those by which it is entertained it is not by every one that the faculty of giving to any such desire its gratification will be possessed but to no government—democratical limitedly monarchical or unlimitedly monarchical—to no government however extensively and constantly determined in its conduct by regard for the separate and sinister interest of the ruling few and the supremely ruling one to no government can it naturally be a discordant and unacceptable spectacle to see the rule of action—at any rate this part of it—not only intelligible to all but satisfactory to all in no government can it be otherwise than satisfactory to its rulers to see their own personal security standing on its steadiest and surest basis order of insertion is one thing classification and nomenclature—for they are scarcely separable classification and nomenclature by natural philosophers commonly comprehended under one name method with or without regard to order of precedence another of a rationale formed by the undiscontinued application of the so often mentioned fundamental principle of your constitution a correspondent method of classification and nomenclature is a natural not to say an inseparable accompaniment and instrument but to the gentlemen in question even without still more with this accompaniment a rationale would have been a bridle and as i have so often had occasion to say gentlemen did not want a bridle no man in their situation does natural and rational are attributes by which with incontestible and even with exclusive propriety a method thus deduced and accompanied may assuredly stand designated this natural and rational method—apply it to the penal code you will in so doing have gone the greatest part of the way towards the applying it to the two others according to the abovementioned fundamental principle offences is the name given in common to all acts which being regarded as productive of a balance on the side of mischief are taken for the subjects of prohibition and thence of punishment mischief is by the amount of it a defalcation made from the greatest happiness of the greatest number and to be real it must as abovenoticed consist exclusively either of pain in some determinate shape or of loss of pleasure in some determinate shape and in both its forms or else it will not be prevented in act it must as above throughout the whole of the field be opposed while as yet but in tendency     opposed and to a considerable extent by means of punishment according to this principle offences there can be none but what are offences against individuals—acts which in act or in tendency are productive of mischief in this or that determinate shape to individuals to individuals—meaning rational beings to which if it be agreeable to you to add to a certain extent irrational ones i would with pleasure so they be sensitive ones join with you as we have begun to do in england were it only for the sake of rational ones to these i am perfectly ready to add the almighty being the very instant you have shown me that he is susceptible of pain or loss of pleasure through human agency and at the same time unable to afford sufficient protection and security to himself so likewise but always under the same condition to fictitious entities such as religion order good order political order public order or as many other orders as gentlemen please in short but always under the same condition to fictitious entities of any other sort and in any number that they please in act or in a distinctly perceptible and assignable way in tendency every act if fit to be by means of punishment erected into an offence and thus placed upon the list of punishable offences must according to the above principle be an offence against an individual or individuals—an act productive of mischief as above to an individual or individuals but at the time of committing the act these individuals may either be assignable or unassignable when unassignable they may be either comprised or not within a class less extensive than the class composed of the whole community—for instance a class constituted by professional occupation or a class constituted by vicinity of residence and thus you have the three first and allcomprehensive divisions of offences namely i private offences—offences the mischief of which applies to assignable individuals ii semipublic offences—offences the mischief of which is in its range confined to such unassignable individuals as are comprehended within a particular class iii public offences—offences the mischief of which extends in tendency to all the individuals to all without exception or limitation of whom the whole community is composed note that in an offence of a semipublic or public character a private offence will frequently be included looking now to offences against individuals you will find them distinguishable into offences against person offences against reputation offences against property and offences against condition in life and if to any individual mischief be done in any shape you will i believe sir find it comprehendible under one or other of those divisions offences against person you will find a convenience in distinguishing into offences injurious to body and offences injurious to mind not that body and mind are ever seen walking—the one one way the other the other—nor that pain or loss of pleasure can affect the body without affecting the mind—but that in some cases the mischief will have its seat in the body only from thence affecting the mind while in others it will have its seat only in the mind looking to offences against reputation you will i must confess see in reputation nothing more than a fictitious entity but the adoption of it was found necessary for the giving an intelligible and familiar appellation to a class of mischievous acts which could not otherwise have been distinctly designated and as this reputation is the reputation of a man and a man is a real entity you are not by this denomination put in danger of being sent in chase of clouds or shadows as in those other cases and though of the mischief done to a mans reputation the seat cannot be elsewhere than either in his body or his mind nor commonly very distinctly perceptible elsewhere than in his mind—yet for the reason just mentioned you will i believe find a convenience in distinguishing it from all other offences the mischief of which has its seat in the mind looking at offences against property—in property if all the shapes into which it has been commonly cast are to be comprised you will see objects for the declaration or conception of which you will not find it possible to speak or even think without making use of the fictitious entities which on this occasion in such abundant variety the authors of language have been under the necessity of creating for the purposes of discourse you will see—not only real entities—things styled immoveable relatively immoveable portions of our evermoving planet—and those other real entities styled things moveable—but the fictitious entities styled services and rights of way and rents and tolls and annuities and so forth without end but still by no such fictitious entities sir will you be put in any danger of being led away from the consideration of the real and only really existing mischief—pain or loss of pleasure of body or mind or both—the only really existing mischief that can be occasioned or be in a way to be occasioned to one or more of the really existing and human beings whose good fortune it is to have you for their representative and who in a shape so honourable to you have a sort of property in your services in the very best shape in which it is in your power to render them looking to offences against condition you will find the like necessity and thence the like justification for the nominal existence given to this fictitious entity for though to a mans condition in life you will find that no mischief can be done by any act any otherwise than through the medium of his property or in some shape or other of his reputation or of both for of the shapes in which property has place property in human service dependent in many     instances in no small degree on reputation is one—nor then without producing pain or loss of pleasure to body or mind or both—yet here as before you will find in but too great abundance acts the effects of which may with truth be said to be mischievous to a man in respect of his condition in life but which at the same time having or not having their seat in the mind could not be said to be mischievous to him in respect of property in any particular shape or in respect of reputation alone though perhaps they are so at the same time in respect of reputation and in respect of property in a variety of shapes the case being that on account of some peculiarities in the nature of the mischief or in the manner in which it is produced it requires to be distinguished by a separate denomination from the aggregate stock of the offences comprehended in the beforementioned denominations take for examples conditions genealogical such as the pair of correlative conditions belonging to husband and wife together with the several others which springing out of them constitute the genealogical tree add those other conditions which without being genealogical may be styled domestic such as those of master and servant add again those other conditions which like the former are not political and are still of a private nature but are not necessarily correlative i mean those composed of occupations of all sorts other than those of public functionaries considered as such add lastly conditions political all of them corresponding to and constituted by so many modes of servantship as towards the community at large considered in the character of master of these last the whole aggregate may be divided into public and semipublic as in the case of offences in all these several cases the chief value of the condition in respect of benefit and in respect of burthen will be composed of services in so far as the rendering of the services is obligatory the possession of the condition will involve a right to the services in question a sort of property of which those services are the subjectmatter in this case for example are the correlative conditions abovementioned in so far as the rendering of the services to which the occupation owes its value is not obligatory the value of it consists mostly of a sort of chance for obtaining free services in exchange for other free services in this case are the various occupations exercised by workmen and traders of all classes in this process sir if your patience has been persevering enough to carry you through with it you have seen logic employed in classification and thereby in theory in payment for this labour you will now i hope have the satisfaction of seeing some good effects producible from it in practice in so far as in a system of penal law the denominations thus employed afford as above indication of the nature of the mischief in consideration of which the acts in question have been placed upon the list of punishable offences—of the nature of the mischief and consequently of the existence of mischief in that shape—in so far as this indication is afforded every denomination by which no such indication is afforded will mismatch with them and on the part of the acts which it denominates present a sort of presumptive proof of want of title to be admitted into the company of the rest in such a method every such instructive denomination stands therefore as a sort of security against the admission of any group of acts in which no determinately mischievous character can be found take away the security give admittance to acts by the denominations of which no such indication is afforded—put aside the only natural and rational method—then comes in as above—then comes in as of course—some unnatural irrational and arbitrary one then come in at every turn—as sinister interest or interestbegotten prejudice dictates—acts which not being productive of mischief to any such amount that the mischief of the least punishment by which any diminution could be produced in it would not be still greater—or even not being productive of mischief to any amount at all—afford no sufficient warrant for the application of punishment for the designation of these same innoxious acts—since by the supposition no apt word expressive of mischief in any shape as being produced by them is to be found—the words employed are such as are designative of this or that vague generality to which every man feels himself at liberty to attach whatever interpretation best suits his views every man and in particular every man who has it in his power to give to his own interpretation the desired effect of these convenient generalities sir would you see an example examples more than one—examples sufficient for illustration—may be seen in the system of classification and designation employed by the committee witness title i offences against political order title iii offences against public order title vii offences against buonas costumbres which i presume is a translation given to the latin phrase bonos mores and which i infer from the use thus made of it is in spain become familiar to unlearned ears in english good customs—the literal translation of the spanish words taken in their separate sense would not serve—offences against good customs—would not pass still less would good manners—another of the literal translations of the two latin words in a boarding school yes but in a penal code offences against good manners would not pass to an english ear by neither of these phrases would a sufficiently plausible pretence be afforded for penal visitation—to use a recently invented religiously and hypocritically cruel rhetorical phrase accordingly when for the affording by political power a gratification to this or that     personal or individual antipathy a formulary is wanted the latin phrase—bonos mores by which the obnoxious act is enveloped in a cloud of convenient mystery—offers a formulary the suitableness of which has been proved by experience as to the phrase offences against good customs it carries upon the face of it an objection against itself because a and b chose to do a thing why lay hold on c who does not chose to do it and punish him for not doing it and so in case of omission or forbearance what ground can the mere exercise of liberty by one man or any number of men afford for imposing obligation on any other of this and of every other objection but that of meaning nothing and thence anything—anything which it may suit the purpose of tyranny to make it mean the word order stands altogether clear allow to the legislator the unlimited use and application of but this one word nothing more is wanted to fit him out in the completest manner in the character of a despot and that despot a tyrannical one the acts which draw down upon innocent men the vengeance of the most atrocious tyrants upon record can there have been any one of them that was not an offence against order against the order established by the tyrant by whom the man was punished for them tiberius nero domitian commodus caracalla charles the ninth of france lewis the fourteenth of france philip the second of your own country and belgium—philip the second not to come down any lower—in the word order had not they for punishing every one of those whom it was their pleasure to punish as good a warrant as gentlemen have given themselves by the use made of this word in their code by the word good when prefixed as it sometimes is to the word order intimation of something like a reference to public opinion seems conveyed but not even this little softening would gentlemen vouchsafe to apply to the despotism it proclaims let me not sir be misconceived what i do not mean to say is—that among the acts to which a title is given by them with the word order in it there are not any to which it is fit that the character of punishable offences should be given on the contrary there are perhaps not many to which if it depended upon me i myself should not give that character all i mean to say is—that if an acts being an offence against order is admitted as a sufficient warrant for placing it on the list of punishable acts the consequence will be—that along with acts affording a fit demand for punishment others that afford no such demand may in any number be slipt into the list with little difficulty by a natural and rational method as above described not only is a bar opposed to acts that are not mischievous but so likewise is a thread afforded for the investigation and finding out of such as are in a method thus formed by the application which on each occasion is made of one and the same simple principle—in every such method by the relation which every offence bears to every other and to the whole catalogue of offences you are no less naturally led to the discovery of undue omissions than to that of undue insertions in a catalogue of offences in the formation of which no such instrument of indication has been employed there may be gaps to any amount unfilled to any extent modifications of maleficence to which no penal bar has been opposed deficiences ever so numerous and so extensive and yet no indication of them afforded and as it is in regard to offences themselves so is it in regard to other extensive objects for the application of which a demand is created by the catalogue of offences witness causes of satisfaction for injury causes of justification aggravation extenuation causes for pardon total and partial formal and virtual thus not only in a direct way by the application made of it to each particular case but in an additional way by means of the method to which it gives birth does the principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number cover the whole field of legislation with its salutary influence by a method deduced from this principle a bar is in every part opposed to the introduction of arbitrary arrangements in any shape a thread afforded for the investigation and introduction of suitable ones and in every part information given of the design pursued throughout the whole and of the relation which each part bears to every other by no mode of arrangement not deduced from that allvivifying and alldirecting principle can any such satisfaction be afforded in every part you see groups of offences for the insertion of which no reason is visible in the whole you see a receptacle into which for the purpose of giving to them this disastrous effect acts of any description—acts the most purely innocent—may with equal propriety for anything that appears be inserted no sir without a good method for your penal code no good penal code can you have without a rationale deduced from the fundamental principle of your constitutional code—greatest happiness of greatest number—no good method can you have gentlemen saw before them a method of which the principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number—the polar star of your and their constitutional code—was the object of actual and perpetual observation why would not they employ it the answer is obvious and but too uncontrovertible because it would not suit their purposes   example fourth and last all spaniards put under martial law in the preliminary discourse p xviii the jurisdiction of the military courts continues they say on their plan confined to military offences that is to say so they add     by way of explanation to infraction and transgression of military discipline and ordenanza in english order or ordinances i cannot absolutely take upon me to say which for a promise satisfactory enough this promise but how is it performed answer by placing the civil authorities in subordination to the military and in particular by making military men in so far as it shall please them to come into conflict with nonmilitary men judges in their own cause there sir you see the position now for proof turning to preliminary title chapter xiii articles         i find as follows— reserved equally igualmente for the military authority and jurisdiction in quality of military offences are the following— firstly acts of disrespect los desacatos or violence committed by any person whatsoever against military men who are found que se hallen meaning it is hoped only at the time of their being oocupied in an armed state in military service without this limitation in point of time—a limitation which under this wording a judge may apply or not apply as he feels disposed—any person whatsoever may be punished in a military manner by a military man for any act deemed by him an act of disrespect towards a military man secondly those offences which are committed in like manner tambien by any person whatsoever either within the quarters ridingschools magazines and other military edifices or to the damage of any effects which are therein kept thirdly acts committed by any person whatsoever in aid of a foreign enemy by this third clause compared with title ii chapter i articles from     to     a fair sparring match might seem to be set on foot between judicatories military and civil on this part of the field but as the hands of the civilians it has been or will be seen are tied behind them no mutual bruises need be apprehended now then sir—on any account whatever—by behaviour ever so bad or by behaviour ever so meritorious—suppose a nonmilitary man to have rendered himself obnoxious to a man or to a certain body of men in the military service under the second clause if by any means they can contrive to get him at any time within their quarters whatever may be their quarters or when they are upon a march or in short upon duty anywhere—what is the injury it will not be in their power in virtue of this article to inflict on him and without possibility of redress—but no they need not be at any such trouble let him be where he will they have but to pick a quarrel with him—to bestow on him any such treatment as may have the effect of drawing from him words of a disrespectful nature he is thereby placed at their disposal a judge upon the bench—suppose an occasion to present itself in which it may appear to him matter of duty to express in relation to the conduct of any man of the military order any such sentiment of disapprobation as a judicatory composed of men of that same order shall be pleased to regard as being expressive of disrespect this judge if he be a person persona—this judge—though he be of the highest order of judges nay the minister of justice himself—is he not sir by this article placed no less absolutely at their mercy than the meanest citizen in all these several cases not only is the judicatory to be military the punishment is to be so likewise the association is formed by igualmente—one of the instruments of entanglement which the genius of confusion under the guise of the genius of eloquence has contrived to put into gentlemens hands by this instrument it is—by their igualmente—lodged as it is in article    —by this it is that ere we can obtain an adequate comprehension of what is done by this same article     we are made to go back to article     in which article the first word i see is a tambien by which i am sent further back to the two first articles of the same   th chapter namely articles     and     which same article     has nothing to do with the subject being confined to ecclesiastical persons and ecclesiastical offences for this same article     conceived as it is in general terms seems to be inserted by way of ornament the general terms not adding as far as i can perceive anything to the mass of the more particular arrangements which follow it of the words which the also—tambien or in like manner in article     serve to introduce—the following in so far as my interpretation of them is correct is a translation as literal as possible reserved to the military authority and jurisdiction is the cognizance and chastisement castigo of the offences delitos culpas y faltas which contrary to their discipline     respectively military persons commit in the word castigo may be seen the demand created for the reference thus made from the    th to this same    th article for thus it appears that by this word as inserted in     and by the word igualmente in article     applied to and ingrafted upon this same article    —not only is the judicatory by which persons not military are in these cases to be tried appointed to be a military judicatory but as i set out with saying the punishments which they are to suffer are appointed to be military punishments note that by being thus subjected to the military authority as exercised by courts martial the civil judges of all classes are subjected to the arbitrary power of the monarch for in the constitutional code by article     number the  th to the monarch it belongs to command the army and navy and to appoint the generals and admirals under which provision must be understood to be comprehended though forgotten to be expressed the removal of them or else i do not understand how the command given to him over them can be exercised—if not removeable a commander in chief when once appointed will be absolute for this subjection of the civil judicatories to the arbitrary power of the king—for this subjection thus established in an indirect way through the medium of his necessarily arbitrary authority over the military judicatories the constitution and the people would not it is true be much the worse if those same civil authorities were in a direct way in a state of equally effectual subjection to that same power but this is not the case for by that same article     number  th it is not by the king alone that the magistrates magistrados including i suppose judges of all the civil and criminal tribunals are to be nominated but by the king at the presentation of the council of state in the appointment of the members of which by articles         he has no other share than the choice of the number in question out of thrice the number presented to him by the cortes thus as to appointment and as to removal magistrates and judges says article     judges being now inserted—for thus are your immutable laws drawn up magistrates and judges cannot be deprived of their situations without cause legally proved and stated in their sentence nor suspended unless in consequence of accusation legally instituted whether for words deemed wanting in respect applied to a soldier a court martial shall be pleased to flog or beat the judges of the supreme court of justice erected under article     of the constitutional code or content themselves with imprisoning them—regard for the constitution will i make no doubt suffice for preventing the military judge from signing either a sentence of forfeiture or so much as an order of suspension in their case but by any such regard for the constitution it does not appear to me how the mischief if any from the subjection of the civil judicial authorities to the arbitrary will of the monarch—through the medium of his courtsmartial as above—will be very materially diminished was it by design sir was it by inadvertence that the sort of arrangement you have seen was proposed by gentlemen for your adoption in either case what say you to it in either case at the elections before the next cortes but one what will their constituents say to it nothing of professional or other prejudice—nothing of exaggeration sir—need you fear in me knowing something of your nonmilitary judicatories in so far as they are upon the roman models—knowing something of these and next to nothing of your military ones—for the present and until your judicial establishment and system of judicial procedure have been put upon a footing very different from that in which i understand them to stand at present—supposing professional sympathies and antipathies out of the question i have more confidence in the military than in the nonmilitary ones why because the military ones have at any rate this distinguishing character in their favour so at least i take for granted namely that by delay vexation and factitious expense they have nothing to gain while the nonmilitary ones have everything to gain to real justice—not only among us as far as little less than sixty years of pretty close attention has enabled me to judge but among you as far as depends either upon the system of procedure or the ordinary dispositions of the judge—to real justice the citizen has i should expect to find a better chance in a military judicatory than in the highest ordinary judicatory that is not military if i have     not been misinformed in the case of offences of an insurrectionary nature leaving or not leaving the cognizance of them to be shared by the nonmilitary judicatories you have by a recent decree given the cognizance of them to judicatories of a military cast—to judicatories in which whether the judges be or be not of the military profession for i know not which is the case the mode of procedure is at any rate military to me this information taken according to such conception as i was in a way to form in relation to it was i confess not unsatisfactory now said i to myself there seems a probability of a decision till now there has been no chance of this conception right or wrong my observations on judge hermosas panegyric on judicial forms and delays may help to show the grounds in the present state of civil judicature—even to give to military men the cognizance of disputes on whatever subject between nonmilitary men and military men might for aught i can say be an improvement but so long as there are judicatures not military to which the cognizance of causes of any kind continues to be intrusted—to think of intrusting to military judicatures the cognizance of causes arising out of disputes between nonmilitary men on the one side and military on the other this is what i must leave to the gentlemen in question and to the construction put by them upon the articles relative to the greatest happiness of the greatest number if the remembrance of it has not dropt altogether out of their minds among the sources of controverted points this topic relative to judicatories of exception as you may remember we have found reckoned but no ground do i on this occasion find for any such supposition as that the question whether the civil authority should be subject to the military or the military to the civil was of the number of these same controverted points unanimous as far as appears has been the opinion by which the civil authority is placed as above in subjection to the military the opinion unanimous and the propriety of it too plainly manifest to stard in any need of support from reasons sir this is going even beyond us even in our government military as under our best of kings it is become nonmilitary men have not yet been delivered up to military judicatories a servant of the king gives orders for killing us and we are killed but should a military man by whom without provocation we have been killed be called to account for it it would be in some ordinary and nonmilitary judicatory that the account would be rendered and to some nonmilitary functionary or functionaries that the giving him impunity would be consigned to the kings attorneygeneral by means of an instrument called a noli prosequi or a nolle prosequi to the chancellor with the kings signature by means of an express pardon or what is more commodious to the judge by whom the man is tried by means of a virtual pardon manufactured out of a quibble—out of some recondite rule of evidence or other rule of procedure which if it has not yet been made can at any time be made for the purpose just as penal law to any extent is in the name of common law made every day by this or that dependent creature of the king in the situation of judge without putting the legislature to the trouble we have priests to order unarmed and unoffending men with women and children to be killed and ministers with kings at their backs to reward them for so doing we have posts by the receipt of which men are entitled to receive sinecures of thousands ayear for such services all this may be done and is done but what with us remains as yet to be done is—to subject men not military for offences not military to be tried without any such formality as that of jury trial by a courtmartial composed of military officers yes sir as yet—though i cannot take upon me to promise how long it will continue so—as yet for an offence not military be it what it may—and be the individual specially injured if there be one who he may—a military man be he who he may may be tried and is tried by a judicatory not military no nonmilitary man is for any offence be it what it may tried by a military judicatory though you must have quitted paris—taking for granted that you have given directions for the transmission of my letters—not having been forbidden i give them and shall continue to give them the same direction as before one observation or two more before i quit the subject of method altogether in different places of the proposed code i see a number of articles encumbered each of them with a clause by which where the offender is a public functionary an ultrà punishment is added witness articles  0   0   0   0   0          and in short such seems to be the method pursued throughout also a separate clause to the like effect applying to ecclesiastics as if an ecclesiastic as such were not a public functionary but perhaps that title was regarded as not belonging to monks or sinecurists and in the apprehensions in which the punishments originated foreign ecclesiastics not beneficed in spain would naturally be included various are the inconveniences resulting from this practice—by it the conception and memory of individuals at large is burthened with matter with which they have no concern the bulk of the whole receives a useless increase and by a want of uniformity and correctness in the mode of expression imperfections too various to be here brought to view are liable to be produced in another part of this same code i see a compartment by the consistent and comprehensive use of which the inconvenience might at any rate have been lessened i mean—in part   title vi containing in    chapters articles   0    namely from     to     it is headed—of offences of public functionaries in the exercise of their duties offences namely delitos y culpas faltas being on this occasion as on the one above noticed omitted here then is a place into which the matter relative to public functionaries as above should naturally have had admission at any rate supposing the words in the exercise of their duties omitted as they might have been without inconvenience unhappily there is no reference from either of these places to the other the consequence is—that—ere he can be assured of his having information of the whole of the burthen for ignorance of which or any part of it he is exposed to be punished in many perhaps most instances by loss of office—a public functionary must have hunted through the whole code by the title thus given to that division of the code is not a presumption sir afforded that by the matter of it information in some shape or other was meant to be given to all the several individuals so denominated of the whole mass of the obligations respectively imposed upon them for unless it be in proportion as such information is possessed how is it that by the community at large the benefit expected from the fulfilment of these same obligations can be received the afflictive punishments appointed in proportion to nonfulfilment be avoided but if so how happens it that no reference is there made to so many other articles in which other obligations not less serious are imposed upon the same persons thus faint are the traces which in that part the proposed penal code affords of any regard for the two characteristic and fundamental articles of the constitutional code to confront with the method thus exemplified—allow me sir to submit to you the two short rules by which the disposition of the matter in the whole body of the law has been governed—in a code in the penning of which that allilluminating principle has never been for a moment out of sight rule   make known to every man what belongs to him rule   burthen no man with anything that does not belong to him would it be agreeable to you sir to see them both in a nutshell behold them then in a latin one rule   suum cuique rule   non suum nulli   make known to every man what it belongs to him to know functionary or nonfunctionary no more would i think of making a man suffer for nonobservance of an article of law unless it had been put into his hands having first been cleared of all matter in which he had no concern than i would think of punishing a child for the not having performed a lesson that had never been set him no more did i say i should have said—much less think sir of the difference as to the penal consequences a few observations—showing on the one hand the allembracing application capable of being made of these two short rules on the other hand the aspect borne towards them by this work of your illustrious colleagues—i know not sir how to forbear troubling you with be the code what it may if of the class to which the individual in question belongs mention is made he is in point of interest either concerned or not concerned in it if concerned he is so either in quality of party burthened or in quality of party favoured or in both qualities taking into mind the entire mass of the matter of law including not only that portion which at the time in question happens to be actually in existence but also whatsoever other matter there be a demand for which may eventually come to be found to have place—in a word taking into mind the whole body of the law actual and desirable together—let a man consider it with reference to the number and description of the persons affected in point of interest by the several distinguishable parts of it he will find it according to a principle of division at once natural and allcomprehensive divisible into the general code and the system or assemblage of particular codes in the general code—saving a few exceptions which on inspection will be obvious to every eye—the two opposite and correlative situations of party benefited and party burthened will be seen to belong alike to every member of the community in so far as protection is afforded him from mischief at large and in particular from whatever mischief he stands exposed to suffer from the effects of mischievous acts on the part of other men the situation a man occupies is that of party benefited in so far as coercion whether in the shape of restraint or constraint is imposed upon him—whether for the purpose of preventing him from being an instrument of mischief or causing him to be an instrument of good to other men—or for any other purposes all manner of bad purposes included—the situation he occupies is that of party burthened to the extent therefore of the whole field of the general code every man has this double interest in being acquainted with the matter of it this double cause for wishing to be acquainted with it in any particular part of it according to circumstances it may be in the one or the other capacity that the interest he thus has in being acquainted with it is greatest in the system of particular codes may be seen that one of the two great masses which in this respect presents the greatest differences persons taxed c public functionaries and parties to contracts—by these denominations are brought to view the three most extensive classes of persons who in the situation of parties specially burthened have respectively an interest in the matter of this or that code belonging to the system of particular codes     i persons taxed c by this i mean the persons of various classes that of public functionaries not excepted on whom for the benefit of the community at large or of this or that portion of it the obligation of rendering service in the shape of payment of money or any other shape is imposed in the particular codes by which taxes are imposed for the use of the community at large the several persons on whom respectively the contribution in its several shapes is imposed—these commonly with the addition of others to whom on each several occasion it happens to be in some way or other respectively connected with them—are the parties thus specially burthened the party benefited being as just mentioned the community at large where instead of the community at large the party benefited is either a particular class or a particular individual—his description receives the changes thus indicated to impose a tax c is to impose the obligation of rendering to a party of this or that description as above service in this or that shape and of service the simplest and most comprehensive shape is that which consists in the transfer of money in this one group will be comprehended it is evident a numerous and ever variable multitude of particular codes in each of which in the character of party burthened a class more or less numerous of individuals will find itself interested and in the instance of each individual there will be an assemblage of codes more or less numerous and ever variable in which he will find himself to have an interest ii public functionaries in a particular code in which anything is ordained that bears upon the situation of a public functionary or a class of public functionaries as such—the functionary in respect of any obligations imposed upon him is the party specially burthened if in return for the services expected at his hands the matter of reward in any shape is placed within his reach he is in so far a party specially favoured if to enable him to fulfil any obligation imposed upon him or in a word any service expected at his hands power in any shape is conferred on him—he is in that character also a party specially favoured in respect of the reward he may be said to be not only specially favoured but moreover specially benefited not so in the case of the power if considered as charged with the obligation and not accompanied with the reward but note that in many shapes in many eyes the power though not accompanied with any distinct reward and notwithstanding every obligation it is charged with has the effect of reward unless it be in the case of a monarchy—concomitant to power in every shape is or is supposed to be obligation in the correspondent shape—obligation to direct the exercise of the power to the rendering of the services by which the function is characterized iii persons engaged in contracts in the case of a contract the same person has place in the two opposite and correspondent characters namely that of party benefited as well as favoured and that of party burthened in the benefit expected from it each party sees the inducement by which he was led to take upon himself the burthen and unless in his eyes the benefit from the transaction had at the time been greater than the burthen he would not have engaged in it of the several conditions in life the two most important and most extensively entered into—namely that of husband and wife and that of master and servant are respectively the result of a correspondent contract in the case of father and child the two opposite and correspondent conditions—though not constituted by a contract to which the persons so related were both of them parties—derive their existence from contract namely that to which the two parents were parties and in which the child was eventually among the subjectmatters of it that on the one hand the burthen upon the conception and the memory on the other hand the burthen upon the purse may be as endurable as possible in the giving expression to this matter of the body of the law repetition will of course be to be avoided as much as possible if—in every particular code headed by the name of the class it belongs to not only the whole of the matter in respect of which a man belonging to that class is party benefited but the whole of the matter in which he is party burthened were inserted at length—no small portion would thus be to be printed twice over and the burthen as well upon the purse as upon the conception and the memory would in a proportion more or less considerable be increased in the instance of every particular class of persons—in the code the matter of which belongs to that class and on that account will require to be denominated from it—in respect of some part of that matter the individuals belonging to that class will be parties specially benefited or at any rate parties specially favoured in respect of other parts parties bound in whichever of the two characters a person is concerned it is alike requisite that information of the concern he has in it should be in his hand in the code denominated from the class to which he belongs all such information must accordingly in some shape or other be contained but in that same code what part shall be inserted at length what part no otherwise than by reference to the code or codes denominated from this or that other class concerned in that same matter in a manner which is correspondent and opposite—will depend upon particular convenience as indicated by particular circumstances note on this occasion that by one and the same group of legislative arrangements by which the man of but one class is a party burthened men of divers other classes may be parties benefited and so vice versâ     in the case of a member of the judicial establishment may be seen that of a public functionary who together with the power being charged with the obligation of contributing according to the nature and extent of his jurisdiction to the giving execution and effect to the whole body of the law or to this or that part of it is therefore—not only in a general way in his quality of member of the community at once party benefited and party bound with relation to the whole matter of the general code—but likewise with relation to the whole of the matter of the system of particular codes specially favoured in respect of the abovementioned power and specially burthened burthened with the obligation of eventually giving execution and effect to it and to that end of lodging and keeping in his mind the import of it only in proportion as it is known can the law or any part of it be an instrument of good in any shape but—with every degree of compression that can be given to it—the difficulty of giving to the knowledge of it this necessary extent cannot be inconsiderable any expedient which promises to contribute in any degree to the lessening of this difficulty—ought it sir to be left unemployed—of some of these expedients i proceed to submit to you sir a faint sketch i laws of constant concernment—laws of incidental and contingent concernment—by the distinction thus expressed one instrument for the diminution of the burthen upon the conception and the memory may be brought to view in the case of a law of incidental concernment—if the case be such that the demand for attention to it will not be presented till after a certain state of things has taken place—a state of things notice of which cannot fail of being received by the parties who whether it be in the character of party burthened or party benefited are parties concerned—a consequence is—that of this part of the code be it the general be it any particular one the expression at length need not be given in every edition of this same code by indication given in the way of reference to a more enlarged edition in which the part in question is given at length the purpose of conducting the mind to it will be answered and in the case of no individual with reference to whom this state of things never does take place will the code out of which the matter in question is omitted be incomplete first instrument of reduction or compression as above—distinction between articles of constant concernment and articles of incidental and contingent concernment this distinction applies alike to the general codes and to the system of particular codes ii second instrument of reduction or compression—distinction between main text expository matter and rationale on my plan the matter of each of the three codes—penal civil and constitutional is divided into general titles and particular titles—or into particular titles and general titles for it is not as yet altogether clear which of the two orders will in each instance be most convenient take for example the penal code in the particular titles the main text is composed principally of the denominations given to the several offences denominations followed each of them by a definition and coupled with intimation given of the punishments respectively attached to those offences in some cases to the name of a genus of offence thus marked out may be added—added in form—other more particular denominations declared to be indicative of so many species of acts contained under that genus be this as it may by every distinguishable portion of the expository matter designation will be made of some particular species of act contained within that same genus made by the very nature of the case whether mentioned or not mentioned as being made compared with the bulk of the whole the bulk of the main text will lie in a very narrow compass the particulars contained in the expository matter are employed in giving clearness and precision to the import of the name of the offence and of the definition given of it when of this expository matter a conception has once been obtained—it will thenceforward with more or less clearness correctness or completeness be suggested by the name alone still more effectually by the name with the definition added to it and the more completely this effect is produced the more effectually will the main text answer the intended purpose when the expository matter is detached from it so likewise as to the rationale the use of the definition is—to distinguish the offence defined from all objects with which it is likely to be confounded in the first place from all acts to which punishment is not meant to be attached in any shape—in the next place from acts in respect of which for the purpose of punishment or any other purposes arrangements in any way different are meant to be made take for example the offence of theft neither in the roman nor in the english law—neither by any definition that has ever been given either in the way of statute law or in the way of common law—nor by any lights afforded by reports of judicial decisions—has any clear line been ever drawn between a noncriminal taking namely on the supposition of right to do so on the one hand—and the taking by means of consent obtained by fraud on the other the expository matter will in its own way contribute to fix in the memory when once let in by the conception the idea of the true character of the offence the rationale will in another way contribute to the same desirable end but moreover conversely the effect of the association being mutual—proportioned to the clearness correctness and     completeness of the view which these instruments of elucidation have given of the object as designated by its denomination and its definition—will be the facility with which upon every occasion the import of these same instruments respectively will be recalled recalled by the denomination and definition together or even by the denomination alone in this way sir in my penal code you see three distinguishable parts contained under the head of each genus of offence the second and third—each in its own way throwing light upon the first and thus forming a useful accompaniment to it—but each of them capable of being detached from it on this plan in so far as there may be any use in separating them nothing can be more easy every printer will be competent to it if there be any such use it will be in the way of lessening the burthen the burthen whether it be on the conception the memory the pocket or the shelf not to speak of the pocket in the literal sense of both expository matter and rationale particular samples may be seen in the first of those works of mine that have been edited in french by m dumont you will assuredly neither expect nor wish sir to see anything of either of them here what the relation may be between what is said there on the subject and what i have said here i know not neither eyes nor time will admit of my looking at it other instruments of compression i employ but by any attempt to convey any conception of them here i know not what further addition might be required to a load which perhaps may already have been put aside as unsupportable you see already that either the main text alone or the main text with the expository matter may be considered as an abridgment of the whole here then you see a sort of abridgment of the legislators work an abridgment made by the legislator himself on this occasion permit me sir to observe that the legislators is the only hand by which an abridgment can be made on which any dependence can be placed with safety—can be placed without imprudence let the work at large be ever so replete with imperfections—an abridgment in which those imperfections were removed would to him who trusted to it be no less mischievous than one in which the multitude of the imperfections had in the same proportion received increase how can it be otherwise in case of litigation—not by the abridgment good or bad—not by the abridgment but by the authentic work at large—will the lot of the parties litigant be determined thus in case of statute law as to common law—in this case an abridgment is an imagination of an imagination in either case in what character is an abridgment capable of being of use only sir in that of an index an index for giving information of the places in which may be found those portions of discourse by reference to which the fate of the cause and thence of the parties will be determined an index—differing no otherwise from the sort of implement more usually designated by this name than by being more ample and cast into a logical form instead of the alphabetical in the rules suum cuique and non suum nulli is included you see sir this instruction to the legislator—so order matters that in addition to the general code in which all have a concern each one shall have—have actually in his hands—every particular code in which he has any concern and that in a state separate from every particular code in which he has not any concern the allcomprehensive survey thus and for this purpose taken of the field of legislation—the division thereupon made of the rule of action into general code and system of particular codes—was there no use in it sir was it mere theory had it no bearing upon practice no influence on the greatest happiness of the greatest number to the gentlemen in question—was it unknown sir no sir it was not it could not be unknown to them it stared them in the face it stared so strongly that they shut their eyes against it it came from the intrusive foreigner it was not of their starting it would have given them too much trouble—in a word it suited not their purpose it was put aside accordingly there sir you see the cause—no such thing was to be found in any of the most accredited codes—there sir you see a pretence such is the omission now for one little example of the consequences on my plan under the head of husband and wife in a particular code so denominated a document in which all benefits and all burthens attached by law to those two correlative conditions are set forth would be found if it depended upon me—on entrance into that contract into the hand of every man and that of every woman should a copy of it be placed or no such contract should be entered into if some time before the ceremony so much the better they would then enter into the engagement with their eyes open and not as at present blindfold an instrument of this sort—would it be less instructive less useful than a ring but rings were made before codes were made before codes were made or the press for the printing of them invented but moreover from the relations between husband and wife come eventually those between father and child of the particular code intituled law of father and child notice would accordingly be given in the particular code intituled law of husband and wife with or without intimation more or less particular of the details in the committees proposed code arrangements relative to this pair of correlative conditions have place under what head under that of offences against buenas costumbres     articles       0         offences against good morals or good customs but on or before entrance into this engagement—what man what woman should this same code pass would think of buying a copy of it and reading it even if they did set about reading it would not they to save trouble be apt to glance over the titles glancing over the titles would they see any one of them in which either the word husband or the word wife is mentioned not seeing any such title but seeing the title offences against buenas costumbres would they be led by it to expect to find in it anything that they would have more concern in after their marriage than they had before one little example more—knowing that in the code in question there is a compartment in the title of which functionaries in general are mentioned—every man to whom that denomination belongs will of course understand that in some way or other he can scarcely fail to have a personal interest in making himself acquainted with the contents but from any such title as that of offences against the liberty of the nation what is there that should lead him to make any such inference in the committees proposed code i see a division thus intituled—of the offences delitos y culpas of public functionaries in the exercise of their offices—chapters xii pages    from     to     inclusive articles    from     to     inclusive after so much said on the subject under its own name—who without notice given would expect to see anything more about it under any other name yet under other names more there is in abundance—and no warning given of it and in particular under that of offences against the liberty of the nation as above whatsoever be the benefits undertaken to be conferred on a man by any part of the law—whatsoever be the burthens imposed upon him by force of punishment—do gentlemen know of any means a man has of making himself secure—secure either of enjoying the benefit or of escaping from the punishment—without reference made to the law wherefore then did they decline taking the measure necessary for the putting this saving knowledge within every mans power wherefore—but that—either absolutely or in comparison with some nearer object—the greatest happiness of the greatest number was in their eyes an object of indifference giving to a man this double security—giving to every human being that could read it or hear it read this double security—giving to the whole body of the law all this efficiency—a service such as this would it sir be a service without value this service the intrusive foreigner would have rendered and would yet render to your nation this service gentlemen would not themselves render nor would they suffer him to render it they are spaniards to them it belongs to be apprized of all those circumstances affecting in each case the demand for legislation that are peculiar to spaniards to them yes to him not—be it so sir but by him who having complete knowledge will not make application of it or by him who having but incomplete knowledge would make application of it to the uttermost of his power—by which of the two with reference to the purpose whatever it be is most service likely to be rendered on the part of the foreigner the knowledge of the circumstances peculiar to spain was wanting relation being had to spain imperfections in any work of his would thence have been inevitable admitted but whatever would have been these imperfections could there have been on the part of the gentlemen in question any want either of the inclination or of the power necessary to the correction of them thus stood the matter at the first but at present and in future whatever wisdom it may be that in their instance composes the fruit of this indispensable local knowledge it is now visible it is seen in their proposed code and all foreigners as well as all spaniards have it before them two rules you have already sir in a nutshell permit me to slip into it one other such little pair and i have done rule   ideis iisdem verba eadem—or thus—eadem natura eadem nomenclatura of this the converse is—rule   ideis diversis verba diversa or thus—alia natura alia nomenclatura change the expression can any one avoid suspecting at least that the ideas you meant to convey are changed likewise supposing it your intention to convey different ideas could you take any other means than that of using different words if you could not then is the use you have made of different words a certificate of diversity in the ideas and this certificate is a false one if these rules be conducive to the ends of language and the opposite course repugnant to the ends of language try them sir upon the proposed code try them throughout upon that great work and see what will become of it of this i have already submitted to you a few exemplifications thus is it as i have so often had occasion to observe—thus is it sir that in every page the same unfortunate spectacle is but too visible—knees bent before the fascinating art of rhetoric backs turned upon her formal but honest sister logic good this in poets but is it so in legislators ideis iisdem verba eadem ideis diversis verba diversa—there sir you see two rules of expression two rules for the expression to be given to the matter of the law suum cuique non suum nulli—there you have two rules of distribution two rules for the distribution to be given to that same matter on the possession of which to so vast an extent the difference between happiness and misery in the instance of every human being depends proceeding thus what linnæus did for natural     history—what sauvages did for the nosological branch of medicine—that will this your troublesome correspondent do sir for legislation so far as life and faculties suffice and already though it were by nothing more than these four short rules is not some little progress made lawyers employed by the ruling few with or without cognizance taken by a supremely ruling one—lawyers linked with these their employers by a community of sinister interests—such are the men by whose particular wills governed by their particular and thence sinister interests on this as on every other occasion as far as has depended upon the state of the law the condition of the millions has been disposed of but with the exception of those violences from which the danger to every mans person and property is serious and manifest their own included—it is the interest of lawyers that the multitude of offences in all shapes should be at its maximum—in such sort as that the profit from defending the injured against the injurer and the injurer against the injured shall be so likewise thus it is that with the above exception mischief in whatever shape produced by ignorance of the law is by professional draughtsmen viewed with delight and it being to their high seated employers matter of indifference hence it is that we see it left upon the footing at which it suits the interest of the lawyer class that it should everlastingly be kept jeremy bentham letter vi on the anxiety of the legislation committee to keep the door of the cortes shut against works coming into competition with their own conditions on which sanctionment is recommended necessity of the free tone of these letters sir— such with the exception of the words in brackets was the title of this my sixth letter as announced in the first meantime the matter itself has undergone no small change of the anxiety of the gentlemen in question to keep out of the sight of their colleagues and thence of their constituents rival productions in general and in particular your humble servants actually existing works and future contingent codes you have already heard more than enough the anxiety on his part not to be so kept out of sight—this is the only anxiety which in the course of this letter will give you any further trouble before i take my leave of theirs altogether i must however submit to you in the way of contrast a short recapitulatory sketch of the principal objects to the accomplishment of which the opposite anxieties may have been observed directing themselves and the different arrangements of which the pursuit of the respective objects has been productive   my object being the greatest happiness of the greatest number—the same which in articles   and    of your constitutional code stands proclaimed as the allcomprehensive object of that official work i have on every occasion held it up to view and made application of it gentlemens object being—what i will leave to themselves or some one for them to state—they have not on any occasion as far as i can see taken any the smallest notice of it   as one means towards that same end for the purpose of securing the aptitude of the work in relation to it—namely in so far as depends upon appropriate moral aptitude on the part of the framers of the first draught and for that purpose to shut the door against all particular and thence sinister local interest backed with power sufficient to give effect to it—i make offer of a foreign hand secured by its position from all sinister interest gentlemens object being still what i will leave to some one else to name—and by that organ of impeccability to which as far as appears they trust their minds being to their own satisfaction sufficiently secured against all seduction from sinister interest—their anxiety has for an ulterior object the keeping all such troublesome intrusion as effectually excluded as possible   in further pursuit of that same end—to secure aptitude to the work—in so far as depends upon the above and the two other branches of appropriate aptitude on the part of the workman or workmen namely intellectual aptitude and active talent—another object of mine is—so to order matters that no distinguishable arrangement shall be proposed that has not for its support a distinguishable and openly expressed reason or set of reasons and this security the hand i offer is accordingly prepared to afford gentlemens object being still what i must leave to themselves or some one else to name—their anxiety is—so to order matters that no arrangement which in your nation is to have the force of law shall have any one assigned reason for its support in such sort that whether there be any reason or reasons for it at all and if yes what shall remain for everlasting a subject of unsatisfiable doubt and boundless conjecture   in further pursuit of that same end—regarding consistency of design as highly conducive not to say necessary to the attainment of it—lest while in one part the end whatever it be is pursued by one course in another part it be pursued by an indeterminately     different course—my anxiety is—that throughout the whole field the groundwork thus laid shall if possible be the work of one and the same hand gentlemens object being still what i must leave to some one else to say in a positive manner—but as far as appears to me from their own declarations coupled with the nature of their situation what may be called mutual accommodation—division of the whole stock of power and glory upon the principle of a partition treaty—their anxiety has been—to secure and they have secured accordingly to themselves and one another this same means of mutual accommodation and of the result and of the influence which if this work of theirs should become law may be expected to be exercised by it on the greatest happiness of the greatest number samples have already been brought to view and in greater number than can naturally be welcome   still in pursuit of that same end—taking into consideration with reference to works of the description in question the immensity of the demand for appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent on the part of the workman and at the same time the deplorable scantiness of the supply everywhere in conjunction with appropriate moral aptitude in the same breast—yes—everywhere spain itself forgive me sir for saying so not excepted—my strongly manifested anxiety has from the first been and continues to be to secure to your country as well as to every other now and at all times the greatest obtainable number of works of the abovementioned description by hands of the above description for those to whom it belongs to choose out of and towards the fulfilment of this wish i have laboured with as much energy as ever monopolist employed in his endeavours to secure his monopoly witness the second of my letters to emperor alexander as published in my papers on codification gentlemen in their anxiety to keep out of the way the competitor from whose intrusion most trouble seems to have been apprehended—took the measures explained in the second of these my letters to yourself sir—being such measures as promised at least equal success against all similar intruders under these circumstances despatch would naturally be in their eyes no inconsiderable object and by the principle of the division of labour applied as it appears to have been applied not only was harmony promoted but despatch likewise but enough now sir of anxieties prepare yourself for gladness whether in the honourable breasts in question any such sensation is likely to be produced by the sight of any code of my drawing you are in a condition to imagine in mine the sight of theirs has been and is a source of real satisfaction the case is—in my way of viewing the matter the tendency of this production of theirs with reference to me is—to promote in a variety of ways that intrusive design which is giving you sir so much trouble   it will to an extent more or less considerable lay open to my view those local circumstances in the exclusive knowledge of which gentlemens modesty has found a support to their claim of exclusive privilege   it thereby lays before me as well as before the nation which it is my ambition to serve a complete map of those parts of the field of law to which if to any the objection derived from foreignership can have any application spreading out the map before me it enables me on each occasion to make those references—those clear and exact references—of which you may have been seeing sir so many more examples than it can have been agreeable to any eye in the situation of yours to see   in a word it lays before me—it lays before the members of the existing cortes—it lays before their constituents—it lays before the succeeding cortes—it lays before the so deeply interested and observant nation the only existing production with which any one of those that i have in preparation has as yet to contend it is not necessary for me to attempt to affix any precise value to the use which this circumstance may be found to give to it with reference to my intrusive purpose suffice it to observe that the less the value of the production in the eyes of the nation to which it looks for support the greater will be its value with reference to the purpose of every intrusive rival actual satisfaction at seeing the code in its candidate state is one thing eventual satisfaction at seeing it in an elected state is another by the title of this letter as announced in my first you may have been prepared sir for a certain eventual satisfaction on my part even in the event of my seeing the sanction of law given to the proposed code in the exact state in which it has been the subject of all the freedom you have seen taken with it of this same satisfaction you may at the same time have observed that it is not altogether absolute and unconditional but limited by conditions more than one at that time conditions more than one i had accordingly in view but on a nearer inspection that my chance for satisfaction may be as favourable as possible i have settled with myself to put aside these same conditions all but one sanction then i say this proposed code—yes and as soon as may be if within the time the imperfections which you yourself sir have had the frankness to lay your finger upon can any or all of them be removed so much the better not to speak of any of those supposed ones which my own presumption represents itself as having given indication of but if nothing of this can be done sanction it even as it stands at present now then for the condition it is neither more nor less than this—instead of the more     commonly looked for everlasting duration give it but a temporary and that a short one when experience—and a long one need not be insisted upon—has demonstrated its usefulness then will be the time for giving to it that eternity which will be so much more to the taste of its honourable authors considering the terms in which your letter speaks of this proposed code—were i even to indulge a serious expectation of seeing this condition annexed to the passing of it i hope sir you would not find it altogether an immoderate one such is the presumptiveness of my hope it extends even to this—namely that in the endeavour to cause this condition to be annexed your influence which fame represents to me as so powerful will not be withholden that on the part of the gentlemen in question any willing consent to this effect will be given is i must confess rather too much for my hope feeling each of them on his own forehead seeing in virtue of the partition treaty each of them on that of every other those two most instructive organs which there has been such frequent occasion to touch upon—the organs of impeccability and infallibility—they will feel themselves under an incapacity of conceiving how in any such troublesome limitation there can be any use alas the closer i look into this matter the less sanguine is my hope turning to their most accredited codes whose wisdom they have made theirs i have found no precedent on which my hope can anchor itself to the best of my recollection on the foreheads of all persons concerned in the manufacturing of all these several codes servants as well as masters the two organs have been alike prominent whither then shall this same hope of mine betake itself the answer is not difficult to united angloamerica restingplace as well as cradle of all honest political hope an example then i have already in that rashly begotten and happily expired act of congress to which i have already had occasion sir to solicit your attention and to which without fear of contradiction from that ultramaria i gave or might have given the denomination of the liberticide law here sits my hope quietly for the first moment oh but cries a voice that state is a democracy ours is a monarchy it is only in a monarchy that any such organs are seen the illustrious gall by whom the organs of this class were first discovered—did not the empire of austria give him birth under the notion of promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number do not the rulers in that american seat of anarchy make the condition of that same greatest number depend upon the will of that greatest number can anything be more absurd as for us we make the condition of the greatest number—oh yes—and of all the rest—depend upon the will of one individual—one single individual without whom nothing can be done and by whom everything can be done everything so it be with that proper and necessary assistance for the purchase of which it is that we have placed at his disposal the good things of this wicked world in all requisite abundance in some countries there might be danger in such an arrangement but in ours there is none in some countries all mens first care is for themselves and their own particular connexions but in our country when a man gets into an office—if it be of a certain height he forgets he has a self belonging to him king and country are the sole objects of his care well sir be this as it may i will not deliver myself up absolutely to despair one other precedent i have in store i should have said a mine of precedents for such it is and a most abundant one it is the practice of the government under which i write rotten as it is—and hastening as it appears to me to be to a change which cannot be for the worse—sacrificing as it does on all points of contrariety the greatest happiness of the greatest number to the supposed happiness of the ruling few and the supremely ruling one—still on points on which no such contrariety has place examples of prudence the fruit of long experience are here and there to be found and this is not the least conspicuous nor the least incontestable codes it is true we have none the very word is horrible to us statutes however we have every year and every year in a heap such as would outweigh a hundred of your codes no sir not a year passes but amongst these statutes there are—i fear to say how many—for i have neither time nor eyes to count them—but i can venture to say multitudes of each of which the duration is limited to a time certain and that a short one witness even the six acts which for your information i must call by the aggregate name of the liberticide acts but which among us are sufficiently known by the more concise and merely numerical name acts which had the same object as that american act which by its death has been rendered the pride of that happy people of which during its life it was the shame even the statute on which the standing army depends for its continuance—that standing army by the dissolution of which the government would if its own fears are just be dissolved—even this statute it is called the mutiny act lives but from one year to another trust not to me sir for this ask anybody—ask our minister at your court whoever he may happen to be not that in the possession of any such expatriated court favourite you will be likely to find any such dry and bulky matter as the matter of our statutes at large but that which everybody knows you will find him knowing and for this purpose it will suffice here then sir—under a government of the determination of which on every point of conflict     to sacrifice the greatest happiness of the greatest number to that of the ruling few you cannot entertain a doubt—under this government the life of which is in its own persuasion no less inseparably attached to that of a particular law than that of meleager was to the log which somebody threw into the fire—under this government you see no such fear has place as that of mischief to itself from thus rendering the law capable of going out at the end of a twelvemonth what say they then were it only for appearance sake cannot gentlemen be prevailed upon to assign to this code some experimental duration if yes say then one year say two years and in either case from thence as is the custom with us to the end of the then next cortes you see sir how mistaken the notion would be—that between this exertion of selfdiffidence and prudence and the practice of depredation to an amount so far above anything that in your country men can have any conception of there could be anything of practical inconsistency those who require such comfort let this comfort them but methinks sir i hear you saying to me this contentment on your part is it in any degree consistent with the opinion of which such copious intimation is given in your preceding letters sir i will tell you simply how that matter stands good and evil may be considered in an absolute point of view or in a comparative compared with a greater a lesser evil is good no mass of law so bad that i would not vote for it on condition of its taking the place of a worse of the state in which the penal branch of law exists at present in your country gentlemen have in their preface—though but in the way of allusion as to a state of things out of dispute—given that account to which in the second of these letters i had occasion to allude all circumstances considered i can scarcely entertain a doubt but that in comparison with such a code even that which i have been so tediously commenting upon would be a blessing from yourself moreover i learn sir that—to an extent the precise limits of which are not known to me but which appears not to be a narrow one—the existing atrocities alluded to fail of receiving execution and effect here then is my hope and my consolation of the existing code the articles which in their view are unfit to receive execution have to a considerable degree actually failed of receiving it an inference i indulge in is this of the projected code the articles which in my view are unfit to receive execution would to an amount more or less considerable in the event of its becoming law be in that same case in a certain state of the law the existence of the human species depends upon the degree of execution given to the law or at any rate the more exact the execution the greater is the happiness of the greatest number in the community in question in this state is the law for example in the angloamerican united states notwithstanding the remnant of that poisonous matter which was originally imported from the augean stable on the other side of the water and which the lawyers who fatten upon it still keep on the penal and civil part of the field unexpelled in another state of the law the existence of the species depends upon the nonexecution of the law and the consequent impotence of the ruling tribe of the ruling few under the supremely ruling one in this state for example is the law in a country which it would be superfluous to name carried into full execution and effect libel law would of itself suffice for the extirpation of the inhabitants for the conversion of all dwellings into jails of all the inhabitants into jailors or prisoners and—by giving this destination to all those on whose productive labour themselves and their fellowcountrymen depend for subsistence—substituting starvation to existence in your country though utterers and readers of libels all newspapers without exception included are not so numerous as in the one just alluded to laws i cannot doubt might be found by the aggregate virtue of which if fully executed an equally complete clearance would be effected wherever roman law has reigned—in addition to a functionary by whom under his own name power of pardoning applicable to offences in general has been avowedly possessed and exercised—other functionaries there are by whom without the name that same power has been possessed and exercised where the judicatories have not possessed the power of giving execution to penal laws of their own motion—nor without being called upon by a servant of the monarch in the situation of prosecutorgeneral—the whole of this covertly pardoning power has had his single breast for the seat of it in so far as this has been exercisable by them at their own motion this mode of proceeding has been styled the inquisitorial and within their several ranges the power of the prosecutorgeneral has had the judges of the several judicatories for sharers in it according to banniza thus for example if my recollection does not deceive me stood the matter in the austrian dominions according to boehmer in the prussian i should expect to find the case standing on much the same footing among you not to speak of the rest of europe with us the matter stands as yet upon not quite so bad a footing the power of giving effect to the laws on which personal security depends is not made an object of monopoly our monarch being god upon earth as we are all of us taught from blackstone our lawyers as far as depends upon them have it is true given to him the power of putting to death every man it would be agreeable to him to put     to death on condition of finding one hand to do the job and another by the countersignature of a pardon to concur in giving impunity to it but commodious as upon this statement it may seem this mode of proceeding—signatures and countersignatures being visible things—has not yet become a customary one modes not less effective but less conspicuous have hitherto obtained the preference discriminating slaughter has not yet been visibly added to indiscriminate matters however are in preparation for it recent progress has been made the last session but one or two produced a statute by which the right of certain relatives to prosecute for the murder of the correlative without permission from the monarch—in which case on conviction a pardon from him was without effect—was abrogated since then the life of every man in the kingdom hangs by a thread which a word from the king may cut at any time mine sir remaining as you see still uncut what gratitude do i not owe i beg your pardon sir—i have been digressing what belongs to your case is this under a government which has for its real object the supposed happiness of the ruling few through the sacrifice of the real happiness of the subject many—the system of law being to such a degree bad that the execution of it if complete would suffice for the extirpation of the species—in such a state of things if the species remains in part unextirpated it must be indebted for its existence to some arbitrary power by which the purposes proposed by the makers of the law are prevented from being carried into effect while your judicial establishment and your system of judicial procedure remain upon their present footing or upon any footing standing on a ground of romebred law—the otherwise natural effects of codes drawn from that source—of codes such as the one i have before me—will in arbitrary powers such as those i have been speaking of find a palliative and on this palliative rests the confidence i entertain of seeing your country still inhabited even supposing the code in question to pass in its own words unchanged you are now sir in a condition to judge whether on the satisfaction above declared in what degree soever well or ill grounded inconsistency can be charged though beyond the abovementioned temporariness lest you should be asking too much i should be sorry to see you asking for anything in the character of a condition—a few other things there are which i will venture to mention in the character of simple propositions   one is—that of an article declaring that for giving increase to the quantity of punishment appointed in any case by the new code no recourse shall be had to any at present existing portion of statute law any more than for applying punishment in any shape or degree to any act to which this same new code has not applied punishment something in this view i should expect to find actually done but time and eyes forbid the search in title i chapter xiii as abovementioned i see a chapter entitled on delinquencies delitos and delinquents not comprehended in this code and therein besides laws relative to matters ecclesiastical and ordinances relative to matters military i find—namely in article     over and above delitos mention made of culpas as being commissible against the regulations or ordinances which govern rijan en any matters or branches of the public administration but of these noncomprehended portions of law i see no more particular designation given for the purpose here in question the more obvious as well as the shorter and at the same time the more complete course would be—a general clause killing at one stroke with the exception of such as were kept alive by a list made out for that purpose the whole body of the penal laws found in existence this would be the only endurable course supposing the survey taken on this occasion of the field of penal law an allcomprehensive one but to the gentlemen in question—if the truth may be confessed this same idea of allcomprehensiveness considering how natural it is for a man to measure all other mens faculties by his own scarcely should i expect to find it an endurable one and at the hands of him by whom accomplishment is regarded as impossible accomplishment cannot reasonably be looked for even among us among whom how ill soever applied experience in the field of legislation is so much more abundant than with you—men in other respects not destitute of intelligence are not wanting to whom the idea of setting in any such way any precise bounds to the demand for punishment and coercion is an intolerable one not being myself without more trouble than i choose to bestow able to descry any such limits the thought that by any labour he can bestow it should be in the power of any other man to trace them out is intolerable to me such is the confession involved in every declaration of the impossibility of substituting on the field in question light to everlasting darkness what is above said with relation to your statute law or as it is called written—may with little or no difference be found applicable to your common law or as lawyers love to call it because there is so much writing in it unwritten law i mean the romebred commonly called the roman law in it i behold a still more vivacious as well as venomous hydra than in your statute law a hydra yes—but unfortunately not in your legislation committee—no not even in its president whatever he may behold in a lookingglass can i behold a hercules what if by their code—after the storm of horror and contempt poured forth upon the system of penal law which they found in existence—gentlemen   0 should be found to have left it in a state of undisturbed existence adding thus instead of substituting the new load of their own framing to a burthen declared by themselves to be an intolerable one should such an omission be found actually to have place your exertions sir will i hope not be wanting for the repair of it do what you can sir i cannot very well see how in the situation of advocates a set of men nurtured in romebred law can effectually be prevented from pointing if not in a direct in a little less effectual though indirect way to the old hag for an interpretation of it nor—without which the call would be hopeless—men in the situation of judges impregnated with the same poisonous milk be prevented from giving ear to it thence it is that for substituting certainty to uncertainty cognoscibility to uncognoscibility there exists not any possible instrument other than a complete mass of expository matter subjoined all along to the main text and intervening between the main text and the rationale interwoven as in my abovementioned french works stands not only proposed but if i do not misrecollect exemplified yes sir when completed the collection of codes should either in the way of insertion or in the way of reference contain everything to which the force of law is given by government and while it embraces everything in existence by its power it should embrace the whole contingent future by its providence one little proposed arrangement i would not venture sir to trouble you with were it not for the facility with which—and i hope without any very sensible wound to national honour and glory or soreness in the organ of infallibility—effect might be given to it in this code the numbering of the articles goes on i observe in one and the same series from first to last number of the last article     in this arrangement no method has place but that of the numeration table nothing of what is meant by classification but along with this arrangement comes a system of classification in the customary form or at any rate a form resembling what is customary first comes a part styled the preliminary part then come part the first and part the second under part the first i find eight titles under part the second three under every title except title eighth and title ninth i find chapters more than one and under every chapter i suppose there may be under little less than every chapter i am sure there are articles more than one this being the case the little arrangement i would venture to propose is—that to the number of the article reckoning from the first in the whole work—be added or substituted the number of the article reckoning from the first in the chapter of which it forms a part suppose this not done note sir the inconvenience in process of time comes an article to be inserted or an article to be repealed take in the first place the case of insertion suppose the insertion made at the end of the series the system of designation receives no disturbance but suppose it made at the commencement of the series the consequence is—that if the numerical order is still preserved throughout the whole of the series thus constructed the numerical names by which the articles were originally designated are now all erroneous and to the number of each the number of that which was next in the series must be substituted or confusion will be the result and in whatever part of the series the new article is inserted the numerical names of all above it remain indeed unaffected but those of all below it require to be subjected to the change so in case of a repeal the consequence is—a state of things which is the converse of the above in practice what will be the result that no such insertion or expunction will have place whatever is therefore done must be done by an independent law leaving the numerical arrangement undisturbed but in this way the logical arrangement which has been given to the existing series of articles cannot be extended to any supplemental ones now—instead of the arithmetical arrangement throughout with the logical arrangement here and there jostling it—suppose the usual logical arrangement had been employed with the arithmetical as usual in subordination to it in any title and in any chapter of that title suppose a new article added at the end of the series of articles contained in that chapter let the addition be made—the classification will be still preserved and everything left unchanged and undisturbed—conversely suppose repeal made of an article in that same chapter—at the end of the series of articles belonging to that chapter insert an article giving notice that the article in question is repealed in case of substitution the notification will be—to such an article designating it by its number substitute the following with that same method of theirs it being theirs the honourable authors of the logical method in question were it must be presumed not ill satisfied the little alteration here submitted has no other object than the giving to that same method of theirs a degree of undisturbed continuance such as it could not possess otherwise if not adoption this little intrusion may at any rate i hope obtain forgiveness as to the origin of this changeexcluding method—in the organ of infallibility i cannot but suspect it might be to be found—question to the genius of the organ to a work thus perfect the demon of presumption himself could he ever have the effrontery to propose in any part a change—answer impossible under the inspiration of this same genius it was that the authors of the constitutional code ordained in positive terms that no change should have place for eight years tacking at     the same time by a stroke of refined policy to the end of that period an indefinite one and with the inspirations of this same genius the honourable authors of this same projected penal code appear to be no less sufficiently impregnated quitting the allegro i must return to the penseroso proportioned to the severity if there be any in the above remarks—especially if in any degree it should be felt to be warranted by justice—will naturally be—the sensation of chagrin produced in the breasts of whatever persons are in virtue of the parts respectively taken by them in the work the subjects of them believe me sir or believe me not it is not without a correspondent chagrin on my part that any such unpleasant sensation can ever present itself to my mind imagination finds no difficulty in placing me in their situation triumph were i assured of it—triumph on any occasion and in any shape if the persons triumphed over were present would to me have more of concern than joy in it in no sensitive being could i ever yet witness pain—whether body and mind or mind alone were the seat of it—without catching as if by contagion a portion more or less considerable of it it is thus that i am constituted that i am so is it not known to all that have ever lived with me the consequence is—that in the present instance lest i should fail in the fulfilment of what appears to me my duty towards your nation and mankind at large it is all along necessary for me to keep my mind abstracted from any effect it may have upon them in any such unpleasant way as completely as possible all this while in supposing the production of chagrin by such a cause i look—not to the honourable gentlemen in question of none of whom have i the honour to know anything but what i see in public documents—but to the universal and unchangeable nature of man in the situation in which i see them placed it is to this cause as much perhaps as to any other that we are indebted for libel law it is for this cause that men in such abundance—and the gentlemen in question could direct your regard to some examples—are so eager in their endeavours to consign to ignominious death those whose misfortune it is to differ from them in speaking of chagrin from such a cause i speak of that which it seems to me can scarcely fail to exist not of anything which i should expect to see declared how it is with man in such a situation often have i had occasion to observe ask him while the animadversion is applying itself—speak of the effect naturally produced by it and express your own regret at the thoughts of it—you will be taken up short your sympathy will be taken for insult and the more acute the feeling is the more decided will be the protestations of indifference among the effects of these operations of mine if any effects they have i cannot therefore but number these unpleasant ones as to their original cause operations and effects together it is no other than that which on every occasion has place in the case of the medical operator exactly as much unkind feeling and no more have i towards the gentlemen in question collectively and individually as the surgeon has towards his patient when the surgeon operates it is for the good of the individual operated upon and with the exception of his particular connexions no others in my case it has been for the good of all spaniards of both hemispheres that in wish and endeavour at least i have been operating and through spain sooner or later for the good of the whole human race considering that in all this i make no personal sacrifice in any shape worth mentioning judge sir whether without much danger from the imputation of credulity you may not venture to believe me be that as it may judge then sir whether by the contemplation of any such universally encountered uneasiness as above i should have been justified in turning my back upon the unmeasureable mass of misery which these remarks of mine such as they are have been labouring to alleviate and in the production of which i should have been a participator if by any such narrow sympathy my pen such as it is had been stopped think sir whether by a single instance of execution given to a single one of the oneandtwenty homicidal articles above spoken of—every one of them in the view of so many other attentive observers of human nature as well as myself so much worse than useless—suffering could fail of being produced to a greater amount than in all five of these same illustrious breasts put together could be produced by anything that has been said or ever could be said by the unknown stranger—placed as he is forever out of their sight as effectually as if by the hand of death ere this your inward sanction cannot i think sir but to an extent more or less considerable have been given to the persuasion in which on my part this correspondence commenced i mean the persuasion of the inevitable disadvantage with which with reference to the greatest happiness of the greatest number it could not but have been carried on had my part in it been to be strained through a censors sieve though a conde de torenos had been the hand that held it thus much i can venture to affirm and without fear of contradiction—that in the multitude of remarks the freedom of which be the justice of them what it may has been so undeniable—there exist in no small proportion such as even in the persuasion of their justice a prudent man in your situation could not have brought himself to give utterance to whatever were the demand for animadversion could any such man have poured forth any such body of animadversion     on this same work of your selected colleagues either in their presence or out of it in your situation could a man have spoken in any such strain of the object of such extensive idolatry—oh that there were none worse grounded your constitutional code in your situation could a man have spoken in any such strain of aristocracy at large in your situation could a man have spoken of the order of lawyers in particular as i have found it so continually and indispensably necessary to speak of them in your situation could a man have spoken of the order of churchmen as i have already begun to speak and shall have to speak again in my next and as it were postscript letter in your situation could a man have spoken of the situation in which your cortes is doomed to sit breathing an atmosphere loaded as i have shown it to be with the fumes of sinister and corruptive interest exposed to a miasma against which scarce could a fontana d oro in the metropolis of every province afford a sufficiently powerful antidote in your situation could a man have anything near so strongly invited attention as at every turn i have seen reason to do to the union of the most perfectly unrestrained discussion with the perfection of security harmony public economy and good government in every imaginable shape in the instance of the angloamerican united states in a word in your situation could a man have spoken as i have found but too much occasion to speak of monarchy—of monarchy in any the least absurd and mischievous form in which that disastrous result of primæval necessity in the infancy of society can possibly present itself in your situation could a man sir have spoken as i have found but too much occasion to speak of monarchy fancy not however from anything i have said—fancy not sir that you have been hearing me say—rid yourselves of your monarchy true it is that no government to which the name of monarch ever has been or ever can be applicable ever has been or ever can be anything better than a system of established plunderage plunderage—regulated indeed but only because—unless it be in this as in every case regulated—the matter of plunderage and with it the profit must soon cease in spain monarchs established share—according to official accounts taken and made public here about the year     —onefourth of the whole expenditure of the government besides ulterior expenditure to an amount unascertainable and unlimited true it is that by no man has any attempt been ever made—by no man will any attempt be ever made—to show in what way it is that from the subjecting all to the will of one or of a few the happiness of the greatest number can receive increase true it is that by no man has any attempt been ever made—by no man will any attempt be ever made—to show how by giving everything to one or to a few or by placing everything within the grasp of one or of a few—subsistence abundance or security in any shape can any more than equality be afforded to all or to so much as the greatest number true it is that by no man has any attempt been ever made to show—by no man will any attempt be ever made to show—that in any instance in which the ruling few were not dependent on the will of the subject many for their continuance in rule they ever failed to give to their own interest the preference over that of the subject many or how—in case of every such constant preference of every one else to self as they pretend to give—the human species could so much as continue in existence is it in human nature—that a monarch full of resentment for restraint endured—restraint which in every shape is in his eyes an injury—is it in human nature—that a man so situated should by anything but terror or impotence be induced to part with any the least particle of power which he has been in use to exercise or so much as to wish for is it in human nature—that in a state of indigence and so long as he has anything that is not his own every monarch is in a state of indigence any such man in any such indigence should ever with patience behold himself reduced to a state of still more pinching indigence all this sir without much strain upon the fancy you may actually hear me saying but still what you do not hear me saying is—rid yourselves of your monarchy regulated plunderage to whatever extent carried on is still a less evil than unregulated plunderage to the same extent is conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number no government can be—if and so long as the greatest number think the contrary for can any man be happy any further than in his own opinion he is so and on this subject or any other subject sitting where i do how can i tell what they think whatsoever care has even as yet been employed upon their minds has it not been employed to make them think wrong or rather than that they should not think wrong to prevent them from thinking at all—no sir—in a few years in no eyes in which the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the only legitimate end of government—will any government other than that of a representative democracy as in the angloamerican united states be legitimate but either in one body or in a cluster of confederated bodies have you—in any such proportion as they had it or in any other sufficient proportion—the stuff of which representative democracies     are made a representative democracy not less necessarily perhaps than a monarchy must have a chief the americans had their washington and in default of him with the exception of his next successor every president they have ever had would have made a washington but among you is there anything out of which a washington could be made—there may be for aught i know but how can i know desirable or undesirable in a constitution—made of materials such as yours is made of—materials so irreconcileably discordant—change in one direction or in the other is in my eyes altogether unavoidable saying this what i do not say is—rid yourselves of monarchy but what i do say is—whatever change you make be it in favour of the greatest happiness of the greatest number—not of the ruling few or of the supremely ruling one be it towards a form by which all causes of insecurity and discontent are excluded rather than towards that form under which among you they were so recently operating operating all together and with a so disastrously effective force now sir permit me for a moment to indulge in a supposition which in its matter whatever in your eyes may be the probability of it will i am confident not be in every part displeasing to you it is this after sight of the objections brought to view—gentlemen being in their own minds satisfied of the reasonableness of them to an extent more or less considerable come forward—and on such considerations as in their judgment shall be best suited to the occasion declare themselves content or desirous as they think best that this work of theirs shall sleep a while on the shelf or to take another supposition and which for the reason above given may be perhaps a preferable one to an extent more or less considerable—amendments of the nature of those which i have ventured to submit together with others that may perhaps be suggested having been made—the proposed code at their presentation passes but with a clause confining the duration of it to a certain limited time and that as above not a long one to these two suppositions have patience with me sir while i add one more at the suggestion of these same most competent hands not only is the door thrown open but invitation given—given to every man whom it shall find disposed to accept it—to deliver in with or without further remarks on the only as yet proposed code a code of his own penning with or without an interwoven rationale as he shall be advised whatever may have been the sins found to have been hitherto manifested always supposing that into a political situation so elevated it is possible for political sin to have found entrance whatever may have been the sins manifested—a confession such as the above would it not be an ample—would it not sir be a glorious atonement by such sin followed by such atonement would not more merit be made manifest more magnanimity displayed more admiration deserved and called forth than if in no shape sin had manifested itself condemned on the occasion of i forget what controversy with bossuet—condemned by the constituted authorities of the country and the time—fenelon archbishop as he was of his own motion ascended his own pulpit and in the face of the assembled multitude read his own condemnation together with the retractation he disdained not to make in consequence it is for the multitude at large i bring this anecdote to mind for to yourself sir it can scarcely i think be new on a field of controversy such as that was—on the part of a mind such as that of the author of telemachus was—sincerity may to some eyes appear not altogether exempt from dispute not so either selfcommand or enlightened policy matchless is as yet the splendour with which the heroism of the man displayed in a shape so unexampled stands illuminated of victory over others you may see almost as many examples as you see contests examples of victory over self you may look for till you are tired the retractation made by fenelon was made under the eye and in conformity to the known pleasure of a man from whom on his part as on the part of everybody he ever saw everything imaginable was to be hoped and feared if in consequence of any of the arguments submitted to yourself sir in the first place to the gentlemen themselves in the next place any such selfsacrifice as above suggested should come to be made—it will by an admiring public be seen to have had anything rather than hope or fear looking to the individual at whose suggestion it will have been made well sir if in the honourable eyes in question all this inducement is not yet enough here is something more over the world of ideas with this their instrument of conquest in hand their aim has been in their preface does it not stand sufficiently avowed universal empire if without any to share in it it be in their eyes sufficiently within their reach they will continue still to strive for it in the other case putting off don quixote and putting on sancho pança permit me to say half a loaf is better than no bread so says our english proverb for which there can i think scarce fail to be a spanish one if leaving to some other as it may happen that lower part of the honour which belongs to the fundator incipiens gentlemens magnanimity can content itself with that upper part which belongs to the fundator perficiens—that highest part may be still their own let experience sir declare whether this sort of peaceful conquest be quite so remote from the region     of probabilities as some would be glad to see it by a rare union of merit with fortune circumstances favouring the spanish constitutional code—has it not already found numerous adopters adopters in all nations by whom the attempt has been made to render monarchy oh herculean or rather sisyphian labour consistent with the greatest happiness of the greatest number let them have received a plan in which the dictates of that principle are pursued with undeviating consistency—pursued over the two remaining parts of the field of law—the penal and the civil—think sir to what extent sooner or later spain may not by their hands have spread over the willing nations the blessing of her laws whatever may be their determination on that question in mine their can be no difficulty if life and faculties continue my codes will successively be drawn up the encouragement which from so many quarters i have received would of itself have been a sufficient stimulus the discouragement received at the hands of the legislative committee of the existing cortes—not to speak of the cortes itself which on this ground knows nothing of what it has seen heard or received—has been an additional stimulus as the work proceeds it will find its way into various languages the spanish will not be the last into your ultramaria—including all that was your ultramaria—it will in that as well as other dresses find its way without difficulty thus far my determination reaches but now commence my uncertainty and my desire of information in so far as in a case such as that in question information is possible is it through the regular channels—or is it in the way of contraband with other piecegoods that the fruit of my endeavours to serve your constituents will have to make its way to them and to their paulopostfuture representatives i am prepared for both sides of the alternative but it would be a convenience to me to know in which of the two the greatest probability is to be found sir when in dernier resort for giving effect to whatever endeavours can be used to serve your country i put on the garb of a malefactor and assume an attitude of defiance it is not—indeed it is not—with a light heart but in the state in which your legislation still is still is and for i know not what further length of time seems doomed to be—what else by a man whose first regard is neither for laws nor makers of law but for those for whom such laws in as far as they are anything better than nuisances must be made—what else what better sir can be done if you are fed must it not be against law if you are clothed must it not be against law as if in one word prohibition were contained the united powers of capital skill and access to market if you are instructed no wonder then if this too must be against law believe me sir neither is the uncertainty i speak of in any degree a feigned one i see what the present is but until the millstone which the committee with but too much countenance from their colleagues have suspended over your press has either been set aside or been let down upon it and crushed it—i am unable to see in anything that is either past or present any security for the future of the most comprehensive of those works of mine that are in french the first volume thanks to the zeal and talent of dr toribio nunez has been some time in spanish the others may by this time for aught i know have followed it true it is that to the functionaries whoever they may be whom the legislation committee looks to for giving execution and effect to its code i should not expect to find that in my penal code even with the rationale standing part of it there is anything that will give any heavier offence than may have been given to them already by those works or even than that which may come to be given to them by these present letters but in this respect the lot of this little work remains as yet in total darkness and supposing this darkness cleared away and cleared away in my favour still the like darkness would cover those so much more extensive and important future works if i have not in either instance any assurance of proscription—still in that quarter in neither instance have i anything like an assurance of toleration how is it possible sir that i should if with the functionaries in question matters for that purpose are already or shall have come to have been arranged—what man whose misfortune it is to give publicity to anything by which their displeasure shall have been called forth can have any sufficiently grounded expectation of being suffered to live not to speak of incarceration in its most hideous forms and for never ending terms subvertir trastornar alterar embarazar guardárse—any one of those words not to look for others would it not be sufficient sir for the fatal purpose true it is that the gobierno of the day the septemvirate of ministers—if i may believe the official assurance of one of them entertained not many months ago a desire to see these projected works of mine a desire which they were accordingly pleased to make communication of to the king but besides that the offence which i cannot but be too well assured cannot fail to be given by these letters of mine had not then any existence—the gentlemen of whom the government of that day was composed have for some time been—what in a few months the gentlemen of the legislation committee in question will be and under the proposed articles in question i see nothing that should prevent these my quondam honourable and official supporters from being involved in that same fate which but for the circumstance of distance might so naturally be mine true it is again that for any such work there could not i should suppose be much to fear     supposing the circulation of these letters to remain unrepressed but unless it be from yourself sir—for this even in the present state of things i cannot see any tolerably wellgrounded assurance how much less can i under the proposed code in question if in anything like its present state it shall have become law now then sir comes a fresh vexation which i know not how to avoid exposing you to a request for answers to a few unavoidably troublesome and therefore sincerely reluctant questions the uncertainty above spoken of it being the cause and reason of them will i hope be received as an excuse or i have none not to take for the subject of the desired information a work that as yet has no existence i will take for a representative of it those letters which have already given you so much trouble and hereupon it is that i take the liberty of submitting to you the questions that here follow to this work i might add those other tracts of mine on spanish and portuguese affairs which in the original english have for sometime been as you inform me in your hands—were it not that if this little work is tolerated there can be no fear for either of those lesser ones   without special interference on the part of yourself sir or any other person in particular is it your opinion that they will or that they will not be suffered to circulate unrestricted to be bought and sold freely and all over the country as books in general are and this without danger in any shape to any persons by whom in any part of spain any part shall have been borne in the publication of them   if there be any such impediment to their diffusion may i be warranted in any such hope as that the influence of your declared opinion and wishes will be employed in the endeavour to remove it one word more sir and the experiment so unexpectedly made upon your patience and power of forgiveness is at an end prepare yourself now sir for what i am sure you cannot be accustomed to receive—and what i myself am as little accustomed to give as to receive—a menace menace as it is it is however of that sort a mans sensitiveness to which is—not in the inverse but in the direct ratio of the elevation of the place he possesses in the scale of public estimation and of the goodness of his title to possess it it is of that sort or you would not have it to encounter i believe from anybody and i am sure not from me nor yet from me but for the weakness of my position would you be troubled with it that which in my character of unretained but not the less zealous advocate of your nation i have need of so far as you are concerned is—to see you at liberty at real and not merely apparent liberty but to a man in a situation such as yours exposed to so much pressure in so many sinister directions it is impossible to receive liberty but from some opposing pressure in the assembly of the deputies of the people you cannot take your seat but encompassed by colleagues from whom in all varieties of form you will hear this in substance—leave the intruding foreigner unnoticed let him write on at his peril the constituted authorities will take charge of him what is he to us what need spaniards care for foreigners let him remain unanswered least said is soonest mended what a pity you thus noticed him but this will be a lesson to you and to all of us in future in the midst of all this for how guarded soever the expression you see the meaning that is at the bottom of it—after such a warning from the highest but narrowest section of the tribunal of public opinion—is it in the nature of the case that a man in your situation should feel himself in possession of real and effective liberty oh no it is impossible i see virtue struggling but tottering now then for a support where the desire exists to maintain a line of conduct which in the nature of the case cannot but be in contrariety to the wills and opinions to which a man is under the necessity of showing a certain deference—a sense of superior duty presents not only a justifiable cause but may frequently be found a convenient and allowed plea for yielding to it and thus out of obligation real or though but apparent springs real liberty in the tribunal of public opinion—the only efficient guardian of political virtue—there are i believe i have already made my bow to the superior of them two grand sections in your situation on a thousand occasions the suffrages of that one section are irresistibly forced from the line of rectitude by the pressure of a swarm of particular interests in the inferior and more numerous section is the only steady seat of that virtue which has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number at paris sits one of the most respectable committees of this multitudinous body paris sir is not unknown to you in paris you behold sir or report has been misled a not altogether unattractive residence   if i decline doing what is thus asked of me what will paris say to me this sir is a question you need not be ashamed to put to any of your colleagues now then sir for my menace—return to paris when you will—these letters in a french dress will meet you there now then sir you are free free to prefer public good to private considerations now sir you stand at your ease and armed receive at length in form the assurance of that respect tokens of which so much more demonstrative than any express declarations can be have in no part of this long address i stand persuaded been found wanting from jeremy bentham to the comte de toreno c c c     jeremy bentham letter vii on religion and the plan pursued in the proposed code for the support of it by death and other punishments religion—catholic religion—pena de muerts—death so says article   0 death the portion of every one who directly and by deed shall conspire to establish establecer in any part of spain en las españas any religion other than the catholic spanish ultramaria included or not included—i should expect to find it included establish what is to establish a set of men who in a house appropriated or not appropriated to the purpose of religious worship or let it be in open air perform religious worship in a way of their own—may not they under this article by a willing judge without much difficulty be killed for doing so on this subject sir i should hardly have thought it worth while to trouble you with any observations on my part—but for the words by which speaking of les articles qui parlent sur la religion you encourage me with the assurance—cela ne passera pas as to its being meant to apply to all these articles without exception this could scarcely i think have been your meaning but at any rate i hope the prophecy will prove a true one if applied as i hope it was meant to be to this same   0th article it being no more my intention to say anything either in this letter or in any code of my drawing against the catholic religion than to run my head against a wall—i find no difficulty sir in submitting to you in relation to this subject a few scattered observations to every sincere and at the same time firm believer in the christian religion in general and in the catholic edition of it in particular—it cannot i think but be matter of sad concern to see the testimony of so many illustrious names attached—as in the articles   0                         and i know not how many besides in the chapter declared to be appropriated to that subject—to any such declaration as that in their opinion without support from temporal punishment inflicted on gainsayers the belief in it would not be able to stand its ground—not stand its ground not in spain what should hinder it in ireland as so many irishmen settled in spain can testify to you it not only stands its ground but gains ground and that not only without support from oppression but in spite of it what says somebody and among all the sorts of acts to which the chapter on religion seeks to apply prevention and for the purpose of prevention punishment—is there absolutely not any one to which if it depended upon you you would apply prevention and even in some shape or other punishment o yes some there are unquestionably namely all those acts by which to human beings to an indefinite or other adequately large extent i see any real evil—in a word any sensation of an uneasy nature to a certain degree of intensity—produced here then is a line drawn which if drawn on the proper plan would be at any rate a tolerably plain and clear one all exhibitions which being to the minds of individuals taken in any considerable number productive of uneasiness on a religious account are offered to their senses in such manner as that the unpleasant sensation produced by them whatever it be is unavoidable—all such acts are in my view of the matter objects calling for prevention by means of punishment and in this consideration i cannot but approve of the principle acted on in articles         and     of the proposed code why because man is a being but too susceptible of uneasiness and the more of it he can be saved from the better but—the almighty—is he a being susceptible of uneasiness in any shape for my part i cannot find any sufficient reason for believing him so to be however if on this point the cortes by means of information received from those to whom it belongs to give it have been more fortunate—this point must be considered as settled but this point being supposed to be thus settled then come two or three others the almighty being susceptible of uneasiness and in particular of uneasiness produced by words employed by men in speaking to or of him—is it his almighty will to be saved from such uneasiness or not if yes does he stand in need of any human power and in particular of that of the cortes to give effect to such his will if on the contrary it is his almighty will not to be saved from such uneasiness but to continue suffering under it does it become the cortes to endeavour to oppose their power to such his almighty will and if yes does such opposition afford any considerable promise of proving effectual corresponding questions in regard to the saints to whom also meaning doubtless the departed saints the protection provided for the almighty is in article     i perceive extended having ventured so far as to submit to your view these questions the answers i must be content to leave which i do without reluctance to the competent authorities these things considered—blasphemies or imprecations article     or whatever else be the denomination given to portions of discourse by which with or without production of uneasiness offence has been supposed to be given to god or to the saints or to both—so long as they are confined to writing or printed books—or to private conferences not open to the public at large into which he to     whom what is said is productive of uneasiness entered of his own free choice without being obliged to repair thither in prosecution of any matter of business—to no such discourses how revolting soever to myself could i if it depended on me think of applying punishment in any shape but in a promiscuous multitude—in a church suppose a judicatory or any other public building or in a road or marketplace or a ship—suppose such language uttered uneasiness to men may be produced and with it demand for punishment whatsoever may be the justice—with which the above observations may be found to apply to offensive audible exhibitions—with correspondent justice they will i think be found to apply to visible exhibitions it matters not through what sense the wound passes to the mind if the mind is wounded whatever difficulty may have been produced in gentlemens minds by offences styled offences against religion considered as commissible by individuals at large—it is but a small matter i should suppose in comparison with that produced by offences through religion offences apprehended at the hands of that particular order of men in whom among you the votaries of religion are wont to behold its special and little less than exclusively authorized guardians as to myself—reference always made to the greatest happiness of the greatest number—i beheld as issuing from this source two widely different mischiefs the one temporary in its nature the other permanent   by the temporary mischief i mean that which consists in opposition made by this particular class of functionaries to the government composed of all the other classes of functionaries a mischief which to the greatest number of the people is great in proportion as the conduct of the present government is in a higher degree than that of the late conducive to that same greatest happiness   the permanent mischief is—that which i apprehend from the junction of the body of the sacred functionaries with the profane ones the junction of the two particular interests of these two sections of the ruling few into a body of particular and thence sinister interest which will thereby be so much the more effectually enabled—as if the body be composed of men it cannot but be as surely disposed—to sacrifice to its own supposed greater happiness the greatest happiness of the greatest number—or if interest be the word the universal interest supposing the old government to continue unrestored—the temporary mischief as above described will be growing less and less every day as the functionaries established under the old government drop off and as the public mind grows more and more enlightened in corresponding proportion will the permanent mischief take its place and when it has once swallowed up its present opponent the temporary mischief—will remain in possession of the field without anything unless it be the spirit of the people to oppose it in a word the temporary mischief is—superstitious influence the permanent mischief corruptive influence in the temporary mischief i see nothing very formidable nothing but what under the constitution as it stands may admit of a remedy an easy a gentle and an effectual remedy this remedy sir i shall proceed to submit to you and with the less diffidence considering how near on some points it comes to that which i see employed by the committee for conciseness i shall put it into a form in some respects similar to what i should pursue in the penning of the correspondent part of a code but i must beg of you not to consider it as anything like an adequate sample of such a code to give to it anything like the precision and conciseness that would be given to it in a regular work of that kind of which it would form a part is altogether impossible in any such fabric of my construction the form of each part would be dependent on that of every other general description of the proposed remedy   with the exception of ecclesiastical functionaries in general and bishops in particular addressing themselves in print or writing to the people within the range of their authority in the exercise of their official functions—leave to persons of all descriptions—ecclesiastics of all classes as well as others—the complete liberty of publishing whatsoever they please on the subject of religion without exposure to punishment in any shape or impediment to the circulation of such their discourses n b such—only without the exception—is the state of the law in the angloamerican united states and no mischief in any shape—no such mischief as that of oppression by government or disaffection towards rulers or discord as between citizen and citizen through the instrumentality of religion—is produced by it or has place there   on the part of an ecclesiastical functionary of whatever class let the publication of any instrument—on the face or on the occasion of which either by his proper name or the name of his function he stands designated either as sole author or partaker in the authorship or publication of such instrument—designated whether in the direct way or in any way howsoever indirect—stand interdicted unless and until it shall have received a license in writing under the hand of a functionary of the temporal class—say the political chief of the province in this case—though the composition of the instrument is as consistently with the religion in question it cannot but be the sole act of the ecclesiastical functionary—yet the publication of it may be considered as the joint act of the ecclesiastical functionary and the temporal     or a relative censorship may be considered as established with the temporal functionary for censor the operation is the same in whichever light considered n b to this purpose must be considered—not beneficed ecclesiastics only but all ecclesiastics whatsoever regular as well as secular for it is—not only from special power or dignity but from the sacred character common to them all that their influence is in the instance of each wont to be derived coextensive is the designation employed in the proposed code article     i reasons for the general liberty   against vexation to the feelings of individuals security will be sufficiently afforded by the above proposed interdiction of discourse visible as well as audible and of all other objects of an antireligious nature if exhibited in any such manner as to be open to eyes to which they are disagreeable   against mischief by the propagation of mischievous errors security will be afforded by the unbounded faculty of refutation left to all persons in whose eyes they possess that quality and of inducement adequate to the production of such refutation in so far as the nature of the case admits of refutation no deficiency can reasonably be apprehended if there were any nothing could be easier to government than the providing an adequate supply to it see the tract on the liberty of the press and public discussion   any fear real or pretended of seeing the will of the almighty in this or any other particular overpowered and frustrated by human agency is too palpably selfcontradictory and absurd to be defendible—or to be accounted for otherwise than by longcontinued custom produced in its origin by the union of force and fraud with or without superstitious terror   of the fear of seeing the will of the almighty frustrated in the particular instance of the existence and extent of the religion of jesus—the groundlessness is moreover demonstrated by experience in the case of the angloamerican united states   of the fear of seeing the will of the almighty frustrated in the still more particular instance of the existence and extent of the catholic edition of the religion of jesus—the groundlessness is moreover further demonstrated by experience in the case of ireland as noticed above ii reasons against every such attempt as that of designating for the purpose of punishment the sort of supposed mischievous discourse meant to be interdicted on the score of opposition to the existing government on the part of ecclesiastical functionaries speaking as such   such designation is as to a part of the extent needless in so far as such discourse has for its immediate tendency to engage men in the commission of acts injurious to person or property—the offence is met by the laws applying to such offences taken in their utmost latitude   as to the rest of the extent it is impossible the above case excepted—it is not possible to reach by any description the sort of discourses in question when emaning or appearing to emane from any person invested with the consecrated character out of phrases extracted either from the fathers or even from the bible—in a word from any writings whatever they may be which in the religion in question are held as sacred—out of phrases thus extracted may be composed by any one who shall think it worth his while a cento abundantly sufficient for any such mischievous purposes of the portions of discourse thus extracted and employed the application thus made will be a misapplication true but the source from whence they were extracted will not have been the less sacred too great to be contended against will be the difficulty of passing condemnation on matter extracted from such sacred sources—when seen or believed to be extracted by such consecrated hands   uniform conviction will be hopeless howsoever in such a case a judge zealous to a certain degree on the side of the existing rulers may be disposed to pronounce conviction—a judge inwardly hostile or less zealous can scarcely be punished for not doing so such says the obnoxious ecclesiastical functionary to the judge is the interpretation put by me if my interpretation is erroneous does it belong to you—not only to put an opposite interpretation upon the sacred text but to punish me only because mine is different from yours then comes the judge and says to his superiors can you punish me layman as i am for not punishing on the ground of its being a misinterpretation an interpretation put by a consecrated person on these sacred texts as to the particular restraint—note in the first place the assumption on which the demand for it is grounded it is—that from the class of persons in question under existing circumstances hostility to the new order of things is naturally to be apprehended grounds for the assumption are these viz   hostility from this quarter has actually been manifested to a very considerable extent   it is but natural and even morally speaking excusable—that having been admitted into their respective functions when the former order of things was in force—they should by sense of duty and thence by reflection as well as by particular selfregarding interest be attached to it and led to give support to it iii reasons for the restraint   addition of what is wanting to the perfect freedom of discussion which by the supposition was meant to be established by the general provision relative to this subject the power—exercised over the judgment of the people at large by means of the fears derived from the source in question and infused into their breasts—is a power by which inward     freedom of consideration is liable to stand excluded and the mind to be rendered insensible to the force of argument on the other side   from the freedom of discussion no defalcation is thus made not even on the part of these functionaries themselves since for the giving support to their opinion it leaves to them whatever liberty is possessed by any other citizen they may give currency to whatever arguments they please so as they do not make it known from what privileged source they come the arguments will then operate with whatever rational force properly belongs to them and no more   exclusion of useless punishment if punishment were ordained to be applied to all such discourse as emanating from the quarter in question shall according to a description given of it be deemed mischievous it might under the uncertainties abovementioned come to be now and then inflicted this punishment being upon the whole inefficacious would be useless and expended in waste evil produced without preponderant good look on the other hand to the case where the offence to which the punishment is applied is the offence of publishing without the required license in this case the fact is so easily ascertainable and so completely unexposed to dispute that by a presumption by no means unreasonable it may be assumed that the offence will scarce ever be committed if the instrument is not regarded as coming from the ecclesiastical functionary in question it is not productive of the mischievous effect apprehended as little is it if on being interrogated whether it has his sanction he denies it—if on the other hand he avers that it has his sanction in this case having by the supposition no license to produce he plainly incurs the punishment under these circumstances how small the probability is that a man should thus expose himself is manifest true it is—that by this restriction confined as it necessarily is to discourse in a written state mischievous discourse from the quarter in question not uttered otherwise than by word of mouth is not reached but   for the repression of all actual mischief—all mischief in a tangible shape—all mischief which is anything more than mischief in tendency—all mischief in a word which has for its subjectmatter either person or property—provision is made by the general and standing laws by which acts mischievous to person or property are erected into offences and as such made punishable   the mischievous discourse in question being by the supposition not committed to writing—the effect of it will be proportionately uncertain and transient   in so far as any reports made of the purport of it find their way into print—they will have to encounter the arguments which—on the side that by the supposition is not only the right side but the side which has the remuneratory power of government for its support—cannot as above shown be reasonably expected to be deficient and as by the supposition the mischievous matter will not be avowed by the functionary from whom it is reported to have come they will not operate with more than their proper and reasonable force iv punishment proposed for promulgation without such license   banishment for a term to be limited from every part of the spanish territory   forfeiture of all ecclesiastical benefices situated within the spanish territory i e of the temporalities thereto belonging nb if by the ecclesiastical law recognised in spain any difficulty be opposed to such forfeiture—for example a difficulty as to the separation of the temporalities from the spiritualities—this point will require to be settled   in case of damage produced to person or property by means of any incitement regarded as having been given by the unlicensed instrument—obligation to make compensation for the injury   reason for article   of the punishment   power of reoffending cut off in part   reason for article   of the punishment   power of reoffending cut off in other part   reasons for article   of the punishment   the justice of the arrangement manifest to all eyes nb but this supposes that the connexion—between the publication of the unlicensed instrument and the physical damage in question—in the character of cause and effect has been sufficiently ascertained   assistance necessary to the law more effectually secured secured on the part of the persons whose subserviency is necessary to the execution of it necessary—in the several characters of witnesses and informers or prosecutors nb capital punishment makes martyrs a martyr may be more mischievous after death than during life neither by banishment—nor by forfeiture of the ill bestowed invitations to idleness and antichristian luxury—nor by obligation of making amends for injury—nor by all together—is any such instrument of good or evil as a martyr manufactured v punishment for the political chief in case of his giving a license to an instrument of the sort in question which in respect of the mischievous tendency imputed to it shall have been deemed unfit to receive a license in case of actual damage produced to person or property—obligation to make compensation—as in the case of the ecclesiastical functionary as above nb if in the case in which no such damage has been produced it be thought fit to apply punishment to the case of the temporal licensing functionary—a description of the nature of the offence committed by the improperly licensed spiritual functionary will require to be given a description the difficulty of which has been above brought to view but in comparison   0 with the peril that has place in the case of the improperly licensed spiritual functionary—the utmost peril that can have place in the case of the licensing temporal functionary is very inconsiderable the inducement by which a person in the situation of the ecclesiastical creature of the former government is naturally stimulated to the commission of the offence—has no place in the situation of the temporal creature of the new government by which the former government has been supplanted whatever therefore be the description given of the offence—very inconsiderable is the probability of its being in any such situation as that of the temporal functionary in question ever committed suppose even that in the text of the law no penalty is attached to the supposed mischievous conduct in question on the part of the temporal functionary—even in this case the requisite means of repression will scarcely fail of being applied for this purpose the power of removal belonging to the superiors in the executive department might it should seem suffice vi punishment for the political chief in the case of his refusing a license to an instrument of the sort in question to which it is thought a license ought not to have been refused by him in this case there seems not to be any adequate demand for punishment the situation in question would be too perilous—if for two offences of an opposite nature—one of them so difficultly susceptible of precise description—punishment were thus menacing a man on both sides to put an extreme case suppose the result to be—that from the quarter in question no written instrument of the sort in question ever emanes the greatest possible evil that could result from such deficiency does not present itself as very serious from the same quarter there would remain in unlimited quantity in the oral form instructions to any effect wished to be communicated and in the written form instructions equally unlimited so it be in an anonymous state—in that state in which it will carry with it no more indeed than the weight but yet all the weight that properly belongs to it vii reason for the proposed temporariness of the restriction   restriction howsoever applied being so much evil—ought not to stand applied but in so far as it has the effect of excluding evil to a greater amount for the exclusion of the evil in question the most perfectly effectual course would be—to continue the restriction so long as any one functionary admitted into the order in question under the former state of things continued alive but were the duration given to it thus protracted the restriction would continue long after the need of it had ceased to exist threescore or as far as fourscore years might be the duration of it even supposing unabated hostility sure in the instance of every one of them—it is not by one nor by a small number that in this way any considerable mischief would be produced in a torch though lighted there is nothing dangerous—except in so far as combustible matter in a quantity sufficient for mischievous effect is within reach of it say then in ten say in twenty—say at the utmost in thirty years—with the hope even the desire of producing mischief in this shape it seems reasonable to believe would be effectually extinguished if not in all at any rate in so large a proportion of the whole number as to leave the rest in a state of sufficient impotence i was about to speak somewhat at large upon the permanent mischief in regard to which gentlemen of the committee are so much at their ease and your humble servant so full of apprehension i had even written more than as much again as on the conclusion of this letter you will now have been troubled with what has saved you is—the recollection that in the composition of the mischief in question the mass of the matter of corruptive influence in the hands of the clergy is but one element out of a number and that therefore under the head of religion discussions on this subject would not have their proper place i will not attempt sir to take up any more of your time by offering to your view the points of difference and the points of agreement—for points of agreement on this subject there are—between your honourable colleagues and your troublesome correspondent there would be no use in it and when confronted the passages will i hope speak sufficiently for themselves by one thing or other i have thus been insensibly led to the obtruding upon you as it were by a side wind something like a sample of the manner in which—in a code furnished with a rationale—the principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number would be applied to the several particular cases the several elementary ingredients of the great compound—i mean the probable feelings of all individuals concerned—being to the best of the operators ability looked out for set down numbered up weighed and measured inadequate in a lamentable degree must unavoidably be any such sample in an entire work of this kind constructed in pursuance of an uniform design that degree of condensation is practicable which in any part taken by itself is impossible condensation—a quality in this case so indispensable—to precision comprehensiveness and consistency as well as notification on the same subject—you and your honourable colleagues sir have before you a work of which in this place i need say no more than that compared with their proposed code it is a different one the eyes of cultivated europe—yes and of the so much better cultivated america—not to speak of that which is beginning to be cultivated—are fixed upon you you will make your choice     and now at length sir a period is put to the course of continually increasing vexation—which by the philanthropic and spontaneous zeal of a common friend has—such have all along been my apprehensions—been unawares imposed upon you at the hands of your not the less sincerely respectful correspondent jeremy bentham supplemental advertisement in the preceding advertisement some account was undertaken to be given of the effect of these letters so far as regards the honourable gentlemen at whose instance they were

comte de toreno mr bentham to the comte de toreno queens square place westminster sept   th      sir— this goes to you i hope by a private hand in obedience to your commands as signified by your letter of last month and in consequence of your obliging present received on the   d i addressed to you by the post on the   th of this month the first of six intended letters and on the   th the greater part of the second the conclusion of the second i shall send this night by the post not being able to finish the revision of it time enough to send it by the present private conveyance the third and fourth will follow it in a very few days more in the first or second of these letters reference is made to two pamphlets which miss wright a young lady who was going from hence on a visit to general la fayette was kind enough to take charge of it would be a great satisfaction to me to hear that anything of all this has been received by you as likewise to receive your directions respecting the course to be taken for the conveyance of the remaining letters your letter to me not containing any directions on this subject nor being dated from any street or other place at paris i could think of no course so proper or so likely to succeed as that which is expressed in the direction given to this letter and which direction i have accordingly pursued in every instance to miss wright i gave in charge nothing more than the pamphlets in question not having at that time been able to decide what course my letter to you should take understanding that the cortes were to meet to do business so soon as the   th of this month i should not have sent a letter to you at paris thus late in the month but for those words in which you say in your letter dici aux derniers jours de septembre que je dois retourner en espagne with the truest respect i am sir yours jeremy bentham under these circumstances i could not help considering myself as being in no inconsiderable degree indebted to miss wright for the spanish letter underneath of which the following is a translation— el conde de toreno september   th      paris paris september   th      sir— perceiving from the quotations in your three valuable letters the acquaintance you have with the language of the nation i belong to i employ it on this occasion in preference to any foreign one following in this particular the example you have set me never should i have thought of making any such attempt upon your time had it not been for my friend mr bowring and the assurances he gave me that you would with pleasure do whatever it might lie in your power to do in compliance with any request which for a purpose such as that in question i might be disposed to make to you under this assurance it seemed to me that i could not have a more favourable occasion for addressing myself to the illustrious writer the celebrated mr bentham whose works have spread so much light over the field of legislation and thereby made such large contribution to the welfare of mankind i see however that the extent of the subject and above all a sort of distrust on your part as towards the functionaries who consult you have given their colour to your mode of complying with my request although it does not appear to me that the individual thus consulted should have seen grounds for distrusting the functionary consulting the latter of these will with pleasure quote with due respect the person by whom he is     thus honoured it accords not with his principles or his habits to attempt to gain reputation by hiding diminishing or appropriating to himself the merits of other men with that urbanity which from such a quarter could not but be expected it has been your care to avoid including me in any such imputation i mean by the testimony you give to the fact that i have not the honour of knowing or being known to you or of ever having written to you by this testimony coupled with the intimation of your opinion that there was nothing about me that could have given room for any such particular distrust on your part towards myself be assured sir that i am duly sensible to the value of the expectations you hold out to me of your having in hand a work on this same subject not less so am i to the justice of those already published observations of yours of which certain articles in our constitution are the subjects confirmed as it is to me by those which a pretty extensive course of experience has led me to make on the practice of legislative bodies the nonreeligibility of deputies is a most serious evil detrimental as it so manifestly is to that stability and consistency which are so essential in mens proceedings in general and more particularly in such in which the public interest is concerned although my first letter was not written under any such expectation as that of its meeting the public eye you have not the less my free consent sir to send it to the press so as the present letter be an accompaniment to it it is with great pleasure that i shall always receive any such communications as you may be pleased to make to me persuaded as i am that whatsoever labour may have been employed upon them will not be labour lost i am sir c signed el conde de toreno ps miss wright has the goodness to take charge of this letter for you mr j bentham el conde de toreno septembre    de      paris paris septembre    de      mui senor mio viendo por las citas que vmd hace en sus tres apreciables lo bien que entiende el espanôl prefiero escribirle en mi lengua á valerme de otra extraña siguiendo en esto el exemplo de vmd nunca hubiera yo molestado su atencion ni atrevidome á distraerle de sus importantes tareas si nuestro amigo mr bowring no me hubiera animado á ello manifestandome el gusto conque vmd satisfaria mis deseos—en virtud de esto nada crei mas oportuno en el asunto de que se trataba que dirigirme al escritor ilustre al célebre mr bentham que por medio de sus obras habia procurado en materias de legislacion difundir ideas luminosas y contribuir de este modo al bien de la humanidad—veo sinembargo que lo extenso del asunto y sobre todo un cierto género de desconfianza que tiene vmd en los funcionarios que consulta le han impedido contestar à lo que le preguntaba si bien nada hubiera tenido que recelar del functionary consulting el individual thus consulted el primero citarà con gusto la persona que le ilustre no fundando su gloria en ocultar disminuir ó quitar el mérito de las demas—vmd con la urbanidad propia de hombre tan distinguido no me comprehende en su asercion y en verdad no habiendo tenido la honra de conocer antes à vmd ni de escribirle directamente como vmd mismo nota no habia antecedente alguno que diese lugar a esta desconfianza aprecio de todos modos la promesa que vmd me hace de una obra que acerca de esta materia escribe—asimismo estimo las observaciones generales sobre algunos articulos de la constitucion entre ellas hallo algunas bastante justas segun lo que me ha enseñado una larga experiencia de lo que son los cuerpos legislativos—la noreeleccion de diputados es un grave mal pues falta aquel principio de estabilidad y consequencia tan necesario en todos los asuntos y sobre todo en los de publico interes aunque mi primera carta no fué escrita con el obgeto de que viese la luz publica es vmd mui dueño de imprimirla

it seems to me that there may be a use in my making this second acknowledgment of the honour done me by your second letter bearing date paris sep    the first acknowledgment was made in a postcript to letter the  th being the  rd of the series of letters announced in letter  st whether besides that  st letter you had before your leaving paris received any others i cannot be sure though from a passage in your abovementioned  d letter i am inclined to think you had received one at least of the   sent or announced as above   have already gone to paris at different times all of them directed in the same words as the one of which you mentioned the receipt so likewise a part of letter the  th the whole or near the whole of the remainder will go tomorrow friday     letter  th which at

sept   th letter   first part sept   th letter   last part sept   th letter   oct  d letter   oct   th letter   first part oct  0th letter   last part the honourable gentleman speaks of distrust of distrust on my part and as in his situation would very naturally be the case seems to be not altogether pleased with it distrust on my part o yes that there was distrust not entertained only but declared the reader may have observed how explicitly declared it is for this distrust that i see a sort of action brought against me in the court of public opinion though such is the honourable plaintiffs candour i cannot complain of the rate at which the damages appear to be laid to this action such as it is my pleas are—in the language of english law—not guilty and a justification   not guilty for—the object of this distrust of mine—what is it not the individual but the genus and the species—man the genus statesman the species and such as the imputation is we are—both of us—not he the plaintiff alone but i the defendant also—declaredly included in it i will even go further—i aver even ultràinnocence if on my part in a case like this the eye of suspicion could have been closed in few instances could it have been so nearly so as in the present i turned in the first place to the cortes at large in the instance of these real representatives of the spanish people when compared with the sham representatives of this and that other nation i could not but see a ground for comparative confidence—appropriate confidence—a ground alike obvious and incontestable in the instance of count toreno in particular this ground presented an aspect of peculiar strength him alone i saw breaking through the trammels of national vanity and national prejudice him alone i saw looking round for useful information looking to whatsoever quarter presented a chance of furnishing it to whatever presumed source of information the call for it had been directed the magnanimity manifested by such a call would have produced in my mind that degree of appropriate confidence which was so natural and whether by the consideration of the individual source applied to that confidence could have been lessened any one may judge so much for not guilty now for justification—suppression—suppression to an amount more or less considerable—is charged as having in the passages complained of been stated as an undesirable but at the same time a too certain result—supposing the correspondence not submitted to the public eye such then being the alleged probable what has been the actual result this security against suppression—such security as is afforded by the assurance of future publication—this security as far as it goes has been obtained and still so far as has depended on the honourable complainant suppression has actually been the result suppression not partial only but total in the only place in which publicity could have been productive of any immediate effect on practice of the seven letters which the reader has before him three he has seen have been acknowledged but he has moreover seen—how and by what means they were caused to be acknowledged fortune having in the manner that has been seen favoured me and conveyed through the counts keyhole a sylph to whose questions a yes or a no could not be refused it is moreover to her account that my suspicion cannot forbear placing that same license whereby publication stands authorized since that day sept   th      neither in black and white nor by word of mouth has a syllable from him on the subject been extractible the letter with which he was presented or at least endeavoured to be presented upon his return to madrid the reader has seen likewise mr bowring by another such favour of fortune was sent to meet him there have you seen the count what has he received what says he to it to questions to this effect put by me to my friend an answer could not be refused one alone could be given—invisible invisible how so unless that by the count my good genius though so lately his own likewise was now taken for his evil genius thus it is that in the case in question while all use to the spanish nation was dependent upon and proportioned to publicity—on the one part has been seen exertion for the securing of it on the other part silence and secrecy continuing from beginning to end in letter sixth may have been observed two concluding questions put to the count   think you sir that without any interposition on your part circulation will be permitted to these letters   if not will your influence be employed in the endeavour to procure a permit or at least a connivance for the article you have been pleased to bespeak of me still for answer silence and in such a case silence it need scarce be said is a negative now as to the effect of this same negative nor yet if report be to be credited is silence on his own part the only instrument of suppression my honourable correspondent has at his command in madrid as elsewhere sits a board for the securing of whatsoever requires     to be secured in relation to the press on the part of all constituted authorities good conduct at all times and in every shape and for this purpose—for there as elsewhere such are the means employed—concealment of every such instance of bad conduct as may at any time have had place for a gilding to the pill here as elsewhere jury if i mistake not is the title conferred upon this board at madrid report gives to count toreno the direction of this instrument and such is the hold taken upon mens minds by this apprehension i am assured that should it happen to any of these letters to make their appearance at that chief seat of spanish liberty amendments adapted to existing circumstances must and will in the first place have been made in them so that to an extent more or less considerable what i am thus seen to have said will be—not what i have said but what i ought to have said all this while let not injustice be done in any shape to my honourable correspondent on nothing which he has done or left undone is any breach of promise chargeable what he promised was—that he would himself pay attention to what he received from me what he did not promise was—that any one else should have it in his power to do so curious enough unless my information is substantially incorrect is the contrast exhibited by the effect of these letters on the two most conspicuous characters in the cortes—count toreno and m calatrava that mr calatrava who on the occasions of greatest importance has been seen taking the lead yesterday says a private madrid letter of dec    yesterday calatrava made i am told a most eloquent eulogium on the illustrious the learned the humane bentham  how different this result from anything that could naturally have been expected in the case of my honourable correspondent gratitude for the distinction conferred on me added to esteem for the liberality manifested by an application such as hath been seen could not but concur in giving a certain smoothness to every passage by which in the course of the discussion his individuality was brought to view in the case of the chief penman of the projected code—after every smoothingiron that presented itself had been employed necessity still gave to everything an irremediable asperity far indeed from pleasant to the author of the letters was the invidious office which as the work advanced after the promise of it had been made the nature of the case was seen to have forced upon him the office of mischiefmaker between two colleagues never accordingly was sympathy more sincere than was mine as often as the predicament in which the two great statesmen had been placed by me offered itself to my view but on the one hand on a point of the most extensive influence stood the interest of the whole spanish nation not to speak of so many other nations in the background on the other hand the transient feelings of two individuals whose situations could not but be frequently exposing them to similar ones as to mr calatravas knowledge of the treatment he had been receiving at my hands—it is scarce necessary to observe that while count toreno was sitting at his elbow and it was known to other members of the cortes that a spanish translation was in hand few things could be less improbable than that anything which the honourable gentlemen was disposed to know of the matter should be unknown to him the more than friendly language in which as above the author of the provocation was spoken of—spoken of by him who was the object of it—should be present to the readers mind as often as any of the particulars by which the provocation was given present themselves to his eye or to his memory yet have i seen a letter it was indeed from a fellowcountryman of his and a declared adversary in which this forgiving statesman is charged with being of the number of those who do not bear their faculties altogether so meekly as could be wished magnanimity—prudence in this or that shape—to which of these two virtues or to a happy mixture of both shall so rare and exemplary a return of good for evil be ascribed to the hermit at london in his hermitage all this matter is perfectly opaque at madrid it is perhaps transparent     securities against misrule adapted to a mahommedan state and prepared with particular reference to tripoli in barbary now first published from the mss of jeremy bentham note by the editor the papers from which the following pages are extracted bear different dates ranging from august      to february      with the exception of the matter of chapter iv the originals are in detached masses to which the author does not seem to have applied any system of arrangement probably owing to the circumstance that the work was abruptly interrupted either because he found it could not be immediately applied to practical use or for some other cause the value of this fourth chapter which contains the securities in terminis is in the skill with which it is adapted to the uses of any reforming and enlightened monarch of a mahommedan and semibarbarous country who may wish to give his subjects the utmost advantages of a civilized and constitutional government which he can convey to them without resigning his own authority or infringing on the religious observances and national habits of the people the other chapters will be found to contain—a short analysis of the forms which misrule adopts under arbitrary governments a demonstration that any remedies that may be adopted must depend for their efficacy and existence on the force of public opinion an account of the manner in which that force may be brought to bear most efficaciously in such a direction and a calculation of the chances which any such project as that propounded has of being sincerely adopted besides the papers here printed there are in the same collection many others having particular reference to the state of the pachalic of tripoli and to individuals connected with its government at the time when the author wrote finding these to possess only a local interest which the lapse of time has materially diminished the editor considered that the better course would be to omit them the information contained in them was furnished by hassuna dghies ambassador from tripoli to london at whose request indeed the author had entered on the subject this man had by his amiable disposition extensive accomplishments and singularly enlightened political views endeared himself to many europeans who have lately had to lament his sudden death under circumstances which caused a suspicion that he was poisoned he was about thirty years old when he became acquainted with bentham and had been eight years resident in europe on his return to the east he became editor of the newspaper published at smyrna by the turkish government         chapter i preliminary explanations section i the word securities its superiority to others used for the like purpose generally speaking legislative arrangements that have been established or endeavoured to be established for the security of the governed against the governors have for their success trusted to force actually in hand if not to force in a state of independence as in the angloamerican united states at any rate to force in a state of resistance as in england in the petition of rights under charles i and the bill of rights passed on the transference of the crown from james ii to william iii and in france in the déclaration des droits de lhomme passed by the earliest of the successive national assemblies this sort of title has in itself one radical defect it presents no conception of the object which it has in view the object which it really has in view is as here expressed the affording to the governed security against misrule—that is bad government—on the part of the governors nothing can be clearer than the meaning given of the word security nothing for the present purpose can be clearer than the meaning given to the words bad government or as their signification is expressed by a single word misrule when instead of the word securities and misrule you employ such a word as right a cloud and that of a black hue overshadows the whole field the attitude you take is restless hostile and uneasy you show that you are in discontent but you show no clear grounds for your discontent what you give intimation of—though even to this no explicit expression is given is—that some rights of yours have been violated and that a determination has been formed by you not to sit still and see them violated any longer but these rights the violation of which is thus declared—from what source is it that they are derived to any such word as right no other conception can ever be attached but through the medium of a law or something to which the force of law is given from a real law comes a real right from an imagined law nothing more substantial can come than a correspondently imagined right lay out of the question the idea of law and all that you get by the use of the word right is a sound to dispute about i say i have a right i say you have no such right men may keep talking on at that rate till they are exhausted with vociferation and rage and when they have done be no nearer to the coming to a mutual conception and agreement than they were before on the other hand if no demand for security againt misrule can have place until and except in so far as some law is violated no such security can possibly be obtained in the case in which it is most needed for the case in which it is most needed is that in which the laws being altogether at the command of the rulers the very work of their hands no violation of law can be needed for the accomplishment of the misrule on the contrary the more frequent and extensive the violations of the law are the more extensive is the mitigation thus given to the evil for the production of which they were established by the phrase—securities against misrule all this perplexity is avoided but the great advantage of it with reference to practice is—that it is employable and with equally indisputable aptitude in every state of the society whatsoever is the condition of the governed under or in relation to the governors it may be employed by a sovereign representative body on the occasion of the establishment of the constitution of the state it may be employed not only under a monarchy but by a monarch altogether absolute unless in so far as by the arrangements in question a limit or at least a sort of bridle to his authority is regarded as being applied for the subjects to say to the sovereign—this or that is our right—say or do what you will—is as much as to say you are no longer sovereign for the sovereign to be made to say—you have such and such a right as against me or i have not such and such a right as against you is as much as to say i am no longer your sovereign on the occasion of the here proposed arrangements the course taken is—to put them in such a form that with the government still in the state of an abstract monarchy they may possess whatever chance of acceptance can in the nature of the case be possessed by any arrangements of the same or equally effectual import aiming at the same object but if even in so unfavourable a state of things a paper in this form may possess a chance of acceptance answering its wished for purpose—in proportion as the state of things is more and more favourable its aptitude will be still less and less exposed to doubt that otherwise than by fear of evil a sovereign can be brought in any way knowingly to tie up his own hands is generally speaking     too much to expect but what without such fear he may perhaps be brought to consent to—with less reluctance at least is to tie up in the way in question the hands of his agents in which case matters may be so managed as that without knowing it he may thus be made to throw obstacles in the way of his own steps in so far as they proceed in a sinister direction section ii misrule defined and explained misrule is bad government it comprehends whatsoever is opposite to good government a government is good in proportion as it contributes to the greatest happiness of the greatest number namely of the members of the community in which it has place rule may therefore come under the denomination of misrule in either of two ways either by taking for its object the happiness of any other number than the greatest or by being more or less unsuccessful in its endeavours to contribute to the greatest happiness of the greatest number no government having anywhere had place that had for its main object any other than the greatest happiness of those among whom the powers of government have from time to time been shared all governments that have hitherto had existence have had more or less of bad in them of all governments the worst have uniformly been those in which the powers of government have—all of them—been in the hands of one because in that case such government has had for its object the greatest happiness of that one member and to that object the happiness of all the other members has of course been made a continual sacrifice take any government whatever by rendering it less bad than it is whatsoever means are capable of being proposed or so much as thought of are reducible to one or other of two heads— st arrangements by which a change will be effected on the form of the government  d arrangements by which a check will be applied to the power of the ruling functionary or functionaries without any such change arrangements which belong to the first of these heads constitute a seperate subject of consideration the set of arrangements herein proposed under the notion of their serving more or less in the character of securities against misgovernment otherwise called misrule require not any such changes the supposition on which they are grounded is that by one means or other without any such change the ruler or rulers may by one consideration or other be induced to lend their power to the purpose of giving them the sanction of law not therefore to misrule in every shape is it in the nature of the here proposed arrangements to apply a remedy at least in a direct and immediate way not to misrule in any of those shapes in which it bears upon the members of the community in an undistinguishable mass not for example to lavish expenditure and to unnecessary and therefore unjust war evils towards obviating which nothing can be done by any means other than a change in the very form of government to those cases alone has it any direct and immediate application in which the evil comes home to the feelings of particular and those determinate and in each case assignable individuals considered in its application to assignable individuals misrule may be termed vexation the persons considered as the authors of it being persons clothed with power the vexation may be termed oppression in so far as from the burden thus imposed benefit in any shape is received by the authors or by any whom they are in this way disposed to favour the oppression is depredation as to the authors though to a boundless degree and in a conspicuous and avowed manner the only persons in whom oppression and thence depredation can have for its authors are those by whom in the state in question the supreme power is possessed yet to a great and indeterminate amount not only their several subordinates—instruments of and sharers in that same power—but the rich in general possess as such and to an amount rising in proportion to their riches in addition to that desire which is in all men the faculty of giving birth to those same evils the shapes in which vexation is here attempted to be combated are not all the shapes in which the evil is capable of showing itself for against these thus taken in the aggregate security more or less effectual is already in every country taken and must therefore in the country in question be on the present occasion supposed provided by the existing laws calumnies for example or personal injuries or injuries to mental or personal rights are among the subjects not here taken on hand as being of such a nature that the particular remedies here provided are either needless or inapplicable with relation to them the only vexations belonging to the present purpose are those which on those over whom power is exercised are in a particular manner liable to be inflicted by those by whom the same power is possessed meantime these being the same persons at whose disposal everything is that bears the name of law to seek to afford by means of new laws security against those persons to seek to afford by means of new laws security against those at whose disposal those laws will be when made is an enterprise which to a first view can scarcely fail to wear the face of absurdity as well may it be said seek to obtain security against the attacks of an armed man by means of other arms placed in that same mans hands such it must be confessed would be the absurdity if it were necessary that the armour in the manufacturing of which he will be requested to concur should be armour of the offensive kind or even of the effectually defensive kind and that intended to be in any manner employed against himself     but on his part this conception is not a necessary nor altogether certain one against depredation and oppression from which he derives not in any shape any benefit—against depredation and oppression exercised by and for the benefit of the rich in general or by even his own instruments and other subordinates in particular it may happen to him not to have any strong or determinate reluctance to see a tolerably essential security provided and as against any oppression which it is or may have come to be his pleasure to exercise what may happen is—that it will not be very plainly visible to him how it is possible that any supposed security can in reality be efficacious but more of this when the proposed remedy together with the evil in all its shapes have been distinctly brought to view whatsoever may be the chance which the here proposed remedy affords of being productive of the wished effects the smallness of it affords not any ground of objection to it for under a monarchy such being the nature of the case as not to admit of any other the option is—this or none the great difficulty is in obtaining the concession should that point be accomplished its efficacy to no inconsiderable degree need not be despaired of abundant are the instances which history affords of concessions having the same object some in which the engagements taken by these concessions have been grossly and continually violated still however there is sufficient reason to think that without this safeguard such as it was the instances of oppression would have been still more numerous and afflictive the charters by which the concessions were expressed afforded a determinate standard of reference—a rallying point if even in this case paper when employed in the character of a breastplate of defence against the sword was not altogether destitute of efficacy still less need its efficacy be despaired of in the present case for in none of these instances was any such attention applied to the making the most of the only possible remedy as will be seen employed in the system of arrangements here proposed section iii misrule—its shapes the here proposed system of arrangements has for its object as above set forth the applying to such of the evils as are most apt to be produced by the immediate agency of the monarch or those in authority under him such remedies as present the least unpromising chance of obtaining the application of them at his hands one word—misrule—will serve for conveying a general conception of the disease another word—publicity for conveying the like conception of the remedy the only remedy which it will be seen without a change in the form of the government the nature of the disease admits of thus much for a general conception but under both heads some explanations present themselves as necessary necessary in the first place for rendering the ideas clear and determinate in the next place for showing that it is to this one recipe publicity that relief in every shape in which the nature of the disease admits of it is referable some observations will follow in the view of showing in what way application may be made of it to most advantage having for their object the showing what the chance is that the remedy will be found obtainable first as to the shapes in which the evil is capable of presenting itself shape   sufferers all determinate the individuals all determinate and assignable examples—homicide confinement banishment in the aggregate of this suffering consists the evil of the first order for distinctions sake it may be called purely private shape   sufferers altogether indeterminate examples—waste of public money act of engaging in an unnecessary war in this case the evil may be called purely public shape   immediate sufferers determinate but the greater part of the evil composed of the sufferings of individuals altogether indeterminate examples—  political gagging i e obstructing in any way the communication between mind and mind for the melioration of the common lot on any subject of discourse more especially on a political subject   national debilitation—weakening the means of defence and security in the hands of the people against injury at whatsoever other hands those of the rulers themselves not excepted in this case the evil may be said to be mixed or public through the medium of private through the sides of one individual the public is wounded that is to say all other individuals are as well those who do not feel the wound as those who do under the general name vexation may be included every political evil in so far as the consideration of it is confined to the sufferings of determinate and assignable individuals namely the individual persons who are the immediate sufferers by the individual mischievous act in question oppression is vexation considered in so far as the hand of power is considered as occupied in the production of it thus if inflicted without sufficient warrant i e without being necessary to the preserving the community from evil of still superior magnitude—homicide confinement and banishment are—if produced by a hand not armed with legal power acts of vexation simply if by a hand armed with legal power—if for example by the hand of the sovereign acts of oppressive vexation or in one word oppression in oppression by the hands of rulers two stages are discernible and require to be distinguished by oppression in its first stage the disease is produced as above by oppression   0 in the second and last stage the remedy is excluded or endeavoured to be excluded by the same act whereby oppression in this its last stage is exercised oppression in the first stage may also be exercised it is so in most instances in those several cases in which the evil has been spoken of as being of a mixed or public and private nature the afflicting hand wounding the public through the sides of individuals examples—  political gagging   national debilitation as above in so far as the suffering by loss or otherwise to the party vexed and oppressed is attended with profit to the oppressor or other vexer or any one whom it is his design thereby to favour oppression has the effect of depredation thus it is that in the case where a community is plundered by its rulers by the support given to an unnecessary war suppose two such wars and the sums extorted for the purpose of the war the same in both the one in which depredation to the greatest amount has had place is thus far the least mischievous if during the course of the war a million of money is paid for gunpowder to the makers better it is for the community that the half of it be put in the shape of profit into the pocket of the makers than that the whole be converted into gas producing or not producing the destruction which it was intended to produce only to aid conception are the above suppositions put for how far they are from being ever exemplified is sufficiently manifest the modes of oppression against which security is here endeavoured to be provided may be more particularly enumerated as follows†   vexation on the account of religion or say religious persecution nb in this particular case what may happen is—that the sovereign if from oppression on this account he does not derive any particular gratification may be content to deprive his successors of it while by his own act he stands deprived of the power only because he has no desire to make use of it they will by the same act stand deprived of it even though they should have the desire to make use of it in this case therefore a direct promise of nonexercise or even a direct appropriate abdication may not without hope be sued for at his hands   secret confinement viz of the person of an individual confinement namely within the walls of a prison or within any other less narrow place   secret banishment i e by forcible exportation or in any other way exclusion of an individual from the whole of the dominion of the state in question or from this or that part of it   secret homicide‡   mysterious disappearance namely disappearance of an individual from a cause as yet unknown it must be any of the above three—confinement banishment or death   official depredation§   extortion of personal service∥   obstruction of intellectual communication¶       national debilitation  0 violation of private documents† chapter ii public opinion the sole remedy—parallel between the publicopinion tribunal and the official judicatories section i general view of the publicopinion tribunal thus much as to the disease now as to the remedy of the two only accessible remedies that the nature of the case admits of the only one that belongs to the present purpose for conveying a general idea of the remedy a single word—publicity—may for the moment serve but before the nature and operation of it can be conceived with any tolerable degree of distinctness and clearness considerable explanations will unavoidably be necessary publicity but to what acts applied answer in the first place to the acts of rulers in the next place to the opinions formed in relation to them by subjects publicity to the acts—knowledge of the acts being necessary to the existence of the opinions the existence of such publicity being supposed and the degree of it perfect in what way does it contribute to the object in question—namely the affording security against misrule answer be the acts of the government ever so arbitrary the subject many in proportion as they form and make public their respective opinions in relation to them act in so far in the character of judges judges sitting in judgment over the conduct of and in this way exercising rule over the rulers themselves exercising in any way rule over their rulers how then is it that they can remain subjects answer in the way of direct mandate and coercive powers—no in no such way can they give direction to the conduct of these same rulers yes in the way of indirect and gentle power or in one word influence for in this way do our children at an age in which nature places them under the absolute dominion of their parents operate on the conduct of those same parents but the particular way in which the effect is brought about may call for further explanation operating thus as judges the members of this same community may in their aggregate capacity be considered as constituting a sort of judicatory or tribunal call it for example the publicopinion tribunal taken in its utmost latitude this tribunal would include all of them without exception but of no question on any occasion can any such multitude in such their capacity by physical possibility actually take cognizance those less than a certain age and the infirm for example not to mention any other classes cannot but be excepted only to a certain part of the whole number and that perhaps generally speaking the smallest will the physical faculty of taking cognizance of any such political question be confined if then all the members of the community without exception were to be considered as members of this same half and half imaginary tribunal those who are not physically incapable of taking part in its deliberations must be considered as constituting a committee of that same aggregate and multitudinous body—a committee invested     with the powers of the whole a committee in which as in a sort of committee every now and then exemplified in the proceedings of the english house of commons as many of the members of the house as enter have voices again take this or that particular operation of those who all of them possess the physical capacity of entering on it a certain portion only and that most commonly the smallest portion will actually take cognizance of it if then those who might take such cognizance are considered as constituting a committee of that same body then those who thus actually do take part in the business may be considered as constituting a subcommittee the greater the suffering produced by any act of oppression the greater provided it has been made known to them is the number of the individuals who in the character of members of this committee are likely to take cognizance of the affair in the first instance the greater the number of these members of this committee who having joined in the cognizance thus taken pass condemnation on the deed the greater the number of those other persons who on the authority of this report take cognizance not of the affair at large but of the conduct of the actors whoever they may be in the act of oppression so far as to concur in the opinion—the judgment the sentence of condemnation—passed upon those oppressive agents in consideration of their oppressive act the greater the number of those who concur and join in the provisional sentence the greater the number of those who are likely to concur and join in the definitive sentence as to the sentence whatsoever may be the individual gradation of punishment the ultimate punishment which it is in the power of this tribunal to inflict on the oppressors whosoever they may be consists in the withdrawing from them altogether that obedience to the extent of which that of their power is correspondent and commensurate the subtraction of obedience suppose it universal—the corresponding power is by the very supposition at an end this same subtraction is according to the description thus given of it a mere negative act but in the production of the effect arrived at by it positive acts directed to the same end have place or come to be exercised the extinction of the life of the oppressorinchief for example may be the punishment indicated by the sentence executioners any number of the members appointed for the purpose or even this or that single one of them by the adherents of the oppressor the corresponding sentence with the execution of it will of course be objected to on the ground of irregularity but to act against this word irregularity some other will be found by the concurrers in and approvers of the sentence in england for example if the king were among the individuals upon whom the supposed sentence had been passed and execution given to it accordingly a natural and constitutional objection would be that to render it regular and constitutional an act called an act of attainder was necessary—an act of attainder passed like every other act of parliament by the joint consent and concurrence of the kings most excellent majesty as well as that of the lords and commons of great britain and ireland almost all of them in one way or other in a state of dependence on his good pleasure and that his majesty not having been pleased to give his consent to any such act the sentences so passed and executed are thereby null and void by any regular tribunal composed of judges placed by his said most excellent majesty this objection would be held valid and on the individual by whom the sentence in question had so been executed on the body of his said majesty a sentence including amongst other things the extinction of the life of this irregularly commissioned executioner would accordingly be executed on the other hand by the member or members of the irregularly constituted tribunal of public opinion under whose authority the sentence of extinction against the monarch had so been executed the objection would as surely be overruled on the part of this or any other malefactor it would have been perfectly regular for him to have given his assent to the sentence passed upon himself but though perfectly regular it is by no means usual it is so far from being so that if any such assent were waited for it may be stated as a matter of certainty that neither to this purpose of extinction of life nor to the purpose of any the slightest restriction would any bar be opposed in any case to the utmost quantity of suffering which it would be physically speaking in the power of the supreme ruler to inflict on the individuals subject to his power in the legal sense of that same imposing appellation in the above strain for example thought and acted the members of that section of the publicopinion tribunal by whose warrant by the denomination of a warrant by the members of the high court of justice the life of charles the first of england was extinguished at westminster in the year      of this sort among the punishments which it belongs to the power of the tribunal of public opinion to inflict is that which stands highest in the scale but beneath it stand others in number and variety indefinite among them are—  all obstructions to the exaction of contributions the produce of which is placed at the disposal of the sovereign   all obstructions capable of being opposed to the execution of the judgments of the several regularly constituted tribunals   all modes of annoyance by which in retribution for the demonstrations of hatred and contempt received demonstrations of correspondent hatred and contempt are rendered   invectives said and sung   invectives written and posted up   of whatever liberty is left to the subjects     to the members of the community at large by the laws and practices of the government—use made to the purpose of opposing and so far as may be frustrating these same laws and that same practice all this while be the quantity of suffering ever so enormous so long as regularity and nothing else is looked to—all this while to the acts of government by which all this misery is produced on the score of regularity at least nothing can be excepted of whatsoever is done by the superior authority of the state or by any subordinate authority by its order or with its allowance in how great a degree soever productive of human suffering and destructive of human happiness regularity is an inseparable quality and accompaniment irregularity of whatsoever is done by the tribunal of public opinion in opposition to anything which is done by the constituted authorities irregular it is in whatsoever degree it has the effect of diminishing the quantity of suffering produced by the regular tribunals and is in this or any other way productive of addition to the net amount of human happiness in so far then as by the ruling members of this irregular tribunal their own interest is rightly understood the option is throughout between regularity and happiness by those by whom regularity is preferred to happiness this same irregular tribunal will be hated even in so far as fear permits—despised and everything done that can be done to diminish and if possible annihilate its power those who desire to see any check whatsoever to the power of the government under which they live or any limit to their sufferings under it must look for such check and limit to the source of the publicopinion tribunal irregular though it be and to the degree in which it has been seen fictitious to this place of refuge or to none for no other has the nature of things afforded to this tribunal they must on every occasion make appeal to this tribunal they must on every occasion give what contribution it is in their power to give for do what they can never can they give to it too much praise never can they ever give to it enough never can they give to it so much as for the greatest happiness of the greatest number it would be desirable that it should have in the assertion implied in the giving as above to a certain portion of the members of the community the several denominations—publicopinion tribunal—committee of the publicopinion tribunal—and subcommittee of the publicopinion tribunal—there is a mixture of the real and the fictitious in this statement what it may be asked then are the points that are real what those which are fictitious why with that which is real mix up anything fictitious of these two questions the latter may with more convenience be answered first say then from the necessity of the case for of that which is real it is not possible to give any clear explanation but by the help of something which is fictitious the imperfection is one that is inherent in the very nature of language too often is the language of fiction employed for no other purpose than deceit but this case is not of the number not so much for avoidance of imputation as for clearness of explanation an endeavour will now be made to draw the line of separation throughout to point out in these appellatives what there is that agrees with abstract truth—what there is that is metaphysical and fictitious for this purpose the plainest course that can be taken is to confront the scattered body thus newly placed upon the list of judicatories with those to which the title will not by any one be refused to bring them to view in conjunction giving indication all along of their several points of agreement and difference under so many determinate heads placing of course in front the ordinary sort of judicatory and making it the standard of reference section ii attributes of a judicatory the more closely the nature of the publicopinion tribunal is looked into the more clear and strong will be the conception of its efficiency and consequently its existence when announced it will be apt to present itself as nothing more than the offspring of imagination and language the cause and reason of this is that on no occasion are the several members of it seen sitting altogether nor in their official and judicial capacity are they so much as capable of sitting and taking part in the business at the same time or in the same edifice or enclosure or when at a distance of maintaining anything like a regular course of correspondence it wears therefore the colour of fictitiousness but it possesses the substance of reality this will be rendered manifest in proportion as observation is taken of the operations by the performance of which the ordinary judicatories commonly so called—those in the instance of which no one could think of contesting the denomination—are characterized to a judicatory as such belong certain functions these functions are exercised by the performance of correspondent operations to a judicatory as such belongs a certain mass of power namely the power necessary to the performance of these same operations to the will of the several members of every judicatory applies moreover a certain mass of ruling interest and in the exercise of their power they will of course be guided by the direction in which their will is acted on by this same ruling interest to the head of ruling interest belongs that of pay since the ruling interest by which they are respectively actuated depends in a great degree on their pay if pay they have on the manner in which it is connected with their continuance in their situations and the line of conduct therein maintained by them     as to the operations or functions they may be thus enumerated   receiving claims and accusations claims referring to what is called the civil branch i e the nonpenal branch of judicature—accusations to the penal   receiving oppositions and defences—oppositions to claims defences against accusations   receiving compiling collecting and storing evidence viz in support of oppositions as well as claims of defences as well as accusations   hearing or reading arguments or say reasons of parties or advocates or both   forming on each occasion an opinion or say a judgment with a correspondent will   giving expression to such judgment and will   giving execution and effect to such judgment and will among different judicatories it is evident may these functions in various ways be distributed but to the attainment of the ends of justice it is necessary that in some way or other they should be all performed attached to these essential operations may be other incidental ones such as entertaining applications for delay and so forth but to the catalogue of essential ones it will be found that the above belong and that there are no others that do belong to it as to the word power before it can serve to bring to view in any distinct form the attributes comprehended under it certain particulars serving as sources of division will require to be brought to view namely   the several fields over which it exercises itself   the means of efficiency—means by the use of which it gives to itself execution and effect   as to fields of exercise to the power of every efficient official judicatory belong two distinguishable fields   the local which may also be termed the territorial topographical or geographical field   the logical termed also the metaphysical in the logical may moreover be distinguished   the corporeal subjects included in it namely the persons and things   the incorporeal subjects namely the suits or demands of which cognizance is taken i e the claims and accusations   as to means of efficiency they are the means of operating with effect on the abovementioned subjects namely—on immoveable portions of territory moveable things and persons on things by means operating on body alone namely physical force on persons by these same means with the addition of forces operating on mind namely prospect of punishment i e of eventual evil in any shape and prospect of reward on the aggregate amplitude of these several fields and means of efficiency depends the aggregate amplitude or say the magnitude of the mass of power belonging to any official judicatory in the same elements will be found the measure of the power of this unofficial judicatory—the publicopinion tribunal as to ruling interest it is a topic that will be apt to present itself as more new than agreeable when applied to an official judicatory it does not however the less indisputably belong to it as well as to this allcomprehensive though unofficial judicatory the publicopinion tribunal and in this one of its attributes will this allcomprehensive though unofficial judicatory be seen to possess its strongest title to regard the interest of the publicopinion tribunal—that is to say of the aggregate number of its members—the ruling interest can never be in discordance with the interest of the aggregate number of the members of the particular state or community in question whereas the interest—whether we take the aggregate interest of the whole number of official tribunals or their several particular and distinct interests that is to say the aggregate of the interests of the several members—can never be in complete accordance with that same universal interest such is the identity on the part of the real net interest and in so far as correctly understood and capable of being pursued it is the net interest that in every individual and in every aggregate of individuals will on each occasion be the actual ruling interest as to the attribute of power the existence of it will be more readily recognised in the gross namely by the contemplation of its effects than comprehended in detail by reference made to the corresponding elements in the power of a judicatory of the official kind but to its being clearly apprehended and conceived a glance at these details is indispensable in the first instance however thus much may be remarked of it in the gross namely that by its effects the reality of the power itself is demonstrated and by the reality of the power the reality of the judicatory to which the power is ascribed and attributed for of that which has no existence there can be no attributes section iii constitution of this unofficial judicatory to every official judicatory the above several attributes will be allowed to belong without dispute no less truly will they be seen to belong to the unofficial judicatory first as to the members in this first point will be seen to lie the greatest or rather the only difficulty in this part of the picture reality wears somewhat the air of fiction of the object designated by the appellation of publicopinion tribunal familiar as the expression is the existence will be apt to be suspected of being no other than figurative and merely nominal on the other hand the name of it is not more perfectly familiar than the existence of its power is universally recognised and of an object the power of which is     admitted to deny the existence would be selfcontradiction even in regard to members the only difficulty lies in the determination of the individuals to whom on each occasion the appellation can without impropriety be ascribed and even on this point the uncertainty may not unfrequently be seen shared in by the official judicatories be this as it may a function supposes a functionary—one functionary at the least an operation an operator ere any account can be rendered of the operation of the unofficial judicatory some individual or individuals must be brought to view as and for so many members of this judicatory—members by whom the several operations are performed at the head of these as exercising the function in question in a manner the most conspicuous sits the editor of a newspaper in which the press however legally handcuffed otherwise is to the purpose of being capable of affording an example of this sort of judicature practically free say for example an english newspaper an angloamerican united states newspaper is to this purpose legally as well as practically free but it being in europe less known the english newspaper will be the more convenient standard of reference but of the unofficial judicatory an english newspaper editor is but one member amongst millions to show in what way he is the head it will be necessary to show in what relation this one individual stands to the millions in a word of what different classes in relation to so many different purposes this judicatory taken in its totality is composed to show in short the composition of the whole judicatory take any political community—the british empire for example of the aggregate of all the persons belonging to it ruler and subjects taken together will the publicopinion tribunal be composed and not only the inhabitants of the two islands but the inhabitants of the several distant dependencies in the once four quarters—now five great portions—of the globe must to this as to other purposes be considered as included but not to speak of those who do not take a part in the consideration of subjectmatters of the sort in question a large proportion of the number—to wit children below a certain age is composed of those who by physical incapacity are rendered physically incapable of taking such part distinction   those members who belong to the tribunal in respect of interest and future practice only and those who belong to it in respect of personal practice among those who belong to it in respect of personal practice may again be distinguished these classes—viz   the merely speaking members   those who are not only speaking but also reading members   those who are not only speaking and reading but also writing members   those who are not only speaking reading and writing but also printing and publishing members the class of merely speaking members forms the basis of the several others it cannot anywhere at any time be extinguished if it could be extinguished european governments are not wanting in which it would most assuredly be extinguished—at least endeavoured to be so for instance by cutting tongues out it might be and would most effectually be extinguished but tongues and the use of them are indispensable to the performance of the labour without which the stock of the several instruments of felicity by means of which the felicity of the ruling one and of the subruling few is reaped could not be brought into existence by any such extinction as this the interest of these same rulers would according to their conception of it be not served but disserved accordingly no such extinction has ever yet been endeavoured at or seems at all likely ever to be endeavoured at not so by the general extinction of those other classes saving and excepting such a portion of them respectively as under the direction of the supreme ruler may be necessary to be employed in the production and preparation of these same useful and necessary instruments and securing him in the undisturbed possession of them and in the application of them by him and for him to their respectively appropriate purposes so long as human beings come in presence of each other it is impossible generally speaking to prevent their conversing with each other and so long as they converse with each other on any subject it is not possible to prevent them from conversing occasionally upon political subjects in the interior of a palace even without the trouble of cutting their tongues out men may be converted into mutes accordingly in palaces in which the art and science of legitimate rule has been carried to perfection a transformation of this sort is known to have been accomplished but in places other than palaces for preventing conversation from taking any such dangerous direction no means does the nature of the case afford but the employment of spies but here occur divers difficulties spies adequate to the purpose would require to be no less numerous than soldiers and to be even more highly paid and how well soever paid among them—no one can say in how large a proportion—might be those who seeing it necessary to deceive somebody would prefer deceiving the universal enemy to deceiving their respective friends moreover the more strict and effective the     system of discipline employed in the extinction of the several classes of publishers writers and readers the more apt would this policy be to become the subject of frequent not to say constant conversation among the classes of speakers whose existence it would never be possible to extinguish if all the members of the political community in question be considered as being every one of them so many members of the publicopinion tribunal those who are physically speaking not incapable of acting as such may be considered as constituting a standing committee of the whole body invested with the powers of the whole what would however be more simple in conception and would be more exactly conformable to direct truth would be to consider the whole aggregate of those who are physically speaking not incapable of taking a part in the consideration of public affairs as composing and constituting the entire judicatory invested with the power in trust for themselves and the several other members of the community at large these then constituting the entire body a committee of that same body will be the aggregate composed of all those who at any given point of time do actually concur in taking cognizance of the affairs in question or any part of them and that whether in the way of publication writing reading or oral converse and of the general committee so many subcommittees may be conceived as constituted—so many subcommittees as there are aggregates of individuals who on any occasion in any place take actual cognizance of this or that political operation to whatever part of the field of government it appertains of these several subcommittees the several individuals by whom respectively a literary work of any kind bearing in any way upon any part of the field of government is published may be considered as so many presiding or say leading members or in one word presidents but among these presidents a political newspaper editor being the only one in constant authority is as it were president of all these presidents king of these kings lord of these lords of the dominion of liberty and independence real and not sham representatives of all who buy and of all who read with sympathy their respective publications the product of their respective labours among the infinity of subcommittees of the publicopinion tribunal as above indicated three as being the most efficient ones require to be distinguished these are—   the subcommittee of general superintendance president a newspaper editor other members his customers and readers and in particular his correspondents these last belong to the catalogue of leading members   subcommittees of justice or say judicature members the several individuals who being present in the several judicatories during the carrying on of the several businesses take interest in what is going forward in such sort as to form an opinion of approbation or disapprobation in relation to any part of it   subcommittees of religion members the persons present at the several sermons or other discourses held on the subject of religion by the several officiating priests also those by whom the several works on that subject are read or heard in places other than those which are appropriated to this sort of occupation in one and the same number of an english newspaper may commonly be seen the united product of the labours of a number of these subcommittees thus much may it is hoped suffice for the purpose of illustration and for the giving to our conception of the subject such degree of clearness as the nature of the case admits section iv functions or operations of the supreme unofficial compared with those of the official judicatories the several operations included in this part of the business of an english newspaper being thus taken as and for a specimen and sample of the functions of a subcommittee of the publicopinion tribunal let us see in what way the mode in which these several functions as thus performed by it agrees with and in what way it differs from the mode in which these same functions are most commonly performed in and by an official judicatory to the present purpose they may be enumerated as follows—   receiving claims and accusations   receiving oppositions and defences   receiving compelling collecting and storing evidence   receiving and hearing or reading arguments of parties litigant or advocates   forming opinions or judgments on these with correspondent will   giving expression to such judgments and will   giving impression to such expression   giving diffusion to such impression   giving execution and effect to such judgments and will distinct in themselves are all these several operations and by the ordinary judicatories who have the time of other men as well as their own at their disposal as well as the channels of communication at command they are performed at different times and in regular succession as above displayed in and by the publicopinion tribunal a member of it not having generally speaking any channel of communication or the time of any other person at his command these several operations cannot respectively be performed but as occasion offers and when occasion does offer it must be made the most of and the several operations all of them or as many as can with advantage be performed at once     follow under the above several heads a few observations having for their object the bringing to view the principal points of agreement and difference between the one sort of judicature and the other   receiving accusations in the newspaper in question an allegation is made of misconduct in a certain shape as having had place on the part of a certain functionary or set of functionaries the accuser whether the editor himself or a correspondent makes to newspapers no difference here the function of receiving accusations stands exemplified   receiving defences of the exemplification made of the exercise of this function indication will be made presently   on this same occasion a correspondent perhaps makes mention of this or that particular as having fallen within his own knowledge the name though not signed—having for the security of editor and printer or not having been privately communicated here the function of reception of evidence and at the same time that of the impression of it and that of the diffusion of it stand exemplified at the same time whether directly by means of appropriate and direct questions or at any rate indirectly and virtually by means of apposite affirmations as above the party accused is called on either to confess the act thus indicated with the inculpative circumstances and at the same time directly or virtually to confess the culpability of it or to deny the act or some inculpative circumstance or circumstances belonging to it or admitting what is above to argue in justification of the act the next day or next but one suppose the party thus called on argues in justification of the act and at the same time either directly avers the having done it or by his silence or the turn given to his argument virtually admits it here the function of compelling evidence stands exemplified on the former day intimation was moreover given of certain other persons as having been percipient witnesses of the act or this or that inculpative circumstance belonging to it and as being thereby rendered capable if so disposed of becoming in relation thereto reporting narrating or say deposing witnesses here a commencement of the function of collecting evidence stands exemplified purchasers in number more or less considerable being in the habit of filing and preserving the numbers of the newspaper in question as they come out here the function of keeping in store—in a word of storing the stock of evidence in question stands exemplified   with the evidence thus received compelled collected and kept in store is commonly at the same time mixed up and thus received and kept in store in some proportion or other matter on both sides bearing the character of argument argument having for its object the bringing to view either the probability or improbability of the alleged act or of the alleged inculpatory circumstances or the impropriety or propriety of it or both together each party by the argument he delivers directly or virtually calling for counterargument on the other side here then the function of receiving arguments at the hands of parties litigant or their advocates or both stands exemplified the function of reading or hearing these arguments—this mass of argument together with the correspondent mass of evidence is in this case left to the purchasers and other readers or hearers of the newspaper each one exercising it for himself or this or that of his associates   and   having received from his correspondent the abovementioned letter and thereupon the several other masses of evidence and argument abovementioned the editor in the course of the controversy forms and declares some opinion or say judgment of his own provisional or definitive in favour of the accusing or the defending side here the function of forming and that of giving expression to such opinion and judgment stand exemplified the judgment suppose is a judgment declaring conviction and passing sentence of condemnation on the party so accused but in such judgment and sentence of condemnation is included an opinion that by the party thus condemned a disreputable act has been committed an act whereby he will be lowered in the estimation of other members of this same unofficial judicatory in an indeterminable and incalculable number in consequence of which depression he will in the natural course of things be deprived in some sort and purpose or other of their good offices and upon occasion even be exposed in some sort or purpose to positive ill offices at their hands and in such judgment is naturally at least if not necessarily and virtually included the declaration of a will or say a desire that such shall be the result by this president and leading member of this subcommittee of the publicopinion tribunal by which cognizance is taken of this affair—by him not to speak of others who agree with him—expression is given to the judgment so formed but by others in uncalculable number by whom no judgment is expressed—a judgment on the subject—the like judgment suppose—is formed but in such instances the judgment being formed though no expression is ever given to it a correspondent will as above is naturally formed—a correspondent will—whence result subtraction of good offices and performance of ill offices as above   and   from the newspaper editor the aggregate of this mixed mass of evidence and argument together with the accompanying preliminary matter as above and the expression     given to the judgment and will as above receive of course impression and diffusion in the way of his business here then the several functions of giving impression and diffusion to the judgment and will and to the expression given to them stand exemplified   in ways and by members of this same unofficial judicatory in a number altogether out of the reach not only of general perceptive enumeration but of calculation execution and effect will continually and as it were of course be given to the judgment in question namely by the consequent will and ill offices positive and negative as above here then the function of giving effect and execution to the opinion or say the judgment in question stands exemplified from a review of the above several functions or operations may be formed a deduction of no small practical moment this is the prodigious importance absolute and comparative of the situation and functions of this president and leading member of so many subcommittees of this not the less supreme and allcomprehensive because unofficial judicatory the importance absolute and more particularly in a comparative point of view comparison had with all other members of all other and whatsoever classes as abovementioned next to him in the order of importance comes the author of this or that work belonging to some department of the field of politics—of that vast field the whole of which lies within the dominion and is every day coming under the survey of the unofficial functionary section v power of the unofficial compared with that of the official judicatory i means of execution and effect among the elements constitutive of political power this though in the list of them it occupies the last place is the first to be looked to this being the effectual one without a clear conception of which no clear conception of the others can be formed of the means of execution and effect the aggregate efficiency will depend   upon the number of persons disposed to concur in contributing to the effect   partly upon the internal force physical and mental of each   partly upon the quantity of external physical force at the command of each i e of the sorts of things capable of giving increase to human physical force such as arms ammunition c   partly upon the facility of acting in concert   partly upon the smallness of all opposing force   partly upon the magnitude of the evil to which the possessor of the power has the physical faculty of subjecting the individuals subject to it in case of noncompliance and obedience   partly upon the comparative magnitude of such evil viz as compared with the magnitude of the evil to which in the case of a rival possessor of power such rival is able to subject the common subject or subordinate compare now under these several heads the condition of the unofficial judicatory with that of the official ones considered separately or in the aggregate   in respect of the number of persons disposed in the character of agents to concur in giving execution and effect to the opinions judgments and wills in question in this particular the advantage which the unofficial judicatory possesses when compared with the official judicatories all of them put together is at first mention manifest of those by whom on any occasion the judgment and will of the former have been formed and those whom it finds disposed to concur in giving sanction and effect to them some with more energy others with less the number is exactly the same it is the aggregate number of the whole community   the same may be said of the aggregate amount of internal force physical and mental   the same may be said of that portion of the aggregate means of execution which is composed of objects belonging to the class of things for to the aggregate of the individuals abovementioned as belonging on this occasion to the class of persons belongs the aggregate of the individual objects belonging to the class of things   so likewise as to the magnitude of the evil to which in quality of possessors of the power that is to say of the abovementioned elementary ingredients of it the members of the judicatory in question have the physical faculty of subjecting those at whose charge the execution and effect in question are to be given in case of noncompliance or disobedience for in this magnitude is comprehended without any exception or limitation the aggregate amount of all the evil to which in what shape soever it is in the power of man to subject man   so likewise in the case of competition as to the magnitude of the evil to which the members of this unofficial judicatory and the members of the several official judicatories its rivals are capable separately and collectively to produce at the charge of any individual or individuals considered in the character of their common subjects ii personal branch of the corporeal field of the power of a judicatory under the head which applies to members has been brought to view the allcomprehensiveness of this branch of the unofficial judicatory as compared with any official judicatory or judicatories not only sharers of this power but contributors to its magnitude because so many ready executors of its will are the members of this unofficial judicatory every one of them under that same head has also     been brought to view the faculty which in each political community this unofficial judicatory has of receiving reinforcements to an unlimited amount from the members of the like judicatories in the several other political communities having place on the surface of the globe compare this element of its power with the correspondent element of the most powerful official judicatory in the same political state the power of the official judicatory will be still the inferior no such faculty of receiving reinforcements to an unlimited amount from other states belongs to it correspondent to the extent in respect of the number of the individuals of whose force the force of this aggregate is composed is the extent of the number of those on whom the force is capable of being exercised on the one hand all enter into the composition of the public force so on the other hand all behold all in a state of subjection to this same public force iii incorporeal field of jurisdiction of a judicatory—extent of the classes of suits or causes appertaining to it i e of the rights on which claims may be grounded and the wrongs on which accusations may be grounded in the case of the official judicatories the rights which their field of jurisdiction embraces are those only in which proceeding according to the system of procedure pursued by them more good than evil with reference to the interests they are employed to support may it is supposed be produced by their interference and so in the case of accusations by the unofficial judicatory cognizance is taken not only of all these same rights and wrongs claims and accusations but also of all others in which the interests of the community in respect of the several individuals included in it are in the opinion of the several members of the standing committee of the judicatory and of its several subcommittees as above concerned thus much as to the points in which this unofficial judicatory is superior to the official judicatories now as to those in which it lies under a disadvantage   in the first place taken in its totality it labours under a division—a constant and invariably established division in respect of interests two parties constituting so many sections—the democratical and the aristocratical are destined in all communities and at all times to have place in it the interests of the few—the extraopulent and therefore if by no other means the powerful few being in a state of opposition to that of the many that of the consuming class which produces nothing to that of the producing class which produces more than it consumes—hence it is that whatever power is in the hands of the aristocratical class over and above that which is in the hands of the same number of those of the democratical class constitutes a sort of disease with which the body politic taken in its totality is afflicted by the original structure of its constitution this body is destined to labour under two distinguishable diseases having for their cause or causes the inward resistance of two intestine sets of enemies one set composed of the ultraindigent class of malefactors who being as such weak and powerless and objects of general disgust are thereby exposed to punishment the other composed of the ultraopulent who being as such powerful and objects of general respect are thereby exempted and preserved from punishment of both of these depredation is the characteristic occupation by the ultraindigent it is ever acted on upon a small scale by the ultraopulent upon the largest scale intestine depredators of this class being innate accompaniments of the constitution of every political community they exist nor can they ever cease to exist in a representative democracy even though constituted in the purest form possible in that form they may be kept under in such sort as not to be productive of any considerable mischief but they cannot consistently with the security of the whole ever be altogether extirpated thus stands the matter in the only sort of government which has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number for as to all others they have for their object the greatest happiness of the smaller number at the expense of that of the greater in a monarchy at the head of the highest predatory class is stationed the archdepredator the monarch a creature in whose devouring and consuming maw for the small chance of giving increase to the felicity of that one being the substances of thousands and tens of thousands of others whose claims are as good as his are consumed the analogy between the innate disease of the body politic and one of the diseases which in the body natural though frequent is but casual cannot have escaped the observing eye in the class of malefactors so called and treated as such may be seen the ascarides by which the several parts of the intestinal canal are occupied and infested in the higher parts—in the aristocrats—may be seen the teretes the smooth and polished sort as the name imports in the monarch the solitary worm or grub in french ver solitaire no constitution being equal to the endurance of more than one the extraction of which is at once so difficult so perilous and yet so necessary an emblem is not a proof nor is it here meant as such but if furnished by the nature of the case and happily chosen it will contribute clearness and strength to the conception and for this purpose alone is it here brought to view happily the disease such as it is is in a particular degree that of infancy sooner or later the body politic if not killed by it outgrows it every addition made to the number of readers is an addition to the number of persons capable of reading books on political subjects   0 and of so becoming members of subcommittees of the unofficial judicatory while by the same means an addition is made to the number of persons by whom discourse is held on that subject in public or at any rate in private and consequently to the number of subcommitteemen as above every addition made to the number of persons becoming inhabitants of towns in contradistinction to the being inhabitants of the country separated from one another by distances more or less considerable becomes an addition to the number of readers of politics as above or at least to the number of hearers of political discussion every addition thus made to the number of the persons habituated or disposed to the constituting themselves members of these unofficial committees is an addition made to the number of those capable of taking cognizance and likely to take cognizance of any appeal made to this tribunal by any members of the government—by any official functionaries when disagreeing with one another by every such disagreement an addition is therefore naturally made to the power of this judicatory—of the only body the interest of which is not in discordance but in accordance with as being the same thing with the interest of the greatest number of the members of the political community in question whatever it be even by every verbal discussion held between man and man among the people at large on that same subject an appeal of this sort is made accordingly by every such disagreement so as the subjectmatter and the particulars of it do but transpire a service is rendered to the public interest—to the greatest happiness of the greatest number no such service is commonly intended but how far soever from being intended it is not the less rendered of such disagreement the causes are happily not a few   in a monarchy a disputed succession is liable to have place   a minority—the nonage of the monarch   the manifest mental debility of the monarch whether from old age permanent bodily ill health or mental derangement manifest it must be and undisguiseably so to constitute anything that can be regarded as a particular and incidental and extraordinary case for as to intellectual inferiority comparison had with the ordinary herd it is among the necessary results of the situation itself   between any two branches of the monarchs family any disagreement in which the monarch takes or is thought to take a part   a disagreement between the sovereign in possession and the monarch in expectancy—between the monarch on the throne and the next heirapparent or presumptive   disagreement among the members of an administration or as between the members of the existing administration and the other men of rank and opulence who are habitually collected within the field of the sovereigns observation in a mixed monarchy the existence of disagreement between the constituent parts of it is of the very essence of the species true it is that another property belonging to the essence of the species is the having a bond of union a sinister interest in which they share—a sinister interest acting in evident opposition to the interest of the greatest happiness of the greatest number and by this unity of interest the government may for a length of time more or less considerable be kept from dissolution not less true is it however that in a government of this species not less considerable are the causes of disagreement that have place if between the power of the monarch and whatsoever power there is by which his is kept in check the limits are not sufficiently defined thereupon come contentions between the one power and the other so if between two powers subordinate to that of the monarch if so it be that the monarch takes a part on the one side or the other which is what can scarcely fail to have place by a certain degree of prudence disagreement from any one of the above three causes may be kept from breaking out one cause however there remains which is of the essence of the species and which cannot by any human prudence be at any time altogether excluded this is the competition for power as between party and party in the class of statesmen the matter of good in the shape of matter of corruption is suppose even the whole of it in the hands of the monarch or at his disposal still be it ever so vast and be his desire of satisfying everybody ever so ardent to give satisfaction to that desire is at all times plainly impossible so far from decreasing as the quantity at his disposal and accordingly disposed of increases the aggregate amount of the appetite increases in that same ratio the more there is to be had of it the greater is the number of those each of whom beholds for himself a probability of obtaining a share of it thus then between the party by whom this mass is shared including those who by their means are in certain expectation of succeeding to a share in it on the one hand and the party to whom neither in possession nor in immediate expectancy is any share in view strife constant and interminable has place—constantly is the excluded party occupied in forcing itself in for doing so it has no means but that of preferring against the party in possession accusations matter for which never has been nor in such a form of government ever can by any possibility be wanting but for the bringing and prosecuting these accusations there exists but one possible tribunal and this is—the publicopinion tribunal     difficult however is the game which has at all times to be played by the corruptionist in expectancy otherwise than by appeal to the power of the unofficial judicatory in no way can he do anything towards the forwarding of his wishes but to carry on any such appeal is to act as accuser either of the functionaries who act under the form of government or of the form of government itself or both as to the pointing of the accusation against the individuals their rivals if that were all in this it is not in the nature of the case that there should be anything that is not perfectly agreeable to them what is thus aimed at is all profit no loss but under such a government the utmost mischief that is ever done beyond that which the government itself affords a warrant for is in comparison with that which is done with a sufficient warrant from the form of government very inconsiderable depredation and with it oppression in every other imaginable shape may be carried on to any extent and yet nothing be done in which condemnation in any shape is passed by either the letter or the spirit of the law or the usage of government in or under it meantime that same load will be at all times pressing and with everincreasing weight and those men being by their hapless condition condemned to keep up the continued profession of being friends to the people no sooner does any particular instance of misrule in either of these shapes come to light than all eyes are turned to them in expectation of their taking up the accusing part in truth the depredation and oppression exercised having all of it the form of the government for its cause it is never possible that the connexion between the effect and the cause can escape all eyes   second point of disadvantage—comparative incapacity of acting in concert of this disadvantage there are two sorts of causes the one natural the other factitious of the natural causes the radical and principal one is local distance it presses of course with particular weight on the condition of the inhabitants of the country as compared and contrasted with that of the inhabitants of towns in both cases its pressure is in the inverse ratio of the density of the population and as between town and town in the inverse ratio of the number of inhabitants in each of this cause the efficiency is capable of being counteracted and disturbed by every circumstance by which either facility is given to the means of communication or a counteradvantage afforded by means of profit in a pecuniary or any other shape from frequent intercourse by water carriage for example whether it be by sea or inland navigation that the facility is afforded—by mutual advantage in the way of trade the counteradvantage is afforded of this same disadvantage the factitious causes are those which are produced by prohibitions and restrictions imposed by governments in every government but a democracy the interest of the ruling few being in a state of opposition to the general interest the consequence is that in every species of government but that one the class of functionaries beholds in the publicopinion tribunal not a support but an adverse power a power capable of becoming superior to its own capable not only of opposing limits to it but of extinguishing it and commonly the only one that is so the only one without exception in the supposition that the political state in question has nothing of the sort to fear from any foreign state or states hence consequently with the governing body of every state but that one it is a constant object to throw in the way of such communication so far as applied to political purposes i e so far as applied to the formation of subcommittees of the unofficial judicatory in question every difficulty possible in the course of these endeavours it finds two natural interferences and difficulties the odium attendant on it and the obstacles thrown in the way of communication for such transactions as are regarded as being serviceable to its interests and as such approved of as to the odium it will be in intensity and extent exactly in the ratio of the degree in which the qualities of probity and intelligence have place in the community by no government which is not an enemy an uncontrollable enemy to the rest of the community can any such endeavour be ever employed by every such endeavour an avowal is made of such enmity consequently of such inaptitude and of its being the interest of all men subject to it to put it down with all possible speed and by whatsoever means appear to be at the same time the most efficacious and in the shape of evil in all shapes least expensive an avowal not in words it is true but in deeds in deeds by which of the state of the agents mind on every occasion evidence is afforded to such a degree conclusive that the most probative that in the nature of the case can be afforded by words alone shrinks into insignificance and in truth sinks into nothing at all when opposed to the abovementioned practical evidence the other impediment consists in the difficulty of preventing or obstructing communication for this unacceptable purpose without preventing or obstructing it in its application to others that are regarded by the government as serviceable to its interests or even necessary to its existence take for instance the english government with its tax upon newspapers an   0  £ 00000 do an      £ 00000 in any coolly reflecting mind no doubt can have place that were it not for this counterconsideration every newspaper the editor of which acts in     the character of leading member of a subcommittee of that publicopinion tribunal would long ago have been extinguished the odium—had that been all—the government would have been content to subject itself to but the odium with the loss of so large a sum added to it and at a period of so much financial pressure and difficulty would have been decidedly more than could be afforded to be paid even for so mighty and decisive an advantage chapter iii notification and publication in reference to securities section i subjects of notification and thence publicity   ordinances   transgressions or any violations of those same ordinances   suffrages or opinions formed by the several members of the publicopinion tribunal on the subject of or in relation to some transgression as compared with those same ordinances transgression supposes something transgressed in the instance here in question that something is something having or designed to have the authority of law   in the first place come the several ordinances of which misrule in each of the several shapes against which a security is by this system endeavoured to be provided will have been a transgression ordinances or supposed rules having the effect of ordinances—of ordinances interdictive of vexation and oppression in all its several shapes if at the time of giving establishment to security in those several shapes ordinances adapted to the purpose are already in existence it is well if not fresh ordinances for the purpose must in this case be provided   in the next place come whatsoever instances of transgression happen to take place if none so much the better the ordinances have in the completest manner possible fulfilled their purpose if any transgressions within the law in question have had place the number of them being given the greater the number to which notification and publicity have been secured as compared with the total number that have had place the better   suffrages understand by suffrages the opinions produced in the minds of the several members of this same tribunal by the cognizance of the several transgressions as applied to persons taking cognizance of the several transgressions the degree of publicity will be as the number of their suffrages note that in the number of the members of this same tribunal is included the number of all those on whose obedience or will depends the effect of the several general salutary tutelary ordinances by which vexation is prohibited as also of any particular acts or particular ordinances in consequence of which any acts of vexation and oppression are exercised in violation and transgression of these same general and salutary ordinances power on the one part is constituted by and is in greater or less proportion to obedience on the other it is in the direct ratio of the obedience and in the inverse ratio of resistance but the greater the number of the members of the whole community to whom the existence of an act of oppression has been made known the greater is the number of those by whom on the occasion of an endeavour to exercise other acts of a similar nature supposing the first act notified to them not only may obedience be withholden but resistance opposed rule abstraction made of the several degrees of influence possessed—influence of understanding on understanding and influence of will on will included the actual power of the publicopinion tribunal will be as the number of the suffrages actually declared in the minds of the several members its power as supposed by other persons and in particular the several functionaries to whose transgressions it is the object of the securities to oppose a check will be as the number of the suffrages which they expect to find formed and delivered this influence with its several possible degrees it may be said may be laid out of the account altogether for of the persons on whom by possibility it is capable of being exercised the only persons here in question are the members of the political community in question considered in the character of members of the publicopinion tribunal belonging to it thus accordingly when considered in a general point of view for the most part does the matter stand one point however there remains in relation to which the sort of influence in question is capable of having a distinct operation the suffrages suppose of all the members of this tribunal take the same direction they being all of them pronounced in condemnation of the oppressive act in question therefore as between suffrage and suffrage it makes no difference which of them was the result of a selfformed opinion—which of them the result of an opinion derived from the influence exercised on the mind in question by that of some other member exercised whether on will or on understanding or on both together but though by the supposition the direction taken by the suffrages is the same and the ultimate number of them by what cause soever produced is the number in question yet the degree of energy with which upon occasion they may respectively be disposed to act in conformity to these same suffrages may be to any amount different and in each case this degree of energy may be greater or less according to the nature and force of the influence received note that to simplify the conception the direction taken by the suffrages in question is on this occasion supposed to be the same in the     instance of every one of them but as by this supposition the subject of these suffrages is in every instance some act of oppression exercised by the sovereign or individuals there is nothing in this supposition that seems to be in any very considerable degree wide of the truth so much for the several subjectmatters to which the act of notification may have need to apply itself now as to the several successive operations the performance of which may be necessary to the production of the effect—of the effect by whatsoever name designated whether notification or publicity these preparatory operations will be in a considerable degree different according to the nature of the subjectmatter according as it comes under one or other of the three abovenamed denominations namely ordinances transgressions or suffrages section ii notification with respect to ordinances first let them be supposed already in existence and possessed of binding force if so far as regards the purpose here in question they are already present to every mind capable of taking cognizance of the matter it is well unfortunately there is not anywhere on the surface of the globe any country in which this sort of omnipresence or anything like it has place not even in that country the angloamerican united states in which the productions of the printingpress are most extensively dispersed much less in northern africa where even the instrument itself has never yet been in use necessary to the existence of an ordinance in a binding state are three distinguishable operations namely scription sanctionment and registration   scription by this understand the act of composing and committing to writing the matter in question   sanctionment by this understand the investing it with binding force by some person or persons generally recognised as being possessed of a correspondent power   registration or say recordation by this understand the depositing and keeping in some appropriate receptacle the individual instrument to which the act of sanctionment has been applied but for this the correctness and even genuineness of all copies written or printed might stand exposed to doubt and dispute minute and useless will the distinction thus brought to view be apt at first sight to appear upon a second view nothing it will be seen can be farther from being so scarcely will that country be seen in which throughout a vast and indeterminate portion of the field of action and legislation an operation so essential as sanctionment will not be seen wanting to that matter to which is given nevertheless the name and binding form of law thus far ordinances appropriate and adequate to the nature of the exigency have been supposed to be already in existence if so it is well but suppose the state of things to be a contrary case what then is to be done case   in relation to the matter in question yet no ordinance of the above description in existence but in the case of judicial decisions the standard of reference composed of anterior decisions or inferences deduced from them in the european governments with the exception of the few instances if any in which codification has had place such is the state of the rule of action when it is in the state of what is called common law or unwritten law on most parts of the field of law a quantity of matter has been written—written by men not invested or so much as pretending to be invested with the legislative authority and out of this huge and shapeless mass of writing the judge on each occasion makes choice of such portions as appear to him best adapted to his purpose to the purpose which is most agreeable to him whatever it may happen to be in this state of things singularly unfortunate if not unskilful must that judge be who out of so rich a granary fails on any occasion to find that which is most agreeable to his wishes whatsoever they may happen to be—to his wishes guided as they cannot but be by what at the moment he looks upon as being his interest in the countries in question if i understand the matter right some of those memorials have been collected which in england over so large a portion of the field of thought and action occupy the place of law i mean that sort of matter which consists—of statements of cases by which judicial decision has been called for the particular decision pronounced in each case and the general positions which have been brought forward by the judge in support and justification of his particular decision—or of such general positions as in the way of inference have been deduced from it by men volenter dissertantes—rulers not invested with any such authority as that of a judge case   the standard of reference referred to in judicial decisions composed of inferences drawn not from former decisions but from an original standard composed in a time of remote antiquity in the country in question the standard of reference is it seems of this sort and consists of the matter following—there stands the koran the work of mahomet the universally acknowledged standard of opinion and practice in all matters of religion as well as law but for a great portion of these particular cases to which the occurrences of life are continually giving birth—in this book the matter being for the most part of a nature extremely general is not capable of an application particular enough to serve as an adequately determinate guide influenced by this view different persons without concert with each other have     at various times set themselves to work to fill up the vacuities all of them agreeing in the homage paid to the general positions discoverable in the sacred text but differing from one another in no inconsiderable degree in respect of the inferences drawn from these important positions of which as being included within them application has been made with reference to the sacred text these works of inferior authority stand in the relation of commentaries throughout the dominion of the koran four of these commentaries have obtained the preeminence over all the others such is the degree of that preeminence as to have given rise as it were to two classes of commentaries commentaries of the first order and commentaries of the second order those of the second order being not exclusively at least commentaries on the sacred text but commentaries upon those of the first order commentators of the first order four as above commentators of the second order not as few as seven hundred though clear of confusion from that source of which indication has been given as above in the case of the european and especially the english books of reports and treatises deduced from them the eastern system fails not however to labour under very obvious and such as cannot but be very grievous inconveniences in the first place no one of them having taken for its object of pursuit the greatest happiness of the greatest number none can except by accident have made any clearly defined provision for it in the course of such arrangements of detail as are to be found deducible from it in the next place in opening out the thread of inferences they have all of them taken on various occasions courses more or less different from all these diversities two evil consequences to an extent more or less considerable cannot but have taken place so indeterminate in this or that case is the bearing of some or all of these previous commentaries upon the case that the judge be his probity ever so great finds more or less difficulty in determining in what manner he shall make application of them to the case the other consequence is that amidst such diversity the judge in so far as the union of disposition and opportunity produces on his part an inclination for corruption seldom finds any difficulty in gratifying it with regard to aptitude of phraseology—aptitude of phraseology on the part of the rule of action the source of security on the part of the members of the community—thus much may with confidence be asserted with reference to the most aptly penned codes of european law namely that in respect of determinateness of designation as well as aptitude with relation to the only proper end of legislation the greatest happiness of the greatest number they are in a deplorable degree deficient continuing to apply the words which custom has applied to the several occasions on each occasion the assumption they proceed upon is that of the word in question the import is adequately determinate—and scarcely perhaps in a single instance is that assumption true if such is the case in the instance of those bodies of law the authors of which during the penning of them set and kept before them all along a determinate object of pursuit namely the greatest happiness of somebody—the greatest happiness of the monarch whose power was employed in giving birth to them and binding force still more assuredly must it be the case in the instances in which the rule of action has from time to time been spun out in the way of inference from a rule which whatever may have been the talent employed in the making of it was yet of a mixed character having something of religion in it and something of law in it with here and there a passage of history springing the whole texture of it out of the occurrences of the day and that day a very remote one with reference to present days the state of society being at the same time in a great variety of particulars widely different from what it is at present widely different and amongst other points of difference far less diversified be the inquiry however ever so pressing be the demand for new and precise definition of binding terms ever so urgent everything cannot be done at once with the stock of those terms whatsoever may be the extent of it with this stock of instruments in the penning of the proposed securities must the scribe content himself putting them to use in the best manner he is able in the character of a guide to judges the necessity of a collection of ordinances has just been brought to view—of ordinances in the form of ordonnances—of an allcomprehensive collection covering the whole field of legislation and putting an exclusion upon every standard of reference that is not in that exclusively adequate guide but if necessary even to the judge—to the functionary to whose function it belongs to decide upon the conduct of the members of the community at large pronouncing that decision which never can be pronounced without producing suffering in some shape or other from the lowest to the highest degree—to a party or parties on one side or the other—how much more necessary must it not be to an individual in the situation of one who every day of his life is exposed to the danger of being party to a suit for the want of being able to have access to a document which would enable him by anticipation to preserve himself from the sufferings which otherwise cannot but await him at the hand of the judge if necessary to the right termination of these afflictive processes called causes or suits at law how much more strictly necessary are they     not to the prevention of them without any such forewarning and trusty instructive guides a termination in some way or other these courses of suffering cannot but receive but by no other means than these means of timely information can they be anticipated and prevented it may be matter for consideration whether to this fundamental and allimportant institution of rational government the form of a charter—the form of a declaration of rights or the form of a contract should be given if obtainable the form of a contract will unquestionably be the more beneficial whatsoever securities are afforded will thus be fixt upon the firmer basis the case of a charter remains always more or less exposed to one cause of failure being the free and sole act of the sovereign whatsoever is granted by him on any one day may be taken back by him on any other when he granted it it was on the supposition that no bad consequences would result from it but that supposition being disproved necessity compels him to revoke it to this effect are the words which at any time may just as easily be uttered as any others of the same length and number and wheresoever and by whomsoever in the situation in question uttered no want of voices to echo them need ever be feared so much for charters charters the people in question cannot have been much used to contracts—compacts—all people are more or less used to more or less in the use and expectation of seeing them kept and at any rate of regarding the infraction of them as an act of injustice and a reasonable cause of displeasure and discontent a reasonable cause for endeavour to obtain remedy in the case of a charter if it be regarded as really obligatory there is but one party on whom any obligation attaches in the case of a contract there are two parties the people forming one of them if then the contract form be the form employed consistency would seem to require that on the occasion of the solemnity from which it appears to derive its sanction there should be given by and on the part of the people thanks to the sovereign for his entering into his part in it—thanks with acclamations thanks to the sovereign—to god—to the prophet—to everybody—nothing of this sort need be grudged but on their part if anything what more can be done with safety and advantage promise to obey him and all his descendants to the end of time this would be too much too much even although on the part of those potentates the condition of their performing their part of the contract were attached to the promise on the part of the people for—what if another form of government should come to be regarded as in a greater degree contributory to the greatest happiness of the greatest number promise to obey his descendants so long as the contract were on their part kept inviolate and so long as monarchy continued to be the form of government this is exactly what seems desirable but unfortunately the more desirable on the one part the less likely to be acceded to on the other in the case of england the whig monarchists who brought about the revolution in the time of james ii saw the advantage attached as above to the contract form and in their arguments employed it accordingly their contract however—the original contract they called it—was a mere fiction and of its being a mere fiction an evil consequence was—that on each occasion the terms of it remaining to be feigned—they made them whatsoever seemed to them most advantageous to their own particular interests but in the case here in question there would be no fiction and there being two contracting parties to this contract the terms of it might by mutual consent of both parties be changed at any time so long as the terms were kept by the monarch the people would not be likely to feel much inclination to change but supposing them at any time infringed by him it would be for them to make themselves amends and provide for that purpose whatsoever security seemed to them most efficient for example the change from the mixed monarchy to a representative democracy and for the bringing about such change the securities here in question would prepare them by giving them power in every shape section iii means of multiplication of ordinances in the country in question written discourse though not printed discourse being in use of whatsoever ordinances are in force as such copies one or more cannot but be in existence somewhere in the metropolis of the country of course in the seat of the principal judicatory of the country of course in the case here in question the first operation therefore that requires to be performed is multiplication for this purpose the newly invented instrument called the lithographic press seems for a beginning preferable to the ordinary printing press not that there should be any reason why either should put an exclusion upon the other the advantages which at the outset it presents itself as in possession of are the following   it is by much the cheaper   it requires for the production of the effect a much less numerous association of arts and thence of different artists   being with difficulty distinguishable from ordinary manuscript the use of it will be less alarming than the use of the printing press to artists who at present are employed in the transcription of manuscript writing on the occasion of this as of every other mode employable for the abridgement of human labour an effect which can never be too scrupulously attended to and which at the     same time has been almost universally turned aside from is its effect on the interest—on the very means of subsistence of the working hands the whole of whose subsistence is derived from the practice of the art in its present state in various countries of europe in england more perhaps than in any other prodigious is the mass of misery that has been produced by this means first branch of the evil the distress of the labouring hands whom the introduction of the new art causes to be dismissed and thus deprives of the means of subsistence second branch of that same evil suffering in the shape of pecuniary loss and other shapes sustained by those who trusting to profit by the new art dismiss in a proportion more or less considerable those hands whom they were wont to occupy in the course of the old established one suffering namely produced by the hostility of those who are thus deprived of the means of subsistence—hostility exercised under the notion of its being in exercise of retributive justice to the great capitalist the sufferings of these his discarded servants to how many hundreds soever they may amount has generally speaking been of little or no importance but to no one of all these human beings strange as it may be in his eyes is it a matter of no importance to each of these discarded servants the difference between comfortable subsistence and death or scanty subsistence from the parish funds is in reality of much greater importance than is to the capitalist the difference between the old established rule of profit to which he has been accustomed and the new rule of profit to which he aspires the law relative to the subject being uniformly the expression of the will either of himself or of one belonging to a class still more insensible than he is to the miseries of men less fortunate than themselves the act by which he deprives them of the whole of their subsistence is never treated on the footing of a crime or even of an offence on the other hand any act whereby the men who by him have been deprived of the whole of their subsistence shall endeavour to retaliate by depriving him of ever so small a part of his vast opulence is treated on the footing of a crime and deep is the turpitude imputed to those who have defiled themselves with it as to the depravity whatsoever may be the amount of it one thing is undeniable namely that he in whose loss it is manifested under the circumstance of neglect in question is the author of it and has himself to thank for it in his own eyes as also in those of his superiors on whom the state of the laws depends the heart of the man of opulence is no less full of virtue than his purse of money to himself the difference in respect of profit is no object but the public the sole object of his regard—the public is enriched by it the discarded labourers a mean and grovelling race who care nothing about the public experience nothing but what they deserve in the instance here in question happily the evil here in question if so it be that it requires any cure for the existence of it requires no such cure as in the cases just mentioned supposing the securities in question granted the copies the production of which will be completed will furnish of themselves a fresh demand for which no adequate means of supply can at the time when the demand commences be in existence but whatsoever be the improved mode of multiplication employed lithographic press or ordinary press care should be taken that the employment given to it should not be such as to throw out of employment any of the existing scribes except in so far as other employment not less advantageous is found for them—measures should at the same time be taken to prevent the influx of fresh hands into their business if certificate of the stoppage of the demand for this art be not sufficient even prohibition might be employed prohibition absolute or unless by license next to the operation of multiplying the copies of these literary instruments of national security against misrule comes the method of their distribution distribution is either gratuitous or for a price—for example in the way of public sale of copies to a limited amount the distribution it is true might be gratuitous but in such a case the demand might be indefinite for to no man able or not to read the characters on it could a quantity of paper be without its uses exposure to sale therefore presents itself as an indispensable mode but the price demanded should not at any rate be to any the least amount greater than what will suffice to cover the expense if it were insufficient it might be so much the better on the side of convenience all that is essential is that it be not so small as that for purposes other than that of reading it should be worth a mans while to purchase it obvious and unanswerable is the reason why so it does but prevent undue application to purposes other than those designed the price cannot be too small the usefulness and the efficiency—the usefulness of these securities will be as the number of the minds by which cognizance of them is taken on this ultimate security depends the efficiency of whatsoever else can be designated by that name for the benefit of this security no expense that can be incurred by a number of copies equal to those of the individuals able to read them can be too great section iv application of public recitation to ordinances as far as it goes this operation compared with swift exposure to sale presents several advantages       by this means a conception of the master document in question may be conveyed to minds in vast multitudes to which by any other means it would not be possible to convey it   it is not necessarily attended with any expense   it is susceptible of any additaments applied to it in the view of rendering it the more impressive of these presently on the other hand the signs by means of which the conception is conveyed or endeavoured to be conveyed to the minds in question being of the supremely fugitive and transient kind their existence ceasing as soon as it has commenced deplorably inadequate will this mode of communication uniformly be in comparison with that which operates by signs susceptible of indefinite permanency nor even for the single instant in which the communication takes place can the conception derived be generally expected to equal that which has place in the other case in any of the qualities requisite namely in clearness correctness or comprehensiveness much less at any instant separated from that first instant by any considerable interval of time now as to impressiveness this quality is capable of being raised above the ordinary standard by any one of the following circumstances   the rank of the person by whom the recitation is performed   an extraordinary degree of aptitude on his part in respect of the properties desirable on the part of a public reader or speaker for example clearness of pronunciation strength and agreeableness of voice propriety of intonation with reference to the occasion   the place at which the recitation is made   any circumstance of ceremony with which it may be thought advisable to accompany the operation the discourse in question being drawn up and agreed on the sovereign for example in the principal mosque stationed in an elevated station in which he may be seen by the whole assembly takes the paper in hand and reads it in a voice suited to his convenience when read he touches it with his seal—with the seal by which his acts as sovereign are in use to be authenticated he touches it with his seal and that instant a signal being given notification is conveyed to the greatest distance by the firing of artillery and musketry and the sounding of drums and trumpets or whatever wind instruments of music are in use after this for the more effectual information of the surrounding audience the best reader in all points taken together as above that can be found reads the paper over again and the notifying sounds as above are repeated the ceremony might be preceded and followed by a procession from the palace of the sovereign to the mosque and back again after the reading has been performed any such declarations of censure on all infractors may be added as the forms of the religion and the usages of the country will admit of in those monarchies of europe which are called constitutional in them and in those which have elsewhere sprung from them it has been customary for the monarch to open and close the legislative assemblies by a speech from the throne—a speech of which though not so much as supposed to have been the framer he is himself the recitator but of all these general speeches one general character may be given for the most part they contain nothing but vague generalities they contain no enactments they are not intended to give expression to any specific engagements indeed the manifest and scarcely dissembled object is to avoid binding the royal speaker to anything—to keep his hands as free as possible if on any occasion they amount to anything it is when the object of them is to notify though in the most general terms the assent of the monarch to a new constitutional code or to any particular law to which a preeminent degree of importance is attached or to propose in the most general terms possible a subject for deliberation and eventual enactment in the case of tripoli should the consent of the sovereign to the proposed system of securities be obtained the design if i understand aright is to endeavour to prevail upon him to reecho from his own lips not merely a form of words expressive of his assent but the whole contents of the discourse unless the length of it should be such as to present an insurmountable obstacle to the physical exertion necessary for this purpose the example as above of the sovereigns of europe might perhaps contribute more or less to the surmounting of any reluctance of which the novelty of the proposal may have been productive in his mind section v notification and publicity as to transgressions by transgression understand as above instances in which the tutelary ordinances having     been established as above acts of oppression as above characterized happen notwithstanding to have place unfortunately in this second instance the placing the matter in question in broad daylight is not altogether so safe nor yet so easy as in the former instance to an operation of this description the nature of the case will be seen opposing these obvious opponents namely fear indolence and poverty it remains for inquiry what can be done towards the surmounting of these several obstacles  st obstacle—fear to observe where the fear attaches we have but to observe the parties whose conjunct labours are necessary to the production of this result these are  st the person or persons from whom in each instance the information should come  d the person or persons by whom it should be received furnisher of the information any person may be a receiver of it is as such a sort of public functionary at any rate if so it be that he does what is required to the giving publicity to it as he must do sooner or later or he might as well not receive it in comparison with that which is offered by fear the force of all other obstacles put together is inconsiderable fear is the expectation of eventual evil evil at the hand of all those to whom publicity in relation to the event in question may come to be disagreeable against all such fear the most effectual of all securities is concealment concealment of every person by whom anything has been contributed to the publicity of the obnoxious state of things known it is necessary they should be—known to the functionary by whom the information is received or extracted were it only for the sake of eventual responsibility in case of disturbance given to the peace of the community and of individuals by false accounts to one functionary or perhaps one set of functionaries it is necessary that for this purpose every person contributing to the furnishing of the information should be adequately known known to the purpose of being eventually forthcoming to the purpose of being subjected to punishment in case of mendacity or injurious temerity but to no other person is it necessary that he should be known next come the several persons by whom any part is borne towards the giving permanent and appropriate publicity to the information when received at one stage or other some one person at least there must be—naturally persons more than one—whose agency in the business cannot be kept concealed concealed that is to say from those from whose power vengeance will naturally be to be apprehended but when any one person is known as having borne a part in it the greater the number of the persons thus known to have done so the better the greater the number the higher their situation meaning their official situation and the more dispersed their several situations—meaning their topographical situations for the higher their official situation and the greater the number of the persons occupying those several situations the more dangerous will it be for the oppressor to endeavour to extend to them his oppressing hand the higher and more numerous the more dangerous and the more dispersed the more difficult suppose for example by one such functionary or set of functionaries information of an act of oppression received and committed to writing if their situation is that of a set of functionaries constituting a judicatory of the higher order then suppose a copy sent to every judicatory in the dominion and by the joint authority of them all made public at one and the same time made public by whatsoever means of publicity happen to be at their command here the security against vengeance from the oppressor is at its maximum unless it should be deemed advisable that from this branch of the authority of the state communication be also made to the military  d a case may be supposed in which whether fear have place or no indolence may oppose a bar more or less powerful to communication suppose the oppressed party alive and in condition to act indolence is not in his instance very likely to take place for affording the requisite excitement the desire of compensation and vengeance will generally speaking be sufficient but to him even though living it may happen that the injury is not for some time known and the case in which the oppression—the injury—is at its maximum is that in which adequate excitement is most apt to be wanting this is the case in which by the oppressive act the life of the victim has been made a sacrifice in this case whether any connexion of his disposed to come forward and seek redress be in existence will be matter of accident in one case and that not a very uncommon one the nonexistence of any such person will be an occurrence altogether natural a dead body say at the dawn of day—the dead body of a man is found lying on a high road or some such public place and for some time nobody knowing whose it is by no connexion of his is the catastrophe known or suspected in a case of this sort the object is to obtain information from the first person to whose senses the spectacle has happened to present itself in the first instance here for surmounting the resisting force of indolence three active forces present themselves appeal to the social affections by a standing authoritative and appropriate discourse punishment in the case of nonperformance and reward in the case of performance of this public service of these instruments whether one or more or all may with most propriety be applied will depend upon circumstances circumstances too particular to lay claim to a place here  d obstacle—poverty understand relative     poverty—inability to defray the expense whatever it may be of the operations necessarily preparatory to the ultimate publication above brought to view an indefinite number may any or all of them be unavoidably attended with an indefinite amount of expense   collecting from places in indefinite number each of them indefinitely distant persons capable of serving in the character of reporting or say deposing witnesses   committing to writing the result of their respective depositions   transmitting from judicatory to judicatory from office to office copies of the written instrument to which the statement of the case was first consigned though provision might in some way or other be made for them the case required that these several sources of expense should be brought to view in what particular way any such provision may most conveniently be made will depend upon local circumstances such as are not within the cognizance of him by whom these particulars are offered to view note here that as well upon those who are likely to be most willing as upon those who are likely to be most unwilling should the tone of whatever ordinances are issued for providing publication be as forcibly imperative as possible the more irrisistible in appearance the coercive process the greater will be the security given to him in whose breast any desire to cooperate towards the beneficial effect in question has place against the wrath of the offended and denounced oppressor he has coercion to plead as his excuse section vi natification and publicity as to suffrages—newspapers letter post to the subjectmatter thus denominated the operations which apply to the purpose in hand will be seen to be the following viz   extraction   registration   multiplication   transmission or say diffusion for all these several operations one and the same instrument presents itself as the efficient and the only efficient instrument this instrument is no other than a newspaper multitude of instruments of this same sort employed by so many different sorts of hands and multitude of copies of each as great as possible in this instrument may be seen not only an appropriate organ of the publicopinion tribunal but the only regularly and constantly acting visible one in this same tribunal it is by the newspaper editor that in each case the motion in which the decision originates is made and thus much of the matter is no fiction but the exact truth thereupon come the suffrages—suffrages given by those members of the community being at the same time readers of the newspaper or in converse with those that are—so when it happens to take cognizance of the matter these suffrages being from the nature of the case incapable of being collected the number of them must in each case be left to inference and conjecture meantime thus much may be remarked namely that in the instance of each person it is by the real and true opinion the real and inward affection not the opinion and affection declared and avowed that the salutary effector the check applied to misrule is produced for it is by opinion and affection really entertained and not by the opinion and affection professed to be entertained by a man that an action in the shape in question is produced newspapers suppose two taking different sides of the question in each case one suppose the side of the suffering people the other the side of the oppressing sovereign and his misrule here the case is rendered more complicated motions the tenor of them in every instance visible and permanent suffrages expressed or not expressed i e with or without tenor but in both cases invisible and evanescent of these suffrages some are on the side of one of the writers others on that of the other greater is the efficiency of this one sort of written instrument than that of all other written instruments put together on this and that question pamphlets and books works small and great may be written but by no one of them is any regular cognizance taken of the several occurrences as they take place for by any publication suppose any such regularity and constancy of attention kept up it becomes the very thing here in question i e a newspaper in a representative government at any rate in a representative democracy with the exception of the function of the principal minister more important is the function of this unofficial functionary than that of any official one more important that is to say in particular to the great purpose here in question—that of making application of the power of the publicopinion tribunal in its highest character and by far the most beneficial one of a check upon misrule of this superiority the causes are—  in each individual instance the greater number of the suffrages on which the motions made by these representatives of the people are taken for their ground the motions made by these unofficial compared with those made by any official representative by the prime minister impulse is given to the machinery of the political sanction by the editor of the prime popular newspaper to that of the social sanction—but   more particularly the constancy and continuity of action which has place in this case—sources of influence in respect of which no official representative limited as his motions and discourses are to particular and scattered reasons and scattered points of form can hold comparison with him the aptitude of the newspaper in question with reference to the greatest happiness of the   0 greatest number being given its usefulness will be as the extent to which the diffusion of it has place in other words as the number of the persons to whose minds it finds its way the circumstances on which the degree of that extent depends in particular at the outset of the sort of institution in question are  st the constancy   the frequency of its publication   its mixture with matters of a nature universally interesting   its cheapness—the smallness of the price   the impartiality of its procedure in respect of the admission or rejection of articles   the moderation of its language i e its purity from expressions of vague and ungrounded vituperation and laudation of men and measures of the several qualities the three first are at the same time the most essential and the most easily secured to it as being those that are the most completely independent of the mental qualities moral and intellectual of individuals   as to constancy this quality is of all others the easiest to secure it is moreover a matter of prime necessity that the institution be so conducted the interest created and kept up by it cannot but be in the closest degree dependent upon the assurance with which on the occasion of each paper a reader looks forward to a regular succession of the like entertainment provided by the same hands so invariably is this property possessed by this species of discourse wherever it has place that the absence of it not being presented by experience is not easily presented to view by imagination   next in the order of importance comes the quality of frequency the number of readers being given the greater the frequency of its appearance the greater the degree of diffusion nor in the instance of the aliment thus administered to the mind is the appetite slackened by the frequency of its application as in the case of the aliment administered to the bodily frame on the contrary it is rather kept alive and invigorated—the meal of each day operating as an excitement to look out for that of the next day following   variety admixture of the political matter with matters of other sorts in the greatest variety possible what gives this property an essential claim to notice is—besides the degree in which the amount of diffusion depends upon it—that it is so little dependent upon the talent employed in the conducting of it suppose for example six sorts of matter each of them interesting to one class of readers no one sort interesting to classes more than one by this means you have six times as many readers and regular purchasers as if there were no more sorts of matter in it than one each class stands assured of having something in which he takes an interest as it is on no other terms that he can get anything no one of them is debarred from the purchase of his onesixth by the consideration that without more than that sixth it is not obtainable when this variety of entertainment is kept up no imaginable literary composition can in respect of attractiveness by possibility enter into competition with this nor in particular with reference to the uses here in question from the physical association—the contiguity of the natural and visible signs—an association is instantly formed between the ideas of which they are respectively the representatives taking up the newspaper each one is upon the lookout for the master of that sort in which he takes a more particular interest but while he is upon the lookout for that matter of all other sorts is continually offering itself to his eyes little by little the dryness and repulsiveness of each wear away each in some degree or other becomes more and more familiar to him and even supposing that matters in which he takes no interest at all are regularly passed over without a glance still of those in which he takes some interest the interest is little by little increased in what abundance by the mere circumstance of the being among the contents of his newspaper a man is led to the reading of articles for which he would not ever have looked in any publication exclusively appropriated to the reception of them is a circumstance which can scarcely have escaped any persons experience   impartiality—its uses wheresoever there are newspapers there will be or rather are already parties and wherever there are parties all minor divisions naturally fall under one allcomprehensive division—the assailants and the supporters of the party which has the power of the country in its hands if there be any tolerable degree of freedom a newspaper can hardly have place for any length of time but rival newspapers one or more will start up likewise be the number of newspapers ever so great or ever so small great would be the advantage in respect of extent of currency if the editor could prevail upon himself to keep up an impartial course between the two parties—to give equal admission to attacks and to defences obvious altogether is the advantage which the course thus prescribed by justice would secure to him readers of all parties would be invited no readers of any party would be repelled number of readers of each party suppose equal on this impartial plan the number would be the double of that which it is on the ordinary partial plan but for securing to the instrument of instruction this at once most respectable and most difficult endowment—and this without prejudice to the diffusion of it—what would be the most eligible course not to make controversial matter on either side but to admit it on both sides by the sacrifice of this stimulating matter the publication would be rendered by the double and reciprocal insertion doubly excitative and attractive     on the part of a newspaper editor nothing is more easy than to profess impartiality few things more difficult than to maintain it but if in the highest degree utility depends upon impartiality—upon actual impartiality—in a not much inferior degree does it depend upon the reputation of impartiality—upon the proportion between those of his readers in whose eyes he is impartial and the number of those in whose eyes he fails in respect of a quality so highly desirable and unhappily he may be in ever so high a degree actually impartial and yet and even from that very cause be partial in the eyes of both for keeping up impartiality without diminution of frequency the most effectual course supposing extent of sale to permit would be for the proprietor of the newspaper to employ two editors one whose assertions were on the one side the other whose assertions were on the opposite side the number of days in the year allotted to each being the same why not the answer is lest in that case there should be a correspondent alteration and division among the customers one set buying the paper on the government day and not on the opposition day the other on the opposition day and not on the government day not that the greater part of the readers would thus content themselves with no more than half the aggregate stock of facts but still some there would be and antecedently to experience it would not be possible to say how many as to any endeavour to conceal this part of the arrangement it would neither be practicable nor desirable to exclude fraud and injustice and to secure harmony some arrangements of detail would be necessary nor does the securing such as would be adequate present to view a task of any considerable difficulty   moderation or say good temper unhappily for securing this quality important as it is there is no such simple and effectual recipe as hath been shown to have place in the case of impartiality of moderation the simplest and clearest description as far as it goes that can be given is—the avoiding to employ for the giving expression of disapprobation whether of men or measures or modes of action any words or phrases of vague and violent vituperation that express aversion or displeasure without any precise designation of the cause of it of every violation of the laws of moderation various and serious are apt to be the evil consequences   by the disgust which it cannot but produce it tends to exclude readers to a number altogether unascertainable and unlimited and among them not only those who are decidedly attached to the party whose sensibility is thus wounded but others who are neutral indifferent or undecided   by the hostility thus manifested correspondent hostility on the opposite side cannot but be provoked   among the consequences of such hostility prosecutions—attacks in the field of judicature will with more or less frequency have place hints respecting the best plan for the conducting of a newspaper   one sort of article by which an interest more or less exclusive cannot fail to be excited is—an indication of sights to be seen things offered for purchase or hire prices of goods of various sorts at various places probabilities in respect of future increase and diminution of price   accidents at all times by occurrences of this sort more or less of interest can scarcely fail to be excited in most breasts the greater the interest taken the greater the assistance and encouragement afforded to the sympathetic affection that affection upon the strength of which morality and felicity so essentially depend   offences of matter under this head the usefulness is of prime importance with reference to the particular design here in question of the misdeeds of various sorts from time to time committed few in comparison at the utmost will be those committed by the order of the sovereign or which it is matter of pleasure or advantage to him to see committed for the greater part they will be of that class by which while no profit in any shape is produced to men in power as such suffering is produced to individuals and through individuals danger and alarm to the community at large and thereby to the members of government in the quality of members of the community at large this being the case to the publication of misdeeds in general no aversion will be excited in their minds no objection will have place in their eyes but the habit of writing and reading accounts of misdeeds of all sorts being once established mention of the misdeeds committed by or agreeable to men in power will find their way in along with the rest—will slide in unobserved by the editor or at least as if unobserved and thus the way will be paved for the general admission of misdeeds in the commission of which the man in power has an interest or imagines he has an interest   proceedings of courts of justice especially that of the cadi in the metropolis being that by the proceedings of which the greatest interest will naturally be excited   deaths number of in the metropolis and other principal towns according to a periodical enumeration if obtainable in the case of those of remarkable persons their names given with any particulars that can be collected of their characters   births those of persons of the male sex may be ascertained by the acts of circumcision of which a register if not actually kept might     it is supposed without much difficulty be caused to be kept by the imans and notaries of the several mosques   the like occurrences in the domains of the neighbouring states   parallels between the particulars indicative of the state of society and manners as between the state in question and other mahometan states on the one part and christian states

states in all these cases constant standard of reference the greatest happiness of the greatest number   indications of physical inconveniency with or without hints respecting the most eligible means of remedy to each class of articles as above there might be a use in prefixing the denomination of it on a separate line and larger type as thus—accidents offences deaths by this means   readers would be directed instantaneously to the class whatever it were in which he happened to have an interest   the attention would by this perpetually recurring excitement be kept awake   by these exemplifications the minds of the readers would be familiarized with the practice and general conception of commanding arrangements a degree of diffusion sufficient for continuance being supposed to be already established now then comes the question—concerning the general usefulness of it by what means it may be raised to the highest pitch in the first place as to the only right and proper end of sound action the greatest happiness of the greatest number this allruling allcomprehensive and allimportant principle though not on every occasion brought forward and held up to view in its own name should on every occasion be inwardly kept in view and even by name the greater the number of the occasions on which without exciting abuse and disgust it can be brought to view the better for by it a standard is held up the only legitimate standard by which the mischievousness of misdeeds can be proved and the degree of it measured and indicated every occasion should be embraced of making application of the greatest happiness principle to the individual occurrences of the day showing   how morality and happiness depend upon the notoriety of the rule of action referred to by the judicatories   the advantage of the greatest degree of equality consistent with security in the distribution of the external instruments of felicity in all their shapes in particular power and the matter of wealth in all its shapes   showing how compensation to all sufferers by a misdeed in any shape ought to take place of punishment because the burden of affording compensation operates as punishment so far as it goes how punishment should be adapted to misdoing that by allotting to the more mischievous misdeeds the more severe punishment those who cannot reform from misdoing altogether may be induced to commit the less mischievous in preference to the more mischievous c c particulars of the mass of literary capital to be provided antecedently to the commencement of the publication of a work of this sort antecedently to the setting up any such newspaper it would be highly advisable to have a stock more or less extensive of foreign newspapers to serve as sources out of which heads of information would be brought to view and might be selected of all newspapers the english are by far the most instructive next to them those of the angloamerican united states in comparison with these the french are worth but little the newspapers of all other nations put together nothing at all the public demand which it is hoped will accompany the paper will serve to show the prodigious number of articles of this sort that are every year published in england—also the enormous revenue derived from them always remembered that this is among the worst of all sources of revenue and more especially so would it be in any country in which newspapers are set up for the first time the reason is that to an extent more or less considerable every tax operates as a prohibition a prohibition applied to the sort of articles taxed as in the instance in question though a bounty would not be necessary a bounty would be less monstrous than a prohibition suppose a dozen boys receiving at the school in question† their education the most useful and thence the highest occupation which the best head among them could be put to would be that of editing a newspaper on his return to his own country the master might choose for this purpose the most promising and he might be trained to it even at the school itself before his return antecedently to the setting up as above a stock of matter should be prepared and kept in readiness various kinds of matter being tried for the purpose of observing and knowing which of them excited the most interest as the publication went on various articles of every sort advertisements in particular would of course be sent in by those whose taste were pleased or their interest as it seemed to them served as thus miscellaneous and ever highly interesting matter by degrees came in the less interesting matter belonging to the     original stock would give way to it it is of the utmost consequence that on no appointed day whatsoever any failure of the appearance of the paper should take place and by the preparatory stock in question all such failure might effectually be prevented production and multiplication are effected by newspapers conveyance by the letter post these and whatever other documents require for the production of their intended effect to be sent to a distance are of no use but in proportion as they are conveyed to their respective destinations between any two places in the dominion in question is there any such establishment as a post for letters a messenger or chain of messengers travelling at stated intervals between the one and the other between the capital for instance and the two universities or one and which of them the first thing to be done in this way would be to establish a system of communication of this kind between the office of the cadi at the capital and the several judicatories next to that would be the establishing the like between each judicatory and the several mosques within its territorial field of jurisdiction messengers one or more going the circuit among the mosques in time pay received for letters sent from individuals to individuals might lessen the expense to government as the number of persons who read and write receives increase so will the receipts of every such establishment but at no time should any of these receipts be made a source of revenue a tax on the intercourse between man and man being a prohibition on all who cannot afford to pay the tax cripples social intercourse cripples it for all sorts of purposes and nips all improvement in the bud of the proposed system of communication the direct as being the most important object is—personal security and in particular security against oppression by the hands of rulers but a system of communication if once established for the major purpose will apply itself of itself to all minor purposes it will contribute to the efficiency of the judicial power as applied to its more obvious and more ordinary purposes it will contribute to the security of individuals as against injury by individuals it will contribute to the increase of commerce in regard to each article making known to each possessor of a surplus beyond his occasion where those individuals are to be found who to the desire of possessing the article add the means of paying for it whether for the mere chance of finding individuals in sufficient number able and willing to make use of it for merely commercial purposes it would be worth while to establish a system of communication in the first instance would be matter of uncertainty calling for calculation but on the supposition that it would be worth while to establish it for the sake of security alone any the least chance of its being contributory to the increase of commerce that is to say to the increase of opulence cannot but operate as an additional probable benefit and as an additional inducement meantime in the early state of the establishment by whom shall the expense whatever may be the amount of it be defrayed a question this which where any advance is proposed to be made in the track of civilisation is unhappily obtruding itself at every step as to the sovereign the funds of the state which are all of them his funds are never sufficient for so much as his own personal expenses never sufficient as yet nor in the nature of the case under such a form of government ever likely to be so soldiers in a certain number—say  000 are at present kept up if of these a certain number were regularly employed as lettercarriers they would not be the less fit for service in the character of soldiers they would be the more fit by thus changing their situation these messengers would thus become every day better and better acquainted with the country and in that way as well as others be by so much the fitter for service in their character of soldiers a slow conveyance so it were but regular and constant a slow conveyance extending over a large portion of the territory might be preferable to a more expeditious one extending over a less portion of territory for quick conveyance horses mules or dromedaries would be necessary but by this means the expense would perhaps be doubled in certain districts camels would be necessary for the carriage of the water necessary for subsistence but this would be only in certain districts chap iv the

declaration or memoir such individual is distinguished the person or persons by whose hand he has been brought to prison the person or persons by whose authority he has been brought to prison the cause for which he is so committed the time for which he is so committed and the evidence on which such commitment has been grounded—a sufficient description by name and memoir of every person on whose testimony the commitment has had place being added as also the cause for which the individual has been committed art   within  hours after the commitment of the prisoner a copy of such entry shall be pasted up over the door of the judicatory in such characters and situation that it shall be legible to all passengers art   if at any time by any special necessity the commitment of the prisoner to the appropriate prison be rendered impracticable or improper any other building public or private may for the time be employed for the purpose care being taken that the vexation thereby occasioned as well to the occupant of such building as to the prisoner be as little as possible and that at the expense of     the prisoner if found guilty or otherwise at the public expense if there be funds sufficient compensation be made to the occupant for the vexation for which reason also that building which for this purpose may be employed with least vexation—compensated or uncompensated to the occupant must be in each case preferred art   cases for which instead of the ordinary appropriate prison an extraordinary prison as above may be employed are as follows—   the ordinary prison being rendered incapable of holding the prisoners without danger to health or safe custody by reason of its fulness   — — or by want of repair   — — or by unhealthiness—produced for example by contagious disease   the ordinary prison rendered by distance inaccessible without halting for repose   — — or rendered inaccessible by hostility on the part of enemies foreign or domestic   — — or by danger of forcible rescue art   if in any such occasional prison a person be detained more than    hours over the door there shall be posted up a paper such as that described by article   in the case of an ordinary prison and for the framing or attestation thereof the assistance of some iman be invited that of the iman of the nearest mosque in preference art   on the commitment of a person to any such extraordinary prison the bringer shall give the earliest possible notice to the keeper of the ordinary prison and to the president of the judicatory in whose district the extraordinary prison is—of the fact of the detention together with the cause by which it was rendered necessary and whether such notice as should have been fixed up as above is or is not fixed up and if not why not art   the bringer shall make known to such keeper of the ordinary prison and such judge the fact of such detention at the extraordinary prison together with the causes and circumstances of it if he omit so to do the detention shall during the omission be deemed unlawful art  0 every person who knowingly and wilfully has been contributory to the injurious imprisonment of any person shall himself suffer imprisonment for a length of time equal to that during which the party so injured was imprisoned and shall moreover to the extent of his means be compelled to furnish compensation in a pecuniary shape for the injury art    any person by whom it shall be known or suspected that in a certain building or other receptacle a certain person is kept in confinement may repair to the keeper and require to be informed by him whether such person is actually under his custody if being so interrogated the keeper refuse or forbear to make answer or make a false answer he shall suffer condign punishment and if at the time of the interrogation the person in question was actually in his custody shall be punished as having been guilty of injurious imprisonment art    to the interrogation whether the person in question be at that very time in the custody of such keeper may be added the interrogation whether at any and what time he had been in such custody and if yes in what manner and by what means he ceased to be so art    for prevention of vexation and impertinent inquiry the keeper before he makes reply to any such interrogatory as above may require the applicant to make himself known to the purpose of eventual responsibility art    any person to whom by any such keeper any such acknowledgment has been made may repair to the judicatory of the district in which such place of confinement is situated and there require of the judge that the person so under confinement may be produced before him and that at a public audience inquiry be made into the cause of such confinement which inquiry made the person shall be remanded or set at liberty or otherwise dealt with as the case may require art    what is here said of a prison shall be understood of any other place in which whether according or not according to law the person in question is under confinement art    if to avoid his being produced to the judicatory as above a prisoner is shifted from place to place all persons concerned in such shifting and conscious of its having that for its purpose shall be responsible as for injurious imprisonment section iii securities against injurious banishment definitions injurious banishment is where without or otherwise than according to lawful sentence of a judicatory a subject of the state is to his vexation by force unlawful intimidation or fraud sent or kept out of the state or any part thereof if out of the whole territory of the state the banishment is external if out of this or that particular part internal the intimidation is unlawful if the means employed be a threat of vexation by unlawful means or even of lawful prosecution for other cause than injury done to the individual by whom the comminatory intimation is conveyed or to some individual on whose behalf he is entitled to prosecute art   of any sentence of banishment external or internal pronounced by a subordinate judicatory notice shall by the earliest opportunity be sent to the office of the head judge nor shall the sentence be executed until confirmed by his signature nor then until thirty days after the sentence has been read in the chamber of audience art   every person who knowingly and wilfully has been contributory to the injurious     external banishment of any person shall suffer imprisonment for a length of time equal to that during which such banishment shall have had place and shall moreover to the extent of his means be compelled to contribute to the furnishing compensation in a pecuniary shape for the injury observations on the subject of preventive measures against injurious and secret banishment for security against secret and injurious banishment two obvious measures of the preventive class present themselves one is prohibiting egress without passports the other is prohibiting egress without entry of the fact in the official register book it may perhaps be too much to say that in no state of things either of these means ought to be employed but what may be said and with truth is that generally speaking the evil of the remedy will be found to preponderate over the good the state of things will be an extraordinary one if for one instance in which the egress is involuntary on the part of the individual there will not be hundreds not to say thousands in which it is voluntary—say for arguments sake one thousand here then in the hope of saving from the greater vexation a single person a thousand are subjected to the lesser but in the case where a passport is rendered necessary neither in its length nor therefore in its aggregate amount has the vexation any certain limit power without limit over every one who has need of the passport is thus given to the functionary or functionaries whoever they be whose signature or signatures are necessary to the giving validity to it and thus for the sake of saving one from injurious banishment a thousand are exposed to arbitrary confinement—confinement not the less vexatious for not being against law in the case where simple registration is all that is required the power of granting or refusing the passport not being given in a direct way the danger of abuse may seem as if materially lessened if not removed it is not however by a great deal so effectually lessened in reality as in appearance for still so long as the minute in question remains unmade the confinement is as effectual as if the case had been that of a passport that had been delayed the argument from the security thus afforded has hitherto been supposed entire this however it cannot be in any case and the more uncertain the effect of it is the less the utility absolutely considered and thence comparatively with reference to the vexation produced by it the efficacy will depend upon the nature of the communication with other countries and the efficacy of the means actually employed for keeping persons and things in a state of confinement—true it is that exportation of another person against his will is not in general so easy to a man as the exportation of his own person or of an equal mass of inanimate things section iv securities against secret and unlawful homicide art   on the death of every person except as excepted notice thereof shall be given to the iman of the parish within which the death took place if in any dwellinghouse by the occupier thereof or some other person in whose presence the death took place if not in any dwellinghouse or the ground belonging to a house and occupied therewith—as for example on a journey if at the time any person or persons were present then by some one or any of the persons present—if the person be found dead then by some person by whom the body was found art   in every case in which it appears that in the production of the death of any individual human agency has in any shape borne a part every person to whose mind or senses appearances tending to give probability to such an incident have presented themselves is expected and required to give to his conception in relation thereto whatsoever publicity it may be in his power to produce art   to this end after making inspection of the dead body if it be in his power with his own eyes let him repair to the nearest mosque with all possible despatch and communicate to the iman such observations as he has made to the end that this servant of god may take cognizance of the facts and in case of immoral agency on the part of any individual do whatsoever may be in his power towards the discovering and punishing of every criminal so concerned art   having received such communication the iman shall with all practical diligence repair to the spot on which the body lies and there make examination of the state of the body and make inquiry in relation to the matter at the hands of all persons by whom appropriate information is offered or at whose hands it seems capable of being obtained art   in taking such examination let the servant of god proceed as follows   except as excepted let everything done by him on this occasion be done as publicly as possible   if in regard to this or that person he sees reason to suspect that on seeing what passes he may give information thereof to some person or persons contributory to the death for the purpose of enabling them to escape he may keep secret from such person anything that tends to point suspicion upon the person so suspected until means have been taken for his arrestation   let him in the name of god and his prophet adjure all persons so interrogated to declare the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth in relation to the matter in hand and that as well spontaneously as in answer to all such questions as he shall have to put to them       in case of refusal to give information or to make answer to this or that question let him take note thereof but if any allegation in justification of such refusal be made let him make mention also of such allegation   so if any means be used to evade giving such information   so if after promise to give it such promise be not fulfilled   of the demeanour as well as discourse of every individual at whose hands testimony is required as above let him take account in writing noting as correctly as possible the very words of everything that is said   in the case of each individual so interrogated let him read over to him what has been written in every instance where it has been signified by the witness that the account so given by him was in this or that particular incorrect and that it ought to have been so and so let him make addition accordingly but let him not on this account obliterate anything that has been written for any contradiction that has place between any subsequent part of the testimony and any antecedent part may help to make known the truth   at the end of the account thus given of each persons testimony let him cause the witness if able to write his own name in confirmation thereof if unable let the servant of god write the name and cause the witness in confirmation thereof to take the pen in hand and make a mark and to this mark let him add in his own hand or the hands of the respective persons the names of the persons who saw the mark made or of a competent number of them choosing such whose attestive testimony may upon occasion be resorted to with least inconvenience in every shape  0 if by any person present a desire be expressed that a question to this or that purport be put to any other person in relation to this same business let the servant of god if in his judgment such question be not irrelevant or on any other account improper put the same accordingly on the number of the questions if regarding the same as improper he decline putting it to the witness still if by him by whom it is propounded or by any other person present it be desired that entry be made of such request and refusal so be it    of the names of all persons present during the examination of such witness let entry in like manner be made unless the number be so great that such entry would occupy too much time in such case the number may be limited to twelve unless the persons themselves desire entry to be made of their names in which case after those by whom no such desire has been expressed have been entered to the number of twelve entry may be made of those by whom the desire is expressed till the whole number amount to twentyfour if by any person complaint be made of partiality in the choice let note be made of such complaint the servant of god following his own judgment notwithstanding section v securities applicable to the case of mysterious disappearance art   in case of unexpected disappearance of any person if it be known or suspected that he is clandestinely kept in confinement anywhere or has been secretly put to death or by force or fraud sent out of the country application being made on his behalf to the cadi or to any inferior judicatory entry shall thereof be made in the register book of such judicatory and means shall be employed for the recordation and notification of the fact to the end that in the case of his being unlawfully confined he may be liberated or otherwise dealt with or if unlawfully transported he may be brought back or if unlawfully put to death means may be taken for the punishment of all persons concerned in the commission of the injury art   such application being made the judge shall hear and make entry thereof in an appropriate register book of the judicatory and shall do whatsoever shall be in his power towards the causing notification to be made thereof throughout the dominion of the state art   at the request of any person so applying the judge shall immediately deliver to him or suffer him to take or cause to be taken a copy thereof signed by the said judge copies in any number being taken of such copy the judge shall without delay cause examination thereof to be made and as soon as they have respectively been found or made correct shall in like manner authenticate them by his signature to the end that by the applicant transmission thereof be made to all such judicatories and mosques as the applicant shall be desirous of sending them to whereupon immediately upon the receipt of each such copy the iman of the mosque shall make publication thereof by reading the contents to the faithful in full congregation assembled art   in every judicatory in the office of which any such copy shall have been received the presiding judge shall cause it to be kept in the archives having in the first place made notification thereof in the promptest and at the same time in the most public manner that the circumstances of time and place admit of art   attached to such record of disappearance shall be an invitation to all persons having knowledge of any facts tending to the discovery of the authors of the injury or the causing it to cease if the party be alive to repair to any judicatory or to any mosque at their choice there to testify what they know which done the president of the judicatory or the iman of the mosque shall upon his responsibility use such means as his situation admits of to the forwarding to the proper judicatory the information so obtained art   the petition on which a record of disappearance is grounded must be signed by   0 some one person namely to the end that in case of its being presented through malice or otherwise without justification or sufficient excuse the person presenting it may be responsible to the purpose of pecuniary compensation with or without ulterior punishment for the vexation so produced such petition may be signed by persons in any number and in such case such signatures may be in lines one under another or in lines forming the rays of a circle the use of this radial form is to save the individual principally concerned from being more exposed than the rest to vindictive treatment at the hands of any functionary or other person in whose breast the application might excite displeasure art   in so far as applicants are unable to defray the expense of copies and transmission let the judicatory defray it out of any such means as it has in its power section vi securities against extortion of personal service art   by no person functionary or nonfunctionary shall personal service in any shape be exacted of any individual without

securities against official depredation definitions—official depredation may have place at the expense of an individual or at the expense of government—that is to say at the expense of the whole community at whose expense the money employed in the service of government is collected official depredation at the expense of government belongs not to this purpose official depredation has place in so far as any public functionary avails himself of the power or influence possessed by him by means of his office to obtain from any person money moneys worth or beneficial service in any shape not having a right thereto by law the instrument whereby this offence is committed may be either force intimidation or deceit intimidation may be exercised by producing either the fear of some eventual positive evil or the fear of failing to obtain the matter of good which the functionary had no right to prevent the individual from receiving art   imposition of secrecy is evidence of official depredation if on the occasion of the valuable thing or service received intimation is by the functionary conveyed to the individual that it is the wish of the functionary that the transaction should be concealed from anybody such declared wish affords presumption of official depredation the presumption if the fact of the having given intimation of such a wish is credited shall be regarded as provisionally conclusive art   if on account of any service or supposed service rendered or supposed to have been rendered or to be about to be rendered to an individual by a public functionary by means or in respect of his official power gift or service other than what is appointed and allowed by law be received by him or to his use or for any person specially connected with him by any tie of interest or sympathy intimidation or corruption shall be presumed to have been exercised by such functionary intimidation namely by apprehension lest evil in some shape in which it ought not to be inflicted by him on the individual be so inflicted or lest good in some shape in which it ought to be rendered to the individual by the functionary without such gift or service should not be rendered by him accordingly corruption in the view of obtaining of the functionary at the expense of the public the matter of good in some shape in which it ought not to be so rendered art   in case of intimidation the gift or the equivalent of the service may be recovered of the functionary or his heirs at any time within  years art   in case of corruption it may be recovered for the use of the public treasury art   if by any public functionary gift or service not due to the sovereign by law be received or required of any individual on pretence that it is for the sovereigns use or by command of the sovereign the intimation by which it is asserted or supposed that the sovereign issued any such command or would receive any such gift of service if permitted shall be deemed a calumny and the functionary and every person willingly contributory to the conveying such intimation shall be punished as the author of such calumny art   if on any such occasion any writing to any such effect be produced purporting to be authenticated by the signature of the sovereign the same shall be regarded as a forged instrument and the persons concerned in the exhibition thereof shall be punished as for forgery art   provided always that if the sovereign be pleased to appear in the judicatory and in the face of the bystanders declare that the signature was really his signature in such case it shall be acknowledged as such and all due obedience shall ensue art   every functionary by whom on account of any branch of the public service money or moneys worth is required at the hands of any individual shall on receiving that which is required or any part of it deliver to the person of whom it has been received an appropriate instrument or writing acknowledging such receipt this

shall be punished for the falsehood and the party if privy to the falsehood shall not have the benefit of the evidence so obtained but care must be taken lest he not being privy to the falsehood a false friend should by obtaining it by means of falsehood deprive him of the benefit of it art   if by legal means employed for the purpose of obtaining evidence of this or that act of delinquency or of the correspondent nondelinquency or in respect of this or that particular right writings or other documents capable of serving as evidence respecting any other supposed offence or right be obtained the evidence thus obtained may be employed accordingly but if in this way possession or inspection has been obtained of writings or other documents by the publicity of which evil in any shape has been produced to any person without service rendered to justice in any shape as above for such evil all parties concerned in the production of it shall be responsible to the purpose of reparation or punishment or both as the case may require art   if for the purpose of producing serious evil by disclosure of writings or other documents evidence not applicable to any other than a trivial offence or a trivial right be obtained although it be by legal means all persons knowingly concerned in such inspection or divulgation shall be responsible to the purpose of reparation or punishment or both but from the punishment deduction may be made proportioned to any such real good as shall be deemed to have been produced by the production of such evidence example for the purpose of causing a person to be disinherited or otherwise made to suffer by an oversevere or capricious father husband or master an adversary obtains by legal means in company with documents applicable to the purpose of a trivial offence or right others which by means of some exasperation produce the evil effect intended as above chapter v hopes of success for any project having such securities for its end section i value of the concession on the part of the sovereign in the first instance all that to this effect can be done by the sovereign—all that can be asked for at his hands—is resolveable into one thing—promises towards the performance of these promises all that can be done in the event of a violation of the promises is the procuring notoriety for the several acts by which such violation has been effected everything i say that he can do on his part amounts to a promise and nothing more if for example he grants a representative assembly what he thereby does by such grant amounts to a promise to suffer the deputies to be elected and to meet according to forms of their own choosing or forms recommended by him as the case may be if in the case of such invitation or permission he makes a declaration     or assurance that in the event of their meeting he will not thenceforward give or endeavour to give execution and effect to any laws to which they have not given their consent whether antecedently to their receiving his sanction or not till afterwards here again is another promise or set of promises if what is obtained of him consists of edicts interdicting the exercise of any acts by which in certain ways therein mentioned men are made to suffer in their persons or their property by whomsoever such acts may have been exercised—in this again is comprised a promise not only to abstain from such acts himself but to punish without exception all persons by whom they shall be or have been exercised as a security and that a necessary one for the performance of this primary class of promises comes a sort of secondary class of promises having for their subjectmatter in the event of any violation of these promises the suffering the giving execution and effect to a set of mandates and permissions having for their object the giving to every such infraction notoriety to every extent possible if notwithstanding these promises explicit and implied together—promises engaging not to give any such predatory or other oppressive orders orders to that effect are given by him here again is another instance of violation of promise on his part if notwithstanding the correspondent order to the citizens of all classes not to exercise such acts of violation acts of that sort are exercised and he omits to give the requisite orders for appropriate prosecution and virtual punishment—if to any exertions made by the injured parties or others for the purpose of instituting and continuing such prosecution until sentence be pronounced and if condemnatory executed he by himself or others opposes obstructions in an immediate and declared or unimmediate and undeclared way—obstructions to any endeavours used for bringing about such punishment—here again is another violation of promise—another instance of perfidy on his part still in all these cases everything that is done by any person other than the sovereign himself consists in an appeal made to public opinion of everything that is thus done or endeavoured at the success depends upon the spirit the intelligence the vigilance the alertness the intrepidity the energy of those of whose opinions the public opinon is composed as everything depends upon public opinion so does everything depend upon notoriety—notoriety as above to ordinances transgressions of these ordinances and suffrages and note here with regard to transgressions that be the instances of violation ever so frequent it follows not from such frequence that the ordinances in question have been altogether without effect much less that in their own nature they are inefficient and nugatory this may be exemplified in the case of the ordinance whereby assistance given to a person engaged in the commission of this or that act of oppression is declared to be criminal and as such punishable resistance to it lawful and not punishable antecedently to such concession any person by whom any such act of oppression was witnessed would regard it as lawful and be without hope of any punishment being inflicted on any person concerned in it suppose on the other hand the concession and the virtual promise contained in it made every one would in the first instance and unless taught the contrary by experience entertain the expectation and hope of seeing it observed and in pursuance of such hope individuals might rise up with one accord and concur in opposing effectual resistance individuals into whose conception but for such ordinance no idea but that of obedience would have entered this view of things—this hope—this estimate of the usefulness of solemn monarchical promises how flagrantly soever violated is confirmed by all history—by the history of all nations in which they have been made in england for example take the instances of magna charta and the bill of rights as already referred to magna charta dating near the commencement of the thirteenth century of the christian era the bill of rights towards the close of the seventeenth abundant and frequent have been the violations of both these clusters of promises yet is it to them that the english are indebted for every security against misrule—for every abstraction from misrule by which their condition is distinguished to its advantage from that of the inhabitants of the continent of europe so in france take for instance the charter which the conquering despots forced the people to receive at the hands of the reigning monarch the security miserably inadequate—the principle upon which it is grounded a security for not against misrule the lot of the whole people declared dependent upon the arbitrary will of a single one of them he by his situation rendered in every intelligible sense of the word worst the worst of all of them on every occasion he would be instrumental in sacrificing the interest of these thirty millions of his fellowcountrymen to his own sinister interest and caprice yet such is his benevolence that cases are mentioned by him in which he promises so far to keep a restraint upon his desires as to forbear from making the sinister sacrifice each moment he would be warranted in taking all they have yet such is his generosity that of the fruit of each mans labour there is a part which in so far as it may happen to the promise to be observed he may keep even of this scandalous provision insulting and grossly inadequate as it is the violations are incessant still however under this so inadequately bridled mixed monarchy the lot of the people is less disastrous than under     the despotism by which the revolution was produced section ii the probability of the sovereigns consent abstractly considered the question concerning the probability of consent on the part of the sovereign was brought to view at the outset it has never been out of remembrance unfortunately having as they have for their object the applying limits to his power the greater the efficacy which the several proposed arrangements would have on the supposition of his consent the less sanguine the hope of its being obtained cannot but be as to this point such as they are they must take their chance that hopes have place that to the purposes here in question he may be brought to bestow upon the people a benefit so transcendant and so unexampled is a datum without which the work could not have been undertaken in form and tenor the object has been to render what is done as little offensive to the feelings of a man in the situation in question as the nature of the case can admit of its being of misdeeds and misdoers a description in the several cases is given if so it be that it is his will and pleasure to give himself a title to that appellation there is no help for it but to him personally and individually it is not on any occasion applied if to stop the course of justice be his will and pleasure so it must be all that could be done is so to order matters that the security thus endeavoured to be afforded cannot in any case be taken away without its being seen by and known to the people that it has been taken away and that by taking it away he is stopping or perverting the course of justice not only so but matters are so ordered as that unless in so far as special injunction of secrecy has been communicated whatsoever has place is by the general means of notoriety whatever they are that have been provided made notorious to wit according to the degree of notoriety whatever it be which by these same means has been established but in all internal concerns at least not to speak of international ones secrecy in the acts of constituted authorities or in the circumstances in which they have been performed affords a presumption—and indeed with the exception of certain cases to a comparatively small extent which may without difficulty be distinguished and declared amounts to a confession—of guilt of moral and political guilt a confession that the promotion of some sinister interest and not the universal interest is the object of what is done a confession of this sort neither the sovereign himself nor any subordinate of his will willingly be seen to make a bit of some sort or other and that an effectual one the courser must have in his mouth the object is to render it so soft and smooth that as far as possible it shall be imperceptible accordingly whatsoever be the obstacle on no occasion is it to the person of the sovereign that it is opposed not to him either by name or description but to the person concerned in the vexatious practice whatsoever it may be and the practice being not only vexatious but with reference to determinate individuals plainly injurious that the sovereign should in his own person be an actor in the injury can scarcely in decency be supposed by anybody nor will it be expected of these arrangements that they should have any such supposition for their ground the injurious act being brought to light whatever disrepute attaches upon it will attach at any rate in the first instance upon the instruments which he employs on them he will see it attaching and on them on the supposition of its not coming home to himself he will without much concern or resentment as towards anybody so long as it is not seen by him to come home to himself see it attach for its not doing so he will naturally be led to trust to the splendour that environs him and to the delusion and awe which it inspires to a certain degree what he thus relies upon will take place but in the meantime of a fund of discontent in the breasts of individuals not known to him and therefore not exposed to punishment symptoms will be continually breaking out by the obscurity of the source danger in the eyes of him on whom it impends far from being diminished is magnified and thus it may be that upon the whole he will find his situation more comfortable by abstaining from injury than by indulging himself in it compared with a set of provisions bearing expressly upon the person of the sovereign opposition in this mode will be analogous to that which in machinery is opposed by friction compared with that which is produced by an opposing bar accustomed to contemplate all objects in a general point of view the draughtsman has had some advantages over the sovereign who in his situation is not accustomed to the labour of regarding them in any other than a particular point of view by the legislative draughtsman the objects that belong to the occasion will be seen all of them in a general point of view—the vexations which whether in the shape of simple vexation or in that of depredation a man in the situation of the sovereign cannot fail upon occasion to conceive the desire of practising the instruments and other favourites whom whether on their personal accounts respectively or in virtue of their common relation to him as being part and parcel of his property he will be disposed to let into a participation of these his privileges in some instances beforehand and in the way of previous license in all instances in the way of impunity in the event of any endeavours used to call them to account so on the other hand the resentment which by any endeavour or     so much as a disposition on the part of the person injured to obtain remedy or so much as relief can scarce fail to be handled in a breast so situated to the eyes of the sovereign himself no such extensive views will naturally be present when the means of securing notoriety to his proceedings are proposed to him if so it be that there exists no particular act of depredation or vexation in any shape that he has conceived the desire to commit he will not be forward to suppose that there will be any such in future he will not be forward to suspect to himself a disposition which even in his own instance he could not regard as altogether free from blame if so it be that no individual instrument or favourite to whom in respect of any particular instance of depredation or oppression he would like to afford license or impunity happens to be in the moment in his eye it will not be agreeable to him to look backward to past instances of any such undue favour or forward to future contingent ones if so it be that there exists no particular individual against whom by the audacity of his endeavours to obtain remedy or relief his resentment has been kindled he will not find much satisfaction in any such supposition as that of his being angry without just and sufficient cause not that in his situation advisers to whose situation reflections of a general nature are more necessary are likely to be wanting—advisers by whom representation will be made of the danger with which improvement in any shape and particularly in the shape here in question cannot but be pregnant nor therefore does there seem any great ground for hope that without more special and particularly strong impulse a concession so unexampled and naturally so revolting to ruling pride will be submitted to but be it what it may this chance is the only one which being the case no argument against the taking it can be derived from the smallness of it such as above being the securities proposed as presenting the fairest promise in every point of view natural consequences if conceded and probability of success taken together—only in proportion as they apply a restrictive check to the accomplishment of the sovereigns will only in proportion to the extent to which they operate in this direction can they be productive of any of those salutary effects for the purpose of which they are proposed but the idea of any effectual opposition to his own will in whatsoever direction operating is an idea to which in a mind so situated more pain is attached than can be outweighed by the consideration of any particular pleasure that he may be capable of deriving from the contemplation of any particular good effects of which the creatures subject to his power must receive their share before he receives his their share being at the same time if taken in the aggregate much greater than his his situation is as to this matter that of the infant with his physic—some years must have passed over his head before any such remote contingent and imperfectly conceived event as the cessation of the suffering he is enduring from the disease can form of itself an adequate inducement to be freely and voluntarily instrumental in afflicting himself with the pain so certainly and immediately attached to the nauseous dose the chance of the requisite concession is not equally small in all imaginable cases to obtain security against vexation in all its shapes and at all times against all persons but more particularly against all persons who have it most particularly in their power to produce it is the object of these arrangements more particularly against vexation at the hands of the sovereign and those in authority under him vexation for the gratification of their respective appetites and passions the classes of persons at whose hands it is most to be apprehended are—  the sovereign himself   the sovereigns favourites   the several functionaries under him considered as being on every such occasion employed as his and their instruments for his and their personal gratification so these same functionaries considered as being in a condition to employ their power in the production of vexation and oppression for their own gratification and supposed advantage to vexation of this latter description so far as confined to this latter purpose the sovereign will not naturally have any considerable aversion what may be the sufferings of the people taken at large will on this occasion as on every other be to a mind so situated a matter of indifference against any sentiment of sympathy of which they may be the objects will be to be set that portion of sympathy which has for its object the enjoyments of a select set of men who being in a more especial manner in his service belong to him by a nearer and dearer tie than the members of the community at large removed as they are from his sight and his cognizance if there be anything by which his sympathy can be turned in favour of the people it must be a species of fear fear of the unpopularity that by possibility may be turned against his own sacred head by the consideration of the connexion that has place between himself and those creatures of his will—the oppressors whose power of continuing the oppression a word from him would suffice to terminate if then according to his calculation any dissatisfaction produced by the divulgation of instances of oppression will on every occasion take them and them alone for its object if it will not rise higher if it will not rise so high as to reach his own person or those of his more especial favourites in such case no very urgent inducement may be necessary for obtaining his consent in tripoli as in england if at any time he can make the people quiet by the sacrifice of a set of instruments in which     no special favourite is numbered a comparatively small inducement—a comparatively slight degree of apprehension may suffice turning out this set and taking in a different one he may through their instrumentality go on in the same track beginning only a new score turning out a set of tories he may go on playing the same game with a pack of whigs section iii inducements by which in the situation of sovereign of tripoli a man may be engaged to concur and take the lead in the proposed change   inducements purely selfregarding—inducements applying to him in his personal capacity—to his purely selfregarding interest person reputation property domestic relations condition in life in respect of one or more of these possessions if in any way in the situation in question as in any other will a mans welfare or condition be affected whether it be in an advantageous way or in a disadvantageous way  st as to person under the existing state of things the person of the sovereign is in a perpetual state of insecurity to individuals in an indefinite number inducements for attacking his life are continually presented by both branches of human appetite the irascible and the concupiscable under a form of government such as the arbitrary one still in existence as in all former times oppression in all its shapes cannot but be matter of continual practice of every injury thus sustained the sovereign presents himself to the view of the injured party as the author in most instances this will be an erroneous view but in a more or less considerable number it can scarcely fail to have more or less of truth in it so imperfectly defined under such a form of government are the boundaries which separate right and wrong in particular those by which rightful occupation is distinguished from depredation in whatsoever way committed—whether without consent and by force as in the way of taxation or with consent and by a sort of fraud as by taking up goods in the capacity of a purchaser but without ever paying for them thus much as to the provocation offered to the irascible appetite in the case of a boundless multitude a multitude to which at any rate there are no bounds but those by which the population of the country is circumscribed now as to the provocation offered to the concupiscable appetite the sovereign not having at present any established and regularly disciplined military force for the security of his person nothing but an uncertain number of irregularly armed retainers and irregularly and unequally paid domestics the sovereignty presents itself at all times to the eyes of a man of ardent ambition or desperate courage in the character of a prize which awaits the hand of every man who has the spirit to put in for it in the situation in question were it possible for a man to have any hold on the general affections of his subjects this hold might be a sort of security to him a sort of discouragement to every man of adventurous disposition who would feel disposed to put in for the prize but no such possibility has place by any considerable body of men who would embark together for the purpose on the principle of equality or by a handful of men if tolerably well trained and placed under the command of a single adventurer induced by regular pay by hope of plunder or by personal attachment the miscellaneous unarmed and irregularly and unequallypaid body of his present defenders might at any time be overpowered and an end—a violent end put to the sovereigns life   reputation in this particular the advantage which invites his acceptance is it will be seen altogether matchless but before any thing of detail under this head is brought to view there will be a convenience in carrying on the inquiry through the other heads that have been mentioned under this head suffice it to observe on the present occasion that with a man in such a situation anything positively good in the way of reputation can scarcely in the general case find a restingplace whatever there may be to which this appellation can apply will be rather of the negative than of the positive cast—such a man has in such a situation done rather less mischief than such another man thus in respect of this endowment a man has everything to gain by the change nothing to lose   property under the present form of government if in the hands of every inferior possessor property in all its shapes is in a state of insecurity in the hands of the superior possessor it can scarcely be said to be in a much better state the desires of the man whoever he be by whom the situation of chief ruler is filled—the desires of this man whoever he be being continually outrunning the means of satisfying them the agents employed by him in the collection of his dues are continually upon the alert for occasions and means of adding to the amount but in such a state of things while on the one part there is a constant endeavour to grasp at more than has been wont to be received so on the other part there exists a correspondent endeavour to withdraw from the grasp of the depredator as much as possible—not only the more and more continually demanded over and above what has been habitually received but likewise as much as possible of that which has hitherto been received the consequence is that in the midst or by means of this conflict security is banished from both sides in the midst of this conflict less than he has at present he may have to any amount more he cannot have unless his subjects have     it to give to him and his subjects are at all times prevented from having any more to give to him prevented by that state of insecurity which is inseparable from their condition he is indigent because they are indigent under the existing form of government their indigence it will be seen is perpetual and incurable therefore so is his but on this subject there will be occasion to say more presently   domestic relations and condition in life—to this head may be referred the uncertainties and anxieties which besiege the monarch in his character of father the prospect of a bloody contest between his sons as being about to have place whenever his own life is at an end in every frank monarchy the order of succession is clearly fixed no such apprehension as that of a civil war from any such cause has place in the dominion of tripoli the order of succession is not fixed and in the existing state of the family that which in almost every other country would be one of the severest curses is even a blessing of his three or four sons the eldest on whom mens eyes would naturally have fixed themselves in the first place is at present generally regarded as being decidedly unapt for reigning by the flagrant atrocity of his disposition this generally and at present but when the existing sovereign has quitted the stage who can say for certain what turn mens minds the minds on which such things depend may take what an incitement may not such an occasion be for some ambitious desperado to come forward and collect a party for the support of the natural or rightful heir to the monarchy whose sins he will pronounce expiated by the disgrace he has endured and whose disposition has been molified and cured by the lessons which from the silent hand of adversity he has received ii extra regarding inducements—inducements applying to him in his social capacity viz in so far as his prosperity is dependent on that of the people the same division the same heads of inquiry that served in the case of his personal interest will serve now in the case of his social interest in this case however the survey will have little need to touch upon any of the above four points other than that of property of property which in this case receives the name of the matter of national wealth in so far as in respect of personal condition reputation or condition in life the lot of individuals at large considered as members of the same community happens to be an object of interest and solicitude to him it is well but in this case it is to his sympathetic affections and not to his selfregarding affections that the interest applies remains then as the sole remaining subject of consideration in the character of a source of inducements to the sovereign to give the consent in question the article of national wealth so far as regards hope of increase nothing can be more intimate than the connexion between the interest of the sovereign and that of his subjects taken in the aggregate no object more strictly dependent upon another than is his opulence upon their opulence in the existing state of things under the existing form of government the sovereign has at all times extracted from his subjects as much as was capable of being extracted from them in this state of things all ulterior increase to him without increase to them being hopeless remains as the only source of hope in regard to increase to him such increase whatsoever it may be as may be derived from a correspondent increase to them but under the existing state of things any very considerable increase of wealth to them is impossible all such increase is altogether dependent on a general sense of security no considerable increase of wealth can take place but by means of a proportionate increase of capital but no considerable increase of capital employed in giving increase to the generality of growing wealth can take place without a proportionate and correspondent increase in the sense of security capital is money or moneys worth laid out in large masses in the hope of reimbursement with an increase at the end of a length of time more or less considerable—say six eight or ten years or even without hope of reimbursement on the condition that the returns each year though perhaps not more than a twentieth or fiveandtwentieth or thirtieth of the capital advanced shall be perpetual and transferable whatsoever money or moneys worth a man has in store over and above what serves him for the current consumption of the year if he cannot obtain security for any return that might otherwise be expected from the employment of it he will either hoard it up as a stock to serve him in case of casual demand on the score of distress by loss or otherwise or if he employ it he will employ it in some other country—employ it that is to say either in giving increase to the quantity of national wealth in some other country or what comes to the same thing in an indirect way namely by occupying the place of an equal quantity which may be drawn off from that destination and thus giving increase to the quantity of national wealth in that same country as above but by any such sense of insecurity not only will capital be prevented from being so employed as to increase the stock of national wealth in the country in question but it will be prevented from coming into existence the adequate motive the inducement for giving existence to it being wanting by the sight of the external instruments of enjoyment or felicity in all their several shapes every human being is in a state of constant temptation solicited by these as he is to make acquisition of them and in the way of consumption employ them according to their several qualities and destinations all without exception are perpetually operated upon and stand exposed to the temptation     for indeed not one in a thousand is in a way to conceive the idea of employing capital in the purchase of foreign securities not many have the selfdenial to sacrifice in any such way to any considerable extent the present to the contingent future a future which even in a state or country of the greatest security is seldom estimated so high as it is worth and which in a country such as this in question is worth so little in comparison with what it is worth in countries where subjects enjoy a very considerable and efficient security against all irregular and unserviceable exactions by the hand of government however it may be as to regular and serviceable ones thus temptation has in every state of things two branches one is that which is presented by the love of enjoyment in the several shapes in which it is afforded by the several instruments of enjoyment according to their several natures the other is that which is constituted by the aversion to labour or say by the love of ease this impossibility of any considerable increase of wealth to the nation and thence to the sovereign without a correspondent increase in the article of security—security against misrule the force of the arbitrary power in the hands of the sovereign will appear the more plainly in proportion as the several sources from which the matter of wealth is capable of being extracted are the more particularly brought to view capital may be employed in giving increase to the quantity of growing wealth in either of two ways or situations namely  st in the hands of individuals acting singly each employing his capital on his own single account  nd in the hands of individuals acting in associations more or less extensive the capital being collected from a number of hands more or less considerable and according to the magnitude of the concern employed either by the same hands by which it is supplied or by a lesser number of hands chosen and appointed by the united suffrages of those by whom and for whom it is employed with the first of these two states of things as being the more simple let us commence the inquiry the other will be understood from it of course the first most extensive and most obvious source of increase to wealth—is labour employed immediately upon land in this case insecurity may attach upon it in two ways either or both of them namely  st upon the undisturbed possession of the land itself  nd upon the undisturbed possession of the growing produce the most intensely and extensively operative cause of insecurity and of the sense of insecurity is that which affects the title to the land the title to the perpetual possession or the title to the assured possession of it for a fixed and ascertained number of years as the case may be wheresoever the title to the land may be deficient either in respect of certainty or in respect of permanence the inducement to expend any capital in the improvement of it will experience proportionate diminution in tripoli the title to the land itself is everywhere more or less exposed to hazard and loss from two sources   from the arbitrary power of the sovereign   from attacks in the way of litigation by individual counter claimants in the case of lands in general for the sovereign to take forcible possession of them without other ground or cause assigned than the absoluteness of his power is it is believed not a very ordinary occurrence still however he that can do anything whatsoever that can be done by power can of course do that whenever he pleases improvements having land for their immediate subjectmatter will apply either to the surface or to the interior improvements applying to the surface will apply either to the soil itself or to its boundaries or to its means of communication improvements applying to the soil itself will consist either of the addition of manures or of the addition or subtraction of water manures are either textureimproving manures or alimentsupplying say in one word alimentary manures improvements having respect to water operate either by the subtraction of it when in too great quantity that is to say by drainage or by occasional addition to it that is to say by irrigation whether it be to be excluded by draining or occasionally introduced for the purpose of irrigation capital to an amount more or less considerable must it is evident be expended capital the returns for which will be more or less distant and uncertain boundaries are either  st for mere demarcation i e showing where property ends or  d for exclusion of objects the entrance of which would produce annoyance these are   high winds i e air when in a certain degree of agitation   animals wild or tame   human beings at whose hands depredation destruction or deterioration are apprehended boundaries having any such exclusion for their object are styled fences some animals there may be for the sufficient exclusion of which in some situations and circumstances no very considerable expenditure of capital may be necessary but in other instances the expenditure necessary for this purpose even where this is the only one may be very great     as to human beings of fences sufficient for the exclusion of depredators and deteriorators in this shape the expense cannot in any situation fail of being very considerable for the effectual exclusion of them if absolutely determined to gain entrance no expense how vast soever can it is evident be sufficient in the making of fences in this view a sort of calculation sufficiently obvious is of course made on the one side is set down the estimated value of the damage apprehended from such intrusion on the other hand the estimated expense of such fence as will in general be sufficient sufficient to overbalance the net profit looked for by an intruder after deduction of the value of the burthen composed of the labour and physical hazard of the enterprise combined with the eventual evil apprehended in the case of detection and punishment now as to the interior of the earth say in the english phrase the bowels of it meaning in general whatever masses of matter lie within the surface down to which vegetation extends extensive portions of the matter of the earth considered in this point of view are called mines such portions as are regarded as consisting of earth concreted into a stony hardness and not containing metallic substances in any proportion worth regarding are in english distinguished by a particular name quarries and so in other languages when separated from other substances the several different subjects of the mineral kingdom as it is called exhibit differences in value upon a scale of prodigious length witness at the one end of it diamonds and other glittering stones deriving value from their splendour combined with their rarity at the other end clay sand lime and coal not however from the value of the species of the matter when obtained separately is the value of the mine that affords it to be estimated but to that circumstance combined with the quantity and quality of the labour employed in effecting the separation and conveying the matter in its separate state to the several places where it is put to use taking all these circumstances into consideration the working of a diamond mine or of a gold mine may instead of the most lucrative of all mining concerns be a losing one and such in many instances it actually has been witness for example brazil as may be seen in mr mawes interesting travels in that interesting country on the other hand not only coal and chalk but even clay and sand may be and in every well cultivated country actually have been and continue to be extracted with considerable profit witness the clay extracted for porcelain and other pottery in england in particular coal a substance which from the vegetable has by lapse of time past into the mineral kingdom has for centuries past constituted the foundation of vast opulence to numerous families opulence in masses superior to any that are to be found in tripoli of whatsoever materials composed as to stones called precious and the metals called by way of distinction precious although they are capable of existing in such quantities and under such circumstances as not to pay for the labour of extraction yet they are also capable of existing and accordingly have been found to exist in such proportions and under such circumstances as to afford a greater rate of profit than any other ingredients in the composition of the earths interior hence it is that by men in general and in particular by men armed with power they have been in all times and in all places regarded with peculiar avidity accordingly mines in which gold has been found and mines in which silver has been found have in many perhaps most countries been by law and practice in whose soever land and by whomsoever discovered declared sacred to the use of the sovereign too valuable to be capable of passing into any subject hand in general before the peculiar precious substance can be found in any very considerable quantity it becomes necessary to penetrate to a depth where vegetation ends here and there however exceptions to this rule have been found gold in particular has in large quantities been obtained by extracting and sifting the earth found at the bottom of shallow rivers as to silver in the mixed masses in which it is contained it has been found in a great variety of proportions in some instances in a proportion so large that every other metal mixed with it has in the course of the extraction been driven away and sacrificed to it in other instances it has been as it were drowned in the less precious metal and the less precious metal has been sold at a price no higher than what would have been asked for it had no silver been combined with it in particular this in many instances has been the case with lead in england in the case of a mine in which silver is thus found in combination with a metal inferior in separate value unfortunate may be the condition of the proprietor who has expended a capital in the extraction of it sooner or later enters the agent of the sovereign and says—this mine is a sacred one sacrilegious the subjecthands that have employed themselves in the working of it there must be no more such sacrilege so much for the surface of the earth and its interior as an illustration in detail of the ends to which capital might be employed were the system of securities established of undertakings for private or public benefit requiring the permanent employment of capital the following may be held as a general enumeration   manufactories of articles suitable to the local wants and means of supply   means of communication such as roads canals bridges improvements in the facilities  00 for communication afforded by rivers source of profit money in the shape of tolls   reservoirs for the preservation of a supply of water in extraordinary dry seasons for example by wells dug in apt places and water raised from them by horsepower or a steamengine   embankment of rivers in their course for the purpose of irrigation or for giving motion to mills   erection of a prison on the panopticon plan for deriving profit from the abour of prisoners   digging of mines extraction of useful mineral substances of various kinds from the bowels of the earth when by the use of boring machines as directed by geological observation their residence has been discovered to conduct it with advantage an enterprise of this sort commonly requires large advances in the shape of capital but to this end all claim to the absolute ownership of mines on the part of the sovereign in grounds belonging to individuals must be solemnly given up by such surrender he might profit to an indefinite amount and could not lose anything for the effect of such claim is neither more nor less than that of an interdiction prohibiting the working of any such mines it would remain for consideration whether any profit could be derived to the sovereign from a tax upon the produce of such mines in conclusion supposing the system established the government and above all the sovereign at the head of it would be illustrious among all and even above all the sovereigns of europe and the other parts of the christian world by the supposition the change is not only on his part altogether voluntary but it is his own work by the supposition this being the truth there will be no difficulty in making it known that it is so all the circumstances by which it is transacted will be conveyed to england and blazoned forth in the english newspapers from which they will find their way into the angloamerican united states and in the meantime to the liberal french newspapers if with any tolerable hope of safety they can be published there coupled with this intelligence would be that of the encouragement given to the useful arts and sciences of modern european countries by the translations made of writers of that class into arabic and the lectures read in the tripolitan universities these circumstances taken together would constitute as it were a pump for capital a pump by the force of which capital would be drawn into tripoli from all countries in which it overflows by curiosity and the desire to see the country in which such moral wonders had been wrought travellers from other countries but from england in greater numbers than from all other countries put together would be drawn to tripoli and as none of them would go thither without money in their pockets here may be seen another channel through which capital would flow into it and with it those comforts which are habitually enjoyed in other countries and are yet unknown in tripoli end of volume viii  the essential excellence of this system is not lessened by its having been found to be practicable after experience in the working of it to improve the monitorial part of it  the papers here spoken of as not having been completed for the first edition are incorporated in this edition—ed a chrestomathic a word formed from two greek words signifying conducive to useful learning after it was framed it was found employed in a book of the seventeenth century and would probably be to be found in other books  an allusion probably to the chrestomathia of helladins published with notes by meursius in     —ed b stages in regard to the several stages into which the proposed course is proposed to be divided all that in the present state of the undertaking can be done is—to give intimation of the choice which among the several possible subjects of instruction has been made and of the order in which it is proposed they shall succeed to one another at this juncture any such attempt as that of fixing the quantity of time absolute and comparative respectively to be allotted to them would evidently be premature   for this sort of uneasy sensation to which everywhere the human mind is exposed the english language in general so much more copious than the french affords no single worded appellative the word ennui expresses the species of uneasiness désœuvrement another word for which the english language furnishes no equivalent expresses the cause of the uneasiness ennui is the state of uneasiness felt by him whose mind unoccupied but without reproach is on the look out for pleasure pleasure in some one or more of all shapes and beholds at the time no source which promises to afford it désœuvrement is the state in which the mind seeing before it nothing to be done nothing in the shape of business or amusement which promises either security against pain or possession of pleasure is left a prey to the sort of uneasiness just designated in the extent and variety of the ideas obtainable by instruction are found security for that profityielding employment commonly designated by the words livelihood and business for the necessary security against the accidents of all sorts by which wellbeing may be impaired and being destroyed for the designation of the means of securing being and wellbeing the words—calling vocation and occupation were commonly employed by our forefathers meaning always on these occasions profityielding occupation as the words—business the means of livelihood are employed by us their successors the word avocation a most incompetent and equivocal term has of late years been vulgarly and we may almost say commonly obtruded upon the words calling vocation employment a vocation is a calling an avocation is a calling off engaged in an avocation a man is engaged in that whereby being called off from everything he is not left free to apply himself to anything in this same case in which so efficient a security is afforded against pain in all its shapes as well as against the extinction of all pleasures may be seen an equally efficient and much more extensively necessary security against the pain of mental vacuity or ennui it is true to a mind engaged in the toil of business a state of repose is in the intervals of business a state of pleasure for a time yes but especially when the nature of the business includes not in it anything peculiarly toilsome that time must be short otherwise the pain of ennui soon succeeds to the pleasure of repose during the life of him who continues in business to the end of it this pain seldom exceeds the measure of a slight uneasiness but when remembering the anxieties as well as toils under which he had been labouring in the course of his business the man of business seeks in the absence of this source of toil and anxiety a source of perpetual pleasure he finds too often that the mere pleasure of repose is but a shortlived pleasure and that its place is soon occupied by a pain of ennui which ends but with life to this pain of ennui to which the man of industry is exposed only towards the end of  his career the man of hereditary opulence stands exposed throughout the whole course of it it is the endemical disease that hovers over the couch of him whose mind though encompassed with the elements of felicity in the richest profusion allows them by neglecting them to play a comparatively passive part from uneasiness of this sort the mind of him who has cultivated no more than a single branch of art or science possesses a rarely insufficient policy of insurance how much more complete the security of him who possesses in his own mind a richly stocked and variegated garden of art and science of the value of this kind of advantage a more striking and instructive example is scarcely to be found than that which is afforded by the case of mr beardmore as reported in the obituary of the gentlemans magazine for february      died feb    of a gradual decline after having passed his grand climacteric with less visitation from indisposition of mind or body than happens to mankind in general at his house in owens row islington calm from philosophical considerations and resigned upon truly christian principles beloved esteemed and regretted by all who knew his worth john beardmore esq formerly of the great porterbrewing firm of calvert and co in redcross street london a stronger evidence of the fallaciousness of human joys and of the advantages resulting from honest employment can scarcely be pointed out than the life the illness and the death of this good man exhibited mr beardmore was born in dependent circumstances and of humble parentage in the country his constitution naturally sound was hardened by exercise his frame of body naturally athletic was braced by temperance his mind naturally capacious owed little to regular education the theatre of life was his school and university and in it he passed through all his degrees with increasing honours for many years after his residence in london mr beardmore acted as a clerk in the brewery in which he finally became a distinguished partner when it was deemed proper to transfer the concern from redcross street and to consolidate it with that in campion lane upper thames street mr beardmore withdrew himself entirely from business and retired to one of the houses which his brother william had left him at islington by will at his decease some years before from inclination active and from habit indefatigably industrious he had hitherto commanded such an exuberant flow of good spirits as made him the object of general remark among friends whom his kindness and vivacity delighted early rising contributed much to the support of this happy and equable temperament he preserved a memory richly stored with pleasant anecdotes sprightly remarks and useful information on a great variety of topics derived not from books but from living studies he had acquired also a lively popular facility of singing easy songs to which a tuneful voice gave tolerable execution for dull sedentary investigations of abstract science for plodding mechanical uninterrupted pursuits of didactic instruction classical learning or moral and theological knowledge the gay the heartsome john beardmore felt no wish and avowed no relish he was as he often proudly declared a trueborn englishman humane by natural feelings and charitable by a sense of religious duty he passed through a life of honourable toil in business with an easy mind with a light heart and with an unsullied reputation from the fatal hour in which he quitted business however he grew insensibly more and more the victim of listlessness and ennui with high animal spirits with a mind still active and a body still robust with confirmed health independent property an amiable wife a plentiful table and a social neighbourhood mr beardmore was no longer at home in his own house the mainspring of action was now stopped in all his pleasures in all his engagements for the day for the week or for the month he was conscious of a vacuum that alas his want of intellectual resources rendered him utterly unable to supply he experienced now perhaps for the first time that intolerable tædium vitæ which like hope deferred maketh the heart sick the result is soon told long did he bear up against the clouds that obscured his little horizon of domestic repose at times indeed transient flashes of cheerfulness still gleamed athwart the gathering gloom but the intervals between these bright seasons grew longer and even their short duration lessened want of customary application brought on relaxation of activity want of exercise brought on langour of body and depression of spirits a train of evils ensued comprising loss of appetite nervous affections debility mental and corporeal despondency sleeplessness decay of nature difficulty of respiration weariness pain and death advantage third security against inordinate sensuality and its mischievous consequences   against the pleasures of sense over and above such objections as are in some cases drawn from the topic of religion there are these grand heads of objection that in the pursuit they are apt to lead into courses injurious to others and by the obstruction they occasion to necessary business as well as by the loss of reputation to a mans self and that through satiety the consequence of full indulgence in them they are apt to end in ennui—a pain for which they have left no cure not in any degree to diminish but to increase to the utmost the sum of innoxious enjoyment is the object of this system but to secure that increase it is necessary to render men duly sensible of the value and to engage them in the steady pursuit of those perennial springs  0 of enjoyment which are the more productive the more copiously they are drawn upon in preference to those which in proportion as they are drawn upon to excess yield in the shape of ennui at the least if not in still more afflicting shapes pain and grief instead of the expected pleasure when it is by the apprehension of future evil that men are turned aside from the pursuit of present pleasure the sacrifice however prudent and even necessary is still not the less a painful one but when it is by the expectation of still greater pleasure whether near or more or less remote that the diversion is occasioned pain is not produced in any shape the profit made is made without sacrifice and the transition is only from a less to a greater pleasure but the greater the variety of the shapes in which pleasures of an intellectual nature are made to present themselves to view and consequently the greater the degree of success and perfection with which the mind is prepared for the reception of intellectual pleasures the greater the chance afforded of security from the pains by which sensual pleasures are encompassed and the more advantageous the terms on which the purchase of that security is effected advantage fourth security against idleness and consequent mischievousness   the connexion between mental vacuity and mischievousness is not as obvious as that between mental vacuity and sensuality but it is not less natural and indisputable the notion which ascribes to inanimate nature the abhorrence of a vacuum has been long spoken of as an ungrounded and whimsical conceit had the notion been confined to human nature it would not have been equally open to dispute a mind completely vacant if any such there be is a mind in which there exists neither pleasure nor pain nor any expectation of either but scarcely has such a state of mind time to take place when it is succeeded by ennui ennui it has been shown is a state of pain and from pain in this shape as from pain in every other shape man seeks deliverance that deliverance is attempted no otherwise than by the attempt to fill the vacuity with pleasures the pleasures thereupon sought consist in the gratification afforded to one or other of these appetites namely the selfregarding the social or the dissocial to the selfregarding belong as has been shown sensuality from gratification afforded to the social affection not evil but good would be the result but unfortunately this result in whatsoever degree beneficial is of all of these the least natural there remains only the dissocial class of affections in human beings in general and in human beings during the age of childhood in particular what is called mischief springs commonly either from curiosity or love of sport and in particular that sort of sport that pleasure of the imagination of which in virtue of its novelty whatever appears new and affords in any shape how indeterminate soever the prospect of pleasure is the natural source from this source it is that mischief in the case of children is most apt to spring the other source is the dissocial affection ill will or malevolence where love of sport is the source of action the suffering which happens to be produced is rather an accidental effect than a result aimed at if it be among the results aimed at the source of the action is not so much love of sport as malevolence what renders the love of sport dangerous when not tempered or directed by that prudence or benevolence which is necessary to restrain it from seeking its gratification in actions productive of suffering is that the love of sport exists at all times and waits not for accident to call it forth whereas malevolence scarcely ever has place unless excited by some particular incident having the effect of a provocation a disposition to seek in the destruction of a house by fire a gratification for revenge is highly dangerous but a disposition to seek in that same source a gratification for the mere love of sport unmixed with any portion of revenge or anger is still more dangerous from the former no person has any thing to fear excepting the comparatively small number of persons who have happened by means of some special cause of displeasure to have excited in the mind of the individual in question the appetite of ill will whereas from the incendiary who has been rendered such by the mere love of sport every person has equally cause for fear who has property that stands equally exposed to destruction from fire if in any respect a disposition to sportive mischief is less formidable than a disposition to malicious mischief it is because in the first place in the love of sport the passion is not near as strong as in the other case and secondly because it is equally capable of finding gratification in results that are unattended with mischief while the strength of malevolence is boundless and nothing but the production of suffering can afford it gratification thus it is that weeds of all sorts even the most poisonous are the natural produce of the vacant mind for the exclusion of these weeds no species of husbandry is so effectual as the filling the soil with flowers such as the particular nature of the soil is best adapted to produce what those flowers are can only be known from experiment and the greater the variety that can be introduced the greater the chance that the experiment will be attended with success advantage fifth security for admission into and agreeable intercourse with good company i e company in or from which present and harmless pleasure or future profit or security or both may be obtained    ii advantages derivable from learning in this or that particular shape and more especially from the proposed course of intellectual instruction it may be of use to bring together under one view the advantageous results of which the proposed scheme of instruction seems to afford a promise after that an examination will be made of such objections as seem most likely to be opposed to it answers will be subjoined which will show that these objections are either inapplicable or inconclusive and in addition some circumstances will be stated serving to fortify the confidence with which the managers look forward to the accomplishment of the proposed objects as well in regard to the efficiency of instruction as to the rate of progress advantage first multitude and extent of the branches of useful skill and knowledge the possession of which is promised by this system and at an early age   as to the multitude of the branches of useful instruction promised by this system and the extent which they cover in the field of knowledge these are points not exposed to doubt of this extent the conception formed will be more and more correct and complete the more closely the subject is examined whether with reference to the field of knowledge considered by itself or with reference to whatsoever has hitherto been either executed or attempted at the most approved establishments even in those in which the time allotted to instruction has no assigned limits it will not be easy to find an example in which the quantity of useful knowledge here proposed to be administered has been equalled still less when consideration is had of the age namely fourteen years and no more at which this mass of instruction is proposed to have been administered and expected to have been administered with good fruit in relation to these points whatsoever opposition the system may be destined to experience will assuredly be built on very different grounds the promise it will be said is too great to be accomplished or supposing it accomplished more evil will be produced in other shapes than good in the shape of knowledge under the head of objections obviated an answer will be given to both these surmises advantage second increased chance of lighting upon pursuits and employments most suitable to the powers and inclinations of the youthful mind in every individual case   ah what talents ah what capabilities had but the opportunities and assistances necessary to the development of them and turning them to account fallen in his way under the existing system lamentations to this effect are perhaps not much less reasonable and well grounded than they are frequent to obviate this cause of regret nothing is more manifest than that this system will be contributory by the whole amount of the difference in point of variety and extent of instruction which the lot of the pupil will exhibit compared with what would have been his lot had his qualities been improved by no better culture than such as an ordinary school conducted under the existing system can afford or what is but too common been suffered to remain in a state of utter neglect up to the age of about fourteen—the age at which apprenticeship usually commences and at which the course of instruction here proposed will have been gone through advantage third general strength of mind derivable from that multitude and extent of the branches of knowledge included in this course of instruction   if the objects presented in this course of instruction to the youthful mind had no connexion with each other no such beneficial result as that which is here announced could be expected but amongst those objects natural principles of order have place and to apply those principles to the best advantage will be the constant aim of the whole system from the beginning to the end every part having a natural connexion with every other and every favourable occasion being embraced for bringing that connexion into view every object will by virtue of the principle of association as often as it is presented contribute more or less to fix every other in the memory and thus to render the conception entertained of it so much the clearer at the first stage sensation and memory being the only faculties called directly into exercise the conception may be expected to be proportionally faint and indistinct but at each succeeding stage not only will sensation and memory be applied to the subject matter but the judgment will be applied to the observation of the points of agreement and diversity in the first stage the object will be exhibited in an isolated and quiescent state at the succeeding stages the same objects will be exhibited as parts of a moving scene acting one upon another advantage fourth communication of mental strength considered in its application to the business chosen by each pupil whatever that business may be   strengthened to so many comparatively arduous purposes the mind of the pupil cannot be otherwise than strengthened to the purpose of the comparatively easy occupation be it what it may to which it is to apply itself with a view to obtain a livelihood between two minds equal by nature the strength at each period of their growth will be in proportion to the variety and extent of the ideas with which they have been impressed and in this circumstance may be seen the only cause of whatsoever difference there is between the mind of a well educated youth under the existing systems of education and the mind of the esquimaux or the new zealand savage at the same age    from the immaturity and weakness exhibited by the minds of most children under the present mode of culture it would be wholly unjust to infer that the imperfections would be similar under a system of culture raised to that degree of improvement of which the human mind is capable at present the term of childhood is protracted and the growth of the mind is retarded to an inordinate degree by the state of inanimation in which it is kept to the body exercise of some sort however childish is necessary not merely with a view to present comfort and that sort of general felicity which is termed good spirits but with a view to future health and vigour on the contrary to the mind even from the earliest period at which ideas begin to be received from surrounding objects it is neither necessary nor useful in any way that either the conversation or the objects which that conversation takes for its subjects should be of the cast commonly called childish because under the present system children can have access to nothing better when due attention is paid to adapting to the state of the youthful mind the objects which for the sake of instruction are presented to it the difference between play and study is but nominal every task may be converted into play if the taskmaster be but properly acquainted with his business that the minds of children down to so late a period continue in the sort of childish state which at present is so general is but the natural and necessary consequence of the sort of occupation or no occupation which they are left to find out for themselves or to which they are put and of the conversation with which they are surrounded occupation put into their hands with no higher view than that of keeping them for the moment from being mischievous or troublesome conversation composed of the prattling of ignorant persons of both sexes in the condition of servants in the existing state of things this utter absence of improving intercourse coupled frequently with the abundance of corruptive intercourse this hapless condition though in every instance a misfortune is scarcely in any instance a fault the time of both parents is engrossed by the necessary business of the family added to that of the shop the countinghouse or the profession the children meantime are left almost entirely to themselves and to one another under the casual inspection of a female servant by the proposed plan of instruction the young mind will for the greater part of the day be rescued out of such hands children in whose minds and thence in whose conversation from the earliest dawn of reason nothing of what is commonly understood as childish has had place and on whose countenances all the time scarcely a cloud has been visible children not less replete with vigour and felicity than with useful knowledge have fallen under the observation of several of the proposed managers advantage fifth giving to the youthful mind habits of order applicable to the most familiar as well as to the highest purposes good order the great source of internal tranquillity and instrument of good management see stage v   in as far as the names of species the names of the genera in which they are comprised and of the orders and classes or by whatsoever sets of names rising one above another in the scale of comprehensiveness the several groups of objects have been designated are brought under review in conjunction with natural history a lesson in one of the most useful branches of logic viz the art of classification will have been administered—administered insensibly and without parade but not the less effectually—and this without any additional time or trouble on the part of either teacher or learner in this way and by this means a foundation will be laid and even at this early age the mind insensibly prepared for the reception of a science destined for a superior stage as being of the number of those for the attainment of which the exercise of a faculty of a higher order the judgment is necessary viz chemistry—a science in which more use is made of arrangement and in which more importance is attached to that operation than in any other when once formed the habit of and the disposition to order to whatsoever subjects it may have been first applied is so easily and readily transferred to any and to every other that it ought not to be matter of surprise should the assertion be advanced that by the habit thus implanted at the very opening of life a man will find himself so much the better during the whole course down to the very close of it and that by what is thus gained at the dayschool the state of the house and family whatever it may come to be and the state of the shop the countinghouse and the profession whatever they may come to be will to a greater or less degree be sure of being rendered better than they would otherwise have been advantage sixth possession of sources of comfort in various shapes and security against discomfort in various shapes see in particular stages iii and iv table i   advantage seventh security of life as well as health—that blessing without which no such thing as comfort can have place see stage iv table i   advantage eighth security afforded against groundless terrors mischievous impostures and selfdelusions   numberless are the mischievous delusions to which a man is exposed by ignorance against which knowledge presents the only preservative of these delusions some operate to the prejudice    of the person himself others to the prejudice of persons in general to an extent to which there are no limits but those by which this power of doing mischief is circumscribed examples—delusion   hopes of profit in a mechanical establishment from discovery of a practically applicable perpetual motion preservative—acquaintance with the principles of mechanics see stage ii—delusion   hopes of profit from discovery of what has been called the philosophers stone and thereby that of the art of converting less rare and costly metals into gold preservative—acquaintance with the mineralogical branch of chemistry see stage ii—delusion   hopes of extravagant profit from manures the composition of which is kept secret preservative—acquaintance with the theory of vegetation see stage iii—delusion   hopes of profit to health by the use of medicaments or modes of medical treatment to which no such virtue as is believed or pretended to be believed is attached as in the case of animal magnetism tractorism c c and of medicaments in vast variety prepared without sufficient acquaintance with or attention to the branches of art and science subservient to hygiantics preservative—acquaintance with those several branches of art and science see stage iv—delusion   hopes and fears derived from a supposed connexion between the distant celestial bodies on the one part and the well or ill being of particular individuals among mankind on the other part preservative—acquaintance with uranology more frequently termed astronomy see stage v—  fears derived from the opinion of the existence—and occasional operation or appearance—of ghosts vampires visible devils witches and unembodied beings of various sorts actuated by the desire and endued with the power of doing mischief to mankind preservative—on the one hand acquaintance with natural philosophy in general see stages ii iii iv v i e with the means by which and the manner in which effects beneficial and pernicious to mankind are really produced on the other hand in the nature of humantestimony in the imperfections of which delusive notions sometimes find their channel and sometimes have had their source in that propensity to be deceived which is in the inverse ratio of the progress of true knowledge and in that propensity to deceive others which is in the inverse ratio of the progress of true morality of these propensities it is by history and biography that the exemplifications and thence the proofs are furnished in so far as it is from natural philosophy that the preservative is derived it belongs beyond doubt to the chrestomathic course in so far as it is from the principles of evidence and thence from history and biography the investigation and application of the remedy will probably according to general opinion be regarded as belonging to a maturer and selfinstructing time of life for on this head the correctness of whatsoever notions may come to be entertained will depend—not as in the case of natural philosophy in a principal measure on the senses and the memory but in a much greater degree upon the judgment or judicial faculty and that too acting in each instance under the necessity of including in the grounds of its decisions collections of particulars ample in extent multitude and variety taken conjunctly into consideration after having been brought all together into comparison for the purpose in knowledge in general and in knowledge belonging to the physical department in particular will the vast mass of mischief of which perverted religion is the source find its preventive remedy it is from physical science alone that a man is capable of deriving that mental strength and that wellgrounded confidence which renders him proof against so many groundless terrors flowing from that prolific source which by enabling him to see how prone to error the mind is on this ground and thence how free such error is from all moral blame disposes him to that forbearance towards supposed error which men are so ready to preach and so reluctant to practise advantage ninth securing an unexampled choice of wellinformed companions through life  0 among unfurnished minds from the excitements it affords to sensuality idleness and mischievousness company in proportion to its abundance is the great source of danger hence in the like proportion will be the great source of security the greater the multitude and variety of the sources of entertainment opened to his view the greater is a persons chance of finding those which are suited to his taste the greater the multitude of associates occupied along with him in seeking entertainment from each source the stronger his assurance of meeting with that social cooperation from which labour receives so much relief and pleasure so much increase at the end of a term of six or seven years passed in company with so many hundred fellowlabourers and coadjutors in occupations for which this scheme of instruction alone provides nothing but that persevering course of bad behaviour against which it affords a matchless security can ever leave him at a loss for company the agreeableness of which has been so amply provided for by the magnitude of the number open to his choice advantage tenth affording to parents a more than ordinary relief from the labour anxiety and expense of time necessary to personal inspection    to the class of persons whose callings present an urgent demand for every moment of their time during the hours of business a temporary neglect of their children if kept at home is a misfortune in a great degree    unavoidable in this state of things an expedient not unfrequently resorted to is that of sending the children to some dayschool however incompetent to the purpose of instruction more for the assurance of keeping them under inspection and thence out of harm than for the hope of enabling them to make any considerable acquisition of useful knowledge to all persons thus circumstanced the particular value of an institution in which so much positive good is superadded to this sort of negative accommodation is too obvious to need any further mention advantage eleventh unexampled cheapness of the instruction in proportion to its value    that in proportion to the quantity and value of the instruction thus proposed to be administered the cheapness is altogether without example is a position the truth of which will not admit of a moments doubt the price say £  per year for seven years in all £   for instruction in the list of branches proposed to be administered the cheapness of the price depends upon and is proportionate to the quantity and variety of instruction administered in the given length of time in this if there be any thing to the proof of which words can be necessary or so much as conducive it is not to the fact or the degree of cheapness supposing the service rendered but to the possibility of its being rendered and rendered in so short a space of time of the assumed possibility and probability the expected causes are therefore the only objects which on this occasion can require to be brought to view these causes may be summed up under the following heads   the use made of the lancasterian method   the largeness of the scale   the care taken to adapt the species of instruction to the state of the pupils faculties in respect of maturity   as to the lancasterian method the efficiency of it is already matter of experience experience so well established that it was the very certainty and invariableness of success to the extent to which it has hitherto been applied that suggested the extended application of it here proposed   as to the proposed magnitude of the scale this advantage though in its nature distinct from the peculiar method of teaching in question is however among the fruits of it that method may be used upon the smallest scale with the advantage peculiar to it but it is only by the combination of expedients included in this method that so unexampled a magnitude could be given to the scale that instruction could be administered to so prodigious a multitude of scholars by the same person at the same time it is by means of the peculiar method of teaching that the number of scholars capable of receiving instruction from the same person at the same time is made to receive such great increase it is from the magnitude of the number of the persons receiving instruction under the same system of superintendence that the sum required of each is capable of being to such a degree reduced being taught at one and the same time by one and the same person at one and the same place various sources of expense which on the existing plans are necessarily multiplied are by this plan reduced to one—one building one general superintendent constantly on the spot one apparatus for warming the same for lighting one set of implements employed as instruments of instruction moreover many helps to instruction are easy to be procured many helps unattainable otherwise than by that ample contribution the burthen of which is rendered light by the multitude of contributors advantage twelfth least generally useful branches last administered and thence in case of necessity omissible with least loss    of this arrangement the great practical use is that when either the quantity of money or of time to be spared for the purpose of instruction is limited instruction to the greatest amount in regard to value may be administered and received for a given quantity of money and of time or what amounts to the same thing instruction of the greatest value is given at the least expense of money and time the coincidence which it is supposed will be seen to have place and which if it does will be acknowledged to be a fortunate one is that for the most part those branches which are the most useful will be found the easiest and the pleasantest thus—   in the last stage of all comes mathematical science by itself of this branch considered apart and contradistinguished from mechanics the usefulness will be found less extensive in respect to the number of persons to whom it can be of any use and to the common purposes of life than any other of the branches of instruction comprehended in this course it is accordingly referred to the last stage and hence those parents in whose estimation the value of the instruction thus obtainable will not afford a sufficient compensation for the time and money that can be spared for it may stop at this point of the course   in the last stage but one comes medical science by itself multitude taking place of unity no otherwise than by the division of the one great whole into its component parts in speaking of this branch of knowledge as of less utility than any of those which it is proposed should precede it the opinion thus expressed is rather the opinion regarded as likely to be the prevalent one than an opinion with which the authors of the plan are themselves impressed to the claim it makes to precedence in competition with mathematical science they can give their support with much    less diffidence unless in the case of a person who by profession or in the gratification of a predominant taste is devoted to the mathematics they can affirm without hesitation not only that health and strength themselves are in relation to being and wellbeing of more value than abstract ideas of circles triangles squares or even the highest exemplified or imaginable orders of curves but even that the difference in respect of security that may reasonably be expected for those blessings by means of the proffered instruction in comparison with the degree of security of which a man not designed for the medical profession would otherwise be in possession would with a degree of persuasion proportioned to the intensity of the attention bestowed upon the comparison be found to be possessed of the alleged superiority in point of substantial value this persuasion would still have place even though the portion of time allotted to instruction in this branch of useful knowledge were accelerated and in such sort accelerated that it should be administered antecedently to those portions of natural history and natural philosophy which respectively contribute to form its basis but forasmuch as these introductory branches are included in the present plan were that of medicine stript of these supports taught at an earlier stage some of those other branches themselves so constantly and indispensably useful might to some individuals be lost hence upon the whole it was thought best to postpone this branch of instruction to that stage at which it could be administered to most advantage   in the third stage and not before the abovementioned two come architecture and husbandry of these two branches of instruction the utility is too obvious to be in danger of finding contradiction from any person to the purpose of direct application to practice the utility of them in comparison with that of the branches which immediately precede them is in point of extent as measured by the relative number of persons likely to derive from them any material information limited and narrow here then may be seen a stage at which a portion of the whole number of scholars might in case of pressure either in respect of time or money make a stand   there remain for consideration the two first stages and here it cannot but be confessed and even professed that the advantage stops unless it were for innoxious amusement invigoration and mental enlargement without the second stage of instruction whatsoever is contained in the first would comparatively speaking at least not to say absolutely be of little value it is chiefly for the sake of the second and to serve for introduction to the second and this at a time when the juvenile mind would not be ripe enough for the reception of the second that the first stage is received into the course with regard to what is here said on the subject of eventual premature departure the persuasion entertained by the authors of this plan would be very much misconceived if the supposition were that in their opinion any thing less than irresistible necessity could serve as a sufficient warrant for any such relinquishment by thus quitting the course at the commencement of a posterior stage the loss which the scholar would sustain would be not only the whole of the instruction comprehended in that stage but a portion more or less considerable of the mass of instruction comprehended in the several preceding stages for that nothing which has once been gained be lost one of the fundamental maxims of this institution is that whatsoever thread of instruction has once been begun upon should be carried on to the very end in a great measure this the chain whereby in the proposed course the several branches of instruction are linked together will suffice for the purpose of this unremitting continuance and when this natural means fails care is intended to be taken for supplying the deficiency by repetitions and reexhibitions made for this express purpose advantage thirteenth need and practice of corporeal punishment superseded thence masters preserved from the guilt and reproach of cruelty and injustice    in regard to this advantage the assurance of success stands on firmer ground than in the instance of any of the preceding advantages—that of direct experience as exhibited in the improved system of education under both its modifications viz in the one pursued by the rev dr bell and in that pursued by mr lancaster it belongs not therefore to the additional story here proposed to be erected on that fabric in contradistinction to the original building but to the whole structure together in contradistinction to the unimproved methods followed in schools in general in no school conducted upon either of those plans is any use made of corporeally afflictive punishment in any form and in particular in that of flogging in the lancasterian mode it cannot be said that on the occasion of punishment the person remains in every instance altogether unafflicted but in whatsoever shape punishment is applied to any part of the body no bodily pain is produced of the suffering such as it is the seat is not in the body but in the mind under the lancasterian mode the severest punishment ever known to be inflicted is if it can with any propriety be termed a corporeal punishment at any rate of this mild and innoxious nature and in dr bells nothing it should seem that can in any way be termed corporeal punishment has ever been in use on this occasion a singular contrast presents itself to view during their nonage the children of the very lowest ranks in society are in a way to be liberated and in no inconsiderable    number have actually been liberated from a species of affliction and debasement to which the very highest remain subjected under the present plan the exemption will at any rate be extended to the middle ranks and the highest may have the benefit of it if they please it is a question not unworthy the consideration of mothers even in the highest rank whether they will have their sons taught a smattering of latin and greek by tasks and flogging at eton winchester and the royal school at westminster or in the way of pastime without flogging at the chrestomathic school within view of the august royal one in this aspect may be seen another advantage which though to the proposed plan it belongs no otherwise than in its character of an extension given to the bell and lancaster plan belongs to it not the less unquestionably and that in contradistinction to the mode of instruction still pursued in the great and old established schools under the system of flogging coupled with the system of tasking the flogging applied to the enforcement of the taskwork among the multitude of offences of which that system is constantly prolific an incident which can never fail to happen now and then under the most careful and irreproachable master and is sure to happen every now and then under an ordinary master is an act of punishment which being by hastiness or wrong inference from the evidence really undue is seen by the scholars to be so as often as such an incident takes place the imputation of injustice attaches itself to the character of the master under whose order the punishment has been inflicted and with a degree of strength proportionate to the severity of the infliction the imputation of cruelty attaches itself to that of injustice advantage fourteenth affording to the first race of scholars a mark of particular distinction and recommendation    what is common to all affords no distinction to any and accordingly the more extensive the progress of this system of education the less will be the advantage it is capable of affording in this particular shape at the outset however and on the supposition that in other respects the prospects held out by it are found to be realized this advantage cannot but be a very substantial one every case in which between a scholar of the chrestomathic school and a scholar of any ordinary school not to mention a boy who has not been to any school a competition on any grounds has taken place the advantage which will be possessed by the superiorlyinstructed boy is such the estimation of which may be safely left to any one whose eyes have glanced over the preceding pages this advantage inseparably attached to the very nature of the case may be considered as a premium which in cases even of the most moderate degree of success the first comer will be sure to reap advantage fifteenth enlargement given to each scholars field of occupation    the more things he is more or less acquainted with the more things he is fit for and the better chance he has acquired of meeting with some occupation pecuniaryprofityielding or not according to his condition which shall be at once within his power and suited to his taste    answer the experiment being yet to make no answer can be deduced from experience that is from direct and identical experience from analogy must be sought the only ground of assurance of which the nature of the case admits   the first ground of assurance is this viz that the difficulties attendant on the reception of the mass of instruction in question are not so great as it is natural that to a hasty glance they should appear to be one circumstance by which the difficulty will be apt to be painted in exaggerated colours is the abstruseness of the names by which in a number of instances the branches of art and science are designated this objection having its root in prejudice will be considered in the section allotted to the examination of opposing prejudices   another ground of assurance is constituted by the experienced strength of the newly devised instrument which will be employed viz the instrument composed of the helps to instruction the assemblage of which constitutes the lancasterian method by this method instruction has now for several years and with incontestable success been administered in a like simultaneous manner to a number of scholars as great as the number here proposed indeed greater forasmuch as under the former plan it being intended that of the whole number a division should be made for some purposes it will seldom happen that the instruction should be administered to the whole number at once to the branches of art and science here in question the instrument in question was not applied on the occasion of the successful experiment not to any of them but to a species of instruction which in respect of real difficulty of reception prejudice from novelty and unfamiliar names apart will be found to exceed by far the species of instruction here administered at the earliest stage by which the youthful mind will be so effectually prepared for the reception of ulterior instruction at the several ulterior stages    notwithstanding the earliness of the age at which this instruction is proposed to be concluded it may be affirmed with confidence that of all the branches of instruction here proposed to be administered there is not one the reception of which will at the age at which it is proposed to be administered be attended with a degree of difficulty as great as that which attends the reception of the art of reading and writing at the age at which they are commonly taught according to the established practice of all the branches of instruction with the exception perhaps of mathematics which under the proposed system is put off to the last stage that which is composed of the rules of grammar especially as applied to a dead language will be generally acknowledged to be the most crabbed and repulsive and in that respect opposed by the heaviest load of difficulty fortunately the applicability of this system with the most complete success to the most difficult purpose is already put out of doubt by experience this is proved indisputably by the testimony of a witness whose evidence on this subject it is presumed every one will admit to be decisive see letter of mr james gray master of the high school of edinburgh appendix no iii objection second disregard shown to classical learning and other polite accomplishments    under the present system no sooner are the first difficulties surmounted that stand in the way of the art of reading the art of writing a legible hand and the art of vulgar arithmetic as comprised in a few of the first rules than the scholar is more or less instructed in the rudiments of the latin tongue to this accomplishment a preference is thus given as compared with all ulterior accomplishments under the proposed system of instruction ornamental and respectable as it is and necessary as it is to raise the scholar above the imputation of vulgar ignorance it is in a manner put aside and placed in the background answer the disregard if any is only comparative not positive considerable will be the disappointment of the contrivers of this plan if at the end of the proposed six or seven years course of instruction conducted upon the principles here explained the proficiency of the scholar in latin and greek or at least in one of these languages will not be found to outstrip instead of falling short of the ordinary rate in as far as this expectation seems to be verified by experience this objection falls to the ground but even supposing that instead of being but comparative which is as much as to say not real and effective it were absolute the objection would not they confess appear in their eyes a substantial one by the middle rank of life for the use of which the proposed system of instruction is designed useful and not merely ornamental instruction is required except in as far as ornamental is considered as a species of useful or a wellgrounded acquaintance with his own language is regarded as useful to one in a situation above that of a man whose subsistence does not depend on severe toil or manual labour no degree of acquaintance with any of the dead languages can surely be placed to the account of use—it cannot unless in the case where it has been but the ladder by which the scholar has been conducted to a much higher degree of proficiency have contributed in any considerable degree to the furnishing him with the means of securing a more comfortable subsistence or have furnished him with the means of innoxious and inexpensive entertainment during his vacant hours whereas the proposed system promises in an inexhaustible variety of ways to be subservient to both those incontestably useful purposes for the purpose of any one of the learned professions law physic or divinity no doubt but that an acquaintance with the dead languages meaning the two classical ones of latin and greek may well be considered a matter even of necessity much more of simple use but for any youth destined to the exercise of any one of those elevated professions this system of education is not designed and in the instance of any person so destined should the parents condescend to give acceptance to the sort of instruction here proffered what remains of the quantity of time at present allotted to a course of preparation for these professions will afford ample room for additional instruction in those relatively necessary shapes though with a view to the bar or the pulpit not to speak of the bed of sickness the possession of a considerable acquaintance with the dead languages may in a general view be considered as necessary this necessity especially if comparison be had with the system of instruction here proposed will hardly be regarded as having place with relation to a yet more exalted theatre the house of commons take two men one of them capable of rendering into english without premeditation not perhaps that any such person ever had existence any sentence whatsoever in every one of the greek and latin classics extant but unacquainted with any of the branches of art and science beyond common arithmetic included in this system—the other acquainted with every one of them in the degree in which an average scholar may be generally expected to be acquainted with them but unable to render into english any such sentence which of these two men on the occasion of the ordinary details of parliamentary business will be likely to find himself most at home without much danger of contradiction the answer may surely be he who has passed through the proposed course of practically useful instruction the classical scholar may be better qualified for decorating his speech with rhetorical    flowers but the chrestomathic scholar after a familiar and thorough acquaintance has been contracted with things with things of all sorts will be in a much more useful and efficient way qualified for the general course of parliamentary business as to the classical authors greek and roman to any such purpose as the present the question is not what they knew but what by the study of them is at this time of day to be learnt from them more than is to be learnt without reading them such is the question and the answer is—not anything among the branches of art and science included in the present system of instruction many there are of which they had not so much as a suspicion of their existence with no one of them had they any degree of acquaintance approaching to that which is to be obtained from modern and english authors and if on the part of any of them any superior degree of acquaintance really had place still no need is there of any acquaintance with the originals forasmuch as there is not one of them of which a translation into english is not to be found not even for the purpose of history were that comprised within the present scheme would any acquaintance with these authors in the original be of any substantial use for of the historians at any rate there is not one of which translations into english are not to be found for the purpose of poetry and oratory—yes let it be allowed though the most illustrious of our poets as well as some of our most impressive and efficient speakers are known to have been destitute of all classical learning except through the medium of translation and that before any translations that are now read had come into existence objection third superficiality and confusedness of the conceptions thus obtainable    a smattering of many things—a thorough or useful acquaintance with nothing such will some regard as the species and degree of instruction afforded on whom an unfavourable impression may have been made by the very variety of the instruction here proposed to be communicated answer that in the case of no individual the result may prove to be of this undesirable kind is too much to be asserted but to any practical purpose to any such purpose as that of determining the choice of parents as between the proposed system of instruction and such others as would be within their reach the question is not whether instances may not occur in which the result would be thus unfavourable but whether under the proposed institution the inconvenience in question seems likely to be greater in degree and of more frequent occurrence than in such institution as would otherwise be the object of their choice in relation to this head what is manifest is that as antecedently to actual experience even on the supposition of subsequent success nothing of the nature of demonstration can be delivered so neither antecedently to experience ought anything of that nature to be demanded that under the customary system of instruction such should not unfrequently be the effect is no more than may be reasonably expected why   because in preference if not to the exclusion of things the subjects of instruction are words mere words   because in as far as things are among the subjects of instruction many are talked of few if any are exhibited and brought under the cognizance of sense   because no use is made of those leading principles of order of which under the system here proposed so much advantage is taken the calling first into exercise the faculties which are the first to ripen the proceeding from the most simple subjects to the more complex—that is to the more and more complex in which the more simple are respectively included and thence the frequent reexhibition of the same subjects while the points of view in which they are thus represented on the different occasions are changed the bringing so many and most of them such widely extending masses of instruction within so comparatively small a compass in point of time will be apt to be productive of a sort of doubt and jealousy which is too natural and too plausible and in a certain point of view too well grounded to be suffered to pass altogether without notice such a variety and multitude of things crowded together—and to attempt to force all these things at once into the minds of such young children one thing must drive out another instead of their being all of them learnt at least to any useful purpose and what at length may stick will be no better than a confused hodgepotch composed of odds and ends the smaller a mans acquaintance is with the several subjects of instruction comprehended in the proposed plan the more formidable will the sumtotal of them be apt to appear and thence the stronger the impression which any obstacle of this tendency will be apt to make on his mind and the misfortune is that the number of persons whose state of mind will thus render them unfavourable to the plan is likely to be very great—much greater than could be wished in proportion however as attention is given to experience to established and incontrovertible matters of fact this prejudice must diminish of the branches of instruction which present the most formidable aspect viz of the branches of natural history and natural philosophy with their respective hard names there is not one to which a space of time will not be allotted several times greater than the greatest that has been respectively allotted to the same branch of instruction in the most particular courses    that are as yet known to have been anywhere delivered in this instance the age of the learner will indeed be less mature than in any of those instances but for the operation of this cause of inferiority the allowance made will be ample nor ought it ever to be forgotten however apt it may be to be forgotten that the branches of knowledge which by reason of the unfamiliarity of their names present this formidable aspect are in almost every instance less difficult to learn than those dry and speculative grammatical rules with their applications and the tasks belonging to them and the obligation that arises out of them of penning discourses in prose and verse in a dead language those tasks which because it has been the custom so to do are without a thought about the difficulty universally under the established system put into the hands of children at ages less mature than the earliest of those at which under this new system it is proposed to apply to their youthful minds instruction in various forms selected on account of their simplicity and of the promise they afford of converting the sort of employment which hitherto has been the source of immediate and almost universal pain into a source of immediate and absolutely universal pleasure not less erroneous than disheartening would the inference be if from the observation of the smallness of the progress hitherto made in the old established branches of instruction according to the old established methods in the old established schools any such inference were deduced as that the nature of the case admitted not of any considerably more correct and complete body of instruction or any considerably greater rate of progress to the degree of inefficiency and slowness which by original weakness the result of the immaturity and barbarism of the age—by original weakness followed by habitual and daybyday more firmly rooted prejudice—is capable of being established there are absolutely no limits at christs hospital for example to two or three years consumed in learning the rudiments of latin grammar succeed two or three years which are employed in forgetting those rudiments while in addition to the art of writing the rudiments of arithmetic are endeavoured to be learnt after the course thus completed of learning and forgetting if a select few are applied to drawing or reapplied to grammar and to latin and greek taught by means of it it were strange indeed if in such a multitude a small number were not actually found who wrote well another small number who drew well and another who with or without the benefit of being sent to the university to enjoy the provision attached to the school foundation acquire in a greater or less degree that sort of acquaintance with the greek and latin classics which denominates a man a good scholar but from the examples of inefficiency and tardiness were they even more egregious and numerous than they are the inference would be not less unreasonable than discouraging if it were concluded that efficiency and despatch are impossible it would be as if from the abundance of snails and sloths it were concluded that no such animal as a racehorse could have existence among the great variety of subjects of instruction comprised in the proposed system doubtless the lancaster exercise and the mode of employing the pupils as teachers are not applied to every one with equal advantage but the conductors of the proposed system are aware of these difficulties and alive to every practical expedient for removing whatsoever disadvantages as well as for making the most of whatsoever advantages the nature of each particular case may be found to afford nor on this occasion should the advantage afforded by the proportioning earliness to facility by teaching those things first which in their own nature are the easiest to learn be ever out of sight on the plan begun under an entirely different state of society and continued by custom the course of study being predetermined and without regard to the state of the mental faculties forced or endeavoured to be forced into the mind by terror and compulsion at its tenderest age on this plan measure is taken of the state of the faculties at the several different ages and in each instance the species of instruction is fitted to it objection fourth uppishness a probable result of the distinctions thus obtained  0 against an accusation in itself so unsubstantial it is no easy matter to make a substantial defence the first thing to be done is to ascertain the meaning of the charge and there is the difficulty let us hazard a conjecture it is from the superior classes alone that such a charge can come coming from such a quarter can anything but this be the meaning of it—the superiority which in so many respects we possess over those whom we behold below us will be insufficient and even the continuance of it will be precarious if in respect of useful knowledge in the several shapes in question those who are now our inferiors should become our equals—much more should they become our superiors for continuing to receive at their hands that respect and obsequiousness which we possess at present the wealth of such of us as have wealth the power of such of us as have power the dignity of such of us as have dignity will no longer be sufficient on the subject of any such result should it really be apprehended and regarded in the character of a grievance two observations present themselves   supposing the apprehended result realized the mischief of it does not seem very serious or explicit of the substantial causes of superiority viz opulence power and dignity it does not well appear how their existence is  0 threatened by it of one cause or supposed cause viz the superiority in respect of useful knowledge the amount will indeed be lessened but by this security will not in any shape be shaken or diminished and if this be true security remaining undisturbed the gainers being so many more than the losers while the loss is but comparative and not positive how any balance should exist on the side of mischief seems not easy to determine nor at the expense of the higher classes will any such diminution of superiority in the single point in question—any such diminution of superiority in respect of useful knowledge—have place any further than it is their own pleasure that it should have place to add to whatsoever proficiency their now inferiors possess in respect of useful instruction a superiority in all those branches of ornamental instruction of which the exclusive possession will continue their own will always depend upon themselves to the supposed inferiors no branches of useful instruction will be laid open which will not be equally open to the supposed superiors if under the impulse of emulation or any other spring of action they are driven to keep pace in improvement with those apprehended rivals so much the better for themselves if by indolence they are kept where they are they have themselves to thank for it but whether in this supposed small and imponderable diminution of effective superiority there would be more of good than of evil seems hardly worth inquiry—the result itself not carrying on the face of it any such complexion as that of probability of the matter of wealth in all its shapes the value will remain unchanged the power which he who has most of it possesses not only over things but over such persons as have less of it will remain just what it is at present the need which he who has less of it finds of securing all his share of it will continue undiminished the quantity of food which a man requires for his stomach the quantity of clothes he needs for his back will not be lessened by any quantity of useful knowledge with which he may have furnished his head the mutual propensity which the good things of this world in their several shapes of wealth power and dignity have to attract each other united in the same recipient will not receive any sensible disturbance from the action of an agent comparatively so weak the shopkeeper will not have then less need than at present to sell his wares the artisan and the husbandman to obtain employment the scourer to wash her room the fisherman to catch his fish from any such increase in the quantity of useful knowledge possessed by the middle classes the only manifestly natural and probable results are improvement in respect of health domestic economy and personal comfort a more extensive disposition than at present to look for amusement and recreation in art science or literature in preference to sensuality and indolence in all these ways will the condition of the middle classes be made better and it appears not how in any of them the condition of their superiors should be made worse look to experience as far as any evidence is to be derived from that source the evidence afforded is not in favour of the result here apprehended taking england for the place in question two other countries present themselves as subjects of comparison viz scotland and germany in scotland the first rudiments of useful knowledge viz reading writing and the arithmetic of accounts are universal in england comparatively speaking they are still but rare inferiors are they in general less respectful in scotland than in england no but if there be any difference rather more so this it may be observed is not precisely the species of instruction here in question well then let us turn to germany viz particularly if not exclusively the protestant part of it there in much greater amount than in england is the higher species of instruction here in question abundant numerous indeed in those countries in comparison of england are the men of cultivated minds the men of letters and science such as they are and there in conjunction with literature poverty and its scarcely separable companion sensuality are nowhere to be found from the extension thus given to mental culture what man among them howsoever clothed with opulence and power and dignity has ever found or fancied matter of complaint what pride however pampered by all or any of these elements has ever from any such quarter felt a wound but notwithstanding all which has now been said of so superior a school of learning the effect it may still be urged will be to fill the pupils with selfsufficiency vanity and pride and to cause them to look down with disdain upon those employments to which they would otherwise have applied themselves without reluctance—employments upon which their chance for subsistence will depend thus whether the plan fail or succeed objections as is always the case with new undertakings lie in store for it as to selfsufficiency vanity and pride to which many other words of a similar stamp might be added they are a set of sentimental words the effect of which is to set afloat in the mind so many vague and indeterminate generalities ideas which to the eye of every one who takes the trouble of endeavouring to find for them a determinate shape vanish and leave nothing behind them but the shapes of the letters and the sounds that we associated with them on the part of the individuals in question selfsufficiency vanity and pride all these weaknesses supposing them to have    place will find in the minds of those with whom they have to do—with whom circumstances lead them to hold intercourse—principles of resistance in the shape of self regarding affection and defensive pride in which each transgression against the laws of social intercourse will find an eventual punishment and in the apprehension of it a check as to disdain for the means of livelihood on which they will be dependent for subsistence the objection wears a face somewhat more determinate but which on examination will be found not less hollow whatever sentiment of disdain any such individual may feel neither the need he has nor the need he feels can by it receive any diminution if of these acquisitions the effect be to open to him and to place him in a situation better in respect of subsistence than any into which he would otherwise have found his way so far it is advantageous to him—clearly and determinately advantageous if the effect be to leave him exactly in the same rank in which he would have found himself otherwise he is thus far though no gainer no loser but of all the conditions of life in which it is possible for him to find himself there is not one in which in various ways he will not be the better comparatively at least if not absolutely for the course of instruction and discipline he will have gone through in his career through the proposed course of instruction as has been fully shown already he will have opened to himself sources in abundance of amusement reputable as well as innoxious if in any degree the instruction thus gamed will operate as a cause of repulsion between himself and those who have not been partakers of it it will operate as a cause of attraction between himself and those who so early with him have been partakers of it and compared with the principle of repulsion the principle of attraction operating in a more concentrated state will operate with greater force in the case of the great established schools the agreeable and useful effect of early associations thus contracted is universally notorious in the instance of the proposed new sort of school the more extraordinary new and distinguished the nature of it the stronger the principle of association together with the comforts and advantages derived from it will be and the individuals sharing in these benefits will be still more numerous than in any of those other instances as the system operates the relative and comparative distinctions advantageous upon the whole or disadvantageous upon the whole whichsoever they may be will wear away but the absolute one strength given to the intellectual faculties and the whole character will remain for ever as to the relative and comparative distinction in as far as it is of an advantageous nature the advantage it presents will be greatest and most conspicuous in the case of those whose parents and guardians are the first to put them in possession of it and thus in this lottery if it be to be accounted a lottery the highest prizes will be for the first adventurers    of the branches of instruction comprehended in this plan some of them may be observed to have been included in the system of instruction administered in the dignified institution distinguished by the appellation of royal chemistry and physiology a branch subservient to medicine may serve as examples in these branches from that elevated seat instruction was administered not only to the maturest but to some even of the most richly furnished as well as dignified and exalted minds but from their acknowledged aptitude with reference to these superior and extraordinary minds it would be an inference equally groundless and pernicious that they are unfit or in any degree the less fit for ordinary minds for minds of all sorts in the middle class or even in some degree the inferior classes which this plan has in view one thing it will not be easy to controvert that whatsoever degree of usefulness may belong to that institution an indefinitely greater degree of usefulness must belong to the one here proposed there it was all amusement and decoration here to amusement will be added solid and substantial use there it was confined to adults here it will be imparted and indeed confined to children who by it will be raised to the level of men there it was and is confined to a few—even of the ruling and influential few here it will be communicated to a large and it is hoped to a continually increasing portion of the subject many—of those whose title to regard is founded on the most substantial and incontestable of all foundations that of numbers—and in whose instance the beneficial effect of useful instruction will be seen to rise in proportion to their present need of it in adverting to that dignified institution nothing can be further from the minds of the persons thus speaking than the design to lessen the respect so justly due to its originators and supporters their sincere wish is for its increase and in some degree this desirable result is already afforded since by the encouragement it has given in the way of fashion as well as by the proof it has furnished in the way of experience it has contributed to the formation of another institution which in whatever other respect and in whatever other degree inferior promises to be so much its superior in point of extent that is in respect of the number of persons to whom the benefit the blessing it may surely be called will be imparted relation of this plan to that of the great schools and universities    on an occasion such as the present it is impossible to be wholly unobservant nor necessary to be altogether silent on the subject of so many schools of royal and otherwise dignified foundation topped by the two or if ireland be considered by the three universities of this land—not to speak of those of scotland which to those by whom ecclesiastical discipline is considered as the strongest bond of union and diversity on that same ground as a proper cause of separation are proportionally regarded on the footing of foreign ones compare on the one hand the copiousness of the branches of instruction uniformly proposed to be administered on the other the smallness of the number customarily administered to one and the same person on the one part the preferable regard on the other the comparative disregard for immediate and extensive use on the one part the shortness on the other the comparative length of the time employed in administering such instruction on the part of the unendowed proposed institution the relative smallness on the part of the antique and richly endowed institution the largeness of the sums expended in the endeavours to produce the intended effects    so numerous and multifarious are the springs of action by which the members of every national community are drawn towards and repelled from each other that scarcely in any instance can a plan of extensive utility be brought forward much less a plan so full of promise as that which is here proposed without appearing to be and indeed without being in its tendency in some way or other adverse to the interests of a considerable number of persons a plan which promises a mass of instruction so much exceeding in quantity and value anything which has ever yet been exemplified and that not only to the superior by which is always meant the more opulent classes but to the middle or less wealthy classes not only to those whose means of living are derived from property already accumulated but to those whose means are derived from industry perpetually employed can scarcely fail to be an object of jealousy and envy to a multitude of persons exceeding that of those to whom it is a source of delight and an object of hope to no person by whom any considerable value is set upon his own intellectual acquirements can a continually increasing influx of young men all of them in possession of acquirements in the same class superior to his own be reasonably expected to be a spectacle of inward satisfaction the greater the superiority thus manifested and consequently the greater his relative inferiority the more intense is the feeling of dissatisfaction that will naturally be produced envy and jealousy being passions by which the persons that harbour them are rendered the objects of aversion and contempt are passions the concealment of which is sought with proportionable solicitude the person in whose breast these passions are concealed will endeavour by all possible means to prevent this plan from taking effect the apprehension the cause of his secret suffering is that by this school a superior degree of instruction will be obtained but it is not by the expression of such an opinion but by the expression of the very opposite opinion that anything can be done by him towards the accomplishment of his purpose the opinion which it will be his endeavour to propagate will therefore be that no such superiority will by means of the plan in question be attained and the stronger the persuasion with which he looks for the success of the plan the greater the pains he will take to render other persons assured of its eventual miscarriage by the disguise with which it will be necessary for him to endeavour to conceal the nature of the motives by which he is actuated and if it were possible the object which he has in view the intensity of his aversion from its being in any degree repressed will be perpetually increased impracticability uselessness mischievousness by the imputation of one or more of these qualities will his attack upon it be conducted by the two first his endeavour will be to bring down upon it the contempt by the other the hatred of the public and the more completely he is convinced that no one of these qualities do in any degree appertain to it the more strenuous will be his endeavour to produce in all other breasts the assurance that those qualities each in the most perfect degree do appertain to it every one who has anything good to propose always finds such men as these in his way the uncovering of what may be termed the nakedness of the human mind is a most unpleasant task but on no occasion can it be said to be an unnecessary one if by covering with a veil of silence all this body of hostility it were in the nature of the case that the fire of it should be extinguished or so much as slackened silence would be no less consistent with prudence than favourable to ease and indolence but by no such means can the passions of jealousy and envy be appeased they admit not of any compromise by being unmasked and that ever so completely they cannot be rendered more savage than they would be were the mask to remain untouched masked they will do their utmost unmasked they can do no more by the exposure thus made it would not therefore be true to say that the chance of success has in any degree been lessened on the contrary since by no means is it in the nature of the case that hostility on this ground should be converted into amity or even into indifference the only course that presented any chance of guarding the proposed institution from its attacks was to lay the plan as well as the cause of hostility to it open to public view    under all this load of discouragement there is one source of encouragement which when duly considered will have it is hoped the effect of taking off almost completely the pressure of it the funds necessary for the commencement of the undertaking are already provided the persons and the only remaining persons whose concurrence is requisite for the commencement are the parents or other guardians of such children whose domestic circumstances and local situation concur in putting it in their power to avail themselves of the proffered service if by them and with reference to their own situation respectively it be regarded as affording a sufficient promise of proving at once practicable and useful and if useful useful in a greater degree than any other place of education within their reach it is not by any insinuation which it is in the power of envy or jealousy to throw out that they will be diverted from that course which on this supposition will to their eyes be a source of delight as well as a matter of duty by no insinuation by no declamations or protestations will any such persons be persuaded that by being so much more fully replenished and furnished with useful knowledge than other children—by being so much more fully supplied with that intellectual aliment of which the tendency to moderate and calm all dissocial and otherwise unruly passion is so powerful and so incontestible there will be any the smallest danger of their being encumbered with any such turbulent and mischievous dispositions the existence of which is thus presupposed to them it will not appear matter of certainty that in a school in which neither irreligion nor heterodoxy nor schism nor whatever be meant by heterodoxy or schism will be taught all or any of those abominations will be learnt in their eyes any such suspicion will not appear better grounded than to those systems of thinking which it professes to protect it is injurious as if the only chance of mens adherence to the most important and useful truths were an unassuageable fear and horror of all intellectual light—a voluntary determined and determinately perpetual blindness but these dissocial passions this jealousy this wretched envy the prevalence of which has just been stated by the objection being to such a degree extensive by the mere circumstance of his being a parent or guardian will a man be exempted from their influence the answer is no but whatsoever other persons may to a parents eye be objects of jealousy and envy his own child and especially his own child at any such tender age is not of the number to a parent how lowly soever his own lot in life in general the all but universal wish is to see that of his child raised as high as possible in the promotion of this wish two principles two most powerful and constantly operating principles concur viz instinctive tenderness and the reflection that what exaltation soever it may happen to this object of his affection to receive at his hands is his work and a manifestation of his own power in whatever line of life it happens to the parent to find himself placed in that same line it is his most natural and most frequent wish should any adequately favourable opening present itself to see his child raised as much above himself as possible of the apothecary the ambition is to see his child a physician of the highest eminence of the attorney to behold in his son a lord chancellor of the parish clergyman to behold in his an archbishop the lord chancellor more making his reverence and begging a blessing as in the great hall of westminster he was passing by his father then sitting as a puisne judge in the common pleas the puisne judge and not the lord high chancellor is the great object of envy to a paternal breast adverse prejudices obviated having thus presented under one view the advantages to be expected from the proposed course of instruction it may be of use to consider the adverse prejudices likely to be opposed to it these prejudices may be comprised under two heads viz   novelty of the plan   abstruseness of the subjects    in respect of selection and order of priority the assortment of subjects proposed to be taught will at first sight be seen to be in a very high degree different from everything which custom has hitherto brought to view this difference is most explicitly acknowledged it presents an unquestionable demand for satisfactory reasons but the reasons by which it was suggested are at hand and to these reasons the appellation of satisfactory ones will not it is hoped be refused in the order here stated as being recommended by custom it will be seen that originally it was equally well recommended by reason but that by a change of circumstances the recommendation which it originally received from reason has been cancelled that custom blind custom is the only base on which it stands at present the indication of reason stands opposed to it order of invention order of utility and order in respect of facility between these three principles of arrangement there is no small difference that it is by the joint consideration of the order of utility and the order of facility that the order of instruction ought to be determined is sufficiently apparent but if so the order of invention were it not for the custom of which it has become productive would be a matter of accident scarcely possessing unless on the score of curiosity any claim to regard yet so it is that by the order of invention the order of instruction has in a main degree been determined nor in the coincidence is there anything that need surprise us by the order of invention mens thoughts were    determined to run on in that track and failing determinate and sufficient reason to the contrary the track in which mens thoughts have begun to run is the track in which it is desirable and useful that they should continue to the proposed plan of instruction the quality of usefulness possessed by it in a preeminent and incontrovertible degree is without hesitation attributed inasmuch as of all the several branches comprehended in it there is not one that may not be found to be continually applicable to all the several purposes of common life and that not only of the more or less elevated but of the very humblest spheres true it is that when these several branches come to be mentioned by their names these names being in most instances the designation of branches of instruction hitherto but little cultivated the names and consequently the things themselves will to the generality of readers be apt to be regarded as remote from common use but when by an example or two the practically useful application of these seemingly abstruse and hitherto formidable sciences is brought to view and when the cause why the number of persons acquainted with them is as yet so small is seen to be not in any deficiency in the article of practical usefulness but in the recency of the discoveries by which they have been brought to their present state of comparative perfection and in the accidental circumstances which occasioned a preference to be given to other less useful studies the conception of their inutility will scarcely be long in giving way to the clearest and firmest persuasion of their preeminent and universal use    if they are abstruse it is because they are uncommon if they are as yet uncommon it is because it is only of late years that their general usefulness has received such increase as to form a body of instruction capable of being announced in the character of a thing universally useful to the universality of learners chemistry and mechanics for example are formidable names but when once that which cannot be denied has been understood viz that it is from chemistry alone that a man can learn how to apply fuel to the best advantage or how to guard himself most effectually against destruction by fire or poison and that from mechanics alone he can learn how to apply his labour to the best advantage with or without the assistance of machines and other instruments when once these things have with any tolerable degree of attention been considered whatsoever disgust or distaste whatsoever awe or jealousy may have been excited by their as yet unfamiliar names may surely not unreasonably be expected to give way not only to complacency but to desire accordingly whatsoever practical and familiar utility is seen to belong to these several branches of scientific instruction will be carefully looked out for and completely and diligently held up to view and placed in the most amusing as well as clear and instructive light the design of this institution being not to raise up a few scholastic pedants but to breed up in every walk of life a numerous and continually increasing succession of intelligent and useful and as far as the condition of human beings in this life admits contented and happy men not to pamper pride but to assist and cherish personal freedom and general benevolence let us not suffer ourselves to be either horrified or disgusted by a few words which because less familiar than those which we are most accustomed to are called hard names—names without which the several branches of knowledge which are not only among the most useful but to a greater or less extent even the most generally familiar could neither be distinguished from each other nor so much as expressed let us not conclude that because without teaching they are not to any extent generally understood by grown men therefore by teaching they are not capable of being made to be understood by children in the sort of view which in this first stage of instruction it is proposed to give of the several sciences comprised in it let us but consider what there is in them respectively that so much as to a child of eight years old can prove difficult or formidable   botany for example what is it an acquaintance more or less correct and extensive with the external appearances of the different sets of plants not only a working gardener but every common labourer in husbandry every greengrocer every herbwoman is to a certain degree and in the same way a botanist   zoology being of greek extraction and not in very common use the name is a hard name but in the same mode as here proposed not only every labourer in husbandry but every man without exception is in respect of such animals as have fallen in his way a zoologist every man woman and child to whom there has been given the amusement of seeing a collection of birds and beasts has received a lesson in zoology—a lesson of the sort here proposed   mineralogy to a certain extent every labourers man employed in the working of a mine is a mineralogist so is every labourer in husbandry by whom sand gravel loam marl or chalk are dug or lime burnt the acquaintance which the labourer in mines has with mineralogy is confined to the production of his own mine the acquaintance which in the proposed school a scholar at the first stage will have with the same science will be less particular though more extensive indeed as extensive as it can be made   astronomy so large and so far distant from us are the subjects of this science that the very name of it is enough to strike us with awe but the first astronomers it is well known were shepherds in the regions of the    east the clearness of the sky afforded them this relief from the pain of mental vacancy beyond those shepherds the young scholars will not have to go except in as far as it may be carried by the addition of representations to realities   geography of this branch of science the name is not quite so formidable as the names just passed under review in this country few even of the labouring classes but have seen globes and in general have heard the use of them none who can read but have seen the use of maps yet of these five branches of science geography even at this its earliest stage is the most abstruse why because except to the extent of the prospect which a man carries with him representations are here substituted for not added to realities as to the solution of geographical problems these belong not to this proposed first stage of instruction but to the second in which geography is considered as belonging to natural philosophy and as such coming under the cognizance of judgment as well as of sense and memory general concluding observations    on the one hand the quantity of instruction raised to its maximum on the other hand the quantity of punishment and reward employed in the production of that effect sunk to its minimum in a word profit maximized expense minimized such in the instance of the inferior order of schools established in pursuance of the system invented by dr bell inferior in respect of quantity and variety of instruction but not in respect of importance has been the promise made such as far as evidence extends whether of the direct cast or of the circumstantial as deducible from the working of the system is the promise that has everywhere been fulfilled such in the instance of the superior order of schools of which a commencement is here proposed to be made may with not less confidence be it is hoped expected thus not only will the reign of juvenile terror be everywhere at an end but those occupations which till so lately have in all schools to almost all scholars been a mere burthen will be converted into pastime and those hours which to us and our forefathers were hours partly of irksome labour partly of joyless and listless idleness will to our progeny be hours of sport and gaiety all work and no play makes jack a dull boy such is the concession made the plea pleaded by the homely proverb in favour of unprofitable pastime that by all play and no work jack would ever be made a learned boy is a result to the truth of which neither proverb nor prophecy had ever dared to look but by dr bell that fiction of the golden age which the boldest of prophets would never have dared to prophesy has actually been accomplished if by jenner human life have been rendered longer by bell it has been rendered in a still greater degree happier pain being banished and pleasure substituted and that during the period when the little bosom is most sensible to both compared with all other new institutions the proposed chrestomathic school will have this singularity in its favour viz that not only will its practicability have been proved but even its success assured before it has been tried in the application which the principles of it have already so abundantly received all difficulties have already been overcome as far as concerns the scholars if the field of instruction will in this new case receive increase yet it may be safely and confidently asserted that the thorniest of all fields are those in which the success of this new species of culture has received such ample and uncontested proof and that the new and higher portions of ground now prepared to be enclosed and put into the corresponding course of cultivation are with little or no exception not only less beset with thorns but most abundantly adorned with flowers—flowers altogether without parallel in those lower regions exists there so much as a single ground for believing or so much as supposing that in the instance of any one of the branches of art and science proposed to be superadded success will be less certain or less universal than in those cases in which the completeness and universality of that success has so long been placed out of doubt if there be it lies upon him in whose bosom any such doubt or suspicion has arisen to settle with himself and produce the grounds of it    natural pleasantness at the dawn of reason more especially an object is the more pleasant the more exclusively it presents itself to the senses especially to the senses of sight and hearing and accordingly the less forcibly it applies itself to the understanding calling for the exercise of the judgment on an extensive scale hence the various sensible forms presented by nature and art particularly by nature are objects which at this early period present in general a stronger interest than is presented by transactions such as are produced by the mutual intercourse amongst persons of mature age objects of natural or as it is called physical than is presented by objects of moral including political knowledge birds and beasts subjects of zoology are by themselves or their images plane or solid among the most pleasant and interesting objects that can be presented to the observation of children at their earliest ages    artificial pleasantness under the new mode of instruction a sort of pleasantness not the less real for being artificial i e for being the product of reflection and ingenuity is imparted to all subjects not excepted the most abstruse ones but this being the same on all occasions and to whatsoever subjects    applied the natural degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness will remain to each unaltered    corporeal—incorporeal corporeal or bodily viz natural substances such as stones plants and animals artificial substances such as buildings furniture clothing tools articles of food and drink and the materials wrought or unwrought of which and the tools and other instruments with which they are respectively composed—incorporeal such as interest of money lent rents issuing out of land and other similar subjects of property political offices conditions in life resulting from genealogical relations such as those between husband and wife father and child guardian and ward master and servant    concrete from a latin word which signifies grown up along with viz along with the subject which is in question whatever it be it is used in contradistinction to the word abstract derived from a latin word which signifies drawn off from viz from the subject in question as above an orange for example has a certain figure whereby in connexion with a certain colour it stands distinguished from all other fruits as well as from all objects of all sorts take into consideration this or that individual orange the ideas presented by the figure and colour whereby it stands distinguished not only from other fruits but even from other oranges—from other fruits of the same kind—are concrete ideas for they grew up as it were together in the mind out of the individual object by which they are excited and produced they are amongst the elements out of which the aggregate conception afforded and presentible to us by that individual object is formed the orange being no longer in sight—now of the figure and colour observed in that individual orange consider such parts or appearances as are to be found in all other oranges as well as in that one the idea thus formed is an abstract idea it being a portion drawn off as it were from the aggregate idea obtained as above from the individual object being abstracted and slipt off from the individual stock and thereupon planted in the mind it has there taken root and acquired a separate and independent existence without thinking any more of that individual orange in particular or of oranges in general or of so much as of fruits in general take now into consideration figure at large and colour at large here at one jump the mind has arrived at an idea not only abstract but vastly more abstract than in the case last mentioned instead of figure and colour let us now say sensible qualities under this appellation are included not only figure and colour but smell taste and many others it is therefore abstract in a still higher degree  0 complex or complicated understand with the exception of that species of complexity or complicatedness which has place in the case of concrete as contradistinguished from abstract ideas whence it may be said comes this exception answer from hence viz that though in other cases the more complex the idea is the greater the labour of mind or force of attention is which is necessary to the obtaining the conception in a clear and correct state that is not the case here no portion of matter ever presents itself to sense without presenting at one and the same time a multitude of simple ideas of all which taken together the concrete one in a state more or less correct and complete is composed at the same time though naturally all these ideas present themselves together the mind has it in its power to detach as above any one or more of them from the rest and either keep it in view in this detached state or make it up into a compound with other simple ideas detached in like manner from other sources but for the making of this separation—this abstraction as it is called—more trouble a stronger force of attention is necessary than for the taking them up in a promiscuous bundle as it were in the bundle in which they have been tied together by the hand of nature that is than for the consideration of the object in its concrete state    cause and effect on all these accounts but especially the last the juvenile mind will be earlier prepared for the reception of instruction with reference to natural history stage i than to natural philosophy stages ii iii iv v and as between these—forasmuch as in each of these stages the subjects included in it add more or less if not to the extent to the number and variety of those included in the preceding stage or stages—it will be better prepared for the branches contained in stage ii alone than for those contained in that and stage iii together and so on as to the rest    name of the art or science a cloud of perplexity raised by indistinct and erroneous conceptions—a cloud of perplexity and consequent difficulty of expression—seems to have been at all times hanging over the import of the terms art and science a few lines it is hoped will not be found altogether misemployed in the endeavour to dispel it the common supposition seems to be that in the whole field of thought and action a determinate number of existing compartments are assignable marked out all round and distinguished from one another by so many sets of natural and determinate boundary lines compartments whereof some are filled each of them by an art without any mixture of science others by a science without any mixture of art others again so constituted that as it has not ever happened to them hitherto so neither can it ever happen to them in future to contain in them any thing either of art or science on some such supposition accordingly appear to be grounded questions such as the following—how many arts are there how many sciences such a thing naming it is it an art or is it a science—i e such a    word mentioning it is it the name of an art or is it the name of a science this supposition will it is believed be found in every part erroneous as between art and science in the whole field of thought and action no one spot will be found belonging to either to the exclusion of the other in whatsoever spot a portion of either is found a portion of the other may be seen likewise whatsoever spot is occupied by either is occupied by both it is occupied by them in jointtenancy whatsoever spot is thus occupied is so much taken out of the waste but neither is there any determinate part of the whole waste that is not liable to be thus occupied practice in proportion as attention and exertion are regarded as necessary to due performance is termed art knowledge in proportion as attention and exertion are regarded as necessary to attainment is termed science in the latin language both are with great advantage comprehended under one common appellation viz disciplinæ from disco to learn disciplinæ with which our english word discipline agrees in sound as well as in derivation but by the narrower import which has been attached to it may probably be regarded as having been rendered unfit for this use in the very nature of the case they will be found so combined as to be inseparable man cannot do anything well but in proportion as he knows how to do it he cannot in consequence of attention and exertion know anything but in proportion as he has practised the art of learning it correspondent therefore to every art there is at least one branch of science correspondent to every branch of science there is at least one branch of art no determinate line of distinction between art on the one hand and science on the other no determinate line of distinction between art and science on the one hand and unartificial practice and unscientific knowledge on the other in proportion as that which is seen to be done is more conspicuous than that which is seen or supposed to be known that which has place is apt to be considered as the work of art in proportion as that which is seen or supposed to be known is more conspicuous than anything else that is seen to be done that which has place is apt to be set down to the account of science day by day acting in conjunction art and science are gaining upon the abovementioned waste—the field of unartificial practice and unscientific knowledge witness electricity galvanism see stage ii geognosy or geology aerostation see stage iii botanical and zoological palæology knowledge regarding the remains of plants and animals deposited according to appearance at remote times in the bowels of the earth a branch of science appertaining in common to botany and zoology see stage i on the one hand and geognosy see stage iii on the other under an old name even chemistry see stage ii includes an immense mass of art and science all new within these few years of late years nephelognosy if by this appellation may be designated the long chain of partial observations which have recently taken the clouds for their subject has become a candidate for existence so in the department of morals and politics statistics a newly cultivated branch of geography having for its subject the quantities and qualities of the matter of population of the matter of wealth and of the matter of political strength—existing or supposed to exist on the territory or in the political state to which it applies while new branches of art and science have thus been starting up and putting themselves upon the list others have dropped out of it the case being that either on the one hand something which had been supposed to be done has been found not to have been done nor to be for anything that appears capable of being done or on the other hand that something which had been supposed to be capable of being known has been found according to all appearance destitute of existence and on that account not capable of being known witness alchemy or the art of transmuting other metals into gold with or without the art of composing a medicine fit for the cure of all sorts of disorders whatsoever those of the most opposite nature not excepted   astrology or the art of discovering future events affecting the prosperity of individual inhabitants of the earth by looking at the stars   necromancy the art of discovering future events by conversing with the dead to which may be added a cluster of other arts or sciences all ending in mancy and having for their objects the deriving knowledge concerning future events from so many different sources from no one of which is any such knowledge to be obtained as between art and science in so far as they are distinguishable art is that one of the two that seems entitled to the first mention as being first and most independent—in value and thence in dignity in so far as dignity consists in use for of science the value consists in its subserviency to art of speculation the value consists in its subserviency to practice of the two art when it is not itself the end stands nearest to the end with reference to this end whatsoever of science stands connected with it is but as a means but if independently of all connexion which it has with art science pleases then in so far as it pleases it is of use for use itself has neither value nor meaning but in virtue of and in proportion to whatsoever relation it has to pain or pleasure  persons to whom the account thus given of art fails of being satisfactory may find a very different account of it in james harriss  vo volume intitled three treatics one of which is the whole of it expended upon a definition of this word without any mention as far as memory serves of the word science    antiquity between the degree of natural preparedness on the part of the mind for the reception of a branch of instruction be it what it may and the antiquity of it as measured by the length of time that has elapsed since instruction in it happened first to be administered—no immediate and necessary connexion can be shown to have place in time indeed but not by time are things done experience observation experiment in these three words may be seen the sources of all our knowledge of these experience is without effect any farther than as it has had observation for its accompaniment and in the very idea of experiment that of observation is included upon observation therefore it is—upon observation that is upon attention applied to the subject with effect—that everything depends numerous and various are the natural objects which when once by minds matured for the purpose they have been observed and thereupon denominated find the infant mind in a state of the most perfect preparedness for their reception but which never happened to be taken for the subjects of observation nor therefore of denomination till within these few years to the infant mind few objects can be more interesting—none are there of which the external characters are more readily apprehensible—than those which belong to the field of animated nature but for the most part what acquaintance we have with the objects which belong to this part of the field of thought and action is of very modern date    number of teachers and learners a circumstance on which the antiquity of a subject of knowledge has no influence is as above the natural preparedness of the juvenile mind for the reception of it but a circumstance on which that antiquity has great influence is—the number of the persons who at the time in question are engaged in the teaching of it and thence the number of those who are engaged in the learning of it desire to learn on the one part and desire to teach on the other being two circumstances which with relation to one another are both cause and effect cases to a comparatively small extent excepted for example that which has place where the advantage derivable from teaching is made the subject of a monopoly whatsoever be the real and intrinsic value of a branch of learning those who have learnt it and those who are teaching it have each of them an interest in magnifying it and causing it to be cultivated to the greatest extent possible learners as well as teachers lest their labour should be thought to have been bestowed in vain teachers that the number of their customers may be as great as possible among the known subjects of intellectual labour not many it is believed can be pointed out that have less in them of intrinsic use especially since the stock of translations has been completed than the dead languages yet of these there are incomparably a greater number of teachers and thence of learners than of all other branches of learning put together the very elementary ones viz reading writing and arithmetic alone excepted why because the study of those keys to knowledge has continued to be cultivated from the time when the abovementioned elementary branches excepted there was very little known that was worth learning still less for which teachers could be found    introductory stage the branches of instruction thus referred to an introductory stage are the same as those which are comprehended in the course of instruction carried on in that new method which though applicable with equal advantage to the situation of the highest has not as yet been applied to any other than that of the lowest ranks in life in this introductory stage to a degree more or less considerable the matter of instruction cannot fail of coinciding with and thus anticipating the matter here allotted for the first and earliest of the five stages peculiar to the hereby proposed school words for example it cannot but have to operate upon and—the words of which in the first of these principal and peculiar stages the matter of instruction is composed being such as are adapted to the very earliest age—of this sort with at least as much propriety as of any other sort may be the words employed in the introductory stage already in use again writing is among the exercises allotted to the first chrestomathic stage but writing is itself but a mode of drawing nor that the easiest mode geometry will among its figures present some still more simple than some of the letters of which written discourse is composed    mineralogy from two words one of which derived from the latin signifies belonging to mines mines being the places from which the most interesting among the subjects of this branch of science are extracted and a greek word which signifies an account or giving an account of in this first stage the subject in so far as teachable by exhibition of figure colour and other sensible qualities will be taught without reference made as in chemistry and geognosy to causes and effects more or less remote    botany from a greek word which signifies a plant or vegetable—to be taught as above without reference to the relation of cause and effect except in so far as indication of the manner of propagation comes to be made    zoology from two greek words one of which signifies an animal the other an account as above—to be taught as above under mineralogy will be presented to view those bodies and portions of matter in which    no sort of life is found under botany those which have vegetable life i e birth and growth as well as death but as far as appears without feeling under zoology those which have animal life i e not only as plants birth growth and death but feeling as far as appears with more or less of thought on these subjects the exercises prescribed and performed will as far as circumstances admit be accompanied with the exhibition of specimens specimens dead and even living as well as draughts or models of specimens see table ii col       geography from two greek words one of which signifies the earth the other delineation or description the familiar or purely geographical branch viz that for the teaching of which maps with the requisite verbal explanations are sufficient dismissing to stage v   the scientific viz that by which are exhibited the facts and appearances resulting from the connexion which the earth has with the sun the moon and other parts of the universe visible to our eyes  0 geometry from two greek words one of which as above signifies the earth the other measurement from this derivation it appears that among the greeks the first application which this branch of art and science received was that of being employed in measuring for the purpose of ascertaining ownership portions of the earths surface such as fields gardens and the sites of houses but it is now applied to portions of apparently void space as well as to bodies of all sorts and sizes imaginary as well as real in so far as considered with a view to nothing but their figure from this stage the demonstrations—as requiring too many objects and those not in themselves interesting to be held at the same time in the memory and too strong a hold to be taken of them by the attention for the purpose of forming a ground for the judgment—will be dismissed to stage v and last so likewise even the enunciative parts of the propositions except perhaps in the instance of a few of the most simple and easily conceived remain the definitions for the illustration of which the most familiar specimens such as rules pencils slates marbles balls tops c will be employed as to the demonstrations from the proposed postponement no real inconvenience can it is presumed result on no other subject with so little danger of error as on that of geometry can propositions be delivered to be taken upon trust be the art or science what it may incompetence as to the reception of some particulars belonging to it affords no reason for withholding from the juvenile mind any other particulars to the reception of which it is competent    historical chronology historical from a greek word which signifies originally knowledge at large but which in the use commonly made of it is at present confined to knowledge or supposed knowledge relative to past events principally to such as are of a political nature such as wars conquests changes of government c chronology from two greek words one of which signifies time the other an account as above historical chronology i e history in so far as exhibited by chronology considered in no other than the familiar point of view consisting of indications given of the principal events known or supposed to have happened to mankind mentioned in the briefest manner with reference to the portions of time in which they are respectively supposed to have taken place the mention so made not being accompanied by any of those statements or observations relative to their supposed causes or effects or relative to the characters of the respective actors whereof the matter of what is generally meant by the word history is composed history thus as it were clothed will be reserved partly for a higher stage in this same school partly for a maturer time of life for another branch of chronology which stands higher and belongs to natural philosophy see stage v   by the difference between today yesterday and the day before application being made of the numeration table a child at its very exit from infancy will have been found prepared for historical chronology as above described the import attached to the words designative of the several events becoming by degrees more and more clear correct and complete as the course of instruction advances exercises in historical chronology will be afforded by tables charts and memoriter verses and in return to correspondent questions answers written and repeated in prose    biographical chronology biographical from two greek words one of which signifies life the other a delineation or description as above in this instance as in that of historical chronology the miscellaneous matter will for some time be dismissed as above exercises much the same    appropriate drawing appropriate viz correspondent on the one hand to the state of the bodily faculties and the degree of proficiency thence attained on the other hand to the particular nature of the branch of art and science to which in the character of an organic test of intellection see tab ii col       application is made of this art as to earliness—the first rude essays in drawing cannot take place too soon writing is but a particular branch or application of it not to speak of mineralogy with the right lined angles exhibited by its crystals—and even botany and zoology as exhibited by some of their outlines—geometry affords forms still more easily traceable upon sand or slate than those which are produced by writing under the name of letters and words of the term appropriate drawing the import will consequently be shifting at every successive stage the figures delineated being throughout such as appertain to the branches of  0 learning included in the stage in question as well as the preceding ones by the several branches of natural history learning comprised in this stage is furnished the matter upon which the juvenile mind will have to operate in the course of the several succeeding stages the more familiarly it has become acquainted with them when presented in this most simple point of view the less the difficulty it will experience in its endeavours to comprehend the propositions of which they will be taken for the subjects in the course of the succeeding stages by the hands of chemistry the inward constitution and composition—the latent properties—of all those several natural modifications of matter will principally by means of mixture and different doses of combined and uncombined caloric different degrees of heat and cold be laid open and brought to view    mechanics in the limited sense of the word mechanics from a greek word which signifies a machine an engine a contrivance in the limited sense of the word viz in the sense in which it is employed for the designation of the several distinguishable classes of configurations contrived principally for the purpose of gaining force at the expense of despatch or despatch at the expense of force these are   the lever   the wheel turning upon a fixed axis   the pulley or shifting wheel   the inclined plane   the screw   the wedge to which hath of late years been added   the funicular machine and are now designated by the common appellation of the mechanical powers this limited sense is the only original one the only one attached to the word in the language from which it is derived within the last two hundred years the species of force to a compromise as it were amongst which all distinguishable bodies or masses of matter appear to be indebted for the quantity of matter the form and the texture which they respectively possess have been brought to light these are   attraction of gravity a tendency possessed not only by all the matter of which our earth but by all the matter of which any part of the visible universe is composed   attraction of cohesion the perceptible operation of which is confined within distances too small to be distinguished by human sense   elasticity i e a principle of repulsion corresponding to and antagonizing with the attraction of cohesion   attraction and repulsion having place in the case of magnetism   attraction and repulsion having place in the case of electricity   attraction and repulsion having place in the case of galvanism   attraction termed elective belonging to the province of chemistry and from the french commonly though rather unhappily expressed by the term chemical affinity n b in regard to these three or four last species it seems not at present altogether determined how far they coincide and how far if at all they stand distinguished from each other to the head of mechanics taken at large including or not including mechanics taken in the limited acceptation of the word as above seems now to be generally referred what appertains to the three first of the above seven general principles together with whatsoever changes or arrangements are regarded as capable of being brought about or secured in any mass or masses of matter without any such change in the arrangement of their undistinguishably minute constituent elements and thence in some of their external characters as those which it belongs to the chemist as such to produce or bring to view in regard to magnetism and electricity in so far as the motions which have place on the occasions on which those words are employed are seen to extend to measurable distances they seem to be considered as belonging to the head of mechanics in so far as the distance in question is so minute as to be incapable of measurement they seem to be considered as belonging to the head of chemistry by all the several instruments above spoken of under the head of mechanical powers motion is transferred and modified by none of them produced—in all of them motion finds a channel in none of them a source what then are the several sources from which for any purpose and in particular for purposes of practical utility it is producible and accordingly produced more shortly what are the several sources of motion and what the corresponding prime movers or primum mobiles of a search made in the latest and most approved institutional works on natural philosophy the result has been—that of no such topic is any the slightest mention to be found and thus a gap the existence of which had long been matter of observation and never without astonishment—a gap in the very heart of the science—was found to remain still unfilled up that in the chrestomathic school a demand so urgent may not be altogether unprovided with an answer a slight sketch on this subject has been attempted and is inserted in the appendix—in the hope and under the assurance that being thus started the subject will not remain long without being more effectually pursued by more competent hands    hydrostatics from two greek words one of which signifies water the other taking a station position or level to this head belong such of the mechanical properties of the portions of matter of which our earth is composed as are the result of the propensity which in conformity to the allpervading principle of gravitation the component particles of water and all other bodies in so far as they are in a state of fluidity have to range themselves in such a manner as to form a surface which to our eye appears flat but which is in fact a curve having its central point in this our planet    on this property depend the means employed for ascertaining the specific gravity of different bodies i e the different weights respectively possessed by the same bulk of each and in particular the weights and thence the values of spirituous and other costly liquors so likewise in a considerable degree the effects of pumpwork of millwork more particularly in the case of watermills and the efficiency of such solid constructions as are employed in resisting the pressure of the water for example navigable vessels wharfs docks c    hydraulics from two greek words one of which as above signifies water the other a pipe or tube to this head belong the mechanical properties of liquids as above—in so far as being bounded by and confined in solid channels of a determinate form the force with which and the direction in which when put in motion they act and the effects of which on that occasion they become productive are influenced by the internal form or configuration of those same channels it is therefore nothing but a particular branch or modification of hydrostaties to this belongs for example pumpwork as above and in general the art of conveying water and other liquids upon a large scale to places in which they are wanted    mechanical pneumatics pneumatics from a greek word which means air coincident with or at least included in the import of this term is that of the recently employed term aërostatics to this head belong those mechanical properties as they are termed which in whatsoever different degrees are possessed in common by all such portions of matter as at the time in question are in the aërial or gaseous state and in particular their weight the result of the attraction of gravity their elasticity the result of the principle of intestine repulsion and that pressure on all sides which is the result of the sort of compromise that has place amongst those antagonizing forces to the head of chemical pneumatics as below belong those properties by which the several species of bodies when in the gaseous state are distinguished from each other on the above mechanical properties depend for example in a greater or less degree the art of millwork in so far as concerns windmills the art of constructing and navigating navigable vessels in so far as sails are employed and in virtue of the tendency which the same body viz water has to pass from the liquid into the gaseous state and back again according to the quantity of heat combined or mixed with it the construction of steamengines    acoustics from a greek word which signifies to hear to this head belongs the property which by its motion air has of producing in the correspondent organs of man and other animals the perception of sound in the infinitely diversified modifications of which it is susceptible on the science thus denominated depend for example in a degree more or less considerable the art by which relief is afforded in case of deafness and the art by which words and other audible signs are employed in the communication of ideas whether near at hand or at a distance    optics from a greek word which signifies to see to this head belongs the property which light has of producing in the correspondent organs of man and other animals the perception of sight or vision and thereby rendering in some sort present to them bodies which so far as depends upon all other senses are separated from them by vast untraversable and even unmeasurable distances on this depends for example the art of employing with effect glasses and other bodies so prepared as in some cases to transmit the light in others to reflect it and by the one means or the other besides increasing for the purpose of chemical operations the quantity of light and along with it of heat brought to bear upon a given point to delight the organs of vision by a variety of images not otherwise perceptible to afford relief to those same organs under various imperfections to which they are subject to enable them to obtain perception of objects too small to be perceived otherwise and of others such as several of the heavenly bodies which notwithstanding their vast bulk are too distant to be by any other means effectually perceived or observed and by observations taken of them to ascertain upon occasion with relation to the general surface of the earth by the help of calculation the momentary position of a navigable vessel and thus afford guidance to it in its course  0 chemistry from an arabic word which may be said to be of the same signification allowance made for the minuteness of the stock of knowledge possessed in relation to the subject at the time when the word first came into use in comparison with the vastness of the stock possessed at present to the head of chemistry seem to be generally referred those properties which are either discovered in bodies or given to them by means of mixture i e actual contact produced as between bodies in a fluid state on the one hand and bodies either in a fluid or in a solid state on the other or by the application of extraordinary degrees of temperature i e of heat or cold or both on which occasions the original bodies are commonly in appearance destroyed and in the room of them new ones in appearance and properties more or less dissimilar produced   mineral chemistry    vegetable chemistry    animal chemistry i e chemistry considered in its application to those three different classes of bodies applied to mineral bodies it is capable of producing not only the effect of composition as well as that of decomposition but in many instances that of recomposition i e by putting together    bodies such as they are in their natural state it produces new ones—bodies possessed of properties never before made manifest by decomposing i e resolving into their respective constituent elements bodies such as they are in their natural state it thus also produces new ones and moreover after thus resolving a body into its constituent elements it in many instances is able to put them together again in such a manner as to reproduce the very body so decomposed a body composed of the same elements and not in respect of any of its properties distinguishable from it applied to vegetable or animal bodies its powers are confined to decomposition neither to composition nor recomposition do they extend of these organized bodies the formation is a process by much too secret and refined to be copied by human art in the course of the instruction given in chemistry as it comes to be applied respectively to the subjects of the mineral vegetable and animal kingdoms occasion will occur for recalling enlivening extending and fixing in the memory the information received in relation to them in stage i    meteorology from two greek words the first of which signifies aloft or elevated no sooner does a substance break free from any of those bonds by which while remaining in a state of solidity or liquidity it has been confined to a determinate part of the earths surface than it enters into the province of meteorology and there continues until by any of those revolutions of which the atmosphere is the constant theatre it is again brought into immediate contact with and made to form a portion of some one or more of those solid or liquid masses thus after having been raised by solution in the incumbent air and then again precipitated water on its descent towards the dense part of the earths surface becomes according to circumstances mist rain hail or snow—remaining all the while and until it has reached that dense part amongst the subjects of meteorology so likewise the electric fluid when by the magnitude of its quantity it gives birth to those appearances which under the denominations of thunder and lightning are sometimes so fatal and to many a timorous mind at all times so tremendous  the atmosphere i e the miscellaneous mass of matter in a gaseous state with which those parts of the earths surface which are in a solid or liquid state are constantly encompassed    magnetism from a greek word which signifies a loadstone this naturally compounded species of mineral having iron for its principal element being the only body in which the peculiar relation in the way of attraction and repulsion to other bodies of the same sort or to iron was for a long time observed—though latterly by human art means have been found for establishing the same sort of relation between one piece of iron prepared in a particular manner and another and still more recently between magnets or magnetized iron on the one part and on the other a newly discovered species of metal called nickel the like relation has been observed a piece of iron when brought to a proper form and after having for the purpose been magnetized as above left free to turn itself upon a centre points towards a star which serves for giving name to the north and thence to the other divisions of the universe and to the corresponding points of the mariners compass by which means without view of sun moon or star the situation of the spot at which the observation is made with relation to every part of the universe is at all times ascertainable and thus it is that for showing to him the direction in which he is moving the magnetic needle is become an instrument as necessary as it is simple in the hands of the navigator    electricity from a greek word which signifies amber by mere rubbing certain kinds of bodies had at different times been found capable of being rendered productive of extraordinary appearances and extraordinary changes in other bodies attracting them repelling them producing light producing heat and so forth of the sorts of bodies by means of which these appearances are producible amber having been the first in which the power of producing them was observed hence the whole system of those effects came to be designated by the name of electricity as if one should say amberwork by degrees it having been observed that the property of producing those effects is a property which under certain circumstances is manifested by all matter it was at length discovered viz by benjamin franklin that among them are those to which when manifested upon the largest scale the names thunder and lightning are applied accordingly to this head belong at present the means employed for securing person and property from the destruction of which those changes in the atmosphere are liable to become the source in some diseases electricity has been applied not altogether without success in the character of a remedy    galvanism from galvani an italian by whom not long before the close of the last century effects in many respects coinciding with though in some respects different from those produced by electricity were found producible without the help of friction or intercourse with the clouds by a mere arrangement made to take place between certain bodies in a solid and certain others in a fluid state magnetism electricity galvanism—in the hands of the chemist the powers designated by those several names more particularly electricity and galvanism have become so    many very efficient and active instruments by electricity but still more particularly by galvanism bodies which till then had been regarded as simple having principally under the management of sir humphrey dary been decomposed and new ones possessed of very extraordinary properties brought as it were into existence by magnetism by electricity and in some degree by galvanism effects have thus been produced on other bodies without any remarkable change in the constitution of the bodies employed as instruments in the production of those effects and in this way it is that these districts of the field of science appertain in some respects to the province of mechanics but by the use and application made of them particularly of electricity and most particularly of galvanism not only new properties have been observed but prodigious changes have been made in the constitution of most sorts of bodies and in this way it is that they appertain to the province of chemistry    balistics from a greek word which signifies to cast called also the theory of projectiles from a latin word of the same signification the mass projected is either in a solid or in a liquid state in so far as it is in a solid state the art of gunnery is included in it an art which in so far as concerns the motion produced belongs since the invention of gunpowder to chemistry and in so far as concerns the giving direction to that motion to mechanics in so far as the mass projected is in a liquid state the art is that of making jets deau i e playing fountains a branch which by its perfect innocence and comparative insignificance forms a striking contrast with the other in detail neither can gunnery any more than fortification or navigation present any sufficient title to admittance into the chrestomathic school but in so far as they are all of them comprehended in natural philosophy it would be leaving an incongruous gap not to give some general intimation of the general principles on which they respectively depend    geography continued in the first stage the instruction relating to geography will have been confined to mere topography—the knowledge of the divisions and remarkable spots partly natural partly factitious observable on the earths surface beginning of course with the country in which the instruction is administered at this next and other succeeding stages the same ground will be retrodden and in it as relative capacity advances information will be afforded of that sort which in books of geography used to be comprehended under that name but of late years has been referred to a separate name viz statistics such as that which concerns population the manner and proportions in which the matter of wealth the matter of power and the matter of dignity are distributed quantity and quality of military force c c  0 geometry continued see stage i    historical chronology continued in the same manner as geography presented at first in the state of a naked field receives by degrees its proper clothing so will historical chronology in the one case as in the other the signs will come to be repeated and at each repetition an additional quantity of information will be superadded to the account of the great military wars and other political events composed of battles sieges unions and dismemberments acquisitions and losses of territory changes in dynasties and in so far as in the stage and at the age in question they can be made intelligible in forms of government—to this will by degrees be added the sort of information designated by the term archæology i e account of antiquities an account of the state of persons and things in anterior i e former and earlier so preposterously termed ancient times including information respecting lodging diet clothing military equipment pastimes—powers and functions—belonging to offices civil political and religious c    appropriate drawing in the chrestomathic school the great use of drawing is the giving assistance to and serving as a test and thence as a cause of proficiency in the branches of art and science to which it is applicable on this score in so far as it is appropriate it will adapt itself to those several subjects in proportion as they are presented but this direction receives a necessary modification from the state of the bodily organs in question in respect of maturity    grammatical exercises see table ii the objects aimed at in and by these exercises will be—   to render the scholar acquainted with the structure of language in general and that of his own language in particular and thereby to qualify him for speaking and writing on all subjects and occasions with clearness correctness and due effect—in his own language   by familiarizing him with the greater part in number and importance of those terms belonging to foreign languages from which those belonging to his own are derived and in which the origin of their import and the families of words with which they are connected are to be found—to divest them of that repulsive and disheartening quality of which so impressive an idea is conveyed by the appellation of hard words   to render the approach to the several branches of art and science as smooth and easy as possible by rendering that part of the language which is peculiar to them and which is mostly derived from foreign and in particular from the dead languages as familiar as any other part   to lay a substantial and extensive foundation for a more particular acquaintance to    the purpose of reading with or without that of conversation with the several foreign languages dead and living comprehended in the scheme or such of them as at a maturer age shall be regarded as promising to be conducive to the scholars advancement in life or agreeable to his taste as to the subjects of these exercises in addition to the rules of grammar they may consist of select portions of history and biography taken from the most approved works composed in the several languages in any language other than his own composition—except in so far as translation see tab ii exercises or note taking see stage v    may be considered as coming under this head—is proposed not to be comprehended in this course but to be reserved to some other seat of instruction or for selfinstruction at a maturer age    stage iii at this stage the general information obtained in the two preceding stages is still repeated and the application made of it to the exigencies and gratifications of common life rendered more and more particular and determinate and brought still nearer to actual and common use    mining under mineral chemistry have been brought to view the different sorts of simple substances obtained by means of this art together with the new substances obtained by putting them together and combining them in groups and proportions different from those in which they are found combined by the hands of nature under the present head a general view and a very general one will suffice will be to be given of the manner in which this art is practised in its quality of an art operating upon materials rendered more or less known by precedent science it matches in some sort with architecture and husbandry to which it supplies a considerable part of the materials which they respectively employ    geognosy from two greek words one of which signifies the earth the other knowledge or understanding by this name is designated what we have as yet been able to learn concerning the manner in which the matters composing the substance of the earth including so much of what is underneath the surface as hath been rendered accessible to us are distributed by geography the earth is viewed in one direction by geognosy in another direction by geography it is considered with a view to one set of purposes by geognosy with a view to another set of purposes geognosy is among the new fruits of chemistry to the general gratification afforded to speculative curiosity geognosy adds the practical advantage of affording indications—presumptive and experimentsaving indications—of the presence or absence of the valuable substances for the extraction of which the art of mining is employed by the remains which it brings to light of the dead subjects of the vegetable and animal kingdoms—some of them known others not known at present in a living state—geognosy includes archæology as applied to the structure of this our globe—see stage ii       landsurveying in an application made of it at stage ii to mechanics geometry found one of its practical uses in its application to landsurveying it will find another in addition to the more elementary part trigonometry from two greek words one of which signifies a three cornered figure the other measuring is a branch of the speculative science called geometry which on this occasion will be brought into practical use but in this instance too as well as in that of mechanics the simply enunciative parts of the propositions will serve by themselves still leaving to a more advanced stage such instruction and such exercises as take for their subject the demonstrative parts    architecture from two greek words one of which signifies chief or principal the other handicraft work for its products and in that view its subjects architecture in general has constructions in general constructions may be distinguished into principal constructions i e constructions of independent use and constructions for the purpose of communication principal constructions are mostly receptacles according to the nature of the bases on which the receptacles rest or move they are distinguished into terrestrial aquatic and aërial fixed buildings navigable vessels and air balloons of communication the principal instruments are   roads   canals including tunnels and drains   quays including wharfs and jetties   bridges substituted to the present costly and comparatively useless stock of a toyshop architectural models of buildings and furniture might if made to take to pieces and put together again be to this purpose productive of real and lasting use    husbandry including theory of vegetation and gardening on this occasion application will come to be made of the instruction obtained in relation to the mineral as well as the vegetable system in stage i and in relation to vegetable chemistry in stage ii so of the instruction obtained in relation to architecture in so far as concerns barns drains and other constructions and in relation to husbandry itself in so far as concerns implements—employed or with advantage employable in husbandry how to convey and commit to the earth to the best advantage the seeds and other germs of its products—as well as how to collect and convey to the store or the market the products themselves when ripe or otherwise ready for use—so likewise how to collect convey and commit to the earth the manure employed in their production—will be learnt principally from mechanics how to preserve them against corruption and combustion—as well as how to choose prepare and keep the    manure—from chemistry so in gardening how to employ artificial heat and shelter in the improvement or preservation of those choicer vegetables which are the subject of that art cattle not to speak of bees are all of them among the fruits some of them among the instruments of husbandry for what concerns the care of their health reference will be to be made to stage iv among the inferior animals husbandry has a multitude of enemies for the most effectual modes of destroying them reference will be to be made to stage iv but to this purpose it may be necessary to obtain more or less knowledge in relation to them and for this knowledge the foundation will at least have been laid in stage i  0 physical economics physical from a greek word which signifies natural in contradistinction to moral—economics from two greek words one of which signifies a house the other management of mechanics and chemistry—partly in an immediate way partly through the medium of architecture and husbandry—of mechanics as well as chemistry but principally of chemistry—application will here be made to all the various physical concerns of a family care of health excepted for which see stage iv from chemistry more particularly will be deduced and administered an allcomprehensive stock of practically useful information maximization of bodily comfort in all its shapes—minimization of bodily discomfort in all its shapes—minimization of the labour and expense applied to both these intimately connected purposes—these will the art in question have for its ends in view for maximization and minimization see table ii principles articles of household furniture apparel food drink and fuel these it will have among its principal subject matters warming cooling moistening washing drying ventilating lighting clothing cooking preserving repairing restoring—these it will have among its principal operations air heat cold light—substances some in a solid some in a liquid some even in a gaseous form—substances indefinitely diversified in form and texture—substances from all three kingdoms mineral animal and vegetable—some natural some factitious—some simple some compounded—these it will have for its materials and instruments    hygiastics or hygiantics from a greek word which signifies appertaining to health—the branches of art and science which appertain to health i e to the preservation as well as restoration of it—medicine physic—the words most commonly employed on this occasion—are inadequate and delusive under the name of medicines or physic drugs are conceived as being to be conveyed into the stomach and to the choosing and preparing of these drugs the idea of this most extensive and diversified cluster of arts and sciences is thus confined of all the bodies which it can be the object of this or any other course of instruction to render the scholar more or less acquainted with—there is not one the state and condition of which can be of near so much importance to him as that of his own at this time of life few it is true in comparison are the instances in which the body is in any way constantly out of order not a few in which it scarce ever is partly to this cause it seems to be owing that in the education of youth so important a branch of instruction has experienced so general a neglect several others however have likewise been contributing their share towards the production of this effect at the time or times in which the plan of school education not to speak of university education received its form chemistry—one of the necessary bases of hygiantics—had no existence and of the nine other arts and sciences which as below may be stated as being subservient to it several were nearly in the same case in those days the art not having any clear foundations there was scarcely anything which—especially to a mind of the age of a schoolboys—was capable of being taught very different is the case at present when by instruction in the several branches herein enumerated a clear foundation has been laid—as in a moderate space of time it may now be laid—a few rules may at a still more moderate expense of time and words be taught and learnt to great advantage how to guard against disease and death considered as liable to be produced by suddenness or excess of heat cold or moisture by want of respirable air by excess in diet or bodily labour how to apply to ones self or to obtain from friendly ignorance the speediest as well as most effectual relief—in the case of those accidents in which the most common disorders take their rise a burn a scald a flesh wound lameness produced by corns indigestion in its various symptoms pains of the rheumatic kind in the head tooth or ear what is called a cold in the several shapes in which that malady is most apt to make its appearance how to operate towards the recovery of persons apparently drowned in serious cases in general what to do in the meantime until professional assistance can be obtained and when obtained how to form some judgment as to its competency to females partly on account of the infirmities peculiar to that sex partly on account of the almost exclusive share which they possess in the management of children of both sexes for several years after birth this branch of knowledge is in a more peculiar degree important in point of fact all mothers all nurses are physicians partly by remedies altogether unapt partly by ill applied ones partly by ill grounded and false theories—in uninstructed families especially in those in which the expense of professional advice is an object of alarm it may almost be a question—whether more mischief is not done by medicine than sustained for want of it    children in particular are not unfrequently enslaved and tormented by unnecessary precautions and groudless fears great would be the value of sound hygiantic instruction were it only in the character of a preservative against the certain mischief to the purse and not improbable mischief to the constitution by quack medicines medicines of unknown composition presented by those to whom the patient and with him the particular nature of his case is unknown various are the impositions of which the human body is liable to be made the subject by a moderate quantity of hygiantic instruction such as the course in question could not fail to afford the mind is rendered proof against them all it would have its use were it only to enable a patient to make to his professional adviser a correct complete and conclusive report of his own case    physiology from two greek words one of which signifies nature or natural state the other an account an account of the several component parts of the body as well those which are naturally in a liquid as those which are in a solid state    anatomy from a greek word which signifies dissection cutting up the parts of the body to which it can apply are of course no other than those which it finds in a solid state    pathology from two greek words the first of which signifies sensation an account of the sensations which the human frame is liable to experience more particularly the painful or uneasy ones    nosology from two greek words the first of which signifies a malady disease or disorder an account of the several maladies diseases or disorders which the human frame is liable to experience    diætetics from a greek word which signifies habitual mode of life more particularly in respect of food and drink whence the english word diet—the knowledge of what appertains to diet—of the influence which as well in other respects as in respect of nourishment substances commonly taken into the stomach have on the state of the animal frame    materia medica two latin words which signify the matter of which medicines substances applied to the stomach or other parts of the body for the cure or prevention of disorders are composed    prophylactics from a greek word which signifies measures of precaution    therapeutics from a greek word which signifies to cure or endeavour to cure a disorder  0 surgery or mechanical therapeutics surgery from two greek words one of which signifies a hand the other operation mechanical therapeutics it may be called because in so far as in the endeavour to cure or relieve a disorder the hand of an operator is considered as being employed—the means employed belong to the mechanical in contradistinction to the chemical walk in the field of art and science    zoohygiantics or zohygiantics from two greek words one of which as above signifies an animal the other as above pertaining to the care of health—the arts of preserving and restoring health considered as applied to the inferior animals viz to such of them in the health of which man is on any account wont to take an interest branches of art and science—viz branches condivident or subservient—hygiantics thus applied has of course the same in quality and number as when applied to the human species as above applied to the inferior animals anatomy is in use to be styled comparative anatomy with equal propriety the term comparative might it is evident be applied to the eight other branches above enumerated for answering which it does however but in part the purpose of the above word zohygiantics the only word as yet in use is—the veterinary art whence the veterinary surgeon takes his name veterinary is from a latin word which signifies to carry of all the inferior animals in the health of which it may happen to man to take an interest the only ones to which this appellative applies are therefore the very few which come under the denomination of beasts of burthen by its literal analogy to the word veteran derived from the latin word which signifies old it has moreover the inconvenience of presenting some such idea as that of the old mans or old womans art more readily than the branch of art which it is employed to designate    phthisozoics from two greek words one of which signifies to destroy the other an animal as above—the art of destroying such of the inferior animals as in the character of natural enemies threaten destruction or damage—to himself or to such animals from which in the character of natural servants or allies it is in mans power to extract useful service—is an art not much less necessary than that of preserving and restoring to health those his natural friends animals which either immediately or mediately as above are regarded as noxious to man are commonly included under the general appellation of vermin the complete verminkiller is the title of an old established book    mathematics from a greek word which signifies learning in general so inapposite and uncharacteristic is the only word as yet employed for giving expression to this branch of art and science    geometry    arithmetic see stage i    algebra from an arabic word the signification of which seems not to be exactly known by geometry quantity is considered with    relation to form shape—or as on this occasion it is more common to say to figure—by arithmetic and algebra without relation to figure in so far as figure is out of the question number is the only form in which quantity is susceptible of diversification in so far as the number in question is represented by the appropriate characters called cyphers but more commonly figures the amount of it is thus in a direct way made known and arithmetic is the name employed in speaking of it in so far as it is no otherwise expressed than by means of some relation more or less complicated and disguised which it bears to some known number or numbers algebra is the name employed in speaking of it for giving expression to such numbers as are yet unknown—all numbers in so far as they are respectively expressed by one simple line of the appropriate characters being known—instead of figures other signs such as certain letters belonging to the alphabet and commonly taken from the close of it are employed this is for shortness thus instead of saying i e writing first unknown number the algebraist says x instead of second unknown number y and so for a third z and from time to time for further abbreviation other letters again taken from the commencement or some other anterior portion of the alphabet are commonly employed for addition subtraction multiplication division equality and certain other terms of arithmetic the shorter signs  — × ÷  c being also employed algebra is thus in respect of the signs employed in it a species of shorthand—of shorthand applied to the particular subject of quantity considered without reference to quality can it be then it will naturally be asked such wonders as have been performed by algebra—can it be that it is by mere abbreviation—by nothing but a particular species of shorthand—that they have been performed by the mere use of a set of signs or characters—by which the ideas in question are expressed in a less quantity of space and time than would have been necessary to the giving expression to them by the signs or characters of which ordinary written language is composed and by which those sounds are designated of which the ordinary spoken language is composed—newton leibnitz euler la place la grange c c—on this magnificent portion of the field of science have they been nothing more than so many expert shorthand writers answer—assuredly the system of abbreviated forms of expression is one thing—the purpose to which these modes of expression are employed is another and perfectly distinguishable thing the purpose to which in the instance in question this species of shorthand is applied comes in every instance within the description given above viz by means of their relation to certain quantities that are known the making known a certain quantity or certain quantities which in all other respects are as yet unknown but for making out this relation some contrivance in every instance—and in some instances abundance of very subtle contrivance—over and above the use of shorthand is or at any rate originally was necessary and from the shorthand itself the system composed of these contrivances is in itself no less distinct than any one of the species of discourse a speech for instance or the evidence of a witness which shorthand commonly so called is employed in giving expression to is distinct from the shorthand—the mode of writing—itself in that no of the appendix in which an exposition is given of some ulterior principles of instruction by means of which the characteristic principles of the new system may it is supposed be applied to mathematics—and that with as much facility and advantage as any with which they are or can be applied to reading arithmetic or grammar—this subject will be resumed in the meantime two observations may have their use   the first is that though the algebraic contrivances—the contrivances by which the algebraic shorthand is to the purpose in question made use of are perfectly distinct from the shorthand itself yet so prodigious is the facility which when the shorthand has once been learnt is afforded by it that what seems probable is—that had it not been for the shorthand a very small part of those algebraic contrivances which at present are in use would at this time if ever have been discovered compared with the words by which the same ideas are expressed in ordinary language the roman numerals are a species of shorthand compared with these roman numerals the arabian numerals now mostly substituted to them are a highlyimproved species of shorthand—a species by which alone independently of the algebraic shorthand much greater progress would probably have been made in mathematics than in the same quantity of time would have been made with no other instrument of abbreviation than that which is composed of the roman numerals   the other observation is that whether without the shorthand the contrivances would or would not have as yet been hit upon yet now that they have been hit upon being as above in the nature of the case so perfectly distinct from the shorthand there is nothing to prevent their being expressed without it—expressed by the words of which ordinary language is composed—no more than there is to prevent from being written down in words at length and so printed a mass of evidence which at a trial has been taken down in shorthand    and which but for the shorthand could not have been taken down unless a greater length of time had been allowed for the delivering of the evidence hence comes the practical conclusion viz that for the convenience of learners it would probably be of no small use if in ordinary language—language clear from those characters and formularies so appalling to every as yet uninitiated and more particularly to the uninitiated juvenile eye—explanations were given of the several contrivances in question or if in this way the explanation of the whole system pursued to the length to which it has already been carried would occupy too much space—at any rate of such points as by the joint considerations of facility and utility—facility in acquisition and utility in application—should be found recommended for preference  the use thus made of the word figure in two senses thus different and yet not so different as not to be liable to be confounded is an unfortunate circumstance but such is the state of the language  see appendix no viii    uranological geography uranological from uranology which is from two greek words one of which signifies the heavens the other as above an account—an account of the heavenly bodies—more commonly termed astronomy—astronomy from two greek words one of which signifies a star or planet the other arrangement or to arrange but in this field the space in which the bodies are considered as being in a state of motion or in a state of rest requires to be considered as well as the bodies which are considered as moving or resting in that space and as for the bodies it is not by him who is called an astronomer that the arrangement made of them has been made see stage i and see the next article    uranological chronology see stage i when that fixation of quantities which is not performable but by mathematical investigation is discarded or postponed a very small quantity of time will suffice for conveying a general yet sufficiently instructive intimation of what is ascertainable in relation to such parts of the contents of the universe as are in any way open to our observation but if this quantity small as it is be grudged it is only in virtue of its application to geography and chronology that uranology can present any very decided claim to admission into the chrestomathic course in stage i geography and chronology were considered in the most simple and obvious point of view and accordingly without reference to those relations between the earth and the other celestial bodies principally our sun and moon on which the facts belonging to these branches of science are so essentially dependent in regard to uranological geography and uranological chronology—the practical uses to which these two branches of uranology are applied being different—distinct names are accordingly required for giving expression to them but considered as subjects of instruction the consideration of them is inseparable to uranological geography more particularly belongs the division made of space on the earths surface viz the division into climates and degrees of latitude and longitude and the influence exercised by the moon on the tides i e on the motions of such parts of the earths surface as are in a liquid state perhaps also in the winds i e on the motions of such parts as are in a gaseous state to uranological chronology more particularly belong the divisions made of time viz the natural divisions into periods cycles solar years months lunar years and days together with the ulterior factitious and arbitrary but not the less necessary divisions into hours minutes and seconds place and time being considered together and with reference to each other the heavenly bodies employed as they are in the measurement of both these quantities serve for the indication and guidance of the course of a ship at sea and thus they are as it were taken up and in conjunction with the magnetic needle employed as instruments in the hands of the navigator on this occasion by means of our organs of sight light becomes a sort of instrument of communication and thence of measurement between this our planet and other component parts of the material universe and not only between those comparatively near orbs on which the motions of our own have a perceptible dependence and correspondent reciprocal influence but between our own and others such as the moons called satellites of jupiter the star called the polar star and the other stars which for the purpose of distinguishing them from planets are called fixed stars—the motions of which have for their place a field separated from that of our own planet by distances more and more extensive till at last they stretch to such a pitch as to bid defiance to all calculation—the motions—for it appears not that even the stars called fixt are exempt from that law of universal gravitation of which perpetual as well as universal motion is the necessary consequence the short time necessary to a general acquaintance with uranology would not be altogether uselessly employed—would not be unchrestomathically employed—had it no other use than that of preserving the mind against the alarming and predatory delusions set to work by the species of impostor called an astrologer  under the title of sibleys astrology a work has been seen containing no fewer than four thick  to volumes of very recent date a work of such expense could never have been published but under the assurance of a considerable number of purchasers all of whom must necessarily have been found in the most opulent and extensively educated classes    technology from two greek words the first of which signifies an art in the list of separately administered branches of instruction this article may serve to close the last stage on this occasion as far as time will    admit a connected view is proposed to be given of the operations by which arts and manufactures are carried on the more general information obtained in stages ii and iii in relation to mechanics and chemistry and some of their dependencies will thus be extended farther on in the region of particulars on this occasion will be to be shown and exemplified the advantages of which in respect of despatch and perfection the principle of the division of labour is productive here will be shown how by the help of this most efficient principle as art and science are continually making advances at the expense of ordinary practice and ordinary knowledge so manufacture if by this term may be distinctively designated art carried on with the help of the division of labour and thence upon a large scale is continually extending its conquests in the field of simple handicraft art—art carried on without the benefit of that newly found assistance to reduce the apparent infinitude of the subject within a comprehensible compass it will be necessary under the direction of the logician to apply the tactics the art of arrangement of the naturalist to the contents of the field of the technologist to bring together and class the several sorts of tools and other implements—and that in such a manner as to show how they agree with and differ from each other in its character of a school of technology the chrestomathic school though not a place would thus be a source of general communication—a channel through which the several sorts of artists might receive from one another instruction in relation to points of practice at present peculiar to each the carpenter the joiner the cabinetmaker the turner in wood the shipbuilder c the whitesmith the blacksmith the metalfounder the printer the engraver the mathematical instrument maker c the tailor the shoemaker the collarmaker the saddler c the distiller the brewer the sugarbaker the breadbaker c of all these several artists the respective tools and other implements—together with the operations performed by means of them—will thus be to be confronted together and a comparative and comprehensive view will thus be to be given of their points of resemblance and difference not to speak of the mutual information capable of being by this means derived from one another by the artists themselves to the scholars the effect will be that enlivening consciousness of mental vigour and independent power which is the fruit of learning in general reaped from the soil of a highly cultivated mind as in virtue of the grammatical exercises in the language in which the instruction is delivered there will be no hard names so in virtue of the exercises of which the field of artandscience learning including this appendage to it is the subject—in the whole field of useful instruction—there will be no dark spots so far as concerns the middling classes the more extensive the view thus obtained by the scholar of the field of technology the more usefully and to the bent natural or adventitious of his taste and inclination the more favourably consideration had at the same time of his family circumstances and connexions will he thus find the field of his livelihood enlarged  0 bookkeeping at large the commercial process or operation on the subject of which under the name of bookkeeping works in such multitude have been published is but a branch a particular application of an art of the most extensive range and proportionable importance viz the art of bookkeeping at large the art of registration of recordation the art of securing and perpetuating evidence see table ii principles class iii correct complete clear concise easy to consult in case of error so framed as not to cover it but to afford indication of it appropriate i e adapted to the particular practical purpose it has in view the purpose for the sake of which the labour thus bestowed is expended—in these epithets may be seen the qualities desirable in a system of this kind the new system of instruction at any rate the original inventors edition of it presents to view a perfect specimen of the practice of this art as applied to those inferior branches of instruction which it has already taken in hand in the chrestomathic school the principle thereby indicated will of course be pursued but proportioned to the superior extent of the field assumed by it will necessarily be the extent and variety of the application made of it in the practice of this most universally useful art all those scholars who from the lowest up to the highest stages in the character of teachers private tutors or monitors bear any part in the management of the school will gradually be initiated and insensibly perfected and in proportion as any scholar appears qualified to take any such part in it it will be the duty and care of the master to put the means of so doing into his hands as by the undermentioned abbé gaultier the principles of the art of abridgmentmaking and thence of notetaking have been exhibited in a general point of view so between this time and the time at which the chrestomathic population has reached its last and highest stage no doubt but that some apt person will be found to perform the correspondent good office in favour of the art of registration or bookkeeping at large    commercial bookkeeping commonly called without addition bookkeeping as well in the form of money as in that of moneys worth the chrestomathic school will at all times have its receipts its expenditure and its stock in hand in its system of bookkeeping at large it will therefore in so far comprise and possess a system of commercial bookkeeping but to the scholars when they  0 go abroad in the world it will not suffice that they are initiated in the particular system of bookkeeping in use in that establishment to such of them at least as hereafter betake themselves to any commercial occupation it will be matter of advantage not to say of necessity to be no less perfectly acquainted with whatsoever system is in use in other establishments and especially in those of which commercial profit is the object or end in view the italian method or method of double entry is the name given to that system of bookkeeping which is commonly employed in establishments of superior importance unfortunately oldestablished as it is the obscurity of this method is still more conspicuous than its utility and in consequence generation instead of correction of error is but too frequent a result this obscurity has for its sole cause the fictitiousness and thence the inexpressiveness or rather the misexpressiveness of the language the fiction has place in two principal instances   in the employing the word designative of debt in cases in which no such transaction really has had place   in the ascribing to objects incapable of contracting this or any other obligation—such as the several articles of which the mass of commercial stock is composed—the capacity and act of contracting that same legal obligation   moreover in direct opposition to an incontestable principle of evidence the original recordbook the basis of all the other books is branded with a note of worthlessness under the name of the wastebook meantime for the several events and states of things to which these fictitious denominations are allotted it cannot be but that other denominations clear of fiction and in a direct way and to the apprehension of mankind in general expressive of the objects requiring to be designated—are to be found and by any such universally apt expressions so many expositions and explanations will be given of the correspondent fictitious and unapt ones in this design a little work on this universally useful branch of logic was long ago planned and is at present in preparation  some farther remarks on this subject will be found in vol v p     et seq    notetaking i e taking notes or memorandums of the purport of any discourse whether delivered from book or without book for example as here for the purpose of instruction and in the case of exhibitions with or without memorandums taken of the appearances presented by the objects exhibited the time during which these notes are taking being no other than the time during which the discourse is delivering and the object exhibiting including any such pauses as may happen to take place the consequence is that with relation to the original from whence they are taken any such notes can scarcely have place in any other form than that of an abridgment and that an abridgment made extempore upon the spur of the occasion with very little time employable in the process of consideration on this occasion use will naturally be made of a masterly little work on this subject published in english by the abbé gaultier    schoolroom insufficient viz space in the school itself in most instances dancing riding fencing for example the objection is obviously an insuperable one in that of the military exercise so would it be so far as concerns the particular portion of covered space in question but suppose a proper spot obtainable in the near neighbourhood this objection at any rate vanishes    admission pregnant with exclusion i e the branch of instruction in question such that by admission given to it exclusion would unavoidably be put upon others viz upon some one or more or all of them thus if instruction in music were admitted the noise would be such that while it was going on the requisite degree of attention could not be paid to any other so if instruction in relation to controverted points of divinity were admitted whatsoever were the tenets taught a parent to whose notions those tenets were to a certain degree repugnant would not send his child to a school which numbered among its objects and its promises the impregnating with those tenets the minds of its scholars the considerations by which in the proposed course of instruction nothing that regards religion is intended to be comprised are extremely simple and it is hoped will receive the approbation of all parties     necessity of the course thus taken     needlessness of the opposite course     innoxiousness of the course thus taken any one of these considerations might have sufficed to justify it and all of them it is believed will be found to have place   necessity of the course thus taken for the purpose of this first experiment on which so much depends it has been and is the anxious desire of the managers to have    the greatest number of children possible to try it upon and that in the course of the whole length of time during which a continuance of the necessary exertion on the part of all the several numbers could reasonably be expected the cheapness of the terms on which scholars can in the bell and lancasterian systems receive instruction the cheapness of the terms and consequently the number of the persons to whom the proposed benefit can be imparted depends on the number capable of being instructed under one system of management and one headmaster in regard to the proposed mass of instruction it has been matter of consideration to the managers not only to what ages it was capable of being applied but moreover at how small a rate of expense and consequently to how large a proportion of the whole population it was capable of being administered to this end it was that the extent to be endeavoured to be given to the numbers proposed to be provided for in the first instance was that which has been regarded as the greatest for which in such a case the inspecting eye of one and the same general master could be made to suffice to have put an exclusion upon any description of children whose parents are able and willing to send them to the proposed chrestomathic school on the ground of religion would have deprived the managers of an indefinitely extensive number of children on whom to try their first experiment a number on which their wishes had fixed with a much stronger degree of intensity than their expectations   needlessness of the opposite course when under the auspices of the national society for the instruction of children in the inferior and most necessary branches of learning a determination was taken to comprise in the plan of their schools the christian religion in general and the church of england form of it in particular it could not but have been under the apprehension—nor that apprehension by any means an illgrounded one—that to no inconsiderable proportion of the number of children so taught if in those schools religion in that established form were not to be taught the consequence would be that neither in that form nor in any other religion would have been taught to them or learnt by them at all but in the present case that is in the case of the class of persons in whom in addition to the desire of having instruction administered to their children on so extensive a field shall be added a degree of pecuniary sufficiency adequate to the quantum of schoolmoney the four guineas or the two guineas proposed to be required no such apprehensions could assuredly have place by the omission in question at any rate no reasonable ground seems to present itself for apprehending that the number of scholars sent to the proposed school will in any degree be lessened by the very supposition it could not in the case of those parents if any such there be to whom in the character of a subject of instruction religion is a matter of indifference but in the case of those to whom it is not a matter of indifference what objection can it form to the proposed plan—that out of the twenty hours six are employed in subjects other than that of religion so long as there remains the number of eighteen hours during any part of which by themselves or by their own chosen substitutes religion in whatsoever form is most comformable to their respective consciences may be administered on this subject a consideration highly material and which cannot too carefully be kept in mind is that the proposed school is not a boardingschool—it is a mere dayschool and nothing more were it a boardingschool except during the comparatively short portions of time occupied by vacations the scholars would stand precluded from receiving instruction on this head from any other source and subject only to that exception the effect of any arrangement by which the subject of religion was excluded from the list of subjects taught in the school would be to exclude it altogether down to the time of his departure from the scholars mind the music master the dancing master the writing master the lecturer on natural philosophy the lecturer on chemistry the french master the italian master no one of all these different sorts of instructors ever includes or is expected to include religion in his course if in the instruction administered by the schoolmaster by whom the dead languages or one of them are taught religion is now comprised it is either because the school kept is a boardingschool as in the case of the great public schools having a set of boardingschools attached to them or because it has happened to the schoolmaster to belong to that particular profession from which such instruction cannot but be expected or from some other such irrelevant and accidental cause   innoxiousness of the omission notwithstanding all that has been said on this subject one ground of possible apprehension and hence of objection remains it must be acknowledged as vet unanswered good says the father or the guardian true it is during threefourths of the childs time eighteen hours out of every twentyfour you leave me at liberty to administer to him on this most important of all subjects instruction in what shape soever i think best so far all is well but of the remaining fourth part the space of six hours during which you are in possession of him the whole time is to be employed in instruction and the few casual moments during which alone my unavoidable avocations will admit of my administering instruction or causing it to be administered to him what will they avail if so it should be that of those six hours any part should under your management be employed in the administering of instruction repugnant to religion in general    or to that form of it which in my eyes is the best not to say the only good one in answer to an observation of the reasonableness of which they are fully sensible the reply of the managers which the writer of these pages is authorised to make will it is hoped be seen to be as full and felt to be as satisfactory as it is short under their management no instruction that is repugnant or disrespectful to religion in general to the christian religion in particular or to any one form of it shall ever be administered parents and guardians the persons to whom this answer is immediately addressed are not it is true as the proposed managers cannot fail to perceive the persons on whom the success of the plan depends in the first instance and to whom in consequence this proposal is most immediately addressed but for the most part the answer be it what it may which is of a nature calculated to afford satisfaction to those whose interest in the matter is so much greater than any that can be possessed by any one else will it is hoped be in general found no less satisfactory to those whose interest is of inferior magnitude and in particular to all such persons as on other grounds would feel disposed to contribute their assistance nay but says somebody it is not in the remissness of parents and guardians—i am sorry to say the too general remissness of parents and guardians—it is not in their indifference to this most important of all subjects—it is not in the indifference of other people that i can find any sufficient warrant for the like indifference on my part on the contrary the more extensive not to say general this indifference the more strongly is it incumbent on me and on all others who join with me in worshipping god in that perfect form in which i worship to do what depends on us towards making up for that deficiency if then to the instruction which you administer on other subjects you will add instruction on this which is of more importance than all the others put together and that in the particular form which for no other reason than because it is the best i hold to be the best there is so much of my money for you otherwise none in a discourse to some such effect as the above there is nothing but what every person engaging in an undertaking such as that in question ought to be fully prepared to expect in the eyes of a class of persons nor that an inconsiderable one which always has existed nor will ever cease to exist religion not only in the church of england form but in every form is seen hanging on a thread—a thread which by the blast of this or that speech or by the flutter of this or that pamphlet is in continual danger of being cut while without the support of their arm the power of the almighty is in continual danger of being overborne his intentions defeated his promises violated to those to whom the promises of their god afford not any sufficient assurance it were not to be expected that any firmer assurance should be afforded by any human promises in answer to such apprehensions in as far as they may be capable of receiving one no better remedy presents itself than would be afforded by that great institution the national institution by which so much and so much good has already been accomplished if in aid of the first great cause second causes must still be looked to there may be seen a second cause of the most potent character and to the contemplation of which the anxious persons in question cannot consistently or naturally be averse a second cause of which to the very purpose of calming these very anxieties the power has so recently and so efficiently been applied as to the present humble attempt why not then let it take its course why not even contribute to enable it to take its chance if in other respects being useful it be in respect of religion innocuous it may claim at any rate the same sort and degree of indulgence and even countenance as that which has been recently bestowed upon a superior mode of raising mushrooms and if contrary to the solemn and thus publicly announced and disseminated engagement—if the proposed managers prove prejudicial to the best interests of mankind on the subject of religion there stands that society to which neither consistently with situation can the will nor consistently with experience the power be wanting—the power to reduce to thin air all danger from such a source in their hands are all the springs of human action all the sources of reward or punishment let them but speak the word and an hypsopromathic national school will raise itself aloft and the chrestomathic should it even by the humble endeavours of the proposed managers have been completely filled will find itself much more speedily emptied in the very nature of the case the little finger of the national society will at all times be heavier than the arm of the chrestomathic and on the side on which the superiority of the weight of metal is so vast and so undisputable could any possibility of failure be conceived how prodigious must be either on the one hand the indefensibleness of the cause or on the other hand on the part of all but the supposed vanquished the perversity of mankind with or without sharing in such apprehensions real or pretended as the above there will be found another class of persons and that a very numerous one who in the success of such an institution cannot but view an injury more or less serious to their own particular interests for on the part of every person whose wellbeing in any shape or degree depends upon the continuance of any inferior mode of instruction not to speak    of governmental legislative administrative judicative opposition opposition to every endeavour to substitute to it a superior one ought on every occasion to be expected as a matter of course as a particular interest standing upon the face of it in opposition to a more extensive interest would not to those who are actuated by it present any very promising chance of being adopted by any persons who without being themselves in the particular interest should feel themselves standing in the general one some other consideration than the really actuating one will therefore in this case be looked out for and when will any one be found so plausible or so likely to be impressive as the apprehension just above mentioned it is not for ourselves it is not for any such ever miserable sinners and ever unprofitable servants that we are and ought to be afraid god and his cause—it is for that that we are afraid tie up tight then your pursestrings and lest by false however fair pretences you should ever for any such dangerous purposes be tempted to untie them against all such pretences keep your eyes steadily averted and your ears as inexorably closed deficiency of means is commonly one of the last causes which a man is disposed seriously to oppose to a demand which in other respects would not be unwelcome in this as in any other case a more honourable excuse cannot be found than that which is presented by conscience and where the will though real is not accompanied with the means to subject the plea to a rigorous scrutiny would be adding hardship to hardship without use if therefore in the above suggestion any unwilling refuser should find an excuse in serviceable condition ready made to his hands the labour expended in the putting it in order will not be without its use    time of life too early supposing that in the instance of the branch of instruction in question this objection could not if considered as applied to the time of admission be other than a peremptory one it would not follow but that before the close of the aggregate course it may have altogether ceased    utility not sufficiently general in the character of a ground of omission this objection can scarcely be admitted to hold good except in so far as admission would have for its effect the putting an exclusion either altogether or in part upon some other branch of which the utility is more extensive for at any rate the

of which is capable of being proved by the practice of some correspondent art in this latter case the fact viz of his understanding the meaning of the words by which the instruction in question relative to the science was expressed is capable of being proved in some degree by his performing some organical operation by the performance of which the correspondent art is practised thus in so far as his pronunciation is correct he affords a proof that the instructions which have been conveyed to him on the subject of the art of speaking are in so far not only remembered by him but understood

improved by j poole ma      p     the barrington school london      p     in this school the number of the scholars has usually been between five hundred and six hundred the school is divided into five classes each class occupies a separate room the head class which is the most numerous is under the immediate charge of the head master styled rector to each of the others there is a separate

contents of the sections see the general contents of chrestomathia at the commencement  single denomination for both these purposes the thing to be wished for is—that in so far as possible the denomination should be comprised in the compass of a single word viz of course a noun substantive and this not merely for shortness but to avoid the embarrassment which has place in so far as the appellation is a compound one composed of two words or more if in addition to the noun substantive there be but one other that other will be a noun adjective and by this means the denomination will be disabled from receiving without inconvenience any other adjunct the place of the adjunct being already occupied by the adjective which is one of the elements of the compound denomination thus composed if it be composed of more than two the inconvenience will be still greater for in this case all the words which enter into the composition of this longwinded substitute to a single substantive will in the texture of any sentence of which that substantive would have constituted but one component part be liable to be confounded with its other component words in such sort that in relation to each of them it will be matter of difficulty—momentary difficulty at any rate—to determine to which parcel of words it bears grammatical relation viz the sentence at large in which the appellation had it been a singleworded one would have officiated in the character of a substantive or the fragment of a sentence composed of the words of this compound substitute to a proper substantive such are the circumstances by which to all purposes and on all occasions this simplicity—this singlewordedness—is rendered desirable but it is only on the occasion of ordinary discourse that as will soon be seen the nature of the case admits of it in the case of a systematic table for the denomination of each branch two words at least will be found requisite one to mark the genus to which the species in question belongs the other to give intimation of the characters by which it stands distinguished from the other species of that same genus in what way it is that as the number of subdivisions increases the manyworded systematic name grows longer and longer more and more complicated—and an equipollent singleworded name more and more difficult to frame—may be seen in the sample of an

presented this image of a field will moreover be with equal convenience applicable to two expanses—two perfectly distinguishable though intimately connected expanses one within the other—the one of them boundless and so therefore the other viz the field of action and thought and the field of art and science in the pursuance of this necessary fiction for all language which has mind for its subject is unavoidably fictitious speaking of mind as if it were matter on the occasion of the use made of this necessarily fictitious image there will be found a convenience in speaking sometimes of the ideal receptacle the field as if it were a real one sometimes of the objects in question viz the several branches of art and science in the character of its contents by the word field this

abstractive faculty such compounds are formed as are new ie were never produced before invention is imagination directed in its exercise to the attainment of some particular end   attention or the attentive faculty the exercise of this faculty seems to be the result of an exercise of the will of a special application made of the power of that faculty to the purpose of attaching to their work with different degrees of force and for different lengths of time any one or more of the several distinguishable faculties abovementioned  0 observation—in this are included perception memory judgment and commonly ratiocination set and kept to work by attention and directed commonly in their exercise to the accomplishment of some particular end    comparison this is an application made of the faculties of attention and judgment in this case the attention applies itself alternately to the objects which are the subjects of it—viz for the purpose of descrying their mutual relations to each other    generalization this is a mode of imagination i e from the observation of one or more individuals perceived or supposed to be endued with a certain property imagination of an indefinite number of individuals regarded as being possessed each of them of a property of that same sort it is combination performed by the imagination and guided by observation of analogy i e similitude    induction i e deduction or say ratiocination applied as a result of the process of generalization as above followed by a judgment accordingly passed pronouncing that the sort of conformity so imagined has in the instances in question been realized    analysis—i e division literally resolution—viz logical or say noological analysis this is the converse of generalization and supposes that operation antecedently performed by the combination made of the ideas of a multitude of individuals or sorts of individuals in virtue of some property which is supposed to belong to them in common and which is thus made to serve as a bond of ideal union by which they are bound together into one aggregate and that aggregate recorded and fixed by one common name—generalization is performed by the division and subdivision of an aggregate thus found correspondent names whether singleworded or manyworded being either formed or made for the several parts which are the results of the several acts of division and subdivision—analysis i e the resolutive division and decomposition of the antecedently formed artificial aggregate is performed thus on the porphyrian tree as in the annexed table working in the direction of generalization and setting out either from homo or brutum or from a subspecies or an individual of either species you may arrive immediately or through sensitivum vivens and corpus all or any of them at least at substantia working in the direction of synthesis the course you take is exactly the reverse by imagination the idea and practice of logical noological metaphysical analysis was deduced from that of physical physical is either mechanical of chemical physical analysis is an instance of a real and material operation logical of an immaterial and thus in some sort a fictitious one of the same name a term which will be apt to be considered as not only the opposite but exactly coextensive correlative of analysis is the abovementioned term synthesis—synthesis literally putting together analysis literally resolution i e putting asunder if the coincidence were thus complete synthesis and generalization would be exactly synonymous and ought to be interconvertibly employed this however is not the case of any number of ideas how heterogeneous soever the putting together may be termed synthesis but in so far as the term analysis is applied the ideas comprehended in the subject in which the operation is to be performed are by the supposition homogeneous the subject analysed is an aggregate or genus which is divided into species those into subspecies and so on the only case in which synthesis is exactly opposite and correspondent to and no more than coextensive with analysis is when between the ideas put together there is that sort of conformity from which the act of putting them together receives the name of generalization analysis and synthesis—analytic method and synthetic method—are locutions which are but too frequently to be found employed on occasions in which the import meant to be attached to them is far from being clear and determinate the same operation which by one person is called by one of these names shall by another person be called by the other by giving to every supposed explanation the name of an analysis condillac in his logic thinks he has explained everything and thus it is that he explains nothing analysis he says is nothing but a language wellmade he sees not that it is of an act of synthesis the declared object of his antipathy that every name which is not in the grammatical sense a proper name is the sign and the result and that were it not for that despised and much vituperated agent his favourite and exclusively lauded instrument would not have a subject on which to operate    methodization or say arrangement or the exercise of what if a faculty is to be imagined for the purpose may be called the tactic faculty it may be employed with little or no exception in the service of every one of the abovenamed faculties in the exercise of which the attention is employed by it for giving facility to comparison objects are imagined to lie in a certain order for example above below or by the side of one another    distribution in effect this is generally speaking much the same sort of operation as division but for presenting that effect to view a somewhat different image is employed in the case where the word employed is division whatsoever may be the parts or elementary articles contained in the subject they are considered as antecedently aggregated into one whole whereupon in proportion as the operation proceeds that whole is divided into parts in the case where the word employed is distribution whatsoever may be the subject on which the operation is to be performed the parts or component articles whatsoever they may be which are considered as belonging to it are considered as lying in a state of separation from each other when a multitude of articles being considered as coexisting no aggregation of them is considered as having been made no divisum can be considered as being capable of being made consequently in this case distribution is the only one of the two instruments of method that the nature of the case can be considered as admitting of    communication or the communicative faculty a faculty which may have for its subject the results or products of the exercise of any one or more of the several faculties abovementioned—speaking writing—and pantomime i e discourse by gestures or otherwise by deportment—are so many modes in and by which it is exercised communication on the one part supposes receipt or say reception on the other in so far as to the exercise of the act of reception attention on the part of the receivre is considered as necessary—the receiver is styled a learner for correctness—viz as a test of and security for that quality—for correctness as well as clearness this test would require a correspondent list of examples but for any such additional quantity of matter neither time nor place can here be afforded in its present form it must therefore be left to stand in its present form and with all its imperfections an intricate subject of discussion would be—the order in which the several articles might be most advantageously disposed and made to follow one another what shall be the principle of arrangement shall it be priority but from this source no decision can be deduced as between a number of operations which are performed at the same time—shall it be degree of simplicity—from this source some light seems to be reflected on the first steps but when multitudes flock together with equal forwardness this light is extinguished the authors opinions on these subjects will be found more at length in the works on logic and its cognate branches of knowledge immediately following the chrestomathia—ed  la physique particulière doit suivre la meme distribution que lhistoire naturelle p     † de lhistoire prise par

table there is the following note—the completion of this table as it now stands having been posterior by about a twelvemonth to the printing of the letterpress of chrestomathia appendix no iv to which it belongs in the interval some few changes having presented themselves in the character of amendments they are here inserted but of these alterations one consequence has of course been a correspondent diversity between the nomenclature employed in the body of the work and the nomenclature employed in this table in further explanation it is said a convenience had in the interval been found in giving to the termination scopic regarding a more extensive application than in the first instance had been given to it to have in this edition substituted the nomenclature of the table for that which it supersedes in the body of the essay would have occasioned the sacrifice of much valuable matter attached in the way of commentary and incidental remark to the superseded words it has however been thought advisable for the purpose of facilitating reference from the essay to the table to insert in brackets the word made use of in the latter whenever it differs from that employed in the former and to append in notes the explanation given to each word in the note to the table here quoted—ed † eudæmonics from a greek word which signifies happiness originally attended by a good genius for reasons already given see §   and according to the usage which with great advantage has place as abovementioned in regard to newly devised scientific names the following ones are mostly taken from the greek explanations of them in english are subjoined and that for two reasons one is that among the persons to whom speculations of this kind may be not unacceptable there may be many to whom the greek language is not sufficiently familiar to render the denominations in question in every instance readily intelligible to them even supposing those denominations constructed with perfect propriety the other is that the words will probably not be in every instance so well adapted to the giving expression to the intended meaning as with the help of a less imperfect acquaintance with the language they might have been made the quantity or degree of wellbeing experienced during any given length of time is directly as the magnitude i e the intensity multiplied by the duration of the sum of the pleasures and inversely as the magnitude of the sum of the pains experienced during that same length of time in so far as the sum of the pleasures of all kinds experienced by the person in question during the length of time in question is regarded as considerable—the sum of the pains of all kinds experienced by him during that same length of time being moreover laid out of the account—the state which in that respect he is regarded as being in is termed a state of happiness in so far as the sum of the pain of all kinds experienced by the person in question during the length of time in question is regarded as considerable the sum of the pleasures of all kinds experienced by him during that same length of time being moreover laid out of the account the state which in this respect he is regarded as being in is termed a state of unhappinessa a any person to whom this account of happiness fails of being satisfactory may find a very different one given by james harris in that one of his three treatises published together in one octavo volume which takes happiness for its subject and its title but from no part of which would any person suppose that any such dark spot as that of unhappiness is anywhere to be found  the summum bonum is a fruit of the tree of pure good upon the taking of which into his mouth a man experiences at one and the same time every pleasure of which in the nature of a sensitive being he is susceptible each in the highest degree pains of all sorts at the same time keeping aloof so long as this precious fruit remains in any part of the primæ viæ it is the kernel of that fruit of which the philosophers stone is the shell it was lately found by baron munchausen in the island of medemusia after a careful search made in pursuance of the directions given by aristotle plato and cicero in whose philosophical repasts—as in the codes of those universally admired masters of ethical science anybody may see—it formed a constant article by cicero in his tusculan questions it has been made plain to the perfect satisfaction of his auditor a most perfectly wellbred young gentleman whom he introduces to us by that name that pain is no evil but the truth is as the philosopher confessed to the baron that during the whole of this dialogue they were both of them chewing the summum bonum nut to which the areca even when wrapped up in the betel leaf forms a very inadequate substitute the consequence was—that all that time to the philosopher and his agreeable young friend pain was no evil whatsoever it may have been and be about to be to the vulgar of that and other ages † ontology from two greek words—one of which signifies being in general the other an account—an account of being in general ‡ coenoscopic from two greek words one of which signifies common—things belonging to others in common the other looking to by coenoscopic ontology then is designated that part of the science which takes for its subject those properties which are considered as possessed in common by all the individuals belonging to the class which the name ontology is employed to designate i e by all beings in the word coenobite—less properly spelt cenobite—the first of these words has already a footing in the language in the words microscope microscopic—telescope telescopic—and several others designative of philosophical instruments—the termination—scopic is become perfectly familiar the termination scopic in what cases shall it be employed in the formation of the appellative—on the one hand in many instances it is either indispensably necessary or at least highly conducive to the intelligibility of the word on the other hand in every instance it adds to its length and in some instances would probably be found to render it too unwieldy for use cases in which it will it is supposed be found indispensably necessary to complete the intended signification are as follows viz   mesoscopic as applied to eudæmonics   morphoscopic as applied to posology   abioscopic as applied to physiurgic somatics   embioscopic as applied to physiurgic somatics   pathematoscopic as applied to pneumatology or pneumatics   thelematoscopic as applied to pneumatology or pneumatics   esoscopic and   exoscopic as applied to ethics—for the etymology and explanation of all which see the ensuing pages cases in which it may be dispensed with whether as being altogether unnecessary or as being less indispensably necessary are those in which the import intended to be conveyed by it may without difficulty or with little difficulty be understood to be expressed by the more customary terminations—logy and logical or the still shorter though less expressive termination ics instances of terminations already in use are   physics   mechanics   pneumatics   mathematics   statistics   ethics   politics—and various others in logic the final s has for this long time been omitted § idioscopic from two greek words the first of which signifies peculiar in idioscopic ontology then we have that branch of art and science which takes for its subject such properties as are considered as peculiar to different classes of beings some appertaining to one such class others to another in the words idiom idiomatical idiosyncrasy and a few others though none of them in any very common use—this word has already a footing in the language a footing better known in some instances than in others coenosyncratocoscopic and idiosyncratocoscopic might be somewhat more expressive but would be too longwinded coenosyncratic and idiosyncratic would scarcely be equally expressive—syncratic from syncrasis i e commixture composition constitution  somatology from two greek words the first of which signifies body matter or corporeal substance † pneumatology from two greek words the first of which ατευμα signifies spirit i e incorporeal substance in the sense in which it is used as synonymous to mind in their original sense the latin as well as the greek word corresponding to the english word breath in the new testament αγιον ανευμα is the name employed in the original in designating the object for the designation of which in the english version the compound appellative holy spirit is employed more frequently according to a phrase which when on other occasions applied to other objects is either obsolete or expressive of a different class of beings or supposed beings holy ghost in this sense pneumatology and pneumatics as well as psychology are already in use though more upon the continent than in britain if on this occasion and in this sense the word pneumatics were employed it would need to cease being employed in the sense in which it is at present wont to be employed viz that in which it designates the branch of art and science which has for its subject bodies in general considered as being in the state which since chemistry has become a science has been termed the gaseous state in the table the alternative word pneumatics is not employed in the original edition the following explanation of the omission is given accompanied by a statement that the table was completed subsequently to these notes to pneumatology pneumatics could not here be added as somatics is to somatology—why—because pneumatics is at present much more commonly used in an acceptation comparatively limited an acceptation appertaining partly to mechanics partly to chemistry both of them branches appertaining to somatology or say somatics—the condivident branch correspondent and opposite to that for the designation of which the word pneumatology is here employed—see p    note  by the name of materialists stand distinguished a set of philosophers of whom priestley was one according to whom there exists not any such created being as a mind distinct from matter for that that which is called mind is but an assemblage or collection of the sort of fictitious entities called properties with which certain species of matter are endowed one of the grossest imperfections that could be chargeable upon any encyclopedical system would be found to attach upon it if by the unnecessary assumption of any proposition which by any class of men were regarded as false the effect of it were to render itself so far i e with reference to that class of men unfit for use to the use of this class of philosophers this division may be sufficiently accommodated by a very slight change of phrase as thus—to pneumatology belongs the consideration of such bodies or portions of matter as are endowed with the aggregate mass of properties collectively styled mind considered in relation to those same peculiar properties ‡ or on this occasion—as on every other on which certainty is an object—an imperfection attached to the english language presents a very distressing impediment it consists in the ambiguity inherent in the import of the conjunction or inserted between two words—nounsubstantives suppose—it is employed with equal frequency and without any the least discrimination for two purposes altogether different and is thus continually liable to give rise either to interminable uncertainty or to any the most delusive and most mischievous misconceptions the one is—that of giving to understand that what is meant to be said of the thing signified by the one is not meant to be said of the thing signified by the other the other that they are but two words for one and the same thing not to speak of a third case in which the option is meant to be given between two things for the designation of which the two words are employed in other words it is employed in either of the two so widely different senses distinguished by the grammarians of classical antiquity and after them by harris in his hermes by the two adjuncts disjunctive and subdisjunctive disjunctive when the two words are meant to be exhibited in the character of names of two different things subdisjunctive when they are meant to be represented as different names of one and the same thing a more frequently occurring or a more frequently pernicious imperfection will not easily be found in any language from this great blemish the greek language as observed by harris is altogether free it has one word for the disjunctive sense and another for the subdisjunctive even the french language either is already exempt from this imperfection or at any rate with comparatively little difficulty might be rendered free from it ou or ou bien it is believed is the diction or at any rate a diction employed where the purpose is to present to view the disjunctive sense employed it assuredly is in this sense and it is believed seldom if ever employed in the other while when put between two substantives soit is indubitably employed in the subdisjunctive sense and seldom if ever it is believed in the disjunctive in english if or being confined to the disjunctive or say were the diction employed and that exclusively where the sense meant to be presented is the subdisjunctive—a blemish so incompatible with certainty and clearness of conception might thus be removed but supposing the improvement were ever so desirable how the introduction of it could be effected seems not very easy to conceive the inconvenience of departure from habit is an inconvenience which in such a case would be felt by every body by every body as well in the capacity of speaker or writer as in that of hearer or reader the uneasiness produced by a violation of the law of custom in matters of discourse is an inconvenience to which everybody without exception is more or less sensible want of precision—want of certainty—is an inconvenience to which though in many cases so much more serious than the other is in any case few indeed are sensible for this same purpose—viz designation of the subdisjunctive sense the latin word alias—a word already applied to this same purpose—would serve full as well were it not for the displeasing idea attached to it by the use made of it on the occasions on which it is employed in speaking of this or that man of bad character who to elude justice has at different times assumed different names for conveying to the eye the import in question the wellknown letters i e might in some measure be made to serve but id est of which they exhibit the abbreviation is crude latin and the correspondent english phrase would be felt to be insufferably long § from a greek word which signifies a butterfly and probably from thence the soul of man  posology from two greek

particular in the english been long in use by having been confined in its application to the designation of medical practitioners—and among medical practitioners to those who are considered as making experiments on the bodies of patients without taking for the ground of such their practice any sufficient stock of scientific information—thus it has happened that the word empiric how proper soever in its original acceptation is in any other than that dyslogistic i e condemnatory one—and in particular in the one here in question—become unfit for use hence came the necessity of having recourse as

carried on further to an indefinite length but on the present occasion in consideration partly of the quantity of labour which in case of any such formal continuation would on the part of the author have been necessary partly of the largeness of the draughts which it would have been necessary to make on the patience of the reader—at this point it has been deemed most advisable to stop beyond this point it seems as yet matter of uncertainty whether it would be worth while to persevere in proceeding on the exhaustive principle of these two branches aplopathematic pathology as being in the systematic sketch with its accompanying table that to which the precedence was found necessary to be allotted is that which in respect of its nearer vicinity and more obvious relation to the common end a convenience may be seen in bringing to view on the present occasion in the first instance under aplopathematic pathology the source of ramification will be the nature of the end to which the several branches of art and science issuing from it will respectively and successively be directed under technology it will be the nature of the means employed for the attainment of that end proceeding from the consideration of the nature of the end the first division might be into odynothetic and hedonosceuastic or say hedonistic—painrepelling and pleasureproducing widely distant as pain and pleasure are from one another in their extreme degrees not only in their nearest degrees do they run one into another undistinguishably but in some instances to an indefinite extent by one and the same individual operation by which the one is excluded the other is produced but this is a difficulty which throughout the whole field the labours of the logical tactician have to encounter at every step nor does the nature of things admit of its being either avoided or removed under odynothetics one obvious source of division is the nature of the source from which immediately or more or less remote the pain may be found to flow and here the distinction between the work of unassisted nature and the work of man would again find place considered as being purely the work of nature pain will have its immediate source either within the precincts of the body afflicted with it or without those precincts considered as having its source within the body it may be referred to disease and under the name of hygiantics the branch of art and science which employs itself in combating that affliction may together with those branches which presented themselves as subservient to this principal one be seen already held up to view though without any attempt at systematic order in table i considered as having its source without the body pain will be found referable either to the head of calamity purely physical calamity or to that of delinquency as to the means immediately employable for combating pain considered as having calamity for its source these will of course be different according to the nature of the particular calamity and will accordingly be referable to different branches of art and science but in so far as power—political power—is in a less immediate way employed in causing application to be made of those means the subject belongs to the ensuing head of politics or government and thereunder to one of the subbranches of the branch termed police in so far as the affliction is considered as having its source in delinquency the art and science to which it belongs is also government of which in the text for the subject of hedonistics two obvious sources of division present themselves one is the seat of the pleasure in question the other the channel or inlet through which it is let in to the mind the seat will either be in virtue of the whole of the nervous system taken together the whole of the bodily frame or in a more particular manner this or that particular organ or other part to the first of these heads belong the means employed to the opposite purposes of calefaction and refrigeration both concurring in confining the quantity of caloric diffused through the body within those bounds within which bodily comfort is among the fruits of it to this same head belongs in the next place the consideration of the various instruments by the application of which that state of the nervous system which in its several modifications may be comprised under the generic term of intoxication is capable of being produced to the other of the above two heads may be seen to belong the subjects of cookery and confectionary liquormaking and perfumery the term liquormaking being here considered as confined to the designation of potable liquors other than those applied to the justmentioned purpose of intoxication from the nature of the inlet considered as distinct from the seat may be deduced any such ramifications as may be employed in presenting to view in the first place gymnastic exercises in general exercises productive of a pleasure of which the whole body is the inlet as well as the instrument in the next place such games of skill and even of chance which no part of the pleasure afforded by them being considered as having its seat in the body may be considered as exercises productive of a pleasure administered by and let in through the body to the mind to the branches of art and science which have for their subject the above exercises none of which have any special inlet may here be added—under the description of branches having for their subject pleasures admitted respectively through their several special inlets—those which are commonly designated by the collective name of the fine arts—viz music having for its sole inlet the ear painting and sculpture the eye poetry affording a pleasure which finds its entrance at both those inlets in the case of the fine arts two perfectly different species affording commonly as decidedly distinct degrees of pleasure may be distinguished viz that which is experienced by those by whom nothing but the product of the operation is enjoyed and that which is experienced by him by whom—singly or in conjunction with others—the operation is performed the firstmentioned set unlimited in multitude the other limited to the fortunately endowed few the former mere passive recipients the other adding in their persons to the character of passive recipients that of active and productive instruments under the name of somaticohedonistics might be collected and comprehended those branches of art and science which as above have for their objects those modifications of pleasure which have the body for their seat under the name of pneumaticohedonistics such as have for their objects those more refined classes of pleasures which passing through one or more of the inlets afforded by the body find their ultimate seat in the mind for technology the first division might be that which has for its source the distinction between such instruments as are applied immediately to one or other or both together of the two allcomprehensive objects abovementioned—viz exemption from pain and perception of pleasure—and such as are conducive to the production of those same desirable effects no otherwise than in a manner more or less remote viz by being in some way or other conducive to the production of the justmentioned immediate instruments of the branches thus elicited the field upon the face of this account of it appears to be nearly if not altogether coextensive and coincident with that of aplopathematic pathology—considered in its two branches viz the odynothetic and the hedonistic as abovementioned materials and instruments—materials on which the art is exercised and instruments with the help of which it is exercised—in the distinction between the extensive and multifarious classes of objects thus respectively denominated another source of division may be observed in respect of vicinity to use the station of the materials serving as subjects to the art is susceptible of indefinitely numerous degrees the extreme stations are those respectively expressed by the appellatives raw materials and finished work between these two extremes may be seen interposed according to the nature of the finished work different numbers of distinguishable intermediate states as the number of these intermediate states increases the finished work being the same the total mass of labour employed in the production of the finished work has been observed to be diminished diminished by the influence of causes which under the head of division of labour have been so clearly held up to view by adam smith when considered under all the modifications of which it is susceptible the work has been brought into that state in which the appellation of finished work may with propriety be applied to it—on taking any article of it for an example it will be found to be either of such nature as enables it without the intervention of any other object to be applied in an immediate way to immediate use—viz in the way either of excluding pain or of administering pleasure as above—or else not to be susceptible of being applied to use in any other shape than that of preparatory subservient or say instrumental use—viz by being subservient to the production or right and effective application of some subject or subjects applicable as above in an immediate way to use as there are instruments the use of which consists in their being respectively applied in an immediate way that is each according to its nature and destination applied without the intervention of any other to the repulsion of pain or production of pleasure or to both at once so there are others which howsoever truly conducive to these ends are not so in any other than an unimmediate way i e by being subservient either to the production or to the application of some instrument or instruments coming as above under the denomination of immediate instruments immediate utility admits not of degrees but of unimmediate utility as above degrees may have place in any number the scale to which these degrees belong may be termed the scale of vicinity to use instruments the station of which is on the highest degree of the scale—say the first degree—the degree nearest to immediate use may be termed instruments of the  st order those next to them i e next below them instruments of the  d order and so on through any number of degrees which in any system of connected instruments may at any time be found exemplified of materials and instruments of all kinds whether applied immediately or unimmediately to use some are applicable and accordingly applied to their respective uses each of them by itself others not but in conjunction each of them with one or more other instruments agriculture is conspicuous for the number of instances it affords of instruments which are capable of being and are wont to be employed single as above manufactures taken in the aggregate for the multitude of the instances they afford of instruments which cannot be employed but conjunctly the principal characteristics by which the systems of productive operations commonly comprehended under the appellation of manufactures are distinguished from those called trades or handicraft trades seem to be the greater length to which they carry the division of labour the multitude of the instances they afford of instruments of subservient use employed conjunctly with each other and the number of the different orders into which as above those instruments would be found ranged below one another in the scale of vicinity to use raw material or finished work—instrument of immediate use or instrument of unimmediate and subservient use—no portion of matter can ever or in any way be of use until it is arrived at the place which it is requisite it should occupy in order to its being applied in that same way to use hence two universally concomitant modes of subserviency to use of which in so far as they are moveable all useful instruments are susceptible viz subserviency in the way of formation or application and subserviency in the way of conveyance to this place belongs a system of division which with a view to clear correct and allcomprehensive conception might not altogether without advantage in the way of instruction be applied to the aggregate mass of the several different instruments of conveyance these are say stationary i e roads moveable i e carriages and so on in the above may be seen though nothing like a complete list a specimen of the various sources of division by means of which taken altogether roads might with no small instruction and convenience at any rate to the as yet unpractised traveller be cut in so many various directions through the wilderness of technology a view of what was done

applicable to this purpose are in the institutional books styled books of rhetoric designated by the collective name of figures of speech but on the list of these figures of speech as designated by their respective names several may be seen that apply more decidedly to the imagination than to the affections as well as others which without addressing themselves to either of these two classes of psychological fictitious entities are considered as capable of being subservient to the communication of thought by means of collateral associations i e by means of accessory ideas which stand associated with the principal idea with the idea of which the word in question is directly and professedly significative and which it was in the first instance employed to bring to view works of this description—the study of which is commonly in schools an immediate sequel to that of the rules of grammar—are what the author of hudibras appears to have had in view where he says—   for all a rhetoricians rules   teach but the naming of his tools this portion of stock marshalled as have been the contents of it by the didactic versemaker rather than by the logician remains as yet it is believed in that original chaotic state in which without particular examination it seems scarcely practicable to bestow upon it any denomination more characteristic than that of figures of speech by which it has hitherto been designated between the imports which by even the most ancient greek writers extant was annexed and from them continues to be annexed to the words grammar and rhetoric respectively the relation which may be seen to have place is very different from that which can not but have originally had place if not between the words themselves between those from which they were respectively derived by the word rhetoric derived from the verb ϱεω to flow in a stream which in some of its conjugates though not in all for in this secondary sense the assemblage is far from complete was employed to designate the particular kind of efflux distinguished by the name of speech the audible signs of language and none but the audible signs were denoted by the word grammar derived from γϱαφω to make visible or tangible marks none but the visible or tangible ones thus far to judge from the undubitable etymologies of the two words rhetoric should have been the name which in the earliest stage of society—viz antecedently to the invention of the visible and tangible class of signs—was employed to designate the thoughtcommunicating art viz taken in the whole of its then extent and to what purpose soever it was considered as applied or applicable so in like manner from and after the introduction of those visible and tangible signs grammar should have been applied to the same field taken in the same unlimited extent so as in its import to differ from rhetoric on no other point than that of the different species of signs respectively employed by the two arts of the change which upon the face of this statement appears to have taken place between those original and the subsequently established and still existing imports absolute and relative of the two words the cause seems to be this—antecedent to the time at which the use of letters was invented in or imported into the cluster of nations whose language was the greek language the operation of speaking to a numerous audience on subjects of a complicated nature and thence in discourses which continued flowing on as it were to a considerable length had in consequence of the form taken by the political constitution of some of these nations grown into use ρητωϱ rhetor the man of fluency was accordingly the appellation by which a man considered as engaged in operations of this description came to be designated but on the occasion of an address delivered on such subjects and to such audiences motives for exercising on the affections and even on the passions whether directly or through the medium and with the assistance of the imagination whatsoever influence a man was able to exercise could never be wanting and thus it was that rhetoric—the language of the rhetor—i e the public speaker came to signify not so much speech at large as speech considered as addressing itself either directly or through the medium of the imagination to the affections and the passions when the art exercised by the public speaker having for a length of time more or less considerable been already in use the signs invented for the purpose of giving permanence to the import expressed by those audible and evanescent signs had also for a length of time more or less considerable been in use then and not till then it was that those relations for the designation of which the collective appellation parts of speech came to be employed could for the first time have presented themselves to view to obtain over the vast aggregate composed of the whole assemblage of the words of which the language used by the nation in question was composed such a command as enabled a man to marshal them all in his mind and lodge them every one of them in one or other of the eight or ten classes having for their collective denomination the manyworded appellative parts of speech was an enterprise such as could scarcely have been projected much less executed without the benefit of that assemblage of permanent and everlasting signs which in every combination they are susceptible of are capable of being kept in a steady position during any required length of time under the corporeal and thence under the mental eye and in the progress of the art of education thus it was that to instruction in the art of perceiving the import and tracing the forms of these visible and tangible characters came by degrees to be added instruction in the nature of those relations between their respective imports in contemplation of which the whole body of the words of which a language is composed is divided and distributed among the parts of speech in the institutional works on this subject derived by us whether immediately or through the medium of the latins from the greeks a division made of grammar is into orthoëpy and orthography—orthoëpy the art of performing the operation of speaking in the right i e in the customary mode orthography the art of performing the operation of writing in the correspondently right mode considered merely as operations first of the two as above came speech then and not till after an interval of indefinite and unmeasurable length writing but considered as arts to the exercise of which aberration from a standard and thence rectitude the absence of aberration were incident first must have come if the above observations be well grounded orthography the art of writing and not till after that the art of speaking correctly viz according to the usages to which expression had been given in and by the rules of grammar the word rhetoric having thus two considerably different significations the one original and unbounded the other derivative comparatively modern and comparatively narrow the one designating the operation of speech taken in its whole extent the other the art of speech considered no otherwise than as applied to the particular purpose of exercising occasionally through the medium of the imagination influence over the affections and the passions no wonder if in works having for their subject the import of this word the line drawn between these two connected significations should be found not altogether clear and uniform in this or that work taken singly not clear in such or such two works compared together not the same how narrow the conception is which by the word rhetoric has been presented to the authors of the small institutional books above alluded to may be seen by means of a glance bestowed on the string of definitions and examples of which the books so intituled are composed and scarcely by any other means in any one of these books may be seen the import of this appellation taken at its minimum the maximum may be seen in the definition given of it in one of the most instructive as well as most recent books on the subject—viz the philosophy of rhetoric by the late dr campbell of aberdeen in the first page of the body of the work after having without notice given of the change or of the relation between the import of the two words substituted eloquence to rhetoric—the word eloquence taken in its greatest latitude denotes he says that art or talent by which the discourse is adapted to its end all the ends of speaking continues he are reducible to four every speech being intended to enlighten the understanding to please the imagination to move the passions or to influence the will thereupon not adverting to the practice of writing whether for the writers own use or for the use of others—whether particular individuals or the public at large he immediately uses not only the word speech but the word speaking as coextensive with and synonymous to the word discourse in a note the word eloquence says he in common conversation is seldom used in such a comprehensive sense for the choice made of this definition he thereupon gives two reasons the second too long to be noticed here the first is that it exactly corresponds with tullys idea of a perfect orator which he thereupon quotes but in this the christian divine does the heathen philosopher much more and himself much less than justice for of his last mentioned end viz influencing the will in comparison of which those mentioned by tully are all of them but as means the passage from tully says nothing in regard to grammar the case is that of the field of language—considered without reference to the particular nature of the subject purpose or occasion on which it is employed and in that sense in a purely grammatical point of view—the consideration of what belongs to the mutual relations correspondent to the different parts of speech does not cover the whole expanse in this part of the field what is wanted for use for general use is a work the object of which shall be to show the course best adapted to the purpose of rendering language—i e the particular language employed whatsoever it be—in the highest practical degree well adapted to the general end or purpose of language viz communication of thought abstraction made of the particular nature of the particular purpose to which on the particular occasion in question it may happen to it to be employed by the observation of the rules called rules of grammar belonging to the particular language in question true it is that general purpose will in some measure be accomplished but to afford a complete direction for the complete accomplishment of it will it is believed be found to

commonly entertained and the language commonly held in this part of the field of thought and action—the terms legislation and legislators are wont to be regarded and employed as if applicable in no other case than that in which the situation of the hands by which the power is exercised is supreme accordingly and in consequence in the case where it is regarded as being subordinate the discourses

to have been suitable to his purpose and to the occasion have found two viz the two abovementioned common ties not that in any part of the field any such conception as it is in the power of any of the words in question to convey of those general ideas of which they are respectively the names can serve in the place of ideas derived from the perception of individuals of the correspondent individual objects respectively contained in them no it is only through individual objects that any clear and adequate ideas are presented and lodged in the mind and it is the opposite notion that constituted the allpervading error of the class of philosophers called the schoolmen or schoollogicians and gave to little less than the whole mass of knowledge or supposed knowledge of those times the character of a nutshell without a kernel or a skull without brains but what it is in the power of these words to do is—to afford so many ready receptacles as it were or boxes in which the individual ideas—in proportion as they are drawn forth from the individual objects which are their sources—may be lodged and deposited in such manner as to take hold of the memory and there to remain in readiness to be at any time called up for use a in the import of this word—in the sense in which by the aristotelians—at any rate by the christian followers of that philosophy—it has always been employed—is included

 words which whether derived or not from foreign languages appertain exclusively to particular trades and occupations will of course continue to operate as so many incidental sources of the sensation of ignorance to a person not correspondently conversant with the language of those particular trades and occupations respectively there must in those several divisions of the language be of course as many dark spots as there are of these peculiar words but in these instances it will by the context of the discourse be sufficiently shown that by a want of acquaintance with the import of these particular words nothing worse is indicated than a correspondent want of acquaintance with the field of that particular trade or occupation not any want of acquaintance with any part of the general body of the language the language of seamanship will afford an example  in the french encyclopædical table so often mentioned between the art and science of the painter and that of the chemist according to the view there given of the two objects there could not be any relation at all except in so far as painting is a branch of connoissances humaines—human knowledges or knowledge according to that table in painting and not only in painting but in engraving the only one of the human faculties employed is the imagination and as according to the same table the art of making colours fit to be used in painting belongs to memory—and if it be included in chemistry the knowledge how to make them belongs to reason—the painter might be at some difficulty about his colours if for finding out the way to have good ones he had no other means than what are afforded him by that french table † by the mathematical reader with reference to the solution of the principal problem the construction of this test may if he pleases be considered in the character of a lemma ‡ on the occasion of every such division what to prevent confusion is altogether necessary is—that of the names given to the parts which are the results of the division by no one shall any individuals be designated other than those which are comprehended in the aggregate so undertaken to be divided by the word preciseness or precision may be designated the ulterior property thus represented as desirable but to its presenting this signification it will be necessary that the original and material import of the word precision from precido to cut off viz everything that outstretches the proper line be at the same time present to the mind of this property however to avoid embarrassing the present inquiry with matter which on the present occasion has not presented itself as essential to it no further mention except what follows in this note will be made in the scheme of division pursued in the example here given of an encyclopædical tree this property will it is believed be found actually possessed and that by every branch without exception but among the trivial or current names which in the character of synonyms to the names of the branches of the tree in its encyclopædical form have for illustration been introduced some may perhaps be found whose claim to the possession of this property may not present itself as exempt from dispute this deficiency in respect of preciseness is among the unavoidable results of the indeterminateness which will in so many instances be seen to be attached to the names in common use properties may receive explanation from their opposites allcomprehensiveness may be said to have for its opposite scantiness preciseness extravasation  for this diagram see table iv † viz if it be an individual the same individual—the same in all its parts if an aggregate an aggregate composed of exactly the same individuals neither more nor less the portion of time in question must also be in both instances exactly the same for it may be that at one time the individual is possessed of the property in question at another time not possessed of it ‡ if so far as it goes the account here given of contradictories is correct and clear that which may be seen given by the aristotelian logicians will hardly be found in complete possession of either of these desirable qualities only between assertions surely can contradictoriness have place yet by saunderson it is spoken of as having place between two terms of the two abovementioned axioms which have contradictories for their subject it has been seen how well they correspond—yet by saunderson one of them viz the one last mentioned is represented as applying to terms alonea nothing being therein said of propositions the other as applying to entire propositions aloneb nothing being there said of terms and of these axioms that which is applied to terms alone instead of constituting a rule of itself is in the form of a parenthesis sunk as it were under the head of another rule which seems far from equalling it in clearness—though really derived from the aristotelian logic the account here given of contradictories not being exactly conformable to the account given in that system—what difference there is between the two accounts might but for this warning be liable to be without further scrutiny supposed to be the result of misconception to obviate any such supposition it seemed necessary thus to give a brief intimation of the considerations by which the departure here made from the authoritative standard seemed necessitated could room have been spared other supposed imperfections in the aristotelian account of the matter might here have been pointed out a logicæ artis compendium p  0 b ib p     proposition note that the sense in which the word proposition is here employed is not that in which it is commonly employed by mathematicians but that in which it is employed by logicians if the former were the sense put upon it the distinctness here ascribed to the two branches might not be very readily recognised if indeed it would really be to be found so apt are mathematical men to go backwards and forwards between the geometrical and the algebraical mode of expression according to the supposed convenience of the occasion and the moment in a manner as it were mechanical and almost without notice taken of the difference—what may very well happen is that of what may in the mathematical sense be one and the same proposition in one part figure may be and in another part not be an object of regard but because two things are capable of being mixed together it follows not that in their own natures they are not distinct and taking the word proposition in the logical sense scarcely will it be said that in one and the same proposition the matter is spoken of at the same time in a geometrical and in an arithmetical point of view—spoken of with reference to figure and not with reference to figure at the same time  outstretching see above note ‡ to p  0  † allcomprehensiveness true it is that to the purpose of its being regarded as allcomprehensive this division of mathematics into geometry and arithmetic it is necessary that under arithmetic algebra should be considered as comprehended but about this there cannot be any difficulty since by newton as appears by his work entituled arithmetica universalis—by newton and so many others—it is spoken of as thus included true also it is—that to this same purpose it is equally necessary that under algebra fluxions which on this supposition might in the manyworded form be denominated fluxional algebra should be considered as included but upon consideration neither in this case it is believed will there be found any serious difficulty applicable with equal propriety to fluxions as well as to whatever part of algebra cannot be brought under the denomination of fluxions will be found the appellative agnostosymbolic agnostosymbolic i e expressed by signs unknown by signs of which in the first instance antecedently to the solution of the problem the value and import is not known—known in the same degree of clearness as those of which the written language peculiar to common arithmetic is composed this division of algebra into common and fluxional would any one wish to see it expressed in the language of the encyclopædical tree in the solution of this logical problem there would not it is believed be found much difficulty and by this means an exemplification may be afforded of the method in which in any given part of it the process by which these first lines of the encyclopædical tree have been constructed may at pleasure be carried on to any further length for distinguishing fluxional from common algebra take for the distinctive property of fluxions the fiction by which in this case for the production of the quantities in question—for the genesis or generation of them to use the language of mathematicians—motion is supposed if this assumption be admitted as correct algebra being taken for the immediate trunk here then we have—for the positive branch cinesiopseustic motionfeigning for the negative branch acinesiopseustic motion not feigning by him by whom being considered in the newtonian point of view the subject of the branch in question is accordingly treated of in the newtonian language the propriety of the denomination thus proposed for the positive branch will not it is believed be considered as being exposed to dispute whether for the same branch or at any rate the correspondent branch if considered in the leibnitzian point of view and in the leibnitzian language that being the language mostly employed on the continent styled the calculus differentialis et integralis in french calcul differentiel et integral the same encyclopædical division with or without the same nomenclature would and with equal propriety might be made to serve is an inquiry which stands too wide of the present disquisition to be endeavoured to be comprised in it ‡ distinctness see above p  0  note on the word proposition  thus it is that in every instance the proposed test and the capacity of the division to endure the application of it have been kept in view the difference is—that in some instances in the composition of the appellatives in question the application of this test has been actually made—made by the author himself—in other instances left to the reader if in the eyes of any student in logic this work should happen to find favour the application of this test would it is believed be found capable of affording him a not altogether uninstructive exercise but if by the mere use of this instrument in its present shape instruction may thus be gained much greater is the degree of instruction capable of being gained by the endeavour to improve upon it and with whatsoever degree of success it may happen to any such endeavour to be attended any labour thus employed he may be well assured so far as instruction to the labourer himself is a gain will not be lost  definitions these definitions present themselves naturally in the character of answers to so many questions which in a course of instruction administered in the mode now so well known by the name of the interrogative mode might be applied to the matter of any such scientific tree and thus pursuing the phraseology as well as the method applied in the national society schools to the churchofengland catechism we have the matter of the tree of art and science broken into short questions in what degree soever on the superior ground of importance the matter of this encyclopædical tree may fall below the matter of that consecrated formulary on the ground of facility of intellection it will scarcely be thought to yield to it   what is mathematics answers the branch of art and science which has for its subject quantity   what is the encyclopædical name for mathematics answer posology   what is geometry expressed in the encyclopædical language answer morphoscopic posology   what is arithmetic expressed in encyclopædical language answer alegomorphic posology to the above will be added of course the questions adapted to the extraction of the requisite ulterior explanations but of these the above sample will it is believed be found to suffice  of an imperfect division watts in his logic undertakes to give an example but on this occasion he seems not to know very exactly what he is about the sort of aggregate which belonged to his subject was a logical aggregate—a genus such as this table exhibits in every part of it the sort of aggregate which he employs for his example is a physical aggregate—an individual—any individual of the genus tree the division which he gives as an example of an imperfect one is that of a tree into trunk and leaves what in his view renders it an imperfect one is but the want of mention made of root and branches not to speak of other parts two much more important deficiencies are the want of flowers and fruit but the lights struck out by linnæus had not as yet shone upon the field of physiurgics immediately afterwards he takes up indeed a logical aggregate viz logic itself but for want of some words perhaps that were necessary to complete the expression instead of light the result is thicker darkness logic he supposes divided into apprehension judgment and reasoning this division gives us another example of an incomplete one for to render it complete method he says should have been added of the art in question meaning logic method he says is a considerable part be it so but apprehension is it also an art no surely of the art and science of logic it may be taken for one of the subjects—true—but itself it is neither art nor science thus confounding the subjects of an art with the art itself what he gives as an example of the division of a logical aggregate is—a division of it into four parts of which no more than one can with any sort of propriety be spoken of as a part of that same whole no nor even that without a force put upon the import of the word to express a species of art—to express an operation—methodization not method was the proper word method is—not the operation itself but the result of it † elements book vi p    ‡ impression—viz the effect produced in the mind at the very time when the object which is the source of it being present to bodily sense is actually the object of the faculty of perception—idea—viz the effect produced when the object not being so present is—or rather the impression made by it as above is—the object of the faculty of memory the first writer it is believed by whom this distinction so necessary to every clear and correct perception of the phenomena of the human mind was held up to notice was david hume a consequence is—that where observation is made of the existence of this or that relation—and on that occasion comparison as above is spoken of as being made or distinction as having place—if the number of the objects in question is greater than two he who has to speak of the relation the comparison or the distinction finds himself in a very awkward dilemma by the preposition among—it being scarcely in use for this purpose—scarcely is the import in question presented to view comparison of object with object yes comparison between object and object yes comparison between objects yes comparison among objects—comparison for example among those three objects—scarcely so as to relation relation of object to object yes relation between object and object yes relation between objects yes relation among objects—relation among these three objects—scarcely and so in the instance of the word distinction in these cases what shall be the word employed—shall it be the word among scarcely is the import conveyed or if it be it is not without the idea of impropriety for its accompaniment that the corveyance of it is made comparison relation distinction among these three—scarcely will any such phrase be endurable shall it be the word between comparison between three relation between three—the hue of selfcontradictoriness presents itself upon the very face of the phrase by one of the words in it the number of the objects is asserted to be three by another it is asserted to be no more than two be this as it may the confirmation which from this particularity in the language though it should be found to be in no more than one language the notion in question receives seems equally manifest to the use thus exclusively made of the word between what could have given rise but a sort of general howsoever indistinct perception that it is only one to one that objects can in any continued manner be commodiously and effectually compared  on the very face of the portion of language with which the hand of custom has covered this part of the field may be seen a testimony—nor that a weak one—in favour of the conception thus hazarded distinction between is the phrase not distinction among comparison between not comparison among—why—answer because it is only between two objects that any clear perception of distinction can be obtained at the same time—because to no greater number of objects than two can the faculty and correspondent operation of comparison be applied at exactly the same point of time many in a word are the occasions on which—it being supposed that of certain objects a survey is to be taken and that survey a conjunct one—it will be found that of the two words here in question viz between and among it is the former only that can with propriety be employed and besides these just mentioned on many others if not on all occasions will the like testimony it is believed be seen to be afforded the truth is—that on this ground the english language labours under a defect which when it is compared in this particular with other european languages may perhaps be found peculiar to it by the derivation and thence by the inexcludible import of the word between i e by twain the number of the objects to which this operation is represented as capable of being applied is confined to two by the latin inter—by its french derivation entre—no such limitation seems to be expresseda a to the greek—the set of prepositions which that language furnishes being wretchedly ambiguous unappropriate unexpressive—in vain on such an occasion could any reference be made † relations  to other objects when first penned the passage stood as follows—it is only by means of such relations as it bears to other objects that any object can be known  without explanation this it might have appeared would have been going too far for supposing the object in question to contain parts on this supposition the relations which it bore to other objects would not comprehend more than a portion of the whole number of relations of which it was susceptible in addition to them there would remain the relations borne to each other by its several parts the only supposition therefore on which the position thus discarded would be strictly true is this viz that the subject of it is an atom—an object too minute to be divisible into parts on this supposition if deduction were made of all relation borne by this atom to objects exterior to itself after such deduction there would not remain any relations at all for in the very import of the word relation two objects at least between which it is considered as having place are comprehended no powers for example could the atom have why because no subject would it have to operate upon ‡ hence the term equation applied to algebraical propositions  caution to prevent that misconception by which aristotle after bewildering himself kept the thinking part of the world bewildered for little less than two thousand years—by which he put out the eyes of the otherwise powerful mind of james harris—and which by bacon and locke has scarcely ever yet been completely done away lest to the instrument here employed viz the contradictory formula—employed as here in the character of a test of and security for allcomprehensiveness and distinctness in a logical division—any extraordinary powers beyond those which really belong to it should be ascribed—lest by being employed in the composition of propositions wearing on the face of them the form of demonstration a degree of conclusiveness independent of observation and experiment and superior to anything which by means of those instruments of knowledge can be produced should be supposed to be attainable—this caution is subjoined—a caution which however to those who by an adequate conception of and a sufficient attention to the discoveries made in the region of mind by bacon and locke have learnt to recognise the emptiness of the aristotelian philosophy will at the utmost be no more than a memento yes upon observation made of individual perceptions and upon the correctness with which it has been made and the judgments grounded on it deduced will depend in every instance the truth of whatsoever propositions of a general nature can upon that part of the field of thought and action to which these same individual perceptions and judgments appertain be framed and delivered by general words a truth in so far as ascertained by individual observation may indeed be expressed but it is not by stringing together general words be they what they may or in what number they may that truth can be proved i e that sufficient ground for regarding any one of these propositions as true—any of the properties in question as really appertaining to the subject in question—can be afforded of the formulary here proposed in the character of a test of allcomprehensiveness in the division to which it is applied what then is the real function and use—answer to point the attention of the reader to the individual matters of fact on which the possession of this property depends to point the attention to them viz by the means of a pointed form of words by which the existence of them in all the individual subjects in question is asserted in explicit terms that all living bodies turn here to the ramean tree table iv that all living bodies other than those that are sensitive are insensitive—this for example is what can be neither denied nor doubted of—why because the assertion thus brought to view has in truth for its subject nothing more than the import of certain words compared with certain others—words the import of which is on both sides fixed by universal usage but that all the living bodies which are called animals are sensitive i e possess the property of sensation—of this proposition the truth depends upon individual observation viz partly upon the observation that bodies which at first view have been supposed to possess sensation have upon further observation and experiment been found to give further indications of that property partly upon the observation that—in whatever instance body has been found or supposed to be possessed of that same property—animal and not plant has of these two correspondently extensive names of classes been the name to which it has been wont to be referred as well as the name by which in common language it has been wont to be designated of these two observations the first is an observation relative to the nature of things and the field it belongs to is that of natural history the other is an observation relative to the import of words i e relative to the usage which among that portion of the human species by which the language in question has been employed has obtained in respect of the things or real objects for the designation of which the words in question have been wont to be employed and the field it belongs to is that of language it was by fancying that everything could be done by putting together a parcel of phrases expressive of the respective imports of certain words mostly of certain general words without any such trouble as that of applying experiment or observation to individual things—that for little less than two thousand years the followers of aristotle kept art and science nearly at a stand in the present instance what may be seen is—that already in whatsoever may have presented itself in the character of a demonstration among the data of it the existence of the property the existence of which is the object of such demonstration—the existence of that property in the subject in question viz in the division in question—is virtually assumed in and by the remainder of the process—in and by the demonstrative part itself—what then is it that is or could be done nothing more than to show that to the two branches or minor aggregates in question that formula is truly applicable which wherever it is found to be truly applicable is received—or at any rate is fit to be received—as a compendious indication—and in so far as the individual assertions included in it are true i e agree with the nature of things on the one hand and the usage of language on the other—as a commodious test and provisional proof though no more than a provisional proof of the existence of the property in question in the subject in question viz in the present instance of the property termed allcomprehensiveness or exhaustiveness in the system of divisions supposed and asserted to be possessed of it it is from such truth as there is in the included particular—yes and even individual—propositions that whatever truth there is in any more general one is originally perceived—not vice versâ a general proposition is but an aggregate of individual ones it can only be in so far as the individual propositions contained in it are true that in the general proposition by which those individuals are contained any truth can be to be found the case is—that all perceptions are not only particular but individual in so far as it goes beyond actually existing individuals on which the actual observation has been made every general proposition—how well warranted soever the induction is by which it has been formed—how useful soever it is when applied to practice—and how truly soever the sensation it produces in the mind is different from that produced in the same receptacle by any one of the individual observations of which it contains the assertion—is still but a figment—the mere figment of the imagination hence—once more and for the last time—it is only in the character of a provisional test that this general formulary is presented in observation and experiment—observation and experiment having for their subjects individual objects—in these are the only original and in case of dispute or doubt the only definitive tests to be found to give to mere assertion the appearance and for that purpose the name of demonstration is a contrivance invented and brought forward probably without seeing the hollowness of it by aristotle and which down to the present day either from inability or from unwillingness to recognise the hollowness of it polemical writers have not yet prevailed upon themselves to abstain from the use of the proposition which a man stands engaged to support is in its nature a selfcontradictory one and thereby a mere heap of nonsense—expressive neither of truth nor even so much as of falsehood—nothing will serve him but he must give a demonstration of it the more palpable the absence of all genuine instruments of persuasion the more urgent the demand for fallacious ones † for further elucidation on the subject of this and the succeeding sections see the subject of division as treated in the work on logic in this volume—ed  from the greek of the isagoge of porphyrius—i e his introduction to the aristotelian system of logic—this diagram is supposed to have been translated but it was the latin translation as it stands in no i—a latin translation in manuscript and not the greek original in print—that was put by the tutor into the hands of his pupils nor has it ever happened to this one of them to have had a copy of it under his eye † since what is in the text was written an opportunity has been obtained of consulting the work of porphyrius and the result is—that most improperly has this diagram been ascribed to that wordy and cloudy preexpounder of a nebulous original an edition of aristotles organon i e system of logic to which is prefixed the introduction ascribed to porphyrius is now on the table it is that published by pacius with a latin translation at frankfort anno      in the greek there is no diagram in the latin alone is there any diagrama but in the greek what is described is—not a tree but a mere nest of boxes one within another in the latin diagram the image presented has in it something of a ladder but nothing at all of a tree the truth is—what is brought to view by porphyrius is not a system of divisions it is nothing more than a system of logical subalternation of the materials of the diagram here exhibited it has not any of the negative branches it has none but the positive genus generalissimum ουσια next to and within ουσια σωμα next to and within σωμα εμψυχον σωμα next to and within εμψυχον σωμα ζωον next to and within ζωον λογιϰον ζωον next to and within λογιϰον ζωον ανϑϱωτος to grecians it will without explanation be manifest enough how clumsy and incorrect the workmanship is of this nest of boxes how much inferior to that of the latin tree to nongrecians it seems scarcely worth explaining thus it appears that of this admirable instrument scarce a trace is to be found in the work of this porphyrius by whose name it has been found designated no ramification no division is to be found in it no ramification consequently no place for that contradictory formula by which the relation of the contents of the branches to one another and to the trunk is so satisfactorily expressed wonderful therefore it is how among logicians—or from the pen of so much as a single logician of the aristotelian school—the diagram in question should have been ascribed to this porphyrius the probability seems to be that the inventor of it was no other than peter ramus that ramus whom we have seen and shall see again so slightingly spoken of for the use he made of ita in the text of this sectionb when from the gname under which it was handed down the diagram was concluded to have been the invention of porphyrius it was mentioned as matter of surprise that saunderson had made no use of it though the ascription of it to porphyrius was as above the result of misconception the ground for surprise remains without much alteration to saunderson the works of ramus were known for he refers to them by ramus what is certain is—that for the bifurcate mode of division a strong predilection was entertained and abundant use made of it what seems highly probable therefore is—that the divisions thus made by him either were or were intended to be exhaustive according to moreri verbo ramus on the subject of logic for he wrote on mathematical and other subjects the works he wrote were intitled institutiones dialecticæ and aristotelicæ animadversiones anno     —his books were condemned and he turned out of his professorship he not being at that time more than twentyeight years of age being the declared opponent of aristotle the wonder is how for that time he escaped with life—being moreover a protestant he suffered for both sins at once being comprehended in the bartholomewtide massacre anno      in some of our public libraries not to speak of private ones these works of the ingenious frenchman—gallicè pierre ramée latinè petrus ramus—would be to be found of course what he found to say against aristotle would at least be matter of curiosity though considering at what time of day he said it probably not of much use a pp     a the porphyrian tree in its usual latin form is found in use before the time of ramus e g by boethius and others—ed b p      some fiveandforty years ago was the discovery of this imperfection made what led to it was this observing that to the divisions made in that work the quality of allcomprehensiveness was therein ascribed—and concluding that accordingly in the contents of it matter fit for the being represented as endowed with that quality would throughout be to be found—thereupon by way of exercise taking the text of it in hand the author of these pages set himself the task of exhibiting it in the form of a ramean tree but not to speak of anterior sources of perplexity no sooner did the test come to be applied to the attributives of the second order than the delusion vanished and the operation was found to be impracticable  of all the colleges in the university of oxford queens college was in the year     —and for aught the writer of this has heard continues to be—the one in which the art and science of logic was and is cultivated with most attention in those days saundersons and watts as above were—and for aught he has heard continue to be on this subject—employed there in the character of the earliest if not the only institutional writers † dividendum rather than divisum seems to be the more proper term in so far as the time at which the subject is taken into consideration is anterior to that at which the operation has been performed upon it and the firstmentioned is the time which seems to have been in view on the occasion of some of the ensuing rules—the dividendum not the dividend for fear of running foul of the threadneedlestreet bank  by this unfortunate mass of surplusage another source of confusion will be seen to be opened—on the supposition by which the field for the application of these rules is marked out a problem is proposed of this problem the subject is supposed to be already determined viz the aggregate of which a division is to be made upon this subject it is that according to this same supposition an operation is to be performed viz that of division of this operation when performed the condivident parts or members will be the results of which several results the contents will of course respectively depend upon the scheme or mode of division which shall have been pursued here then all that is supposed to depend upon the operator is the mode of the division and therefrom the results of it that which as being by the supposition already determined is supposed not to depend upon him is—the dividendum—the aggregate upon which the operation—the division—is to be performed of these conditions of the problem necessary as is the perception and comprehension of them to any clear and correct conception of the nature of the operation and the work so it is that by this institutionalist no clear conception seems on this occasion to have been entertained addressing himself to the operator the direction which on this occasion he gives is—how to frame his dividendum but on this same occasion according to the conditions of the problem he is not to frame it at all it is ready framed to his hands upon the whole what seems evident enough is—that taken in both its parts this second rule is worse than useless and that the complete erasure of it would be an improvement  from the fifth of these his rules substantial and useful instruction will however be found obtainable—divide says he every subject according to the special design you have in view then immediately follows an observation which with perfect propriety might have been made to constitute a distinct rule one and the same idea or subject says he may be divided in very different manners according to the purposes we have in discoursing of it whereupon by way of exemplification he adduces the several purposes which in regard to a book it may naturally happen to the printer the grammarian and the logician to have in view—of this rule of his two exemplifications may have been observed in the encyclopedical table here exhibited  kaimess sketches book iii sk i p      no says he the conditions are inconsistent—first term   common multiplier   no number of terms will give  0000 for the last the two nearest will give—the one a less number the other a greater hence a demand for discussions the profit of which would not pay for the place occupied † in various parts of the field of art and science in his own instance towards giving clearness correctness and completeness to his own views the writer of these pages has found it—so at least it has seemed to him—of the greatest use for this purpose he had even brought together a few exemplifications but seeing to what a length they had led him from the main purpose and considering that where by any person by whom after such particular discussion and explanation the reality of the benefit is not recognised in that part of the field which has here been operated upon still less reasonable would be the expectation of seeing it recognised on any other ground of which no more than the slightest and most general view could be presented he struck them out without any such trouble as that of exhibiting them in this particular view other exemplifications may however perhaps be seen to be afforded by some of the subsequent numbers of this appendix  the reader will probably find a convenience in having open before him the diagram of this encyclopædical tree and occasionally to turn to the explanations given in relation to it in §   † of a word thus framed an exemplification may be seen in the encyclopædical tree in the word eudæmonics ‡ an instance in which the pair of names first provided were singleworded names and these trivial names is afforded by the words geometry and arithmetic—an instance in which the names first provided were indeed singleworded names but those not trivial names but names framed for the purpose are posology and poiology from thence by the addition of the name of the trunk were made—as may be seen both in the diagram and the explanation of it—the two twoworded encyclopædical names pososcopic somatics and poioscopic somatics to either of these two encyclopædical twoworded names in the structure of which the contradictory formula is not expressed but only implied had it been deemed necessary to substitute two names in which that test of allcomprehensiveness is expressed the following is the mode in which it might have been effected—pososcopic being continued to poioscopic alegoposic might have been substituted in this case the existence of allcomprehensiveness would have been effected and that it is supposed with truth but that instruction would not upon the face of the ramification have been stamped which by exhibiting posology and poiology together in the character of two branches comprehending between them the whole contents of the trunk somatology seems to be affordeda a neither is quantity so perfectly out of the question in natural history and natural philosophy as quality is in mathematics scarcely therefore could alegoposic somatology have been employed as the twoworded synonym of poiology here there may be seen an instance of those imperfections which in such a case it seems impossible altogether to avoid  take an apple cut it once through with a knife by cutting it in this one direction you divide it into two parts put the parts together again you may in like manner cut it again into two other parts if those produced by the former division are considered as united you have still but two parts if not you may have four parts correspondent to the different dissections taken by the instrument of division in the case of this physical whole are the different sources of division in the case of the logical whole in both cases the division is equally bifurcate and exhaustive † of divisional operations performed on the same subject from divers sources examples may be seen in the table ‡ even by bishop berkeley by whom as if to outscepticize the sceptics and foil them at their own weapons—the existence of the table he was writing upon was denied—the name of the table would have been allowed to be—in common intendment at least—the name of a real entity and even in his own view of the matter the table an utensil which required wood to make it of and a saw c to make it with would have been allowed to approach somewhat nearer to the state of reality than a sort of entity such as a quality as a relation in the making of which thoughts have been the only materials and words the only instruments § say strictly speaking names of so many aggregates or classes of objects in which real entities are included for strictly speaking individual objects are the only real entities considered in themselves the aggregates or classes in which those real entities are regarded as included are no more than so many fictitious bodies put together by the mind for its own use see above note  pp   0    and below §     see the several works on grammar language and ontology in this volume—ed † examples of these undefinable fictitious entities are— i physical fictitious entities—motion rest quality c ii ethical fictitious entities—obligation right vower c iii ontological fictitious entities—condition certainty impossibility c of the demand for a species or mode of exposition adapted to the nature of this class of appellatives hints may be seen in an anonymous tract published by the author a°      under the title of fragment on government c p     to     it has this long time been out of print—see this collection vol i p     et seq  genus and species are words which cannot either of them be employed without impliedly asserting the existence of the other both are aggregates or names of aggregates genus is the whole of which species is a part suppose but one aggregate either of these names may as well be applied to it as the other or rather and for the above reason neither can with propriety be applied to it  thus it is that considered as distinct from the individuals contained in them these aggregates as above are but fictitious entities—the names employed in the designation of them so many names of fictitious entities but when compared with names of fictitious entities at large these may be seen to have something peculiar in them which if he would avoid confusion and disputation it seems necessary a man should have in mind in this case the same word which is employed to signify the fictitious entity viz the fictitious aggregate is also employed to designate anyone of the individual real entities of which that aggregate is regarded as being composed an homonymy which may be seen not to have place in the instance of any other sort of fictitious entity such as a quality a property a relation and the like nor let it be said that because it contains real entities the aggregate called a species a genus a class is itself a real entity for by the word plant taking plant for example for the aggregate are designated—not only all plants existing at the time of the speaking or the writing of that word but also all plants that ever have existed—and all plants that ever shall exist in future—and even all plants that without existing shall be but conceived to exist and to these last at any rate the term real entity will hardly be regarded as properly applicable but though in addition to the several individual objects to which the word plant is applicable no real entity corresponding to it has place out of the human mind—yet within that receptacle by this same name of a fictitious entity a real entity—a general idea—an entity which though not corporeal is not less real than that which is produced in it by the sight or touch of an individual plant—is produced to convince himself of this the reader need but ask himself—whether after and by thus reading the word plant his mind is not put in a state more or less different from that which it was in before this word was read by him if this be not enough then let him say for example whether by the proposition plants have a property which minerals have not three distinguishable mental sensations at least—not to speak of any others—have not been produced in his mind three perfectly distinct ideas each of which is of that sort which is termed a general or abstract one yet to some philosophers it has somehow or other been matter of supposed discovery that there are no such things as general or abstract ideas not considering that if this position of theirs were true nothing that they say in proof of it would have so much as the least chance of being productive of the effect they aim at or to speak still more generally scarcely would anything they say be productive of any more effect than would be produced by so much nonsense yes—by the word plant or the word plants when read an effect a sort of feeling or mental image is as really produced as by the sight of any individual plant—and it is a clearly different one in the one case it is an abstract idea in the other case an impression but in the one there is just as much reality as in the other of the evidence of the existence of the general idea the probative force is even nearer and more promptly and surely satisfactory than that of the existence of any individual plant from which by abstraction that general idea was deduced in the former case the evidence is perception in the other case it is but inference—ratiocination and that such ratiocination as many an acute mind bishop berkeleys for instance has not been satisfied with in speaking of genera and species two sources of indistinctness and confusion and if observed of perplexity are continually presenting themselves one is—the difficulty which on the appearance of a generic or specific name is found in determining whether it is the fictitious entity—the aggregate itself—or only the name employed for the designation of it—that in the character of the subject of the proposition the word is intended to bring to view the other is—the penury and imperfection under which language—the best constructed not excepted—still labours viz in respect of its furnishing no more than these two names for the designation of the results of any number of ramifications which in a system of logical division there may have been occasion to bring to view hence it is that the same word which with reference to this or that other is a generic term is specific with reference to a third hence again the continually recurring question—is this a generic or a specific name and the dispute with what that question is pregnant is altogether an interminable one  in their present shape the conceptions above brought to view would not have been formed nor consequently would this section have been penned but for a very recent glance cast on the logic of candillac more than once at different times had that little work been glanced over or at least glanced at never without its presenting itself in the character of a mass of confusion from which little or no information was to be reaped analysis is the name there given to the instrument by which everything is there supposed to be done everything by that one instrument in every case that one instrument the same languagemaking was analysing and analysis itself was but a wellmade language pp    c     c on looking at the work once more observation was made of such passages in which—always under this one name analysis—an explanation is given of the mode for the distinguishing of which the epithet primæval has hereinabove been just employed now for the first time presented itself to view matter which seemed capable of being put to use a resolution was accordingly taken to endeavour to derive such instruction as might be found derivable from it its claim to attention being now recognised thus it was that by a closer application of that faculty those distinctions which have above been seen were brought to view logical analysis of the physical whole logical synthesis performed upon the qualities—upon the parts which had been produced by that logical analysis—these—together with the logical analysis of those aggregates which were the products of that logical synthesis—were in the logic of condillac seen all of them designated by and confounded together under the one undiscriminating term analysis—for the subject of the primæval analysis condillac before he came to the plant had employed a magnificently furnished château for the present occasion a couple of plants seemed quite sufficient without any such encumbrance as the château moreover of the sort of work here in question abundance must have been done before there were any such things as châteaux yes says somebody and so there was before husbandmens daughters amused themselves with gathering flowers the ancestors of husbandmen were shepherds the ancestors of shepherds hunters in certifying this genealogy geography joins with history assuredly it may be answered man had need to provide food before maidens had need to gather flowers but to provide food man must somehow or other have been in being and able to provide it here then the explanation would have been entangled in the mysteries of cosmogony—a subject which besides its inexplicability is altogether foreign to the present purpose no doubt that for attention and thence for analysis—to be performed as above upon these physical wholes—and thence for synthesis and thence for logical analysis to be performed upon the logical wholes results of these logical syntheses—demands much more urgent as well as much more early must have been produced by eatable fruits and roots than ever can have been produced by flowers but by any such illustration we should have been sent to the garden of eden and of that garden no map being to be had sufficiently particular for the present purpose there we should have lost ourselves pluming himself as it should seem upon the discovery and bringing it to view as such thrice in two small   mo pages condillac pp         will have it that languages are but so many analytic methods—methodes analytiques meaning as far as he can be said to mean anything the results of so many analytic—purely analytic—processes he sees not that so far from being an analytic process the process by which the principal and fundamental materials of all languages—viz common names—are framed is of a nature exactly opposite to that of analysis viz synthesis true it is that this synthetic is necessarily preceded by an analytic process viz by the one above explained under the denomination of the primæval or inerudite analysis—a logical analysis performed upon physical wholes true it also is that to the wholes which are the results of this synthetic process—with the exception of those minimums which are in immediate contact with individuals—another analytic process may to any extent be applied viz the scientific or logical analysis performed upon these logical wholes but how promptly soever they may succeed to each other disaggregation and aggregation—putting asunder and putting together—never can be one and the same operation—never can be other than opposite operations and but for and by means of the aggregative process not a single word—not a single instrument—would the philosopher have had wherewith to put together this his not sufficiently considered account of the formation of language one of these days—the sooner the better—by a still closer application of the faculty of attention a more discerning eye will perhaps discover and bring to light similar imperfections in the account given of the matter in these pages and thus it is that—by still closer and closer application of that same faculty—additional correctness distinctness and comprehensiveness is given to mans conceptions in relation to each and every portion of the field of art and science of the aggregations thus formed some have been better made others worse those which he regards as having been better made were he assures us the work of nature those which were worse made the work of learned men meaning such whose labours in this line he saw reason to disapprove of nature being a sort of goddess—and that a favourite one—by ascribing to this goddess whatsoever was regarded by him as good he seems to have satisfied himself that he had proved the goodness of it and by so concise an expedient—an expedient in the employment of which he has found but too many successors as well as cotemporaries and predecessors—he has saved himself no small quantity of trouble nature is a sort of fictitious personage without whose occasional assistance it is scarce possible it must be confessed either to write or speak but when brought upon the carpet she should be brought on in her proper costume—nakedness not bedizened with attributes—not clothed in eulogistic any more than in dyslogistic moral qualities making minerals vegetables and animals—this is her proper work and it is quite enough for her whenever you are bid to see her doing mans work be sure it is not nature that is doing it but the author or somebody or other whom he patronizes and whom he has dressed up for the purpose in the goddesss robes one word more on the subject of a former topic before this philosopher is parted with—in §   p    may be seen the result of the provisional attempt towards an enumeration of the distinguishable operations and correspondent faculties of the mind in number they were seventeen condillac ch   p    makes but six viz   attention   comparison   judgment   reflection   imagination   ratiocination it might be an exercise for a student—nor would it surely be a useless one—to compare these six with those seventeen—to observe whether in this longer list there are any articles that do not properly belong to it—and if not whether condillacs shorter list be in any particular defective or not—whether for example memory has not been forgotten by him—and if not defective in which of the articles of his shorter list those of the longer list are respectively comprised on considering the catalogue once more it seems as if some such article as analogization or analogoseopy—i e observation of analogies might form a useful addition to it not but that in the explanation thus given the phrase observation of analogies is already to be found but—so distinct from simple abstraction analysis and comparison are those abstractions analysis and comparisons which have observation of analogies for their result—and so powerful and perhaps indispensable an instrument is the faculty so denominated in the hand of invention—that a separate denomination would it should seem be not ill bestowed upon it note that to the above catalogue of the distinguishable operations and correspondent faculties of the human mind the sooftenmentioned test of distinctness and allcomprehensiveness has not been applied it is the result of no other operation than the analysis above distinguished by the name of the primæval analysis and unless the title by which it is thus designated be regarded as the result of an act of synthesis not subjected to any synthesis nor consequently to any scientific analysis as above distinguished hence it cannot be given in any other character than that of a collection of raw materials not so much as attempted to be made up into a finished work the task was too heavy to be attempted in a parenthesis but if in the materials thus brought together any addition should be found made to those which had already been brought together by other hands it will be not altogether without its use  according to that conception of the matter which is here alluded to and assumed entities are either real or fictitious real either perceptible or inferential perceptible either impressions or ideas inferential either material i e corporeal or immaterial i e spiritual material are those of which the principal divisions are exhibited in the ramean tree of such inferential real entities as are immaterial examples may be seen in the almighty being and in the human soul considered in a state of separation from the body by fictitious entities are here meant not any of those which will be presented by the name of fabulous i e imaginary persons such as heathen gods genii and fairies but such as quality—property in the sense in which it is nearly synonymous to quality relation power obligation duty right and so forth incorrect as it would be if the entities in question were considered as being in point of reality upon a footing with real entities as above distinguished the supposition of a sort of verbal reality so to speak as belonging to these fictitious entities is a supposition without which the matter of language could never have been formed nor between man and man any converse carried on other than such as hath place between brute and brute fictitious as they are entities of this description could not be spoken of at all if they were not spoken of as real ones thus a quality is spoken of as being in a thing or a person i e the thing or the person is spoken of as being a receptacle and the quality as being something that is contained in it as in the case of all words which have an immaterial as well as a material the root of the immaterial will be found in the material import so to explain the nature and origin of the idea attached to the name of a fictitious entity it will be necessary to point out the relation which the import of that word bears to the import of one or more names of real entities i e to show the genealogy or to borrow an expression from the mathematicians the genesis of the fictitious entity from the observation by which for example the words duties and rights are here spoken of as names of fictitious entities let it not for a moment so much as be supposed that in either instance the reality of the object is meant to be denied in any sense in which in ordinary language the reality of it is assumed one question however may be ventured to be proposed for consideration viz whether supposing no such sensations as pleasure or pain duties would not be altogether without force and rights altogether without value on this occasion in the case of the name of a fictitious entity a distinction requires to be made between the root of the idea and the root of the word by which it is designated thus in the case of obligation if the above conception be correct the root of the idea is in the ideas of pain and pleasure but the root of the word employed as a sign for the designation of that idea is altogether different it lies in a material image employed as an archetype or emblem viz the image of a cord or any other tie or band from the latin ligo to bind by which the object in question is bound or fastened to any other the person in question bound to a certain course of practice thus for the explanation of a fictitious entity or rather of the name of a fictitious entity two perfectly distinct species of operations call them paraphrasis and archetypation will in every case require to be performed and the corresponding sorts of propositions which are their respective results formed viz the paraphrasis performing the function of a definition but in its form not coinciding with any proposition to which that name is commonly attached the paraphrasis consists in taking the word that requires to be expounded—viz the name of a fictitious entity—and after making it up into a phrase applying to it another phrase which being of the same import shall have for its principal and characteristic word the name of the corresponding real entity in a definition a phrase is employed for the exposition of a single word in a paraphrasis a phrase is employed for the exposition of an entire phrase of which the word proposed to be expounded is made to constitute the principal or characteristic word archetypation a word employed for shortness rather than archetypophantia i e indication of the archetype or pattern consists in indicating the material image of which the word taken in its primæval sense contains the expression thus without being drawn out into form an operation for which a multitude of distinctions and discussions would be found requisite in the case of the word obligation both the paraphrasis and the archetypation may be deduced from what is indicated above rhizophantia indication of the root might serve as a common or generic term applicable to both to return to analysis it is by an operation of the nature of analysis primæval analysis that the ideas designated by the several names of fictitious entities have been formed unfortunately in the case of these fictitious objects the description of the way in which the analysis must or may have been performed will be matter of much more difficulty than in the case of the abovementioned real ones not to leave the field of fictitious entities and with it the corresponding part of the field of logical analysis in the state of an utterly dark spot thus much has here been hazarded and here it is high time that what has been said on the subject of analysis should be brought to a close unfortunately here are not only new words but these in a multitude greater by the whole number than would have been employed could the ideas intended have at any cheaper rate been conveyed but he who in any branch of art and science ethics itself not excepted is resolved not to have anything to do with new words resolves by that very resolution to confine himself to the existing stock of ideas and opinions how great soever the degree of incorrectness imperfection error and mischievousness which may in those ideas and opinions happen to be involved one parting word in relation to dalembert lest from the indication given in a preceding section §   of the imperfections observable in his encyclopædical tree any unduly unfavourable estimate of the instruction derivable from the philosophical works of that illustrious frenchman should be deduced with the exception of that which contains the encyclopædical tree the five volumes of miscellanies which comprise his philosophical works had not been opened for some thirty or forty years when in expectation of finding in one of them the germ of what has here been said on the subject of fictitious entities it was thought necessary to run over it in that particular the search has not been successful but in the course of it ample ground has been seen for the conclusion that although with eyes closed by prudence or rather by necessity treading in the steps of his illustrious precursor he on that occasion kept himself below the level of his own age yet on every succeeding occasion he may be seen rising high above it in the two last of those five volumes are contained applications successively and everywhere more or less successfully made of the allcomprehending and allcommanding art of logic to every subjacent part of the field of art and science by a recent but still imperfect review of it such as time and eyes would allow of much regret has been suggested at the thoughts of its never having yet it is believed been brought within the reach of the english reader for even at the present comparatively advanced period much useful instruction as well as to a comprehensive mind much gratification might surely be reaped from a critical perusal of it consummate surely is the originality the comprehensiveness the penetration the discernment the moderation the prudence the elegance of expression and amidst surrounding dangers the steersmanship manifested in that work it is for that age what for the present generation the present work would have endeavoured to render itself could any such endeavour have found a ray of hope to animate it of those volumes the fourth has for its title essai sur lcs elémens de philosophie ou sur les principes des connoissances humaines the fifth under the name of eclaircissemens c contains supplements to some of the principal articles of the preceding volume it speaks of itself as having been written at the desire of frederic the great of prussia in a translation the supplements might with advantage it is believed be worked up along with the original articles and prefixed to both might be the contents of the first volume of the five viz the preliminary discourse attached to the first french encyclopædia and the preface to the third volume of that great work on the subject of analysis however the conceptions of dalembert iv             c seem not much more correct than those of condillac by their manner of speaking of it one would think it was a sort of instrument by which everything is done in general the attention paid by men of science to the greek language seems not to have been so general in france as in britain particularly as in england yet even in the logic of saunderson who can scarcely be suspected of not being well conversant with greek the account given of analysis and synthesis for by him they are both spoken of has not been found a clear one by an observation taken of the archetypal image had this use of the correspondent operation been sufficiently understood all this observation might have been prevented in the case of every name of an immaterial object the archetype is at once an index and a holdfast to the sense of it in the case of every name of a fictitious entity the only sure test of intellection is paraphrasis  some fourscore years ago by david hume in his treatise on human nature the observation was for the first time it is believed brought to light—how apt men have been on questions belonging to any part of the field of ethics to shift backwards and forwards and apparently without their perceiving it from the question what has been done to the question what ought to be done and vice versá more especially from the former of these points to the other some fiveandforty years ago on reading that work—from which however in proportion to the bulk of it no great quantity of useful instruction seemed derivable that observation presented itself to the writer of these pages as one of cardinal importance to every eye by which those two objects have not been completely separated from each other the whole field of ethics in all those divisions of it which the table will show must ever have been—yea and ever will be—a labyrinth without a clue such it has been in general for example to the writers on international law witness grotius and puffendorf in their hands and apparently without their perceiving it the question is continually either floating between these two parts of the field of ethics or shifting from one to the other in this state of things a name which such as deontology turns altogether upon this distinction—suppose any such name to become current the separation is effectually made and strong and useful will be the light thus diffused for ever over the whole field that this distinction should on every occasion be clearly perceived is need it be observed the interest of the great bulk of mankind unfortunately this most extensive interest finds opposed to it a cluster of particular interests which though so much narrower being but the more concentrated have ever been acting against it with proportionable advantage and hitherto with irresistible effect one day these particular interests will be recognised on the present occasion to attempt bringing them to view would be consistent neither with the unity of the design nor perhaps with prudence  the necessity to which we are subjected by the imperfection of the instrument for the purposes of discourse the necessity of mixing falsehood with truth on pain of being without ideas as well as without conversation on some of the most interesting of the subjects that lie within the pale of our cognizance is productive but too abundantly of misconception and false reasoning and this not only in the physical department of the field of thought discourse and action but also in every other on pain of having some of the most interesting subjects of thought discourse and action undiscoursed of and even unthought of we set to work the powers of our imaginations in the creation as it were of a multitude of imaginary beings all spoken of as if they belonged to the class of bodies or substances and on the occasion and for the purpose of this creation we attach to them a name or sign called a part of speech viz a species of word termed a noun substantive the same species of word as that of which in the character of a common name we make use for the designation of real entities appertaining strictly and properly to the class of substances beholding at a distance in the dress of a man sitting and playing upon an organ an automaton figure constructed for that purpose by the ingenuity of the mechanist to take this creature of human art for a real man is a sort of mistake which at a certain distance might happen for a time to be made by the most acute observer in like manner beholding a part of speech cast in the same mould with the name of a real entity a really existing substance no wonder if on a variety of occasions to the mental eye of a very acute observer this fictitious entity thus accoutred should present itself in the character of and be regarded and treated as if it were a real one how should it be otherwise when on every occasion on which and by every person by whom it is spoken of at all it is spoken of as if it were a real entity and thus in a manner an universal attestation is given to the truth of a set of propositions the falsity of which when once brought to view cannot in any instance fail to be recognised  the idea of motion is capable of being deduced from difference of position without any difference of distance as well as from difference of distance but being much more complicated the description of that case is on that account omitted † see this division discussed at length under the head of ontology in this volume—ed ‡ not so in

meant to be announced was probably that by this construction the force generated is economised—ed † some thirty or forty years ago an hungarian of the name of kempel applied to me to consult with me about an invention of his which he regarded as an improvement on the steamengine it consisted in the omission of the piston in such sort that the steam as fast as generated and without being recondensed should operate immediately and in the open air upon the floatboards of a waterwheel in which case before it had time to lose all its extra caloric and with it all its elastic force some small quantity of motion though comparatively a very small one might occasionally be expected to be generated it might be termed an open steamengine will it be believed this was the same kempel by whose inventions of the automaton chessplayer and the automaton speakingchild the curious were in most parts of europe so much surprised and gratified the chessplayer in the character of a turk was beaten by very few christians and i know not whether the contrivance by which the motion was communicated from the directing mind to the chessman was ever divulgated or discovered the child though at

right angles to it  to the inhabitants of classical antiquity the use of springs seems scarcely to have been known neither in latin nor in greek has any word been found that seems to have been employed in the designation of it in any one of the instruments found in any one of the buried cities is any example of a spring to be found † when into an electric jar an extra quantity of electric power has been infused the jar is said to be charged by analogy a spring when the quantity of latent motion on which its action depends has been infused into it may be said to be charged  alarmclocks are innoctious and useful applications of this kind—ed  affinity unhappily chosen surely was this appellation instead of being expressive so far from being characteristic it seems to be not merely inexpressive but misexpressive   in other cases in the only cases which when application of it to this purpose was first made could have been in view affinity was employed to designate the bond of connexion which has place amongst members of the same family and as such designated by one common name according to this analogy all acids for example being of the same family and designated by one common name it is amongst these that affinity should be said to have place amongst all these saline bodies how great soever may be their number and so in regard to alkalies and no as between one acid or all acids on one part and an alkali or all alkalies on the other   in this case for employing the term attraction the same reason has place as in any of those other cases by the term electric attraction this analogy is expressed by the term affinity if the word be used in those other cases or any of them it is virtually disaffirmed   by the epithet elective intimation is given of those preferences that prodigiously complicated system of preferences as between element and element by which this species of relation is so conspicuously distinguished of this system by the word affinity not any the slightest intimation is conveyed  in a still greater degree this contraction takes place in several instances in the case of solution as just explained but being smelted what is it but being dissolved in caloric  in the case of the streets for example which run at right angles between the river thames and the strand if during a certain part of the twentyfour hours the exclusive use of the street could be secured to the coaldealers by whose carts coals are conveyed from the river to their destination in the several adjacent streets and roads of the metropolis and its neighbourhood considerable saving in the article of horses might thus it is supposed be made in the way of apparatus the rope and pulley excepted nothing more would be necessary than a line of strong uprights in number proportioned to the length of the street each of which stationed in the middle of its breadth and turning on a hinge might in a direction parallel to its length be lowered and placed in a horizontal position on the expiration of the portion of the twentyfour hours allotted to this service of these coalcarts every one that went up full would have to come down empty here then would be an occasion in which the draught upwards might have for its assistance if time could be made to suit not only the weight of such horses as belonging to that same carriage had been sent up the declivity for the purpose of drawing it up as they descended but the weight of an empty and returning carriage with the horses employed in drawing it so in regard to other goods at large generally speaking and bating the effect of any particular goods by which the natural equality between the weight of goods exported from and that of goods imported to a mass of water used for conveyance may happen to be disturbed for every ton of goods conveyed up the declivity there would be a ton of other goods conveyed down it and thus to the assistance afforded by the descending carriages would be added that afforded by the descending goods in this way then supposing the circumstances to admit of the requisite agreement amongst the several proprietors of goods and other parties interested calculation would soon show the multitude of horses which might by this means be saved in the case where no animal is employed in the draught it has not unfrequently happened to me to be an eyewitness of the exemplification of this principle of economy in the case where in the production of this same effect animal draught is employed it has never happened to me to see or hear of any instance of its being put to use in this country in russia in the year      under the direction of my brother sir samuel bentham with whom for anything that either of us know or knew to the contrary the idea had originated i saw it put in practice and it was pleasing to observe in how high a degree while the quantity of matter conveyed up the declivity was increased the toil of the horses was diminished about the year      i remember his communicating the idea by word of mouth to the intelligent and useful servant of the public mr samuel more then secretary to the society of arts but i have not heard that

case of the sort of proposition called a problem has accordingly been done when any such phrase as the demonstration of a proposition occurs the sort of proposition which on any such occasion is most apt to present itself is a theorem and this not only because theorems more frequently occur than problems but because in the case of a problem the term demonstration will not apply in such manner as

a distinction which may be seen to be itself a source of unclearness—viz of that sort which is termed obscurity for the purpose of exposition one of the instruments or operations they employ is definition to which again they apply another instrument viz division a definition say they is either a definition of the name or a definition of the thing meaning evidently of the thing—of the object of which the word is employed as a name now in the account thus given of the matter a proposition is implied which is not true viz that where the definition is a definition of a thing it never is the definition of the name whereas in truth it always is of the distinction which they had in view the form they should have employed seems to be this a definition is either a definition of the word alone or a definition of the thing by means of the word a definition of the thing signified—meant to be expressed by it  dictionaries of languages that is where the words of one language are expounded by giving the corresponding words of another dictionaries in a single language generally comprehend almost every species of exposition  see chap ix sec viii † an excellent illustration of definition in contradistinction to other modes of exposition is afforded by the characteristic phrases of writers on the physical sciences in which those characters alone are given which are necessary to

he is intended to receive being referred to description of which i shall speak farther on a great light would be thrown on the pneumatological branches of science were the like exactness to be given to the definition of words in use wherever definition may be employed with advantage in the case of all terms of very general import it will be found much more useful to consider them as genera generalissima and expound them by other means but when once the import of these genera is fixed definition should be applied to and persevered in to the greatest extent possible the advantage of this

for ever continue to have existence those which are regarded as being in the contrary case being for distinction sake termed varieties in such sort that by the term variety is expressed an aggregate subordinate to and contained within some one species of which it is a variety but of these attributions of everlasting immutability in the one case and mutability on the other there can never be any ground stronger than conjecture a conjecture which though by experience found to be so far true as that the acting in conformity to the indication afforded by it is found to be productive of practical benefit yet is every now and then found to be erroneous accordingly it is with suitable diffidence that the existence of the sort of distinction in question is commonly announced—that such a collection of marks is indicative of a species and not of a variety that such another of a mere variety and not of a species thus it is that species in the botanical or say phytological sense differs

interconvertible terms but if there be any difference methodization is that one of the two of which the field of applicability is most extensive compared with the word arrangement the word methodization seems to have acquired more of an eulogistic sense and accordingly in company with the idea of arrangement to convey the intimation that in the instance in question it has been well conducted and that to the result of it the laudatory adjunct good may with propriety be applied and in so far as this is the case the consequence is that in any instance in which the sentiment of approbation is not intended to be annexed to the disposition what is considered as having been or being about to be made the eulogistic term methodization would not be so suitable to the design as the more neutral term arrangement or the word disposition where the nature of the case admits of the employing a word the import of which is so much more ample and consequently so much more lax considered as names expressive of the result of this action or operation the words order method and taken in this additional sense the word arrangement seem to want but little if anything of being interconvertible order however seems as well as the word method to have imbibed somewhat of an eulogistic tinge—a tinge from which in this sense as well as the former the word arrangement appears to be if not altogether free much more so than either of those two ‡ it will be observed that many of the subjects treated under the head of methodization are such as logical writers generally refer to

the less inflected languages have the advantage over the more inflected languages not only in simplicity but in forcea in the english by the separate auxiliary words by which the modifications

verbal matter saved by the employing the word shall in its imperative sense that besides giving to the english pro tanto a degree of simplicity and force not possessed by any of those southernly derived languages dead or living it may almost be said to give to it a degree of copiousness equally peculiar why because in the expressing by means of the necessary circumlocution the import of the imperative shall so many words would be necessary that the mind has not patience to draw them out and so they remain unexhibited a the same modifications which in the least inflected languages are

it has been deemed necessary to pursue is not the same with but very different from the order in which in the progress of society they were developed by the distinctions pointed out by the different

of the sort of mental process styled methodization in which is included a high degree of abstraction a comparatively mature state of the human intellect was requisite and not only at the time of the

expense of maintenance at a rate supposed to be too high the neat value of the service of a male child from birth up to twentyone after all deductions on the score of death and sickness appeared to be £    s  d and a fraction payable at birth—increasing of course with each year of age up to a sum amounting to £     s  d and a fraction at the commencement of the eighth year of age—from which period on account of there being fewer and fewer years of positive value to come it went on diminishing in this calculation there is nothing but what is perfectly consistent with the known and indisputable fact of the universal burdensomeness of children in the existing order of things in all ranks of life and in particular among the selfmaintaining poor in the early stages of the period of nonage a large proportion of the natural value or capacity of yielding a clear profit is lost by lying unemployed for want of time opportunity intelligence and capital on the part of the parents to turn it to account in the latter stages by the dissipation of the produce by the minor himself rendered independent of his parents by the faculty of selfmaintenance in the habitual purchase of luxuries to an amount which is more than equal to that of necessaries as is demonstrated by his being obliged and able to do without them when out of the same earnings he has a wife and children to maintain in the married state—see book iii ch ii mendicity extirpated book v ch v prospect of success and book iii ch v frugality assisted—under these circumstances no wonder that the pecuniary value of a child reckoning from the beginning to the conclusion of this period should be generally regarded as negative in this country especially considering that it really is so—in a high degree and without any exception—in the case of the superior and liberallyeducated classes—that is in the experience of all who either write or speculate upon the subject—for the particulars of profit and loss upon this

predetermined and already entered on written or printed forms the scribe will have little or nothing to do but under these heads to set down individual objects by their names and aggregates by their quantities  in the form called the italian bookkeeping is a science of itself and a most intensely difficult one happily it is not here a necessary one it is not practised in any of the existing poorhouses nor what is much more material on any of the occasions in which national accounts are delivered in to parliament—thus much seemed necessary to be intimated lest a large number of professed bookkeepers thoroughly initiated in the intricacies of the italian mode should be regarded as a necessary part of the official establishment of each industryhouse and an acquaintance with their language a necessary condition to the faculty of understanding the accounts—on the former supposition the expense would be great indeed and on the latter the security for good management as well as the satisfaction to the public not a little weakened if two copies of one and the same original the waste book may be of use in the character of checks of how much greater use will not two original accounts be kept by two uncommunicating hands for instance in the case of articles transferred from house to house the transferinwards book of the one house and the transfer outwards book of the other—in the public accounts the method is the method called for by the subjectmatter and the occasion and the language is the language in use with everybody would public accounts be rendered the clearer by translating them into a language composed entirely of fictions and understood by nobody but the higher class of merchants and their clerks the real use of the peculiarities which characterize the italian mode might be a subject well worthy of investigation i mean in the situations in which it is at present employed for here every purpose of the italian mode might be answered and answered in perfection—i give it as the result of a particular and very laborious inquiry by a set of heads taken exclusively from the ordinary language † to save the delay and danger of error that might result from determining in the first instance to what methodical head they belong to—and to preserve a constant assurance that nothing is omitted ‡ if there be an officers misbehaviourbook

procedure observed by a wise and good man in private life in the character of a father or the master of a family within the sphere of his authority—the procedure of the domestic tribunal—is a standard by which the fitness of a system of judicial procedure—the procedure of public tribunals—may be tried—the mode of procedure observable in such a tribunal as that of the proposed industryhouse is a standard of still greater simplicity and perfection the real difficulties that in some cases obstruct the procurement of evidence constitute but one cause indeed but that the principal one of the necessity which really exists in some cases of deviating from these standards—compare with either of them the refusal to examine parties in the common law courts—civil as well as criminal—and the practice of examining parties—but in writing only and after a six weeks months and fortnights time for fabrication—in what are called the equity courts—delay is spoken of by montesquieu as if it were of the essence of justice and as if the greater the delay the better the justice but delay without special cause—all delay that takes place of course and previous to the knowledge of the case—is—so long as it lasts—injustice lawyers under the notion of coming at the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth—lawyers of all nations—have in the instance of certain classes of witnesses differing in their list of these classes without end refused to judge whether the narrative be or be not a true one—assuming that there are but two degrees of probity in this respect among mankind—that of the everlying and that of the neverlying—and not considering or not sufficiently considering that a refusal to hear any sort of witness—how depraved soever—is a license to commit in the presence of that sort of witness all imaginable crimes apply these rules of inaudibility to a population composed exclusively of convicted felons  concerning which see ch vi—diet  in the higher

and prejudiced parent but will not so much as diminish it in the estimation of the child forty pounds is no uncommon price for a house provided for the lodgment of a waxen child and for the amusement

be administered everywhere is probable † the question whether any instruction of the literary kind ought to be administered and the details of the system of instruction which if any would be the properest to be administered in such a situation must be reserved for the body of the work  at present if a single man be a selfconveying animal a poor man with a family is virtually immoveable and if without his family he goes in quest of employment he is punished by the parish as for desertion under the name of a vagrant † exorbitant wages and still more deep fluctuating wages are the bane of happiness as well as morality among improvident and uncultivated minds stagnation is ruin a fall produces the sensation of a tax a rise drives a man into sensual excesses—excesses which in one who for want of education has no fund of selfamusement no other tastes to gratify are fatal to health industry and content ‡ even previously to the institution of the proposed company no inconsiderable advance might be made towards the equalisation and stabilitation of wages by tables of trades or to speak more comprehensively of profityielding occupations with their correspondent earnings—an existing publication professing to include this object gives but a very small part of the number of the trades the author of this having collected as many again without supposing himself to have gone half way towards a perfect list—judging from the state and comparison of the classes of interests concerned so much at least of the plan as concerns the reduction of exorbitant wages bids fair for being executed inasmuch as the parties to whose interests it is favourable are the major part as well in number as in opulence and power the classes to whose interests it is advantageous are—  the class of consumers that is everybody—  the class of masteremployers—  the class of underpaid hands—the only class to which it is disadvantageous is the class of overpaid hands to these it cannot but be confessed to be in a certain point of view disadvantageous since to their immediate feelings it cannot but be galling—however advantageous to their lasting interests it is only in some such indirect and remote in some such gentle and uncoercive way that government can occupy itself to any good effect either in raising sinking or steadying prices operating not by the creation of inducements but by bringing into notice inducements which spring of themselves from other sources  this latter has been materially amended by    geo iii c    as to settlements see editorial note at

the roughness of the times  thus if a farthing only were lent and only for a day a farthing is still the interest that would be paid for it—of course the least sum a man would ever borrow would be the largest sum the interest of which would be paid for by a farthing at the rate of six per cent per annum for the time he borrowed it for  these four first articles it should be observed are common to married and single and to both sexes † these fifth and sixth articles though peculiar to married persons in respect of the existence of the exigency are almost peculiar to single persons in respect of the faculty of laying up the means of supplying it i e the faculty of saving out of earnings a fund adequate to the purpose and for that reason apply almost exclusively to males supposing the widow to have lived in every instance till the youngest of the children had attained the age and faculty of selfmaintenance and by that time to have arrived at the age of superannuation childmaintenanceprovision and widowmaintenanceprovision would both be consolidated as it were into one efficient cause of demand taking place immediately upon the commencement of the widowhood in the instance of this lowest class as in that of the superior classes—and so long as the widow and the children under the age of selfmaintenance were all living whatever provision could be made for the family would naturally require to be managed and administered by the widow to whom as the children attained the age and faculty of selfmaintenance the benefit of the saving resulting from this diminution of the burden would naturally accrue such accordingly is the form naturally given to the provision made in favour of wives and families in the classes whose habits are superior to that of ordinary daylabour and whose income affords a surplus capable of purchasing a provision in this way superior to the style of provision connected with those habits but in the daylabouring class the surpluses being so scanty whatever supply could be provided would require to be cut down and shaped as closely as possible to the exigency in the instance of the widow it would accordingly be to be shaped not to the whole of her remainder of life but only to the helpless or superannuation part of it and in the instance of the children not to an undefined multitude of contingent children and that during their respective periods of nonage but to each actual child and to him or her no longer than to the commencement of the age of selfmaintenance which in this class may take place before the period of nonage is half elapsed ‡ this seventh article an article peculiar to single persons applies more particularly to males by reason of their greater surplus of earnings the earnings of the stronger sex being as it should seem not only absolutely greater but bearing a greater ratio to the necessary expense of maintenance besides that the faculty of obtaining employment appears to be more assured  the average earnings of a male of the above description south britain taken throughout can hardly be set down at less than  s aday the year throughout— s by the working week making by the working year £     s—in the county of sutherland in north britain £     and no more is the customary personal expenditure of an unmarried man according to a statement reported by the rev mr davies in his case of the poor p  00 and the sufficiency of the allowance is indubitable since according to the same statement nearly as much is laid up as a fund for housekeeping and marriage nothing is set down for rent but then  s is set down for merrymaking i e drinking fermented liquors and the one it should seem may be set against the other a fourth of £     s is £    s—so that what the scotchman spends is not so much as onefourth of what the englishman earns what the scotchman does live upon by choice the englishman could live upon if he chose for oatmeal and potatoes the scotchmans only food in sutherland do not cost less there it is supposed than in england it seems probable that in point of real cost they would even cost least in england i e might be raised for less land and labour though on the other hand the rent that must be paid for the land is probably higher in england than in sutherland the excess of expense on the one score and the deficiency on the other may perhaps without much error be set the one against the other at glasgow indeed the average customary personal expense of a married man of this class is set as high as £    —see letter to the citizens of glasgow—glasgow april         attributed to the rev dr porteous—it is natural that in and about that great and thriving commercial town expenses should be higher than in the thinly inhabited county of sutherland but i cannot help suspecting that the expenses of the man are here rated rather too high since in the same statement the expenses of the woman are rated at no more than £     not much more than half those of the man and the expenses of an average child being one of a family of four children are rated at no more than £    not more than half those of the woman and not much more than a quarter of those of the man—as will readily be expected the circumstances brought to view in this note have been materially changed since      in glasgow labourers wages and expenditure differ but slightly from those of the same employments in england by the new statistical account of scotland it appears that in sutherland day labourers wages average  s  d per day—ed  bankers safe and even unpaid are not wanting to the rich without the aid of some special institution such as that here proposed such bankers will always be wanting to the poor especially to the lowest paid who are the most

distinguishable part of the territory of south britain as diversified by local situation age sex condition in respect of marriage and occupation but if place differs materially from place in healthiness it is not the rate of mortality in any one place that can afford an adequate indication of the rate of mortality for the whole territory taken together much less for each separate part of it if the proportions of mortality as between age and age in different places are materially different it is not the proportion in any one place that can afford an adequate indication of the proportion for the whole territory together much less for each separate part of it if the rate of mortality all ages taken together is in all places taken together or in any particular place different as between occupation and occupation an average rate made out from all occupations taken together will not in any place suit the case of him whose occupation is of the healthiest cast nor of him whose occupation is of the unhealthiest cast in particular so great have been the differences observed in the rate of mortality as between place and place that there cannot anywhere be that place the rate of mortality in which how accurately soever ascertained and for whatever length of time can present any tolerable assurance of its affording an adequate sample of the average or mean rate for the whole territory taken together much less a sample that shall at once be adequate for the most unhealthy and the most healthy situations—for great towns and for country places—for marshes and for mountains—the rate of mortality employed by dr price and adopted by mr morgan is that which is exhibited by northampton and the rate pitched upon by these celebrated calculators is that which bids the fairest chance for being assumed at least presents the fairest claim to be assumed by each of the several friendly societies wherever situated yet in northampton the number of the living is to the number of annual deaths according to dr price no more than as    and a fraction to   but at the same time in the average of seven places reported by mr howlett see howlett on the poor      p    two of

places taken together about equal to that of northampton—the probability of life consequently more than twice as high as in the spot which seems likely to have been taken for a general standard this is not a place to investigate the consequences of the error supposing the northampton standard to be an unsuitable one but that it gives the rate of vitality—the probability of life—too low for the whole kingdom taken together may be suspected from the above instances much more for all country places taken together in contradistinction to towns and still more for situations above par in point of healthiness and if there be an error the amount of it may it is evident be very considerable—dr price p   0  th edition proposes a plan for a society in which superannuation annuities are to be combined with weekly payments during sickness if the probabilities of life he concludes are lower among the labouring poor than among the generality of mankind this plan will be surer of succeeding—meaning by succeeding not the formation of the bank but the preservation of its solvency this is as much as to say that if in any place the probabilities of life are higher among the labouring poor than among the generality of mankind i e persons of all classes taken together at northampton this same plan will in such place be so much the surer of not succeeding but in the seven places abovementioned the probabilities of life taking the whole population together are as we have seen more than twice as high as at his standard place northampton what effect an error to this amount viz upwards of cent per cent and which certainly is not by a great deal the greatest to be found in the general rate of mortality may have upon the solvency of a bank of the kind in question is what i have not taken upon me to investigate—not so great i suspect as upon this statement it may be apt to appear—but what we cannot at least avoid suspecting is that according to the doctors own notions a society for the purpose in question instituted upon his plan in any of the above or any other of the situations in which the probability of life is from twice to thrice as great as in this his standard place would be little less than sure of not succeeding in these seven places it is true the whole population of all ranks is comprised—but so is it at northampton—and as the labouring poor alone are to the whole population in the one case so are they probably with little or no difference in the other and since in all places the labouring poor constitute the great bulk of the population the difference between the rate of mortality among the sum total of the labouring poor and the rate among the sum total of the population cannot in any place be very great—in the case of provision for a widow by annuity commencing at widowhood the commencement of the burden upon the fund being not only distant as in case of superannuation annuities but subject to contingency upon contingency selfpartial hope has so much the wider field to range in of the several widowprovision banks which had been opened before the entrance of dr price into this field of inquiry such as had arrived at the trying period of their existence had all been broken up through the experienced insufficiency of their fund and the rest have been broken up since by the assurance of the future insufficiency of it as demonstrated by dr price though constituted by societies of a magnitude in many instances much superior to any that appears to be common or even to have an example among what are termed the friendly societies see the histories of these failures in dale and price the protraction of the solvency of a bank of this kind too advantageous to the customer to be secure depends upon the influx of succeeding customers if the influx continues copious and steady enough the original members by their representatives reap the benefit of the deception if the influx fails at a certain period the deception recoils upon the authors of the societies instituted for securing a provision for old age a great part perhaps the greatest part appear now to be exposed to the same

scrutiny into health previous to admission the only subsequent objects of inquiry being matters of fact of a nature little exposed to dispute—viz the celebration of marriage between two persons and the death of one of them   will have the better chance of being well conducted the smaller the society since the smaller the society the greater the inteterest which prompts to scrutiny   its chance

insolvency under a plan of calculation grounded on an average of ages and a supposed regular scale of mortality as between age and age will be certain and enormous  combinations of this tendency and of the most pernicious kind are said to exist among the societies composed of london servants  childmaintenance provision where the demand for it results from the coexistence of an extra number of children under the selfmaintaining age is an exigency not altogether incapable of being thus provided for on its own bottom and even in the way of insurance for however the reducing the amount of the exigency below any given amount may physically speaking not be out of the power of the parties such a result being attainable by abstinences repugnant to the object of the institution yet the increasing the amount of the exigency that is the number of the children produced by any given marriage is a result not subject to the will of the individual as marriage itself apparent idleness or apparent failure of employment are whatever were the chance in respect of the coexistent number of burdensome children found to obtain at any period might therefore be safely taken as the permanent amount of the chance since no other cause than the desirable event of a general increase in the national rate of vitality could occasion it to be exceeded but the calculations would be complicated and the stock of data requisite in the capacity of grounds for calculation is such as is not to be obtained without the aid of government inasmuch as a complete enumeration of the whole population would be absolutely indispensable and when once made it were better for this as well as so many other purposes that it should be regularly kept up at any rate the sale of annuities coenduring with this exigency would it is evident be a business of too much complication and delicacy and would require funds of too great a magnitude to lie within the sphere of ability of any of the local associations but by the proposed company supposing the data to be but obtained it might be conducted with perfect safety and regularity to the great advantage of the industrious and frugal individual as also of the company if the company thought fit to take a share in it among the cluster of donations proposed with too little thought of the ways and means and among the least exceptionable in its principle was that of a gratuitous allowance for extrachildren altogether at the public charge a bounty to a more supportable amount upon that same principle might be afforded by enabling the company at the public expense to insure a family against the burden for a premium in such proportion inferior to what would be an equivalent as should be thought fit but whether this expensive mode of affording relief would be preferable to the unexpensive mode of administering it by the taking of extrachildren upon the footing of companys apprentices the reader is by this time in a condition to judge  concerning the age of trial see dale and price † whatever may be the amount of this collateral mischief nothing of imprudence or oversight can with justice be laid on this account to the score of government government did not make these societies it found them ready made by the special protection it holds out to them it has afforded itself its surest chance for their attachment as well as a peculiar title to their allegiance after all what it gives as a boon to this privileged part of its subjects in the shape of a reward for virtue is no more than what government owes as a debt to all subjects without distinction—accessible justice and liberty of residence the last a blessing the loss of which the baneful fruit of the existing poor laws is a misfortune peculiar to this land of

alternative than between the leaving a servant to share in the undistinguishing provision of a common poorhouse and giving him a complete maintenance does nothing † in regard to all these particulars

point on the temper and humour of the parents or those who stand in the place of parents on whose part every degree of caprice and tyranny so long as it keeps clear of injuries threatening danger to life and limb may vent itself without control and as to what depends upon the conduct of the youths themselves towards one another that is of the stronger towards the weaker even those great schools

the selfmaintaining poor all round every one of the two hundred and fifty industryhouses may be a wateringplace  the maximum of clear happiness is the object and the sole object of every rational plan of conduct public or private in this line as in every other—concomitant and consequent inconveniences out of the question—the maximum of enjoyment gives the maximum of clear happiness but the longer the duration of any source of enjoyment nothing being lost in other respects the greater the sum of enjoyment and the duration is the longer nothing being lost in other respects the earlier the commencement pecuniary difficulties being removed as they are here the inconveniences to be considered and guarded against are—  physical—the danger to health and strength from a too early indulgence of which amongst other ill consequences premature termination might be one—  moral—such if any as may be to be apprehended from the entering into a state of power as well as independence before the intellectual faculties have attained a growth commensurate to that state whatever may be the period suggested by a due consideration of the delay necessary to the avoidance of these inconveniences thus much will not be liable to dispute—viz that every portion of time which without incurring them might have been passed in the social state and yet is suffered to pass away in celibacy is so much lost to happiness in the world at large what may be the average amount of this loss in the instance of the class in question is one of the many interesting objects observable in the political line of which no account and scarcely so much as any notice hath as yet been taken a great comfort is—that owing to causes sufficiently obvious and which are not to the present purpose—this loss is not quite so high in this lowest and most numerous as in the higher classes yet even in this class and in this country the number of years thus lost must upon any calculation or rather without any calculation leave a blank much to be regretted in the book of life in the proposed order of things among our apprentices—there need be no such loss at all regard to health—this one prudential consideration and this alone will in this privileged situation draw the line in private life considerations of the intellectual and moral kind conspire to keep back the period of social happiness faculties moral as well as intellectual must be ripe for the business of government—the business not of selfgovernment only but of familygovernment at oneandtwenty a youth will be allowed to be in general alike fit for selfgovernment and for the government of the little family empire and whether married or single it is at this age and not before according to the proposed plan as under the existing order of things that the management of his conduct will be in his own hands in regard to health at what precise point the line shall be drawn will be matter of consideration—it being a point not capable of being determined otherwise than by experiment it ought to be—it must be—committed to experiment nature shows the commencement of the ability—nature shows the commencement of the desire—how long must the ability continue useless how long must the desire be a source of vexation instead of enjoyment—questions surely not uninteresting—surely not undeserving of solution—to give the solution i see but one course—to take the visible commencement of physical maturity in each individual for the standard and basis of experiment from this startingpost to mark out periods of delay—three months—six months—nine months—and so on for a small—it surely need not be a large—number of years—twentyone in the male might be the utmost from thenceforward observe the condition of the classes—see whether

to give the equivalent in english words is not possible the intention of them seems to be to designate three degrees of criminality in general the highest standing first but this distinction has nothing to do with the nature of the offence it takes that offence for the greatest to which it has been the pleasure of the despot to attach the greatest punishment this was the distinction established by napoleon in the climax established in his penal code you have contravention delit crime of this order that which is here in view in your proposed spanish code seems to be the reverse by the word culpas i was led to suspect the distinction to have been borrowed from the roman law but though the ideas seem so to be in both instances in one of them the word is not the word culpas corresponds indeed to the roman culpa but the word delitos does not correspond to the roman dolus which word—a word that considering its meaning in the ordinary language namely deceit was miserably illchosen by the lawyer tribe so far as in their language it means anything means criminal consciousness their culpa meaning temerity pure from criminal consciousness a distinction piteously illadapted to the denoting of different classes of misdeeds it being applicable alike to all classes in gentlemens proposed code the first chapter consisting of one article has for its title de los delitos y culpas neither in the title nor in the body of the article is there any such word as faltas of delito a definition is given whereby the conception so far as discernible appears to correspond with that of criminal consciousness and in like manner culpa with temerity to these definitions such as they are no reference is made either in the articles here in question namely                 or in any other of the articles in which the words are employed—words to which meanings are attributed so different from any that any man can have found attached to them in ordinary discourse in relation

acknowledges three  note that in so far as all future evil is out of the question the loss to sufferers being supposed the same the evil produced by depredation is less than that produced by barren vexation by destruction and otherwise for in the case of depredation though the enjoyment produced is less than the suffering still to set against the suffering there is the enjoyment but when the future is taken into the account the future pregnant with the danger and the alarm—then it is that the evil from depredation may be seen to be greater than that from barren vexation the inducement that excites men to the productive injury being so much more extensive and constant as well as commonly stronger in its operation than that which excites them to the barren one † the analysis which immediately follows bears in the original mss a date two months apart from the more general analysis given above and perhaps the author would not himself have promulgated them in juxtaposition without some explanatory remarks as to the different arrangement adopted in the two cases it will be remarked that neither of them follows the exact order adopted in giving the securities in detail but they both go over the same ground—ed ‡ against vexation in these three shapes provision is of course already made in the existing system of law whatever it may be—and the vexatious act being made punishable secrecy is of course an accompaniment endeavoured to be given to it but when hands by which the injury is inflicted are of the number of those which are armed with power that power extends to the giving to the whole operation a degree of secrecy beyond any which could be given to it by ordinary and powerless hands and for the maintenance of secrecy even where power is irresistible the avoidance of odium affords commonly an adequate inducement by the arrangements proposed under these heads secrecy will be found combated by instruments of elucidation of which none are everywhere in use and of which some are not anywhere as yet in use § if exercised by the sovereign himself the nature of the case admits not of a remedy but if exercised by this or that functionary subordinate to him a not impossible event is that this or that other functionary equally subordinate to him—for example a judicial functionary or set of functionaries shall hold themselves warranted—on the supposition that being unjust the sovereign has no participation in it—in declaring this supposition and proceeding upon it accordingly that is to say unless and until compelled by irresistable means to know that the sovereign himself is the person or of the number of the persons from whose will the vexation has emanated ∥ this article is necessary to complete the description of depredations the

subject such letters memorandums and other visible and tangible instruments of discourse by the communication of which to persons other than those for whose eyes they were intended vexation in almost any shape and to any amount in any one of an infinitely diversifiable variety of ways is liable to be produced so far as the only effect as well as object of the invasion is the furnishing evidence of a misdeed committed or meditated the vexation whatsoever might be the shape or the amount of it could not with propriety be spoken of by the appellation of oppression nor yet where as between individual and individual of the portion of visibly expressed discourse thus dealt with no other use is made other than the causing it to be subjected to inspection for a judicial purpose in the character or for the discovery of evidence of evidence tending to give validity or invalidity to this or that claim of right but by vexation committed in this shape by public functionaries without control oppression to an indefinite amount is capable of being produced on the occasion or on pretence of a search for evidence of a misdeed in this or that shape committed or not committed writings
