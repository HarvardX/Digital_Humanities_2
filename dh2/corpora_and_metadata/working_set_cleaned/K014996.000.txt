the case of england and the protestant interest since the present condition of the kingdom and the whole protestant interest by the conjunction of france and spain abroad and a a more horrid combination of several at home must needs affect with the most melancholy reflections all true english hearts such as have any real love or zeal for their religion or their native country i cannot think it amiss to present a short and impartial view o such as have not considered the same  in the beginning of the last age the protestant interest in europe was more than a match for the roman catholic the kingdom of bohemia was almost all protestant near half the subjects of hungary of austria and moravia were protestant and did many times defend themselves by  against the emperor himself when oppressed by him for the sake of their religion that in germany the houses of newburgh were protestant the palatinates for the most part of them protestant of the strictest sort the saxons entirely protestant and being hearty unanimous and seated in the midst of germany were a bulwark and defense to the protestants of many other lesser states as often as they were oppressed for their religion by their own or their neighboring princes that many of the subjects of bavaria bamburgh cologn wurtzburgh and worms were protestants besides these that the protestants of france were so powerful as to maintain   or   civil wars in defense of their religion and always came off with advantage the vaudois in italy were all of them protestant and great numbers of the inhabitants of the spanish low countries were of the reformed religion besides england and holland and the northern kingdoms of denmark and sweden and duchy of brandenburgh were entirely protestant but now instead of this is not the protestant power destroyed almost over europe the whole kingdom of bohemia entirely popish are not the protestants of poland austria moravia utterly destroyed is not their destruction now carrying on and almost finished in hungary in germany the newburghers of protestants are become fierce enemies of the protestant religion the protestants of bavaria bamburgh cologn wurtzburgh and worms are all destroyed in france the spanish low countries savoy and vaudois after long and mighty struggles the religion is utterly extinguished against the poor palatinates the persecution is now carrying on with its usual barbarity and their neighbors the saxons are so far from being able to help them that they are under the fearful apprehensions of suffering the like from their own prince lately turned roman catholic to obtain the kingdom of poland so soon as his wars with sweden and other troubles created him by his polish and lithuanian subjects will give him leave besides this two northern princes have given great cause to suspect their conversion to the romish religion that sweden by its separation from the rest of europe by the baltic is unable to give assistance to the protestants in any part of europe without the consent of the german princes bordering on the baltic which will never be granted by papists in favor of the protestants  thus the protestant religion which had spread it self over almost all europe which had gained the entire possession of some countries the greater part of others and mighty interest in most has through the restless malice and endeavors of its enemies been subverted and destroyed in country after county till it is at last reduced to a little corner of what it once possessed england and holland and do we think our enemies will not accomplish what they have thus prosperously carried on so far our utter destruction is it not high time then to think our selves in danger to look about us to enquire what it is has thus weakend us brought us so near our ruin what measures will certainly accomplish it and what we must take for the prevention of it  the romish methods of converting the protestants have been in all countries the same viz confiscation of their estates goals and imprisonments ire and sword dragooning and massacring and inflicting the most inhuman torments that rage and fury could invent upon such whose resolution and zeal for their religion could not be moved by the former means  if this be the true case of england and the protestant religion then what is wanting to give the finishing stroke to our destruction but only an ability in the king of france to break the powers of england and holland and when we consider how in the year      the king of france marched his army through the midst of flanders fell directly upon holland then unprovided entered their strongest towns like open villages some without defense or almost denial most of them without any blows at all and all of them with very few and made himself master of three parts of holland in   months time for which sir w t k c iis ambassador then in holland tells us the reason was that the dutch then not suspecting such a thing had no fieldarmy sufficient to encounter their enemies or succor any town that walled towns will not defend the men within unless the hearts of the men will defend their walls that no garrison will make any resolute defense without the prospect or hopes at least of relief it is true that the french king having then all flanders on his back garrisoned with spanish troops then his implacable enemies a powerful army of the german princes matching upon him down the rhine spain and england alarmed by his successes preparing to attack him on all quarters was glad to vomit up all again and return home with as much precipitancy as he had invaded them least the provisions and retreat of his army through flanders should be cut off but now the case is otherwise he has possessed himself of flanders extended his dominion to the very frontiers of holland spain is all united to him some german princes then his enemies are now become his friends others entered into conditions of neutrality with him and should he now by a fatal battle which god of his infinite mer  break the dutch army which they have with infinite charge and matchless vigor gathered up from denmark brandenburgh and other remote countries of germany might he not enter the heart of their country and whence then can their strong cities and towns depend upon relief may he not as formerly enter em like open villages may he not as formerly possess himself of their whole country in less than one campaign it was the opinion of that great statesman sir wt that polland would make a stout resistance in any quarrel remote from their own doors but that which enables them their wealth to carry on a foreign war with vigor would in a war at home render em defenseless rich and populous towns are not fit for sieges or were ever known to make any long and resolute defense if this be our case if the whole power of the protestant religion rests now in a manner in england and holland if the destruction of england as well as of our holy religion must inevitably follow the loss of holland if holland by one unfortunate battle might happen to be lost in one campaign or less are we not in a most sad and deplorable condition and if some men are without their fears have we not the greater reason to fear for our selves our religion and our country what should we judge of those who tell us it is too early yet for england to declare the enemy has raised his armies furnished his magazines and it is too early for us to think of raising a man the enemy is before our outworks and it is too soon for us to prepare our selves to be on our guard will not those men tell us when holland is lost twill then be too late to what purpose will they say now do you think of raising forces is not the french king master of holland possessed of all their ports where will you land em to what use will you put em does not such language as this plainly show the intention of the authors is it not plainly to deliver us blindfold bound hand and foot into the enemies hand is not their design now so visible as not to be disguised do not some of the party begin to throw off the mask and tell us twill not be well with us till our old master returns till the government returns to its natural channel and are not those that were the very tools and instruments of popery and arbitrary power in former reigns and that owe their lives to acts of indemnity in this industriously represented by some as the patriots of their country and by a strange kind of paradox those that have been always hearty for the church and were for defending of it when others were for pulling it down that were hearty for the kings accession to the throne and to his person and government ever since are represented as betrayers of us as having sold us to france would it not be a piece of rare refined policy if france could hang up her greatest enemies under the nation of her dearest friends and give encouragement to her ancient frien under the notion of being her enemies  let us therefore while it is yet in our power as we tender our religion and our country use our utmost endeavors by all legal ways to assu his majesty and his government against all his and our enemies both at home and abroad and in the words of our liturgy let us offer up our most servent prayers to god amighty give peace in our time o lord because there is none other that figureth for us but only thou o god  finis
