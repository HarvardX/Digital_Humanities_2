comprehend the remainder of caernarvonshire the isle of anglesea the county of montgomery and conclude with some account of shrewsbury the ancient seat of the british princes which will complete the

whiteford our parish church and ascended the hill of garreg or the rock a high and most conspicuous part of the country the romans took advantage of it and placed on its summit a pharos a pharos to conduct the navigators to and from deva along the difficult channel of the seteia portus the building is still remaining i hope my friends will not deem me an antiquarian quixote and imagine me mistaking in this my second sally a building hitherto supposed to have been a windmill for a roman lighthouse it is tolerably entire its form is circular the height considerable the inner diameter twelve feet and a half the thickness of the walls four feet four inches the doors or entrances are opposite to each other over each is a square funnel like a chimney which opens on the outside about half way up the building on each side is a window about four feet from the ground are three circular holes lined with mortar as is frequent in roman buildings and penetrate the whole wall for purposes now unknown  withinside are the vestiges of a staircase which led to the floors of which there appear to have been two along such part of the upper which was conspicuous from the channel are eight small square openings cased with freestone the rest of the building being of rude limestone bedded in hard mortar and each of these were separated by wooden pannels placed in deep grooves the last still in a perfect state in each of these partitions were placed the lights which the romans thought necessary to keep distinct or to prevent from running into one lest they should be mistaken by seamen for a star periculum in corrivatione ignium ne sidus existimetur plini hist not lib xxxvi c      to the building is very evidently a broad and raised road pointing from the east and near its

churchyard is a handsome old cross here is fixed one of the charityschcols founded and opened in      by doctor daniel williams a dissenting minister with an endowment of eight pounds a year a charity which he extended to every county in north wales distinguishing that at wrexham the place of his birth by an annual salary of fifteen pounds he also established a fund i believe to each from which the children are apprenticed at five pounds apiece  from the town i ascended the hill cor called coparleni on whose summit is a most enormous carnedd or tumulus formed of limestones it was probably the site of specula or exploratory tower and memorial of some chieftain if roman perhaps paulinus gave name to it coppaulini there is great uncertainty in these derivations i may possibly as well abide by my former etymology of cop yr goleuni or the mount of lights for it might have been a place of signals by fire of the approach of an enemy by sea tour in wales i      or a station of the holy fires the coel ceithie of the druids similar to the karn gollewa the carn of lights and karn leskyz or carn of burnings of the cornish supposed by the learned borlase antiq cornwall     to have been used for similar purposes the tract from hence to caerwys was certainly a field of battle no place in north wales exhibits an equal quantity of tumuli but all sepulchral as is proved by the urns discovered in them they are of a far inferior size to the first and covered with turf it will not be too hazardous a conjecture to suppose that in this place was the slaughter of the ordovices by agricola when our gallant nation was nearly extirpated part of the brow of the hill is called bryn y saethiau or the hill of arrows from being the station of the archers in the engagement  return along the ridge of

profitable warren beneath noted for the delicacy of the rabbets by reason of their feeding on the maritime plants  pass over gronantmoor gronant there is a tradition that its extent was so great that the people on this side could hold conversation over the channel with those of cheshire this may be exaggerated but from authentic records it appears that this flat was formerly very extensive and that it had been reduced to its present scanty limits by the fury of the sea which still possesses its ancient place previous to that catastrophe it was possessed by the sea of st asaph by virtue of a grant made by edward the black prince son of edward iii to llewelyn ap madoc elected bishop of st asaph in      the inundation happened before the reign of henry v previous to that time the bishop paid annually into the exchequer at chester as an acknowlegement the sum of twenty marks but henry v in      and henry vi in      and      in consideration of the misfortune released the sea from that rent williss st asaph    app no xxxi xxxii  if this record did not remain an inconteslable proof of the ravages of the ocean on this part of the country there exist other natural ones that would have given reasonable grounds for suspicion the hyle sands which run for twelve or fourteen miles parallel to the narrow hundred of wiral in cheshire and divided from wales by a narrow channel were once in all probability part of the firm land of england a few miles to the west of gronantmoor under the parish of abergeleu in denbighshire are to be seen at low water very remote from the shore bedded in the sand immense numbers of oaktrees a forest before this event lastly in the churchyard wall of abergelli is a dateless epitaph in welsh signifying the person who was interred there lived three miles to the north of that spot a tract now entirely possessed by the sea  on approaching prestatyn about two miles from trelacre the flat becomes extremely fertile in corn especially wheat which is of distinguished excellence and continues equally noted through all the flat tract as far as ruddlan where it is interrupted for a space by the marsh and is again continued along the coast far beyond abergeleu a little below prestatynmill in a meadow is the site of its castle nothing more than an elevated space with foundations consisting of stone and mortar and a fosse at some distance from it now remain prestatyncastle this little fortress was probably built by the welsh but wrested from them by the english who were possessed of it in      the only time i find any mention of it when it was destroyed by owen gwynedd cadwalader his brother and rees prince of south wales and all tegengle reduced to the power of its lawful sovereign  the hamlet and village of prestatyn lie in the parish of meliden this place was granted by richard i to robert banaster who enjoyed it for three years and a half and built the town which was destroyed by owen gwynedd robert de crevecoeur in the seventh year of edward i laid claim to it in right of his ancestor banaster an inquisition was made before a jury of twentyfour men sebrights mss  their determination was in favor of robert since i find by another record that he died possessed of lands in maelwr saesneg and prestatyn which he held by the service of one knights fee  the road from hence to diserth is extremely pleasant at the foot of high hills rich in lead ore with a fine and fertile flat to the right the white rock makes a conspicuous figure on the left and its sides appeared deeply trenched by the miners in search of ore near this place is the beginning of the vale of clwyd and the termination of the range of mountains which bound it on the east at a small distance from hence lies the church of diserth in a picturesque and romantic bottom beneath some rude rocks the church overshaded with great yews and the singular figure of some of the tombs form a most striking appearance diserth church a waterfall in the deep and rounded hollow of a rock finely darkened with ivy once gave additional beauty to this spot but of late the diverting of the waters to a mill has robbed the place of this elegant variation the stream which is little inferior to that of holywell flows principally from a single well called fynnon asa or st asaphs well in a dingle in the parish of cwm about a mile distant the fountain is enclosed with stone in a polygonal form and had formerly its votaries like that of st winefrede  above diserth church on a high rock stand the remains of its castle we cannot trace the foundation of this fortress which went by the names of dincolyn castle y ffailon and castle gerri llwyds itin castle it probably was welsh and the last of the chain of british posts on the clwydian hills henry iii in      fortified it powel  0   but its date was but short for in      llewelyn ap gryffydd rased both this castle and that of diganwy same      it was at a siege of this place that eineon the son of ririd vlaidd was slain hengwrt ms  a cross was erected on the spot called croes eineon the shaft of which ornamented with strange sculpture now is supposed to form the style into the churchyard of diserth in which is another cross of very curious workmanship  the castle occupied the summit of the rock whose sides are escarpee or cut steep to render the access more difficult on one part beneath the top is a square outwork with fosses cut in part through the solid limestone the fragments of the castle show that its ruin was not effected by time they lie in vast masses overthrown by mining which was a common method of besieging very long before the use of powder  in a field a little to the south of the castle is a ruinous building called siamber wen this is said to have been the seat of a sir robert pounderling llwyds itin ms  once constable of the adjacent castle sir robert pounderling a knight valiant and prudent who had one of his eyes knocked out by a gentleman of wales in the rough sport of tournament but being requested to challenge him again to feats of arms on meeting our countryman at the english court declined the combat declaring that he did not intend that the welshman should beat out his other eye lelands itin vi      moel hiraddug a british post on a very steep and rocky hill with an immense agger of loose stones on the accessible part stands to the south of the castle and forms the next to it in the chain of fortresses tour in wales on the east side and on a place called marion are long deep trenches out of which minerals have been dug probably in the times of the saxons the ore appears by the fragments and color of the rubbish to have been iron and on the summit of the hill which is in the parish of cwm is a great bed of beautiful red spar which seems to take its tinge from the ore  cwn church as the word signifies is embosomed with hills and fronts the vale of clwyd cwm church on a very ancient stone in the churchyard is this inscription hic jacet

 about a mile and a half farther stands the small borough of rhuddlan seated high on the red clayey banks of the clwyd and above morsarhuddlan a marsh celebrated for the battle in     between the saxons and welsh our monarch caradoc fell in the conflict powel  0  and i fear victory declared against us we do indeed say that offa the famous king of mercia was slain here but the saxon chronicle places his death sax chapter    the year before that battle the fine plaintive welsh tune so well known by the name of morfarhuddlan is supposed to have been composed on this occasion for victories are not the only subjects for the harp how beautifully does david lament the blood of the slain on the mountains of gilboa how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished  the castle had been a handsome building in a square with two extremes placed at opposite corners with a double round tower at each and a single one at the two other corners castle the court forms an irregular octagon the ditch is large faced on both sides with stone the steep slope to the river was defended by high walls and square towers one is entire and there are vestiges of two others the first is called twrysilod another in the castle was named twrybrenhin or the kings tower  to the south of the castle at about a furlong distance is a large artificial mount the site of another fortress of very early date the whole surrounded by a very deep fosse including also the abbey which crosses from the margin of the bank near the ascent of the present road to st asaph to another parallel road near which it is continued then turns and falls nearly into the southern part of the walled ditch of the castle the whole forms a square area of very great extent these different works were formed at three several times the mount now called tuthill and its superstructure whatever it was is thoroughly british and is said to have been built by llewelyn ap sitsylt who reigned from the year  0   to  0 0 cambden ii  it was a residence of our princes from that time but gryffyd ap llewelyn in  0   having given offense to edward the confessor by receiving algar one of his rebellious subjects was attacked by harold who in revenge burned the palace at rhuddlan powel  00  it was soon restored and as soon lost robert afterward surnamed of rhuddlan a valiant norman nephew to hugh lupus earl of chester conquered it from the welsh and by the command of william the conqueror fortified it with new works order vital   0  and made it his place of residence from whence he greatly annoyed our countrymen the square towers are evidently of norman architecture and naturally adopted by the new owner robert received here a visit from our prince gryffydd ap kynan who came to solicit aid against his enemies from the norman warrior which he obtained but on some quarrel attacked him in his castle took and burnt the bailey or yard and killed such a number of his men that very few escaped into the towers life of gr ap kynan sebright mss   henry ii in      added new strength to the castle and left a considerable garrison in it before he quitted the country notwithstanding this owen gwynedd in      took and dismantled it but it was afterward refortified by the english for it appears that this fortress had with two others been bestowed by henry with emma his natural sister on david ap owen son and successor to owen gwynedd here in      he entertained very nobly baldwin archbishop of canterbury in his progress through wales girald cambr itin      possibly he resigned it again to the english for i find that in      it was besieged and taken by llewelyn ap jorwerth his successor in the principality powel   0   i must not omit relating notwithstanding i am unable to give the year of the event that randle blundeville earl of chester was in this castle surprised by a body of welsh and lay in the utmost distress until he was relieved by his lieutenant roger lacy alias hell who collecting suddenly a rabble of fiddlers and idle people put the besiegers to flight in reward he received from the earl magisterium omnium leccatorum et meretricum totius cestreshire leicester     this earl of chester held his earldom from      to        i find it in possession of edward i in      who was so well convinced of its importance in the conquest of wales that he made it the rendezvous of all the forces destined for that purpose it was the place darmes and the great magazine of provision for the support of his army in its advance into the country the reigning prince llewelyn ap gryffydd knew the danger of leaving so consequential a place in the hands of his enemy but it resisted all the most vigorous efforts made on it in      by llewelyn and his brother david just reconciled to him by the sense of their common danger soon after it proved the place of confinement to the letter not long before his ignominious end at shrewsbury  in order to secure it from any future attempts edward turned all his thoughts toward founding a fortress impregnable by any future attempts of the welsh he accordingly began with an act of justice that of making recompense to master richard bernard parson of rhuddlan for certain lands taken from him for the purpose of enlarging the castle aylffs rot wall     and again in      made an exchange with the same church of six acres and a half for the same uses sebright ms  and on which he built the castle whose ruins we now survey the finishing of it took a considerable time for i find an order in      for overlooking the works at the castles of rhuddlan flint and chester ret walha     i cannot but remark here the strong necessity of curbing the newconquered country with powerful garrisons for notwithstanding all the ravages of long and barbarous wars it remained so exceedingly populous that edward politically drafted out of it not less than fifteen thousand men in aid of his scottish expedition carte ii     the consequence proved almost fatal to him for while he lay encamped near linlithgow a national quarrel ensued between the english and welsh troops and after great bloodshed the latter separated themselves from his army dayms annas ii       during the civil wars of the last century taken by genesis mytton  it was garrisoned on the part of the king was taken by general mytton in july      and in the same year ordered by the parliament in the phrase of the times to be slighted i e dismantled with many other welsh castles whitelock       in respect to the civil history of rhuddlan i find that in the reign of edward the confessor it made part of the great territories of earl edwin it was then by reason of the inroads of harold a waste and continued so when it was possessed by hugh lupus it then became the capital of the district and hugh enjoyed a moiety of the church the mint and mines of the iron ore found in the manor probably those which we have mentioned in the parish of cwm to which this manner might have extended for dissarch or diserth adjoining to cwm is cited in doomsdaybook as belonging to it  and a moiety of the water of clwyd i e of the mill and fishery on such part which belonged to earl edwin a moiety of the forests on the manor and of the toll and of the village called bren and there were at this time in rhuddlan eight burgesses all this hugh lupus granted to robert of rhuddlan with an addition of certain hamlets dependent on the place and a new borough was erected with eighteen burgesses who enjoyed the same privileges with those of hereford and bretril and were exempted from all fines exceeding twelvepence except in case of manslaughter theft and heinfare i e the depriving a person of his servant doomsdaybook   edward i a borough made this town a free borough appointed the constable of the castle for the time being to be mayor and the bailiffs to be chosen annually by the burgesses on michaelmasday who were to be presented to the constable to be sworn the town was to have power of imprisoning except in such cases which affected the life or loss of limb when criminals of this nature were to be committed to the castle burgesses only were permitted to bail no jews were to inhabit the town the burgesses had a forest and free warren a gild cum hausa et loath et shoth sok sak et theme et insangenthest et lib per totam terram de theoloniis lestagio muragio danegeld gaywite etc  this charter was given by the king at flint september  th in the twelfth year of his reign testibus rob bath and wells etc and confirmed by richard ii at leicester and again at westminster  no constable has been appointed since the days of oliver cromwell  the burgesses contribute toward electing a member for the borough of flint those who are qualified inhabit the place and that part of the parish called rhuddlan franchise which extends above a mile from the town  the parliament said to have been held here in      jts parliament by edward i was probably no more than a council assembled by the conqueror to divide his new conquests into counties and to give salutary laws to the welsh to abolish any ancient customs which the wise prince thought detrimental and to introduce such of the english as would prove of use this was not done hastily for in the year preceding a commission had been appointed with thomas beke bishop of st david president who were to consider and report upon oath the different laws of both countries from their resolutions were framed the famous statute of rhuddlan in which among many excellent institutions were introduced sheriffs and coroners their powers defined and the principal crimes of the times pointed out most of which were acts of violence rapine and theft such as might be expected to exist among people an evil which resulted more from the turbulence of the times than the want of wholesome laws see the statuta walliae passim   a piece of ancient building called the parliament house is still to be seen in rhuddlan probably the place where the king sat in council from hence he actually practiced the wellknown deceit of giving them a prince born among them who never spoke a word of english and whose life and conversation no man was able to stain powel      all which our discontented nobility eagerly accepted little thinking the person intended to be the infant edward just born at caernarvon  the bridge consists of two arches bridge it appears to have been rebuilt or repaired in      that date with the arms of st asaph and the initials of william hughes the bishop of that time being cut in the battlements the tides flow very little higher than this place and bring up to the bridge slats or vessels of about seventy tons the port of these parts is about three miles further at the vorryd or great ford where the river discharges itself into the sea and from whence much corn and timber is exported  the house called the gwindy or wine house gwindy must not be forgotten there are few towns in wales which have not one of that name but the use has long been lost in old times most gentlemens houses had one in their neighborhood where they met their friends and retainers to ymgampio or to exert feats of activity here the gentleman kept a wine cellar which he retailed for his own profit here they passed the day in archery wrestling throwing the sledge and other manly exercises at first the drinking was moderate but at length the purpose was abused and these places were made the sanctuary for all sorts of crimes committed by the dependents or friends of the owner of the gwindy who were recommended to his care and there llawruddion ie persons who came redhanded from a murder were protected till composition could be made for their crimes  the church is dedicated to st mary church it has nothing remarkable about it except an ancient gravestone with a flowery cross and sword the last the mark of the gentility of the person interred the patronage of this church was granted in      to the sea of st asaph in recompense for the loss of that of eglwysvach which had been taken from it and bestowed on the abbey of conway williss st asaph     rot walliae      the priory of blackfriars stood about half a mile south of the castle there is a fragment which bears the marks of antiquity the rest is disguised in the form of a farmhouse and barn we do not know the time of its foundation but it was certainly before the conquest by edward i as anian or eineon de schonan a friar of this house was made bishop of st asaph in      it suffered much in the wars between edward and llewelyn but soon recovered its losses toward which they were allowed    l  0 s rymer ii     besides a grant of a fishery on the clwyd with one net free from any obstruction rot walliae  0  on the dissolution the house was granted to harry ap harry and now belongs to john davies esquire of llanerch  near this place were certain lands called nunneland and st marieland sebright mss  but whether they had reference to any house of female religious i cannot say  the hospital which existed in      stood between the town and bodyryddan  as soon as edward i had finished the fortifications of rhuddlan and filled his new town with inhabitants he and bishop anian ii made different petitions to the pope to remove the sea of st asaph to this place rymer ii     williss st asaph          they urged the solitude and insecurity of the former its hazard from banditti and the danger to which the body of the most glorious confessor st asaph was continually exposed and the king in particular adds the great safety of this place by reason of the vast works he had completed but these petitions never took effect frustrated either by the death of the pope or the exhortion of the archbishop of canterbury to rebuild the cathedral on its ancient site  a little beyond the priory i descended the bank st asaph and fording the clwyd soon came in sight of st asaph the handsome extensive bridge the little town and the cathedral mixed with trees form a most agreeable view the place is seated on the slope of a pleasant eminence the cathedral on its summit the clwyd runs on the eastern side the elwy a most turbulent stream on the western and from the last is taken the british name of llanelwy the township in which it stands is also called brynpaulin and one part of it bron y wylfa or the brow of the watch from which circumstances as well as the great fitness of the situation between two rivers i cannot but think that it was a place of encampment of paulinus in his way to or from mona  its ecclesiastical history may be spoken of with more certainty when kentigern bishop of glasgow was driven from his see in     he retired into wales and established here a monastery for nine hundred and sixtyfive monks instituted on the same plan with that of bangor part for labor part for prayer sii here he built a church and having won over the british prince maglocunus once his violent opponent established here a see and was himself the first bishop being recalled to scotland he nominated for successor asaph or hassaph a briton of great piety and good family being grandson of pabo pou prydain he died in     was buried in his cathedral and gave name to the place  the church was first built of wood but soon after of stone in      during the wars of henry iii the diocese was destroyed by fire and sword matthew paris      and the bishop who sided with the english obliged to live on alms in      cathedral the cathedral was burnt down but ample amends was made to the sea by the grant of edward i of lands in newmarket nannerch dincolyn cwed y mynedd and a rich mineral tract in diserth four hundred and nine acres were given each of which appears at that time to be valued at only sixpence sebright mss  in   0  the church underwent new misfortunes being burnt by owen glyndwr together with the palace and canons houses who strange to say soon after brought over to his party john trevor the injured bishop of the sea who was deprived on account of his revolt after this the church remained in ruins for eighty years when it was rebuilt by that worthy prelate richard redman the same building still remains handsome plain and neat the present dean and chapter are now rebuilding out of a fund vested in them for that purpose the choir after the inevitable dilapidations of time in the space of near four hundred years the good imitation of the gothic and the happy copy in the east window of the noble remains in tintern abbey will add no small beauty to the church and credit to the idea  the tombs are very few tombs here is one in an episcopal habit supposed to commemorate that munificent bishop david ap owen who died in      and in the churchyard near the west door is a plain altar monument of bishop isaac barrow who departed in    0 and whose pious address i can read without any offense howsoever papistical zealots may think it exuviae isaaci

with foliage a shield with a lion rampant inscribed around hic jacet ranulsus de smalwode and beneath the shield passes a sword held by a hand it is said to have been brought from rhuddian but we are left unacquainted with the person whose memory it perpetuates an old drawing of this and some other ancient welsh monuments were most obligingly presented to me by that excellent antiquary the rev mr william cle of  near cambridge a gentleman to whom i have been frequently indebted for variety of useful information   this church stands at the lower part of the town and serves for the use of the inhabitants of the town and country the cathedral not being used for that purpose  the members of the chapter are the dean archdeacon who is the bishop six prebendaries and seven canons besides these belong to the church four vicars choral four singingmen four choristers and an organist  the present palace is not very magnificent the walls are the same with those built by bishop david ap owen

venerable view in a deep wooded bottom not remote from the bridge and this in days of pilgrimage the frequent haunt of devotees  the most capital view of these picturesque glens pencraig is from pencraig on the grounds of mrs jones of galtvaenan from whence is a sight of three at once together with an unspeakable variety of other objects extremely worthy a visit from every traveller  at llannerch the chief seat of my kinsman john davies esquire formerly called lleweni vechan about half a mile to the east of the bridge i stopped a while to admire the charming view of the vale of clwyd

including the cupola and forms from the second floor the figure of a pyramid the rooms small and inconvenient the bricks are admirable and appear to have been made in holland and the model of the house was probably brought from flanders where this species of building was not unfrequent the country people say that it was built by the devil in one night and that the architect still preserves an

they used the twisted leaves or segars the invention is usually ascribed to sir walter raleigh it may be so but he was too good a courtier to smoke in public especially in the reign of james who even condescended to write a book against the practice under the title of the counterblast to tobacco  thomas the fourth son became lord mayor of london and was the founder of the family of chirkcastle it

displayed very early his great talents and began as we are told by himself by searching for coal within a mile of his native place his attempt did not meet with success his genius was destined to act on a greater stage the capital afforded him ample space for his vast attempts few readers need be told that he planned and brought to perfection the great design of supplying the city with water this plan was meditated in the reign of elizabeth but no one was found bold enough to attempt it in   0  the dauntless welshman stepped forth and smote the rock and on michaelmas      the waters flowed into the thirsting metropolis he brought it in defiance of hills and valleys reckoning every winding near thirtynine miles conveyed it by aqueducts in some places in others pierced the high grounds and gave it a subterraneous course he was a true prototype of the later genius of similar works but he sacrificed private fortune to the public good two thousand pounds a month which he gained from the cardiganshire mines were swallowed up in this river fodina regales     he received the empty honor of seeing himself attended by the king his court and all the corporation of london among whom was his brother designed mayor for the ensuing year the waters gushed out in their presence and the great architect received their applause and knighthood and in      the title of baronet his own fair fortune being expended on an undertaking which now brings in to the proprietors an amazing revenue he was reduced to become a hireling surveyor and was eminently useful in every place where draining or mining was requisite i shall have occasion to speak of some other of his labors in the course of this book he died in      myddelton pedigree ms  sir  myddelton the last baronet of this branch of the family died a few years ago the present representative is a widow in distressful circumstances sir hugh left a certain number of shares to the goldsmiths company to be divided among the poor

slope of a great rock crowned with a castle its ancient british name was castle kled vryn in rhos or the craggy hill in rhos the former name of the tract in which it is seated the word dinbech the present welsh appellation signifies a small hill which it is comparative to the neighboring mountains the first time i find any mention of it is in the beginning of the reign of edward i from whom david in defiance of his brother llewelyn chose to hold this lordship together with the cantred of dyffryn clwyd rtuae walliae     he made it his residence till the conquest of our country soon after which he was taken near the place and carried laden with irons to the english monarch at rhuddlan  the king politically secured his new acquisitions by bestowing several of the great lordships on his followers he gave that of denbigh to henry lacy earl of lincoln who built the castle and enclosed within a wall the small town he found there among other priveleges he gave his vassals liberty of killing and destroying all manner of wild beasts on the lordship except in certain parts reserved out of the grant i suppose for the purpose of the particular amusement of the lord sebright mss  for i find in the reign of henry vi the names of five parks in this lordship viz moylewike caresnodooke kylford bagha and posey of which the king constituted owen tudor ranger on the death of lacy the lordship passed to thomas earl of lancaster by virtue of his marriage with alicia daughter of the last possessor after the attainder of thomas edward ii bestowed it on hugh despencer who proved an oppressive superior and abridged the inhabitants of the priveleges granted to them by lacy the same  by the fatal end of that favorite it fell again to the crown and was given by edward iii to another equally unfortunate roger mortimer earl of march whose death enabled the king to invest with this lordship william mountacute earl of salusbury he died in      and on the reversal of the attainder of the earl of march it was restored to his family in the perfon of his grandson roger and by the marriage of anne sister to another roger last earl of march with richard plantagenet earl of cambridge it came into the house of york and so into the crown queen elizabeth in      bestowed it as a most valuable gift on her unmerited minion robert dudley earl of leicester who soon made the country feel the weight of his oppression notwithstanding the tenants made him a present of two thousand pounds at his first entrance into the lordship he remained unsatisfied he constrained the freeholders to raise

the insolence even to mortgage the manor to some merchants of london strifes annals ii      and i apprehend tricked them for their credulity the various disorders which rose from these practices were so great that elizabeth interposed and by charter confirmed the quiet possession of the tenants and allayed the discontents baron prices speech  these were again excited in die reign of king william by the vast grant made to the earl of portland the same ferments arose and the same means were used to allay them at present this and the other great manors of bromefield and yale remain in the crown and are peacefully superintended by a steward appointed by the king  the castle and enclosed part of the town took up a very considerable space and were defended by strong walls and towers the last are chiefly square there are two gates to the outmost precinct that called the burgesses tower gates is large square and built singularly with small ashler stones the other was called the exchequer gate in which the lords court was kept some few houses with most beautiful views are at present inhabited in this part leland says that there had been diverse rows of streets but in his time there were scarcely eighty householders within these walls here stands the chapel called st hillarys formerly belonging to the garrison now the place of worship for the town in old times on every sunday here were masses for the souls of lacy and percy leland itin v     not far from it are the remains of an unfinished church a hundred and seventyfive feet long and seventyone broad and designed to have

public hatred he had incurred on account of his tyranny memoirs  a sum was afterward collected in order to complete the work but it is said that when the earl of essex passed through denbigh on his

which was poured all forts of rubbish stone and hot mortar which time consolidated to a stony hardness this part as leland says was never completed the work having been deserted by the earl on the

of this fortress which i do not discover in any other historian he says that edward iv was besieged in it and that he was permitted to retire on condition denbigh castle that he should quit the kingdom for ever the only time in which that prince was constrained to abdicate his dominions was in    0 when he took shipping at lynn not by reason of any capitulation with his enemies but through

detached that able officer mytton and under him colonel jones and colonel louthian with one thousand four hundred horse and a thousand foot to frustrate the plan mytton did his duty attacked the royalists with vigor and after several hot engagements totally routed them took five hundred horse and four hundred foot killed one hundred and so entirely dispersed them as not to leave a hundred

some of their tombs were to be seen here within memory of man  the present town covers great part of the slope of the hill trade and some streets extend along the plain its manufactures in shoes and gloves are very considerable and great quantities are annually sent to london to the great warehouses of the capital and for the purposes of exportation  the constitution of this borough and its origin will be fully explained by the following transcript communicated to me by one of its burgesses it begins with citing the last charter charter which is that granted by king charles ii which recites letters patent granted by queen elizabeth and dated at westminster the  0th of june in the thirtyninth year of her reign in which the said queen recites that seeing edward i by his letters

serve upon jury at the sessions the aldermen and bailiffs are commissioners of array the resiant burgesses are voters for a member for the borough i cannot but record the virtue of those of the year      who had the courage to withstand the insinuations the promises and the threats of as unprincipled a lord as this kingdom was ever afflicted with who had power to inflict and will to execute any vengeance that opposition to his arbitrary inclinations might excite in that year it was his pleasure that one henry dynne should represent this borough in parliament the burgesses were refractory and chose another person which gave rise to the following letter which i print as a sans pareille  a lre sent from the earl of leicester to the bayliffe aldermen and burgesses greatly blaminge them for making choice of the burges of the parliament without his lordships consent and commanding them to allter their electione and to chose henry dynne i have been latlie advertised how small consideration you have had of the lre i wrote unto you for the nomynasion of yor burgess whereat as i cannot but greatly mervayle in respect i am yor l and you my tenaunts as also the many good tournes and commodities which i have been always willinge to procure you for the benefitte of yor whole state so do i take the same in so  and vill yte so unthankfullie as if you do not upon receite hereof presently revoke the same and appointe such one as i shall nominate namely henry dynne be ye well assured never to look for any ffrienshipe or favor at my hand in any yor affairs herafter not for any great account i make of the thing but for that i would not it should be thought that i have so small regard borne me at yor hands who are bounden to owe as yor l thus much duty as to know mine advice and pleasure that will happily be aleadged that yor choice was made before the receipt of my lres in rely i would little have thought that you would have been so forgetful or rather careless of me as before yor elecion not to make me privy thereto or at the least to have some desire of mine advise therein havinge time enough so to do but as you have of yor selfs thus rashly proceeded herein without mine assent so have i thought good to signify unto you that i mean not to take it in any wise at yor hands and therefore wysh you more advisedlie to consider hereof and to deal with me as may continue my favr toward you otherwise look for no favr at my hands and so fare ye well from the court this last day of april       r leycester   this doughty letter had no effect the burgesses adhered

repaired found a convent of nuns received the veil from the saint and on the death of the abbess theonia succeeded to the high charge st wenefrede died on the  d of november and rested here in quiet near the body of her predecessor for the space of five hundred years by reason of a miracle wrought as was supposed by her intercession on a monk of shrewsbury the abbot determined on the translation of her remains to their monastery her remains translated seven holy men were deputed the inhabitants of gwytherin refused to part with such a treasure visions determined the former to persist in their request and at length on the declaration of the will of heaven by another vision to the parson of gwytherin who declared to his flock the impiety of farther resistance the relics were delivered up and carried with triumph to their place of destination this and much more may be seen in the life of st winefrede pp    etc the prior at this time was robert mr william mytton antiquities of shropshire

in the version of the bible into english as a philanthropist his foundation of a hospital for twelve poor people and a warden who is the clergyman of the place perpetuates his benevolent turn and his affection to learned men is evident not only by his establishing here a free school for this parish and that of llanelidan with a stipend to the master of sixty pounds a year but by his being the

apparent in the thickness of the walls are evident remains of apartments it had two entrances near the northeastern is an oblong square added to the main works and as the ground there is rather flat it is strengthened with a great ditch and a wall within are the foundations of rude stone buildings one of which is circular and several yards in diameter the ditch is carried much farther than the wall and seems part of an unfinished addition to the whole it is conjectured that owen gwynedd occupied this post while henry ii lay encamped on the berwyn hills on the other side of the vale owen glyndwr is said also to have made use of this fastness in his occasional retreats  not far from hence near gwyddelwern is a place called says marchog from the circumstance of owen having there surprised reginald de gray and seven knights says marchog in his train mr thomass mss   this post or fastness of caer drewyn is but one of the chain which begins at diserth and is continued along the

the temporary retreats of the inhabitants in time of war or sudden invasions here they placed their women their children and cattle under strong garrison or perhaps a whole clan or nation might withdraw into them till the retreat of the enemy who could never subsist long in a country where all the provisions were in this manner secured it is also equally certain that the inhabitants

man and greatest clerk in all wales he died in  0    yet that saint has his well here and is patron of the church  on the south side of the church wall is cut a very rude cross which is shown to strangers as the sword of owen glyndwr a most singular cross in the churchyard merits attention the shast is let into a flat stone and that again is supported by four or five rude stones as if the whole had been formed in imitation of and in veneration of the sacred cromlehs of very early time  a monument of our superstition remains in the carreg y big in y fach newlyd a pointed rude stone which stands near the porch we are told that all attempts to build the church in any other place were frustrated by the influence of certain adverse powers till the founders warned in vision were directed to the spot where this pillar stood  in the churchyard is a building founded by william eyton of plas warren in shropshire who in   0  left by will a sum for the support of six widows of clergy of the county of merioneth only and for the erecting six houses for them to live in in consequence this building was finished and lands to the present amount of sixty pounds a year bought which

highest tops are cader fronwen or the white breast and cader ferwyn on the first is a great heap of stones brought from some distant part with great toil up the steep ascent and in their middle is an erect pillar of him whose ambition climbed this height for a monument we are left in ignorance under their summit is said to run an artificial road fford helen called ffordd helen or helens way a lady

the return of spring find them as fresh as when first gathered flora scotica i     tab xiii  i have seen them in the highlands of scotland brought to table as a desert  reach cynwyd a small village

mile from the village the water of the river trystion bursts from the sides of the hill through deep and narrow chasms from rock to rock which are overgrown with wood the rude and ancient stocks that hang in many parts over the precipices add much to this picturesque scene which is still improved by the little mill and its inhabitants in this sequestered bottom  pursue the journey to bala go by the little church of llangar observe somewhat farther on the left in a field called caer bont caer bont a small circular entrenchment consisting of a fosse and rampart with two entrances meant probably as a guard to this pass my fellowtraveller the reverend mr lloyd informed me that in another tour he had ascended a hill above this place called y foel on whose summit was a circular coronet of rude pebbly stones none above three feet in height with an entrance to the east or rising sun the diameter of the circle is ten yards within was a circular cell about six feet in diameter sunk a very little below the surface and about a hundred yards distance facing this are the relics of a great carnedd surrounded by large stones the whole of this formed a place of worship among the ancient britons and probably was surrounded with a grove but what i have to say on the subject of druidism is reserved till i reach anglesea its principal seat  proceed to llandrillo a village with a church dedicated to st trillo it is seated on the torrent keidio at the mouth of a great glen which extends upwards of two miles embosomed in the berwyn mountains and leads to the noted pass through them called milter gerrig into the county of montgomery  at about a mile distance from llandrillo i again crossed the dee at pont gilan a bridge of two arches over a deep and black water beyond this spot the valley acquires new beauties especially on the right the valley here contracts greatly the road runs at the foot of a brow of a stupendous height covered with venerable oaks which have kept their stubborn station amidst the rudest of rocks which every now and then show their gray and broken fronts amidst the deep verdure of the foliage of trees which so strangely find nutriment amongst them the growth of the oak in forcing its root downward frequently rends thse vast strata whose fragments often appear scattered at the base of most amazing sizes the whole scenery requires the pencil of a salvator rosa and here our young artists would find a fit place to study the manner of that great painter of wild nature  a little beyond the extremity of this romantic part in an opening on the right st derfel stand the church and village of llandderfel the first was dedicated to st derfel gadarn and was remarkable for a vast wooden image of the saint the subject of much superstition in ancient times the welsh had a prophecy that it should set a whole forest on fire whether to complete it or whether to take away from the people the cause of idolatry i cannot say but it was brought to london in the year      and was used as part of the fuel which consumed poor friar forest to ashes in smithfield for denying the kings supremacy this unhappy man was hanged in chains round his middle to a gallows over which was placed this inscription allusive to our image david darvel gutheren as says the welshman fetched outlawes out of hell now is he come with spear and sheld in harnes to burn in smithfeld for in wales he may not dwell and foreest the freer that obstinate liar that wylfully shall be dead in his contumacye the gospel does deny the king to be supreme head halles chr ccxxxiii    the prophecy was fulfilled the image burnt and the forest consumed to the great content of the lord mayor the dukes of suffolk and norfolk the lord admiral and lord privy seal and diverse others of the nobility who honored this auto de fe with their presence stows annals      but unfortunately the friar not having the insensibility of our wooden saint on the touch of the flames showed the natural horrors at approach of an agonizing death and paid very little respect to the arguments of the pious latimer who was placed opposite to the sufferer in a pulpit to preach him into a sense of the crime of differing in opinion with his sovereign in religious matters for which the prelate himself suffered in a succeeding reign forest thought fit to deny that henry was head of the church and latimer would force that honor upon mary who chose to cede it to the pope  opposite to this church is llandderfel bridge of four arches at some distance from it the vale almost closes and at kalettur finishes nobly with a lofty wooded eminence above which soars the vast mafs of the arennig mountains notwithstanding they appear immediately after to be very remote and i here stop a moment to recommend to the traveller who does not choose precisely to pursue my steps to follow the course of the dee from bangor through the delicious tract it waters from thence to llangollen to follow it through glyndwrdwy to corwen and thence through the matchless vale of edeirneon to this spot where for a small space it passes through a flat an unpleasant contrast to the preceding ride  on the left

markets every saturday morning when from two to five hundred pounds worth are sold each day according to the demand round the place women and children are in full employ knitting knitting along the roads and mixed with them herculean figures appear assisting their omphales in this effeminate employ during winter the females through love of society often assemble at one anothers houses to knit sit round a fire and listen to some old tale or to some ancient song or the sound of a harp and this is called cymmorth gwau or the knitting assembly  much of the wool is bought at the great fairs at llanrwst in denbighshire  close to the southeast end of the town is a great artificial mount tommen y bala called tommen y bala in the summer time usually covered in a picturesque manner with knitters of both sexes and all ages from the summit is a fine view of llyntegid and the adjacent mountains on the right appear the two arennigs vawr and vach beyond the farther end soar the lofty arans with their two heads aran mowddwy and penllyn and beyond all the great cader idris closes the view  this mount appears to have been roman and placed here with a castelet on its summit to secure the pass toward the sea and keep our mountaneers in subjection the welsh in after time took advantage of this as well as other works of the same nature  the town is of a very regular form the principal street very spacious and the lesser fall into it at right angles i will not deny but that its origin might have been roman  the mounts form a chain i have observed one within sight of this on the mountain

considerable lies within view from tommen y bala sight of this on the road to gwyddelwern and farther on in the parish of bettws is a fourth which goes under the usual name of tommen y castle  bala takes its name from its vicinity to the place where a river discharges itself from a lake balloch in the erse language signifies the same i know little of its ancient history any more than it seems to have been dependent on the castle of harlech and that in the reign of edward ii it was committed to the care of finian de stanedon constable of that castle sebright mss  and in the time of edward iii his great general walter de manni was rewarded with the feefarm of bala and harlech and was made sheriff of this county for life dugdale baron ii      i may add incidentally that edward i gave one

broad in the widest place the deepest part is opposite bryn golen where it is fortysix yards deep with three yards of mud the shores gravelly the boundaries are easy slopes well cultivated and varied with woods in stormy weather its billows run very high and incroach greatly on the northeast end where within memory of man numbers of acres have been lost it rises sometimes nine feet and rains and winds jointly contribute to make it overflow the fair vale of edeirnion  its fish are fish pike perch trout a few roach and abundance of eels and shoals of that alpine fish the gwyniaid which spawn in december and are taken in great numbers in spring or summer pike have been caught here of twentyfive pounds weight a trout of twentytwo a perch of ten and a gwyniaid of five sir watkin williams wynn

sebright mss   the waters are discharged under pont mwnwgl y llyn a bridge of three arches they seem inconsiderable in respect to the size of the streams which feed the lake for the dee does not make in dry seasons the figure i expected salmon come in plenty to this place but neither do they trespass into the lake and the gwyniaids very rarely into the river report says that the dee passes through the lake from end to end without deigning to mix its waters as the rhone was fabled to serve the lake of geneva but in fact the dee does not assume its name till it quits its parent  near the west side close to the bridge and just opposite to tommen y bala stood another castelet not so high but of a more extensive form than that mount it is now broke through by a public road but is very apparent on both sides the mount or keep was on the lower immediately above the river and the vestiges of a wall are still evident this was subservient to the same purposes as the others for there must have been from the nature of the ground a travellable road on both sides of the lake this i apprehend to have been the castle of bala which llewelyn ap jorwerth founded in   0  powel       there is no river in england which has been so much celebrated by our poets for its sanctity thr dlf sacred as the dee most countries had one which they held in peculiar veneration the thessalians paid

interpreters of the presages among the britons the ancient druids who dwelt upon its banks nor yet where deva spreads her wizard fstream lycidas   it was long before we got clear of these superstitions they were very prevalent in the time of gildas in the sixth century when our ancestors strongly retained the idolatry of the druids among their christian rites and notwithstanding the fulmination of many a monarch edgar and canute  it kept its ground and hydromancy still remains practiced among us of which i shall have occasion to speak of more than one kind  i found that i could here kerrig y druidion with greater ease than from any other place digress to kerrig y druidion a parish a few miles to the north in the county of denbigh noted for certain druidical remains which gave name to the place after a dreary ride i found myself disappointed these sacred relics having been profanely carried away and converted into a wall it is therefore from the annotator on cambden ii      and the drawings preserved by him among the sebright mss that i must form my description  the largest was a fine specimen of the british kissed vaen or stone chest it consisted of one stone at top placed inclining to the north and was when measured by mr llwyd ten feet long supported by a stone on each side about seven feet long and near two and a half broad under one end was a stone three feet long at the other one of the length of two feet the hollow beneath was only seven feet long three and a half broad and only two and a half high which sufficiently shows that these monuments had not been the cells of druids their uses therefore must have been sepulchral according to the conjecture of doctor borlase the ancient natives of our isle did not always burn their dead skeletons have been discovered in similar kissed vaens at full length in such as this they might lie commodiously with all the parade of arms often buried with them around this was a circle of stones enclosing an area of about forty paces in diameter and the precinct might be formed with the intent of keeping people at a respectable distance from the remains perhaps of some mighty chieftain this monument went by the name of karchar kynric rwth not that it ever was used for that purpose originally but there is a tradition that in aftertimes a little tyrant of that name in the neighborhood was wont to cram those who offended him into the hollow of these stones which might serve for the purposes of torment as well as the little ease in the tower of london or the iron cages of the bastille  the other kissed vaen was nearly similar to the first but no mention is made of the circle of stones probably they were taken away before mr llwyd visited the place  at giler baron price in this parish was born that upright and able judge robert price esquire baron of the exchequer and finally justice of the common pleas his famous speech in the house of commons against the grant of the great welsh lordships to the earl of portland will ever testify his love to his country his speedy promotion by king william do equal credit to his majesty and mr price since the former howsoever grievous to him might be the opposition to his will yet no consideration could induce him to permit his subjects to lose the benefit of a magistrate capable and honest as he knew our countryman to be  return to bala and continue my journey on the south side of the lake a most beautiful ride pass by llanyckil church dedicated to st beuno and see on the opposite side llangower dedicated to st gwawr mother of the cambrian bard llowarch hen beneath flows avon gwawr the only feed of the lake on that side  go by glan y llyn glan y llyn an old house near the water edge which as well as the following had been the property of the vaughans  leave on the right another ancient seat caer gai placed on an eminence cambden says it was a castle built by one caius a roman the britons ascribe it to gai fosterbrother to king arthur it probably was roman for multitudes of coins have been found in different parts of the neighborhood and it is certain that it had been a fortress to defend this pass for which it is well adapted both by situation and form of the hill  i proceeded about two miles farther castle corndochon to visit another seated a mile from the dolgelleu road on the summit of a high rock which bears the name of castle corndochon the origin of which we are equally ignorant of two sides of the rock are precipitous in the front of the castle is cut a deep fosse the castle consisted of an oblong tower rounded at the extremity and its measure within is fortythree feet by twentytwo behind that and joined to it by a wall are the ruins of a square tower this lies in the main body of the fortress whose form as cambden observes inclines to oval this had been very considerable was built with mortar made of gravel and sea shells and was faced with freestone squared and well cut  i returned toward caer gai llanuwchllyn and not far from thence to the village and church of llanuwchllyn in the last is the figure of an armed man with a conic helmet and mail muffler round his chin and neck on his breast is a wolfs head and on his belly another and in the intervening space three roses the first are the arms of ririd vlaidd the others of kynedda wledig or the warlike a cumbrian prince whose sons after their father had been defeated by the saxons in the sixth century retired and possessed themselves of these parts of wales and from meirion a grandson of his is said to be given the name of meirionith to this shire ririd was lord of penllyn which signifies the head of the lake and forms one of the hundreds of meirionithshire it had also its castle which probably was that of corndochon around the margin of the tomb is a mutilated inscription which as far as i could discover run thus hic jacet johannes ap     ap madoc ap j  eth cujus animae pr  etur deus amen anno di mccc v     close by this village runs avonyllan avon llew or amlew the last rises from two springs and falls into the former those who choose to derive the dee from its double origin may fix on these but i met with a third at the farthest corner of the lake arising from the neighborhood of the lofty aran aran hi to which spencer gives the honor of forming that celebrated river i suppose after running through the lake unmixed with the waters the poet makes the foot of that mighty mountain the place of education of our renowned prince arthur who on his birth being delivered to a fairy knight is by him instantly conveyed to an ancient hero to be upbrought in gentle thews and martial might  it is evident that spencer who was deeply read in all the romance of his romantic days had heard the tradition of caer gai and its old inhabitant gais father to whom he chooses to give the more classical name of timon for so prince arthur is made to name his fosterfather  unto old timon he me brought bylive old timon who in youthful years had been in warlike feats the expertest man alive and is the wisest now on earth i ween his dwelling is low in valley green under the foot of rauran mossie hoar from whence the river dee as silver clean his tumbling billows rolls with gentle rore there all his days he trained me up in virtuous lore fairy queen book i canto ix    this honored stream is now known by the name of avon twrch is a fierce mountain torrent precipitating itself from the aran and crosses a road from whence i first begin my journey among the alps of our country and ascend from hence then sink into very deep bottoms bounded on each side by fields of such steepness as to put the inhabitants to great difficulties in the cultivation woods especially of birch vary the scene on the right tower the vast hills of aran or rather two heads arising from one base  arrive at the foot of bwlch y groes or the pass of the cross one of the most terrible in north wales the height is gained by going up an exceeding steep and narrow zigzag path the pass itself is a dreary heathy flat on which i suppose the cross stood to excite the thanksgiving of travelers for having so well accomplished their arduous journey the descent on the other side is much greater and very tedious into the long and narrow vale of mowddwy vale of mowddwy it is seven or eight miles long and so contracted as scarcely to admit a meadow at the bottom its boundaries are vast hills generally very verdant and fine sheep walks but one on the left exhibits a horrible front being so steep as to balance between precipice and slope it is red and naked and too steep to admit of vegetation and a slide from its summit would be as fatal as a fall from a perpendicular rock in one place on the right the mountains open and furnish a gap to give sight to another picturesque and strange view the rugged and wild summit of aran mowddwy which soars above with tremendous majesty  there is a beauty in this vale which is not frequent in others of these mountanous countries the enclosures are all divided by excellent quickset hedges and run far up the sides of the hills in places so steep that the common traveller would scarcely find footing numbers of little groves are interspersed and the hills above them show a fine turf to the top where the bog and heath commence which give shelter to multitudes of red grous and a few black but their consequences to these parts are infinitely greater in being the beds of fuel to all the inhabitants the turberies are placed very remote from their dwellings and the turf or peat is gotten with great difficulty the roads from the brows of the mountains in general are too steep even for a horse turf sledges the men therefore carry up on their backs a light sledge fill it with a very considerable load and drag it by means of a rope placed over their breast to the brink of the slope at this time the turberies lie at a great distance from the brow of the hill the natives are therefore obliged to bring a horse by a roundabout way to them which assists in dragging the turf to the brink of the slope where men supply its place  then go before and draw it down still preceding and guiding its motions which at times have been so violent as to overturn and draw along with it the master to the hazard of his life and not without considerable bodily hurt  after riding some time along the bottom of the vale pass by the village and church of llan y mowddwy the last is dedicated to st tydecho st tydecho one of our most capital saints his legend gywydd y dyddecho sant in amser mealgwin gwynedd i  the poem of st tydecho who lived in the time of malgwyn gwynedd is written in verse by dafydd llwyd ap llewelyn ap gryffydd lord of mathafarn a person who had a great hand in bringing in henry vii by feeding his countrymen with prophecies that one of them was to deliver wales from the english yoke by which means thousands of them were induced to rise under sir rhys ap thomas and join henry then earl of richmond at milford  this illustrious bard informs us that tydecho had been an abbot in armorica and came over here in the time of king arthur but after the death of that hero when the saxons overran most of the kingdom the saint retired and led here a most austere life lying on the bare stones and wearing a shirt of hair yet he employed his time usefully was a tiller of the ground and kept hospitality malgwyn gwynedd then a youth took offense at the saint and seized his oxen but wild stags were seen the next day performing their office and a gray wolf harrowing after them malgwyn enraged at this brought his milkwhite dogs to chase the deer while he sat on the blue stone to enjoy the diversion but when he attempted to rise he found his breech immoveably fixed to the rock so that he was obliged to beg pardon of the saint who on proper reparation was so kind as to free him from his awkward pain  so far legend that st tydecho might have lived and that malgwyn gwynedd did live a prince of our country i make no doubt and that the former did receive from the prince the privileges it once enjoyed of sanctuary for man and beast is equally probable every offender however criminal met with protection here legend says that it was to endure for a hundred ages but blind to futurity the reformation was not foreseen this place was also exempted from all fighting burning and killing nor was it permitted to affront any of the inhabitants without making the most ample reparation  the lands of tydecho were also freed from mortuaries clames oppression and that great duty which most places were subject to the gobr merched the penalty of incontinence which the saint in tenderness to the possible frailty of his flock wisely took care to get it exempted from  about four or five miles farther i reached dinas y mowydwy dinas mowddwy seated on the plain of an eminence at the junction of three vales beneath the rock craig y dinas whose peat paths i now survey with horror reflecting on a frolic of my younger days in climbing to its summit to enjoy the pleasure of darting down again in one of the peat sledges the foot of this eminence is watered by the kerris and the dyfi the last which retains its name till lost in the sea at aberdyfi rises at the bottom of the rude rock craig llyn dyfi under aran mowddwy it abounds with salmon which are hunted in the night by an animated but illicit chase by spearmen who are directed to the fish by lighted whisps of straw  this mowddwy notwithstanding it is dignified with the name of dinas or city consists but of one street strait and broad with houses ill according with its title but it still preserves the insignia of power the stocks and whippingpost the vagvawr or great fetter the mace and standard measure it is likewise the capital of an extensive lordship under the rule of my worthy cousin john mytton esquire owners he derives it from william or wilccke as he is commonly called fourth son of gryffyd ap gwenwynwyn lord of powis his granddaughter and sole heir married sir hugh de burgh son of the famous hugh justiciary of england his son sir john left four daughters married into the houses of newport leighton lingen and mytton alianor the fourth daughter having given her hand and this seignory to thomas mytton ancestor of the present lord  the powers of this capital over a district privileges which comprehends this large parish and seven out of the eight townships of that of mallwyd are considerable the corporation consists of a mayor aldermen recorder and several burgesses the mayor tries criminals but as the late worthy magistrate a very honest smith told me that for some years past they have not adventured to whip the stocks or confinement in the vagvawr is the utmost severity they have exerted but then they retain the exclusive power of licensing alehouses in their district and are likewise justices of the peace as far as the limits of their little reign  the recorder in absence of the lord tries all matters of property not exceeding forty shillings and the attorneys whose fees do not exceed half a crown are chosen from the lettered part of the community or those who can read  i was accommodated with entertainment at the manorhouse from whence i took a delightful walk of about two miles along the vale on the banks of the dyvi the valley expands and the hills sink in height toward the west after passing the dyfi cross a bridge over the deep and still water of the klywedog black as ink passing sluggishly through a darksome chasm into open day  reach mallwyd mallwyd remarkable for the situation of the altar in the middle of the church which doctor davies author of the dictionary then incumbent in defiance of the orders of archbishop laud removed again from its imaginary superstitious site at the east end  one of the beautiful yew trees in the churchyard is extremely well worth notice it is a sort of forest of vast trees issuing from one stem forming a most extensive shade and magnificent appearance another reason for planting these trees in churchyards besides those usually assigned was a custom in old times upon palm sunday to make this the substitute of the tree from which that sunday took its name to bless on that day the boughs also to burn some of them to ashes and with those the priest on the following ash wednesday signed the people on the forehead saying memento homo quod pulvis es et in pulverem reverteris and of the branches so blessed it was customary to stick some in the fields in rogation week or at the times of processions  return to dinas y mowddwy cruel murder on the road was informed of the place not far from hence where lewis owen vicechamberlain of north wales and baron of the exchequer of north wales was cruelly murdered in the year      by a set of banditti with which this country was overrun after the wars of the houses of york and lancaster multitudes of felons and outlaws inhabited this country and established in these parts for a great length of time from those unhappy days a race of profligates who continued to rob burn and murder in large bands in defiance of the civil power and would steal and drive whole herds of cattle in midday from one county to another with the utmost impunity to put a stop to their ravages a commission was granted to john wynn ap meredydd of gwedyr and this gentleman in order to settle the peace of the country and to punish all offenders against its government in pursuance of their orders they raised a body of stout men and on a christmaseve seized above four score outlaws and felons on whom they held a jail delivery and punished them according to their deserts among them were the two sons of a woman who very earnestly applied to owen for the pardon of one he refused when the mother in a rage told him baring her neck these yellow breasts have given suck to these who shall wash their hands in your blood revenge was determined by the surviving villains they watched their opportunity when he was passing through these parts from montgomeryshire assizes to waylay him in the thick woods of mowddwy at a place now called from the deed llydiart y barwn where they had cut down several long trees to cross the road and impede the passage they then discharged on him a shower of arrows one of which sticking in his face he took out and broke after this they attacked him with bills and javelins and left him slain with above thirty wounds his soninlaw john llwyd of ceisgwyn defended him to the last but his cowardly attendants fled on the first onset his death gave peace to the country for most rigorous justice ensued and the whole nest of banditti was extirpated many by the hand of justice and the rest fled never to return  the traditions of the country respecting these banditti are still extremely strong i was told that they were so feared that travelers did not dare to go the common road to shrewsbury but passed over the summits of the mountains to avoid their haunts the inhabitants placed scythes in the chimneys of their houses to prevent the felons coming down to surprise them in the night some of which are to be seen to this day this race was distinguished by the titles gwyllied y dugoed and gwilliaid cochion mowddwy i e the banditti of the black wood and the redheaded banditti of mowddwy  leave dinas and take the road toward dolgelleu pass by some deserted lead mines which as yet have never been worked with success i may here mention an earth which this place is noted for ochre a bluish ochre which the shepherds wet and pound in a mortar then form into balls and use in marking their sheep an old proverb of the three things which mowddwy wishes to send out of the country shows their long knowledge of it  o fowddy ddu ni ddaw dim allan a ellir i rwystraw oad tri pheth helaeth hylaw din atgas nod glass a gwlaw detested people bluemarking earth and rain    about three miles from dinas leave on the left the vast sheep farm of pennanthigi a deep bottom environed on three sides by vast mountains forming a noble theater this whole country abounds in sheep and cattle and the wool is manufactured in all parts into flannel and stockings  ascend a steep hill into the pass bwlch oerddyrws bwlch oerddrws and the country beyond suddenly assumes a new face before us is a vast extent of dreary slope bounded by vast rocky mountains among which cader idris soars preeminent  this pass is noted for being one of the three places convention there in which were assembled six years after the wars of glyndwr all the great men of certain districts in order to enforce the observation of justice by their own weight without any other legal sanction this perhaps was occasioned by the merciless laws enacted against the welsh by henry iv at each of these places they entered into a compact to cause justice to be done for all wrongs inflicted before and after the wars but not during that turbulent period every one was to have his goods or land which had been forced from him restored without lawsuit and any goods detained after this were to be deemed as stolen or if his lord sold them he was fined ten pounds and the goods or their value to the owner if the refractory person was hanged or died a natural death the demand lay good against the wife heirs or executors but if they or she denied the demand the plaintiff must procure his compurgators viz six persons with him to swear to the right of his clame but like the english in cases of jury the defendant had a right to challenge one of the six and another was to be provided in his stead  after this follow various regulations for restoring the government of the country in general and several laws relative to waifs and estrays vagrants bail recovery of debts manslaughter thefts duty of officers etc the code concludes with valuation of several goods and chattels for which satisfaction was to be made for example a horse and mare on the oath of the owner and two neighbors were valued at ten shillings a foal at twenty pence an ox at a mark a cow at ten shillings the hire of an ox and the milk of a cow were also valued an ewe was esteemed at sixteen pence her wool at four pence her milk at two pence and her lamb at eight pence  as a proof of the high value of arms and that we had few manufactures of that kind a twohanded sword was valued at ten shillings a onehanded at six shillings and eight pence and a steel buckler at two shillings and eight pence but what is very singular a bow which themselves could make was valued at sixteen pence and an arrow at six pence  to all these laws no penalty was annexed for the breach except the forfeiture of the benefit of the compact which in those unsettled times was probably sufficient as it left the party unsupported and friendless  descend from hence dolgelleu along very bad stoney roads to dolgelleu every entrance to which is barred by a turnpike in imitation of other places and every approach mended for a short space by help of the scanty tolls the town is small the streets disposed in a most irregular manner but the situation is in a beautiful vale fertile well wooded and embellished with numbers of pretty seats and watered by the river onion over which on account of its floods is a bridge of several arches the town takes its name from its being placed in a dale abundant in hazels it has nothing in it remarkable but the church which notwithstanding it is pewless is a good building within is the monument of meiric vychan ap ynyr vychan of the neighboring house of nanney fifth in descent from prince cadwgan son of bleyddyn ap cynvyn who resided there and in whose posterity it continues to this time he is armed in a close mail helmet and neckguard sword in hand and with a short mantle over the rest of his armor  cader idris rises immediately above the town cader idris and is generally the object of the travellers attention i skirted the mountain for about two miles left on the right the small lake of llyn gwernan and began the ascent along a narrow steep horseway perhaps the highest road in britain being a common passage even for laden horses into llanvibangelypennent a vale on the other side on gaining the brow of the hill i found it to be a very extensive pasture of coarse grass mixed with a little bog the hill slopes from hence upwards the steeper part to the highest peak or the pen yr cader grows more and more rocky the approach to the summit extremely so and covered with huge fragments of discolored rocks very rugged and cemented by a semivitrified matter which gives them a very vulcanic look added to their disjoined adventitious appearance i met with on my ascent quantities of pumice of the same cellular kind with the toadstone of derbyshire but of a green color the day proved so wet and misty that i lost the enjoyment of the great view from the summit i could only see that the spot i was on was a rude aggregate of strangely disordered masses i could at intervals perceive a stupendous precipice on one side where the hill recedes inwards forming a sort of theater with a lake at the bottom yet very high in comparison of the base of the mountain on the other side at a nearer distance i saw craig cay a great rock with a lake beneath lodged in a deep hollow possibly the crater of an ancient vulcano this is so excellently expressed by the admirable pencil of my kinsman mr wilson that i shall not attempt the description  in descending from the cader i kept on the edge of the greater precipice till i came near the cyfrwy another peak the whole space for a considerable way was covered with loose stones in the form of a stream sloping from the precipitous side multitudes of them were columnar columns but not jointed square or pentagonal none erect but lying very disorderly in all directions some appeared hanging down the face of the precipice the ends of others were peeping out at a vast depth beneath me which showed the great thickness of the stream i wish the day had been more favorable but i hope another traveller will surround the whole and make a more satisfactory relation of this mountain than i have been able to do  in respect to the heights of this mountain height and those of aran benllyn and the arrenig vawr i am enabled to give a very exact account by the assistance of the ingenious mr meredith hughes of bala who assures me that the pen y gader is nine hundred and fifty yards higher than the green near dolgelleu aran benllyn seven hundred and forty above llyntegid and the arrenig only twenty yards short of the aran that the fall from the lake to dolgelleugreen is one hundred and eighty yards so that the real difference of height between the cader and the aran is only thirty yards  after recovering the fatigue of this journey i began another in order to encircle the vast base of the mountain i took the same road as i did before and continued my ride beneath tyrrau mawr one of the points of cader idris the highest rock i ever rode under beyond on the right are the two pools called llynian cregenan and not far distant are some remains of circles of upright stones with many carns a vast stone raised erect on the top of a neighboring rock and several maeni hirion or rude upright columns  at some distance beyond these llys bradwen near the river kregennan i saw the remains of llys bradwen the court or palace of ednowain chief of one of the fifteen tribes of north wales either in the reign of gryffydd ap cynan or soon after the relics are about thirty yards square the entrance about seven feet wide with a large upright stone on each side by way of doorcase the walls with large stones uncemented by any mortar in short the structure of this palace shows the very low state of architecture in those times it may be paralleled only by the artless fabric of a cattle house  ednyfed ap aaren a descendant of this great man had the honor of entertaining owen glyndwr in one of his sad reverses of fortune and is said to have concealed him from the pursuit of his enemies in the parish of llan gelynln in a cave to this day called ogof owain  i must not lead the reader into a belief that every habitation of these early times were equal in magnificence to that of ednowain ap bradwen those of inferior gentry were formed of wattles like indian wigwams or highland hovels without gardens or orchard and formed for removal from place to place for the sake of new pasture or a greater plenty of game the furniture was correspondent there were neither tables nor cloths nor napkins girald cambr dejer walliae      but this is less wonderful since we find that even so late as the time of edward ii straw was used in the royal apartment andersons dict com ii      ancient hospitality notwithstanding this the utmost hospitality was preserved every house was open even to the poorest person when a stranger entered his arms were taken from him and laid by and after the scriptural custom water was brought to wash his feet the fare was simple the meal did not consist of an elegant variety but of numbers of things put together in a large dish the bread was thin oatcakes such as are common in our mountanous parts at this time the family waited on the guests and never touched any thing till they had done when it took up with what was left music and the free conversation of the young women formed the amusements of the time for jealousy was unknown among us bands of young men who knew no profession but that of arms often entered the houses and were welcome guests for they were considered as the voluntary defenders of the liberties of their country they mixed with the female part of the family joined their voices to the melody of the harp and consumed the day with the most animated festivity at length sunk into repose not under rich testers or on downy beds but along the sides of the room on a thin covering of dried reeds placed round the great fire which was placed in the center they lay down promiscuously covered only by a coarse homemade cloth called brychan or played the same with the more ancient bracha and kept one another warm by lying close together or should one side lose its genial heat they turn about and give the chilly side to the fire giraldus       some vein of the ancient minstrelsie is still to be met with in these mountanous countries ancient minstrelsie numbers of persons of both sexes assemble and sit around the harp singing alternately pennylls or stanzas of ancient or modern poetry the young people usually begin the night with dancing and when they are tired sit down and assume this species of relaxation oftentimes like the modern improvisitore of italy they will sing extempore verses a person conversant in this art will produce a pennyll apposite to the last which was sung the subjects produce a great deal of mirth for they are sometimes jocular at others satirical and many amorous they will continue singing without intermission and never repeat the same stanza for that would occasion the loss of the honor of being held first of the song like nightingales they support the contest throughout the night certant inter se palamque animosa contentio  victa morte finit saepe vitam spiritu prius deficiente quam cantu may almost be added the audience usually call for the tune sometimes only a few can sing to it and in many cases the whole company but when a party of capital singers assemble they rarely call for a tune for it is indifferent to them what tune the harper plays parishes often contend against parishes and every hill is vocal with the chorus  continue the ride as before between high mountains in a narrow glen quit the narrow pass and go along a good road formed on the sides of the hills with a fine slope from it to the sea at this time strangely mottled with black and green varied by the light through the broken clouds the road now passes between verdant and smooth hills the great sheep walks of the country they are round at their tops and covered with flocks which yield the materials for the neighboring manufactures from a place called alltlwyd have a very full view of the flat called towyn meirionydd a mixture of meadow land and black turbery watered by the dysynni which falls into the sea a few miles lower on one side is the village and church of tywyn towyn or towyn the rectory is an impropriation in the bishop of lichfield the vicarage formerly belonged to the nunnery of barking in essex now in the patronage of the bishop of bangor i neglected visiting this place but believe my trouble would not have been thrown away for i find among mr llwyds papers sebright mss  the drawing of the sepulchral effigies of a churchman another of a warrior and two rude pillars one seven feet high with the figure of the cross and an inscription on each side in old characters another column marked likewise with a cross but inscribed with letters of a different form is drawn in the same collection from one in the churchyard of llanvihangel y traetheu in this county  from the place where i made this digression i descended a sleep path through fields and crossing the river dined on a great stone beneath the vast rock craig y deryn craig y deryn or the rock of birds so called from the numbers of corvorants rock pigeons and hawks which breed on it at the foot is a prodigious stream of stones which extend some hundreds of yards from the bottom of the rock and is formed by the continual lapse of fragments from it here the towyn is contracted into a fertile vale which extends about two miles further near its end is a long and high rock narrow on the top here stood the castle of teberri teberri castle which extended lengthways over the whole surface of the summit and was a fortress of great strength and extent the most complete apartment was thirtysix feet broad and was cut out of the rock on two sides for much of it is hollowed in some parts the precipices skirted by a wall formed the defense the remaining walls are well built the stones squared the mortar shells and gravel but at present very rotten the whole of this place is so overgrown with bushes as to render the survey very difficult it lies in the parish of llan vi hangel y pennant and is said to have been once defended by a coch or pennant or the red of that place  this probably was the castle bear belonging to our last llewelyn which was taken not long before the final conquest of wales by william de valence earl of pembroke lelands collect i      this seems to have been likewise the same which was committed by edward i to the custody of robert fitzwalter who had at the same time the liberty of hunting all kinds of wild beasts in this county rotulae walliae     it is fit to mention this as there was another strong fortress in cardiganshire of a similar name  return about half a mile tal y llyn and ride several miles along the pretty vale of tal y llyn very narrow but consisting of fine meadows bounded by lofty verdant mountains very steeply sloped went by llyn y myngil a beautiful lake about a mile long which so far fills the valley as to leave only a narrow road on one side its termination is very picturesque for it contracts gradually into the form of a river and rushes through a good stone arch into a narrow pass having on one side the church on the other a few cottages mixed with trees the church and that of llanvehangel y pennant are chapels to towyn ecton       adjacent to this valley singular coffin at a place called llwyn dool ithel in the year      was found in digging turf about three yards deep a coffin made of deal about seven feet long carved and gilt at both ends two skeletons supposed of different sexes were found in it placed with the head of the one parallel to the feet of the other the bones were moist and tough and of an uncommon size the thigh bones being twentyseven inches long within a yard of the coffin were found two other skeletons of the same dimensions with the former laid on the bare clay and within two roods of them a grave with a skeleton of the usual size along the graves and coffin were laid hazel rods with the bark on and so tough as to be flexible llwyds itin ms another instance is related in cambden ii      the high preservation of these rods and the toughness of the bones were owing to the bituminous quality of the turbery in which they were deposited the rods were placed for some superstitious purpose perhaps to avert the power of witchcraft since a double hazelnut in some parts of the highlands of scotland is to this day supposed to have that virtue  a few miles beyond tal y llyn church the hills almost meet at their bottoms and change their aspect no verdure now is to be seen but a general appearance of rude and savage nature the sides are broken into a thousand crags some spiring and sharp pointed but the greater part project forward and impend in such a manner as to render the apprehension of their fall tremendous a few bushes grow among them but the dusky color of them as well as the rocks only served to add horror to the scene  one of the precipices is called pen y delyn llam y lladron from some resemblance it has to a harp another is styled llam y lladron or the thieves leap from a tradition that thieves were brought there and thrown down i have no doubt but that such a punishment might have been inflicted from this welsh tarpeian by order of an arbitrary lord but we formerly very rarely used capital punishments for any crime not but the gallows was in use for theft leges walliae      but fines were accepted in almost all instances even in cases of murder which gave rise to private revenge and brought on a train of endless feuds and bloodshed  on the left is the rugged height of cader idris llyn y tri graienyn pass near a small lake called llyn y tri graienyn or of the three grains which are three vast rocks the ruins of the neighboring mountain which some time or other had fallen into the water these say the peasants were the three grains which had fallen into the shoe of the great idris which he threw out here as soon as he felt them hurting his foot  pass over bwlch coch nanney and after descending a very bad road again reach dolgelleu from whence i visited nanney the ancient seat of the ancient family of the nanneys now of the vaughans the way to it is a continual ascent of two miles so perhaps it is the highest situation of any gentlemans house in britain the estate is covered with fine timber which clothe all the sides of the dingles for many miles on the road side is a venerable oak in its last stage of decay and pierced by age into the form of a gothic arch yet its present girth is twentyseven feet and a half the name is very classical derwen ceubren yr ellyll the hollow oak the haunt of demons how often has not warm fancy seen the fairy tribe revel round its trunk or may not the visionary eye have seen the hamadryad burst from the bark of its coeval tree  above nanney is a high rock with the top incircled with a dike of loose stones this had been a british post the station perhaps of some tyrant it being called moel orthrwm or the hill of oppression  the park of nanney is remarkable for its very small but very excellent venison i have before mentioned the ruins of the house of howel sele within this park and related his unfortunate history tour in wales i       return through dolgelleu and about a mile beyond on a rising spot have a beautiful view of three vales finely bounded by hills and embellished with gentlemens houses finely watered by the junction of the onion and the maw or mowdach i was diverted from taking the direct road to barmouth by the great deference i always found reason to pay to the judgment of a gentleman who a few years ago honored our country with his remarks a gentlemans tour through monmouthshire and wales in      printed for t evans       and has made a particular euloge on the cascades of glynmaw let me add that the consideration of ending this little excursion at the hospitable house of mr garnons of rhiw goch was another spur to my design  cross the bridge of llan elltyd below is a fine tract of meadow wretchedly deformed by the necessity of digging into them for turf the fuel of the country the tide flows within a small distance of this place and on the banks i saw a small sloop ready to be launched on the left is the church of llanelltyd on the right in a rich flat stand the remains of the abbey of cymmer cymmer abbey part of the church is still to be seen and shows its ancient grandeur at the east end are three lofty but very narrow windows pointed at top and over them three lesser mantled in a great and gloomy thicket of ivy the great hall and part of the abbots lodgings now form a farmhouse  this had been an abbey of cistercians founded not by llewelyn ap jorwerth as has been supposed who only confirmed the donations as prince of wales but by the two princes meredydd and gryffydd the sons of conan and howel the son of gryffydd about the year      in the charter of llewelyn in   0  is mention of their benefactions of his own and of the boundaries of the abbey lands sebright mss  which show it had been founded by other persons this charter is most ample over rivers lakes and sea birds and wild beasts and tame over all mountains woods things moveable and immovable and over all things under and over the lands so granted and gives liberty of digging for metals and hidden treasures all which was done in presence of esau then lord abbot and others religious of the house dugdale monast i     who as well as tanner confounds this with cwmbir abbey in south wales  at the dissolution its revenues were valued at fiftyone pounds thirteen shillings and six pence by dugdale at fiftyeight pounds fifteen shillings and four pence by speed the only charge on it in      was six pounds thirteen shillings and four pence paid to lewis ap thomas supposed to have been the last abbot willis ii       uchtred ap edwyn built a castle here castle which was taken and overthrown about      by eneon ap cadwgan and gryffyd ap meredydd ap bleyddyn powel      and its place is not at present even known  continue my journey on a bank high above the maw the valley grows soon very contracted the sides of the hills finely covered with wood almost to the top and the river assumes the form of a torrent rolling over a rocky channel  about five or six miles from dolgelleu at dool y melynllyn i turned out of the road meeting the furious course of the gamlan that falls with short interruptions from rock to rock for a very considerable space amidst the woods and bushes till it reaches a lofty precipice from whence it precipitates into a black pool shaded by trees which gives to the cataract the name of rhaiaderddu rhaiader ddu or the black a noble birch placed above finely finishes this picturesque scene  cross pont ar gamlan below which the river falls into the maw not far from thence the junction of the maw and eden forms another fine scene a lofty hill clothed with woods ends here and forms the forks of the rivers correspondent to the steeps through which these torrents roll and exhibits a view like those of the shady wilds of america  begin a considerable ascent and find on the top some groves of handsome oaks before me a naked country descend through some steep fields to another set of wooded dingles that wind along the bottoms and join with the former in various parts cader idris appears in full majesty over these sloping forests and gives a magnificent finishing to the prospect soon after my arrival among the woods another cascade astonishes me with its grandeur from the situation i was in it formed a vast fall bounded on one side by broken ledges of rocks on the other by a lofty precipice with trees here and there growing out of its mural front on the summit of each part oaks and birch form distinct little groves and give it a sort of character distinct from our other cataracts after the water reaches the bottom of the deep concavity it rushes in a narrow rocky chasm of a very great depth over which is an admirable wooden alpine bridge and the whole for a considerable way awefully canopied by trees this is called pistill y kain or the spout of the river kain at no great distance from it is another for nature is here profuse in her beauties of this kind pistill y maw the maw for some space runs along a deep glen finished by a bare mountain seen through vistos formed by the woods on each side the water tumbles down a series of ledges of different heights into a very black and sullen pool from which it reassumes its violence and is lost among the far extending woods  in the nakedness of winter there is a spot far above from whence these two cataracts may be seen at once exhibiting through the trees a piece of scenery as uncommon as it is grand after emerging from these romantic depths i reach a long extent of woodless tract the vast parish of trawsfynnydd walled in on all sides by lofty rugged mountains of various forms  in a farmhouse bedh porus not far from this road to rhiw goch i visited bedh porus or the grave of porus on a flat stone over it is the following inscription copied somewhat differently by mr llwyd in the britannia ii      porvs hio in tvmvlo iacit homo pianvs fvit   some have supposed the p to have been an r and the word to have been christianus fuit but whatsoever the letter in dispute might have been there certainly never was room between homo and the next word for the letters chris  not far from it in another field is a great upright stone called llech idris there is some silly legend about it concerning the giant idris but it is no more than one of the monumental columns so frequent in wales and many other parts  after a short ride sarn helen see on a common for the first time the noted sarn or llwybr helen the causeway or path of helen a road supposed to have been made through part of north wales by helena daughter of eudda or octavius and wife to the emperor maximus rowland       this road is now entirely covered with turf but by the rising of it is in most parts very visible beneath are the stones which form it and extend in all its course to the breadth of eight yards there are tumuli near it in various places it being very usual for the romans to inter near their highways close to the part in question is one in which were found five urns the whole materials of it are composed of burnt earth and stones with several fragments of bricks which had been placed round the urns to keep them from being crushed  after reposing a night at rhiw goch castle prysor adjacent to this part of the journey i continued it a few miles to castle prysor a very singular little fort placed in a pass between the hills on a natural round rock appearing at first sight like the artificial mounts we had before observed around its summit had been the wall whose remains are visible in several places and in one is the appearance of a round tower the facings are very regular but the work destitute of mortar notwithstanding this the castelet is probably roman for multitudes of coins and urns are found about it the name explains the cause of the want of lime in the walls castle prysor signifying a castle made in baste so that there was not time to prepare the usual cement around its base are the foundations of several buildings which were placed there to enjoy the protection of the place  from hence i took the track toward festiniog and saw by the road side llyn rathllyn a small lake noted for a strange variety of perch crooked perch with a hunched back and the lower part of the backbone near the tail oddly distorted br zool iii tab xlviii  in other respects they resemble the common kind which are equally numerous in this water the same are found at fablun in sweden  not far from hence roman camp within the enclosed country i found a very fine roman camp most judiciously placed in a situation over an extensive view of the country partly level partly inclining from it and commanding a number of passes to die lesser posts of this mountanous tract it is surrounded with a ditch and bank on the last of which are the vestiges of a wall near one end is a great mount of earth broken and hollow in the middle from the removal of the stones which composed the fort round its base is a deep ditch this camp is called tomnen y mur or the mount within the wall coins and urns are as frequent about this place as the former sarn helen runs into it at one end and is continued to rhyd yr halen in festiniog parish and by the side of fannod vawr and over a farm called cae du to ffrydd y dduallt to the upper part of a farm called croesor at the upper end of cwm croesor and through cae ddafydd in nanmor and perhaps to dinas emrys the branches are numerous i cannot entertain a doubt but that one pointed by castle dol wyddelan to caer hun or conovium and that by pont aber glass llyn and y gymwynas or the work done in kindness may be supposed to have been another pointing to segontium i have before mentioned a ffordd helen among the berwyn hills and let me add those recorded by the annotator on cambden in llanbadarn odyn in caerdiganshire and from brecknock to neath in glamorganshire which pass under the name of the same princess cambden ii   0   close by the road side oval enclosure on the common at a small distance from the camp is an oval enclosure about thirtysix yards long and twentyseven wide in the middle surrounded by a high mound of earth but without a fosse there were two entrances one opposite to the other and near one end a part seemed to have been divided off by a wall whose foundations still remain  i returned out of the parish of trawsfynnydd along the beautiful road of the preceding day till i reached llan elltyd when i kept on the side of the hill above the valley which leads to barmouth the ride is very picturesque the vale watered by the maw known here only by the name of avon or the river which widens as we advanced the sides bounded by hills chequered with woods i found the little town of barmouth barmouth seated near the bottom of some high mountains and the houses placed on the steep sides one above another in such a manner as to give the upper an opportunity of seeing down the chimneys of their next subjacent neighbors the town is seated very near to the sea at the mouth of the maw or mawddoch and takes its name of barmouth i e aber maw or mawddoch from that circumstance at high water the tide forms here a bay about a mile over but the entrance hazardous on account of the many sandbanks this is the port of meirioniddshire but not so much frequented as it ought to be by reason the inhabitants do not attempt commerce on a large scale but vend their manufactures through the means of factors who run away with much of the advantages which the natives might enjoy yet ships now and then come to fetch the webs or flannels and i am informed that a few years ago forty thousand pounds worth have been exported in a year and ten thousand pounds worth of stockings many of the webs are sold into spain and from thence sent to south america  in a former visit july   th    0 to this place fasting woman my curiosity was excited to examine into the truth of a surprising relation of a woman in the parish of cylynin who had fasted a most supernatural length of time i took boat had a most pleasant passage up the harbor charmed with the beauty of the shores intermixed with woods verdant pastures and corn fields i landed and after a short walk found in a farm called tydden bach the object of my excursion mary thomas who was boarded here and kept with great humanity and neatness she was of the age of fortyseven of a good countenance very pale thin but not so much emaciated as might be expected from the strangeness of the circumstances i am going to relate her eyes weak her voice low deprived of the use of her lower extremities and quite bedridden her pulse rather strong her intellects clear and sensible  on examining her she informed me that at the age of seven she had some eruptions like the measles which grew confluent and universal and she became so fore that she could not bear the left touch she received some ease by the application of a sheeps skin just taken from the animal after this she was seized at spring and fall with swellings and inflammations during which time she was confined to her bed but in the intervals could walk about and once went to holywell in hopes of cure  when she was about twentyseven years of age she was attacked with the same complaint but in a more violent manner and during two years and a half remained insensible and took no manner of nourishment notwithstanding her friends forced open her mouth with a spoon to get something down but the moment the spoon was taken away her teeth met and closed with vast snapping and violence during that time she flung up vast quantities of blood  she well remembers the return of her senses and her knowledge of every body about her she thought she had slept but a night and asked her mother whether she had given her any thing the day before for she found herself very hungry meat was brought to her but so far from being able to take any thing solid she could scarcely swallow a spoonful of thin whey from this she continued seven years and a half without any food or liquid excepting sufficient of the latter to moisten her lips at the end of this period she again fancied herself hungry and desired an egg of which she got down the quantity of a nut kernel about this time she requested to receive the sacrament which she did by having a crum of bread steeped in the wine after this she takes for her daily subsistence a bit of bread weighing about two pennyweights seven grains and drinks a wine glass of water sometimes a spoonful of wine but frequently abstains whole days from food and liquids she sleeps very indifferently the ordinary functions of nature are very small and very seldom performed her attendant told me that her disposition of mind was mild her temper even that she was very religious and very servent in prayer the natural effect of the state of her body long unembarrassed with the grossness of food and a constant alienation of thought from all worldly affairs she was living in    0 and in the same state   this instance of the influence of disease for such only can it be called strange as it is is not without parallel  the first is the case of a lady a patient of the late doctor gower of chelmsford who was confined to her bed for ten years during which time she had an extreme and constant aversion to all kinds of solid nourishment she drank a pint of tea daily and once in three or four days chewed without swallowing a few raisins of the sun and blanched almonds about four or half a dozen of each she seldom eat oftener than once a month and then only a bit of dry bread of the size of a nutmeg but frequently abstained from food for many weeks together this lady recovered by means of constant medical regimen so that she could walk two miles without taking either rest or refreshment  i refer the reader to the tour in scotland of      for the extraordinary case of katherine macleod of the county of ross and finally shall mention that of martha tailor of  near bakewell derbyshire who abstained from food from december         for thirteen months and took nothing the whole time excepting a few drops of syrup water and sugar or the juice of roasted raisins she was also very religious was much emaciated her palms moist her other evacuations very small harleian miscel iv       see london magazine      p   0 in which is another instance of long abstinence   i shall now mention another singular personage evans the conjurer but less innocent a native of the same parish with mary thomas this was the noted astrologer and illfavored knave arise evans a character and species of impostor frequent in the reigns of elizabeth and james i his figure is preserved in the antiquarian repertory and answers the description given of him by his great pupil william lilly of having a broad forehead beetlebrows thick shoulders flat nose full lips a down look black curling stiff hair and splay foot he was a deep student in the black art and lilly assures us that he had most piercing judgment naturally upon a figure of theft and many other questions he ever met withal was well versed in the nature of spirits and had many times used the circular way of invocating he then tells how his friend evans by means of the angel salmon brought to him a deed which one of his customers had been wronged of at the same time blowing down part of the house of the person in whose custody it was and again how to satisfy the curiosity of lord bothwel and sir kenelm digby who wanted to see a spirit he liked to have lost his life being carried over the thames and flung down near battersea by the spirits whom he had vexed at the time of invocation for want of making in the life of benevuto cellini is a most ridiculous tale of this nature a due fumigation these ridiculous impostures were the fashionable credulity of the times and the greatest men were the dupes of these pretenders to occult science to show that wales was fertile in geniuses of every kind we must lay clame to the celebrated doctor john dee or du who was born at nantygroes radnorshire j d rhys cambr brit ling institut p  0  and was sought after by the greatest princes in europe ben johnson in his excellent comedy of the alchemyst for a time gave almost as fatal a blow to the black art as quevedo did in spain to chivalry but since avarice and curiosity are passions most difficult of conquest it rose again with fresh vigor and maintained its ground till the restoration see lillys life passim   on my return to barmouth i proceeded for some time along the coast among shifting sands pass near kail wart by a stone now serving as a foot bridge on which was this inscription hic jacet calixtus monedo regi there is no tradition of the place it was removed from  ascend from the coast to corsygedol corsygedol the ancient seat of the vaughans where i was entertained by william vaughan esquire for some days in the style of an ancient baron the woods near his house are extensive but affected by the west winds in a very surprising manner the tops are shorn quite even and the boughs so interwoven as to form seemingly a close and almost impenetrable surface  there are few places which abound more in british antiquities than the environs of corsygedol craig y dinas i first visited craig y dinas the summit of a hill surrounded with a vast heap of stones the ruins of a wall which in many parts retain a regular and even facing this and some others similar are the first deviations from the rude ramparts of stone and prior to the improvement of masonry by the use of mortar into this is an oblique entrance with stone facings on both sides and near it are two ramparts of stones the whole is on the steep extremity of the hill near to which is a pass into the country  about a mile farther llyn bodlyn is llyn bodlyn a small lake beneath a lofty precipice well stocked with char which will take a bair and afford good diversion to the angler llyn cwm howel is another lake in this neighborhood noted for a race of trouts which i have seen with most deformed heads thick flatted and toad shaped and which probably might give rise to the fabled accounts of the monstrous species recorded by giraldus  after passing by llynirddin a small piece of water on a plain arrive amidst a wondrous group of druidical antiquities on the flat appear two circles circles of stones the first is about fiftysix feet in diameter formed of piles of loose stones with upright columns placed at five yards distance from each other in pairs so as nearly to divide the circle into four parts about thirty yards from this is a lesser with several upright stones among the smaller but placed with less regularity design not chance certainly directed the founders of these circles in the disposition of the columnar stones but i fear when i come to speak more fully of them the cause must remain unaccounted for by reason of the remoteness of the time and the mystery of the ancient priesthood  half a mile fouth of these on the side of a hill are two carnedds of a most stupendous size containing an uncommon assemblage of druidical customs carneddeu hengwm or religion in form of cromleh maen her and kissed vaen both are of an oblong form and composed of loose stones the largest is fiftyfive feet long and twelve high in the middle at the east end is a great cromleh altar composed of two sloping stones one placed over the edge of the other upon five flat upright stones seven feet high in one part and four feet ten in the lowest about eight yards from this is the upper stone of a cromleh lying flat on the carnedd without the appearance of any other support  eleven yards farther is another great heap of stones and in it a large cromleh supported with upright stones it is now converted into a retreat for a shepherd who has placed stone seats within and formed a chimney through the loose stones above in the same carnedd a little farther on is another magnificent cromleh whose incumbent stone is twelve feet by nine four vast columns or maen hirion three now fallen and a third erect the columns are from the height of ten feet four to that of twelve feet eight and each between four and five feet broad  northwest of these antiquities castle dinas cortin on the top of a hill is a strong post called castle dinas cortin entrenched around with an advanced work on one side this and castle craig y dinas were doubtlessly formed as defenses to the sacred ground the subject of the above description i may add likewife another object of protection of the same nature which i met with on my return to corsegedol two great carnedds placed on small eminences near to each other and within one the five square flags of a kissed vaen the top being destroyed the place is most remarkable for the name bryn cornyn jau the neighbors of this antiquity are fond of rendering it the hill of the horns of jove it more probably was a place of sacrifice before or after the chase and derived its title from the horned deity cernunnos cernunnos who was venerated by the gauls and applied to as a protector from the dangers attendant on the diversion religion de gaulois ii     both the gauls and britons had one common religion so that cernunnos might as reasonably be supposed to have a place here as in france  this neighborhood also abounds with cromlechs of very great size cromlechs i measured one in a tenement called brynyvoel which was sixteen feet four inches long seven feet four broad and twenty inches thick it lay about two feet above the ground supported by small stones and was surrounded with a circle of loose stones most of the cromlechs of these parts lie very near to the ground and in that respect differ from those of other places they lie likewife horizontally which shows that their object was different whatsoever it was  this country is in the hundred of ardudwy the entrance into it from trawsfynnydd is called drws ardudwy dews ardudwy or the door of ardudwy formed by nature through the sterile mountains which separate the places i was tempted to visit this noted pass and found the horror of it far exceeding the most gloomy idea that could be conceived of it the sides seemed to have been rent by some mighty convulsion into a thousand precipices forming at their tops rows of shelves which the peasants comparing to the ranges in a dove cot style carreg y klommenod or the rock of the pigeons the bottom of this passage is covered with a deluge of stones which have streamed from the sides and along it is a narrow horsepath on the slippery rock formed by the removal of a few of the fragments which in other places are disposed into form of most steep and hazardous flights of steps and yet as if the natural and artificial difficulties of these ways were not sufficient to terrify invaders there are in one place the vestiges of a wall which went across the pass in which might have been the door which gave name to it  on my return i visited an ordinary house called maes y garnedd the birth place of the regicide colonel jones whose insolence to the neighboring gentry is still spoken of even to this day with much warmth actuated by enthusiasm he went every length that the congenial cromwell dictated and was a brave and successful officer in a cause which after a certain period was the result of ambition and the foundation of tyranny  from some of the adjacent heights of this ride i had a full view beneath me it being low water of the long range of sand and gravel which runs from this coast twentytwo miles into the sea it is deservedly called sarn badrig sarn badrig or more properly badrhwyg or ship breaking causeway from the number of ships lost upon it this shoal is dry at the ebb of springtides and marked in storms by horrible breakers tradition says that all this part of the sea had been a habitable hundred called cantreer gwaelod or the lowland hundred and that it was overwhelmed by the sea about the year  00 in the time of gwyddno goronhir  a similar accident happened in some distant period on the coast of essex the canons of st paul must be possessed of a prebend before they can become residentiaries and the one usually given is the praebenda consumpta per mare which lay on the coast of that county  from corsegedol i pursued my journey toward harlech but on the road was tempted by my constant fellowtraveller the reverend mr john lloyd to make a small deviation to the right to visit a near relation of his who lived a few miles to our right in his ancient territories of cwm bychan we approached it through glyn artro a little valley watered by a river of the same name and prettily wooded the view upwards was extremely picturesque of a conic rock skirted by a sweet grove and beyond soared the naked mountains which bounded the object of our ride  after passing through the wood and ascending dinas porchellyn had before us a wild horizon of rocks and rocky mountains even these tracts unfriendly as they seem to vegetation had once been covered with venerable oaks and there still remained a few between eight and nine feet in circumference we went under their shade above a rapid torrent with a delightful view before us of a true alpine wooden bridge and a small mill and a little farther an ancient arch flung from rock to rock giving passage over a still and black water shaded by trees ford the river again near llyn sarph or the serpents hole wind up a rocky staircase road and arrive full in sight of cwm bychan cwm bychan embosomed with rocks of magnificent height after a short ride high above a lake of the same name descend and reach the house of the venerable evan llwyd who with his ancestors boast of being lords of these rocks at left since the year   00 this and the fortified pass of drws ardudwy were most probably occupied by the sons of cadwgan in their contests with the sons of uchtryd ap edwyn whom they at last expelled the country  the following as it is the true descent of mr evan llwyd and my fellowtraveller who being brothers children are eighteenth in descent from blyddyn ap cynvyn so it is a genuine copy of the form of a british pedigree  evan ap edward ap richard ap edward ap humphrey ap edward ap dafydd ap robert ap howel ap dafydd ap meirig llwyd o nannau ap meirig vychan ap ynyr vychan ap ynyr ap meuric ap madog ap cadwgan ap bleddyn ap cynvyn prince of north wales and powys numbers of respectable families in this country are of the same descent   i was introduced to the worthy representative of this long line who gave me the most hospitable reception and in the style of an ancient briton he welcomed us with ale and potent beer to wash down the coch yr wden or hung goat and the cheese compounded of the milk of cow and sheep he likewise showed us the ancient family cup made of a bulls scrotum in which large libations had been made in days of yore the family lay in their whole store of winter provisions being inaccessible a great part of the season by reason of snow here they have lived for many generations without bettering or lessening their income without noisy fame but without any of its embittering attendants  of this house was the valiant dai llwyd to whom is said to have been addressed the noted welsh tune ffarwel dai llwyd on occasion of his going with jasper tudor and owen lawgoch to fight risiart frawdwr or richard the traitor by which name the welsh stigmatized richard the third  the mansion is a true specimen of an ancient seat of a gentleman of wales the furniture rude the most remarkable were the cistie styffylog or the great oatmeal chests which held the essential part of the provision  the territories dependent on the mansion extend about four miles each way and consist of a small tract of meadow a pretty lake swarming with trout a little wood and very much rock but the whole forms a most august scenery the naked mountains envelope his vale and lake like an immense theater the meadows are divided by a small stream and are bounded on one side by the lake on the other by his woods which skirt the foot of the rocks and through which the river runs and beyond them tumbles from the heights in a series of cataracts he keeps his whole territory in his own hands but distributes his hinds among the havadwys or summer dairyhouses for the convenience of attending his herds and flocks he has fixed his heir on another part of his estates his ambition once led him to attempt draining his lake in order to extend his landed property but alas he gained only a few acres of rushes and reeds so wisely bounded his desires and saved a beautiful piece of water he found on one side a stratum of fine white earth about half a yard thick which i knew was what mineralogists dignify with the name of lac lunae and agaricus mineralis the germans use it as an absorbent in dysenteries and malignant fevers da costas fossils i     and it would prove a good manure  stools and roots of firs of vast size are frequently found near the lake mr llwyd found one with the marks of fire on it which he used to repair the tyddyn y traian or jointurehouse of his family an ancient customary appendage to most of the welsh houses of any note  among the mountains which guard the cwm is one named carreg y saeth on whose verge is a great maen her and carnedd saeth signifies an arrow so probably the ancient sportsmen here took their stand to watch the passing of the deer which formerly abounded in these parts nor have they long been extinct a person of the last generation informed my host that he had seen eighteen at once grazing in the meadow  the welsh had several animals ancient hunting which were the objects of the chase such as y carw or the stag kaid wenyn a swarm of bees and y gleisiad or the salmon yr arth the bear y dringhedydd climbing animals i suppose wild cats martins and squirrels and ceiliog coed or cock of the wood and the last division was y llwynog the fox ysgyfarnog the hare and yr ywrch the roe some of the above come very improperly under our idea of hunting yet were comprehended in the code of laws relative to the diversion formed as is supposed by gryffyd ap cynan lewiss hist wales introd      i suspect also that the otter was an object of diversion there being a cylch dyfrgwm or an annual payment by the welsh for the princes water dogs record of caernarvon harl mss   the three first were helfa gyffredyn or the common hunt the stag because he was the noblest animal of chase and because every body who came by at his death before he was skinned might clame a share in him the next animals were helfa gyfarthfa or the animals which could be brought to bay such as the bear etc which were hunted with hounds till they ascended a tree the bird mentioned here is the cock of the wood whose nature it is to sit perched on a bough where they will gaze till they are shot as they were in old times by the bow or crossbow  the third division was helfa ddolef or the shouting chase because attended by the clamor of the sportsmen and comprehended the fox the hare and the roe the method of hunting was either with hounds or grehounds which they let slip at the animals holding the dogs in leashes no one was to slip his grehound when the hounds were in chase unless he had a hound in the pack on penalty of having the grehound hamstrung neither was it allowed to kill any animal of chase on its form or at rest on pain of forfeiting his bow and arrow to the lord of the manor when several grehounds the property of different persons were slipped at any animal the person whose dog was nearest the beast when last in sight clamed the skin a bitch was excepted unless it was proved she was pregnant by a dog which had before won a skin  every person who carries a horn must give a scientifical account of the nine objects of chase or else he will be looked on as a pretender and forfeit his horn the same penalty attends the cynllafan or leash he is never again to wear it round his middle on pain of forfeiture but then he is suffered to wear it round his arm  the ancient welsh held the flesh of the stag hare wild boar and the bear to be the greatest delicacies among the beasts of chase  the prince had his pencynwydd or chief huntsman he was the tenth officer of the court he had for his own supper one dish of meat and after it three horns of mead one from the king another from the queen the third from the steward of the household he was never to swear but by his horn and his leash he had the third of the fines and heriots of all the other huntsmen and likewise the same share of the amobr on the marriage of any of their daughters at a certain time of the year he was to hunt for the king only at other seasons he was permitted to hunt for himself his horn was that of an ox of a pound value he had in winter an oxs hide to make leashes in summer a cows to cut into spatterdashes  the king had liberty of hunting wheresoever he pleased but if a beast was hunted and killed on any gentlemans estate and not followed and clamed by the huntsman that night the owner of the land might convert it to his own use but was to take good care of the dogs and preserve the skin  the penalty of killing a tame stag of the kings was a pound and a certain fine if it was a wild one if it was killed between a certain day in november and the feast of st john the value was sixty pence but the fine for killing it a hundred and eighty pence a stag was also reckoned equivalent to an ox a hind to a well grown cow a roe to a goat a wild sow to a tame sow a badger had no value because in some years it was measled wolves and foxes and other noxious animals had no value because every body was allowed to kill them and there was none set upon a hare for a very singular reason because it was believed every other month to change its sex see leges wallicae xxxix     to   0   from cwm bychan harlech took the road to harlech a small and very poor town remarkable only for its castle which is seated on a lofty rock facing the irish sea above an extensive marsh once occupied by the water this fortress was anciently called twr bronwen from bronwen or the whitenecked sister to bran ap llr king of britain in aftertimes it got the name of caer collwyn from collwyn ap tango one of the fifteen tribes o north wales and lord of efionydd ardudwy and part of lln his grandchildren flourished in the reign of gryffydd ap cynan he resided some time in a square tower in the ancient fortress whose remains are very apparent as are part of the old walls which the more modern in certain places are seen to rest on  the present castle was the work of edward i is a noble square building with a round tower at each corner and one on each side the entrance with elegant turrets issuing out of the great rounders like those of his other castles of caernarvon and conway it was completed before the year      at lest i then find that a hundred pounds was the annual salary of hugh de wlonkeslow the constable ayloffs welsh calendar     but it was afterward reduced for it appears that the annual fee was only twentysix pounds thirteen shillings and four pence and in some accounts fifty pounds which was supposed to be for both constable and captain of the town the whole garrison at the same time was twenty soldiers whose annual pay amounted to a hundred and forty pounds dodderidge     the present constable is evan lloyd vaughan esquire with a salary of fifty pounds a year payable out of the revenues of north wales it was impregnable on the side next to the sea on the other it was protected by a prodigious fosse cut with vast expense and trouble in the hard rock  this place was possessed besieged in      in      by dafydd ap jevan ap einion a strong friend of the house of lancaster and distinguished as much by his valor as his goodly personage and great stature gwedir family     he was besieged here by william herbert earl of pembroke after a march through the heart of our alps attended with incredible difficulties for in some parts the soldiers were obliged to climb in others to precipitate themselves down the rocks cambden ii the road is to this day called lle herbert  and at length invested a place till that time deemed impregnable pembroke committed the care of the siege to his brother sir richard a hero equal in size and prowess to the british commandant sir richard sent a summons of surrender but dafydd stoutly answered that he had kept a castle in france so long that he made all the old women in wales talk of him and that he would keep this so long that all the old women in france should talk of him famine probably subdued him he yielded on honorable terms and richard engaged to save his life by interceding with his cruel master edward iv the king at first refused his request when herbert told him plainly that his highness might take his life instead of that of the welsh captain or that he would assuredly replace dafydd in the castle and the king might send whom he pleased to take him out again this prevaled but sir richard received no other reward for his service life of lord herbert       margaret of anjou the faithful and spirited queen of the meek henry vi found in this castle in    0 an asylum after the unfortunate battle of northampton she first fled to coventry and from thence retired to this fortress carte ii      after a short stay here she went to scotland and collecting her friends in the north of england poured all her vengeance on her great enemy duke of york at the battle of wakefield  the place more than once changed masters and in      during the last civil wars it was well defended by major hugh pennant till he was deserted by his men it was finally taken in march      by general mytton when mr william owen was governor and the whole garrison consisted but of twentyeight men it had the honor of surrendering on articles and of being the last in north wales which held out for the king whitelock      torques   edward i formed the town into a borough and conferred on it grants of certain lands and other emoluments  near this place was found the celebrated piece of antiquity in possession of sir roger mostyn  torques on which the learned have thought sit to bestow the name of torques it is well described in cambden as a wreathed rod of gold about four feet long with three spiral furrows with sharp intervening ridges running its whole length to the ends which are plain truncated and turn back like pothooks whether this was purely roman or whether it might not have been common to both nations i will not dispute the use was that of a baldric to suspend gracefully the quiver of men of rank which hung behind by means of the hook and the golden wreath crossed the breast and passed over the shoulder virgil in his beautiful description of the exercises of the trojan youth expresses the manner in these frequently misconstrued lines cornea bina ferunt praefixo hastilia ferro pars laeves numero pharetras it pectore summo flexilis obtorti per collum circulus auri each brandishing aloft

was continued from the more remote periods of britain to later times llewelyn a a lord of yale was called llewelyn aur dorchog llewelyn with the golden torques on that account and the common proverb mi a dynnar dorch a chwi i will pluck the torques with you signifies to this day a hard struggle of a person before he would yield a victory  from harlech i ascended a very steep hill and on my way observe several maen hirion and circles formed of large common pebblestones and of different diameters sometimes appears circle within circle in other places they intersect each other i should have doubted whether they had not been the foundations of cyttier gwyddelod cyttier gwyddelod or the cottages of the wood rangers a sort of temporary hovels erected for the purposes of hunting by our remotest ancestors mona antiqua  had it not been for their intersections the learned borlase gives instances of such in the circles of botallek antiq cornwall     tab xiv  which he supposes to have been formed for religious ceremonies and that one rite might have been performed in one particular circle and another again in a compartment allotted for it by the superstition of druidism clusters of circles were not peculiar to our island baron dahlberg suecia antiqua etc tab     has given a plate of similar assemblages near the town of wexio in smaland in sweden which are on a flat at the foot of a vast sepulchral tumulus with a high column and great globe of stone on the summit some columnar stones or maen hirion appear in the ranges of stones composing the circles  the tumulus is called that of king ingo but since the three monarchs of that name were said to have been steady christians and to have lived in the eleventh century i do guess both tumulus and circles to have been of earlier date and formed in honor  pagan potentate for the northern christendoms old wormii mon dan    or  of christianity abolished all such customs  i must observe that this place is called bonleff her or the loud shout or cry to battle possibly it had been a field of combat and a chieftain had fell here for one of the maen hirion is of a distinguished size  from hence the road is intolerably bad and stoney glyn till i reached glyn a house of my kinsman robert godolphin owen esquire seated in a romantic bottom well wooded this had been the residence of the ancient family of the wynnes from whom it passed to the owens by the marriage of sir robert with the heiress of the place in the last century  pass by the village of llan tegwyn and near a small lake filled with that beautiful aquatic the water lilly somewhat farther is llyntegwyn llantegwin which well merits the name of fair and lovely a lake about a mile round whose waters are of a crystalline clearness its margin full its boundaries neat and clean the narrow path we rode on impends over it and is cut out of a hill whose sides are composed of shivering slate starting out at an immense height above threatening destruction they were much enlivened by flocks of milkwhite goats which skiped along the points and looked down on us with much unconcern  from one of the heights a vast alpine prospect appears in view the stupendous mountains of caernarvenshire and those of merioneddshire not much inferior form a tremendous scenery and rise divided into a multitude of craggy heads the last are particularly barren and appear quite naked excepting where varied by a mossy verdure or whitened by the lichen tartaricus the highest summit of snowdon called y wyddfa soars preeminent from thence the mountains gradually lower to lleyn which stretches in view far to the west and terminates on the point of aberdaron descend into a deep glen clothed on each side with trees with the velynrhyd velyn rhyd or yellow ford at bottom notwithstanding its name a most inky stream the fine cataract a little above being most fitly styled rhaiaderdu or the black  after a short ride reach the village and chapel of maen twrog dependent on the church of festiniog near one end is a great upright stone from which it takes the name this stone is taken into the welsh calendar canonized by the name of st twrog the place lies in the tempe of this country the vale of tan y bwlch tan y bwlch a narrow but beautiful tract about three or four miles long divided by the small river dwyryd or the two fords being formed by the cynsael and another stream which unite toward the upper ends the vale is composed of rich meadows the sides edged with groves and barren precipitous mountains close this gem as it were in a rugged case here is a very neat small inn for the reception of travelers who ought to think themselves much indebted to a nobleman the present earl of radnor  for the great improvement it received from his munificence  above it is a house embosomed with woods most charmingly situated on the side of the hill this seat from the quick succession of owners by the fatal attachment to the bottle has occasioned many a moral reflection from the english traveller a heavy glutinous ale has charms enough to debauch the senses of the whole principality and let me add after a certain stage the fiery dram is called in to effect the destruction the former had begun yet i trust that its charms do not fascinate the senses of the whole principality but that after a fair scrutiny there may be found some corner free from the bacchanalian rout  the river hereabouts widens into a good salmon fishery and after some space falls into an arm of the sea called traeth bach or the little sands  ride up the vale and dismounting meet the course of the cynfael falls of the cynfael which tumbles along the bottom of a deep timeworn chasm sided with sharp and rugged rocks for a very considerable space darkened by trees that overspread the whole issuing both from the sides and margin near festiniog is one cascade remarkably fine consisting of three great falls the lowest dropping into a deep pool black and overshadowed by far impending rocks below is a magnificent columnar rock rising out of the torrent and called pulpit hugh llwyd cynfael hugh lived in the time of james i was supposed to have been a magician and from thence to have delivered his nocturnal incantations a place fit indeed for the purpose as the pit of acheron  about a mile from the cynfael is another comfortable inn which has often received me after my toilsome expeditions opposite to it lies cwm cwmorthin cwmorthin a retreat much more sequestered and much more difficult of access than even cwmbychan in my visit to it i descended through woods along a steep road into a very deep but narrow valley which i crossed and began a very hazardous and fatiguing ascent up the rocky front of a losty mountain the path narrow and dangerous and i believe very rarely attempted by horses after the labor of a mile reached this strange habitation of two farmers in a hollow surrounded on three parts by the rudest of environs and containing a pretty lake and two tenements which yield only grass so that in case the inhabitants have any other wants they must descend from their cwm to get them supplied the mountains which enclose it are the moelwyn yr hydd and the moelwyn gwyn and others equally rude high in the first is the lake dubach which affords perch and another called llyn trwstyllon and opposite to the last a third called llyn conglog all of which after hard rains form noble cataracts down the fronts of the hills we preferred another way out of this singular place and wound up a narrow path at the farthest end on part of molwyn y hydd in order to descend through cwm croesor being then desirous of getting by the nearest road to pont aber glass llyn but in our descent we met with such narrowness of path such short turnings and horrible precipices that our poor beasts with much reason trembled in every limb and in fact had a wonderful escape in getting safe to the bottom the traveller who chooses to follow our steps will find a narrow grassy bottom in cwm croesor with a few tenements he will pass through a pretty wood and soon after find himself on the high road from tan y bwlch to caernarvon  in this journey i went from festiniog on a less hazardous way not two miles from thence on the road from trawsfynnydd to yspytty i fell again into fford helen which is here quite bare and exhibits the rude stones with which it was made  near it beddau gwyr ardudwy at rhyd yr halen on the right are the remains of beddau gwyr ardudwy or the graves of the men of ardudwy these graves were about six feet long marked at each end by two upright stones but most of the stones are now removed there are yet to be seen several circles of stones the largest about fiftytwo feet in diameter a vast carnedd with two upright stones placed on one part as if to mark the entrance to the cell which it probably incloses and near it a lesser heap and a small circle all of which had been surrounded with a larger circle now incomplete by the application of the materials to the making of walls the tradition relating to these monuments is classical nearly parallel with the rape of the sabines the men of ardudwy to populate their country made an inroad into the vale of clwyd and laid violent hands on the fair ladies of the land they carried them in safety to this place where they were overtaken by the warriors of the vale a fierce battle ensued and the men of ardudwy all slain but the ravishers had some how or other so gained the hearts of their fair prey that on their defeat the ladies rather than return home rushed into an adjacent water called from the event llyn y morwynion or the maidens lake and there perished that this had been the scene of a bloody conflict there is a probability the graves and carnedds prove it and the circles evince that it was in the time when the ceremonies of druidism existed  from hence i descended the long and tedious steep of bwlch carreg y fran into the narrow vale of penmachno and after ascending another hill turn to the right into the black and moory mountains to visit llyn conwy llyn conwy the source of the noted river of that name it is a very large piece of water most dismally situated among rock and bog and the sides very irregularly indented it is placed the highest of any large piece of water i have met with in these parts in it are three islands one of which is the haunt of the blackback gulls during the breeding season they are so exceedingly fierce in the defense of their young that i knew of a man who was nearly drowned in an attempt to swim to their nests being so violently beaten by the old birds that he thought he escaped well with the dreadful bruises he received on all the upper part of his body the water issues out of the end of the lake in form of a little rill but in the course of a few miles before it reaches llanrwst becomes a most considerable river by the addition of the various mountain streams  descend for two or three miles and reach the village of yspytty jevan yspytty or the hospital of st john of jerusalem so styled from its having formed in the then inhospitable country an asylum and guard for travelers under the protection of the knights who held the manor and made its precincts a sanctuary after the abolition of the order this privelege became the bane of the neighborhood for the place thus exempted from all jurisdiction was converted into a den of thieves and murderers who ravaged the country far and wide with impunity till the reign of henry vii when they were extirpated by the bravery and prudence of meredydd ap evan  after a very long interval another charity succeeded in the almshouses for six poor men founded in   00 by captain richard vaughan a poor knight of windsor and descended from the neighboring house of pant glass  in the church are three alabaster figures tombs the first is the valiant rhys vawr ap meredydd of the house of plas yolyn to whom at the battle of bosworth henry vii entrusted the standard of england after the bearer sir william brandon was slain by richard a proper respect to the welsh who so highly favored the lancastrian cause the next is an ecclesiastic his son robert ap rhys crossbearer and chaplain to cardinal wolsey and the third lowry the wife of the great rhys i may add that he left several sons from whom were descended many familes particularly those of rhiwlas pant glass giler and voelas  from yspytty i made an excursion to voelas voelas about two miles distant remarkable for a great column with an inscription in memory of llewelyn prince of wales who was slain in the year  0   here is likewise a vast artificial mount the site of a welsh castelet destroyed by llewelyn the great see the poem addressed to him by llywarch brydydd y much in evanss coll awdl vii  mr llwyd confesses the inscription to be very obscure it is part in latin part in welsh the last line says levelinus optimus princeps hic humatus which if meant of any of the actual princes of wales must intend llewelyn ap sitsyllt he being the only one of the three of the name of llewelyn of whose place of interment we are ignorant cambden ii       turn back and again reach the river conway enter caernarvonshire and after a short ride rhaiader y graig llwyd arrive at its celebrated falls not very far from its junction with the machno the prospect is very extraordinary from the neighborhood of a fulling mill where the channel of the rivers form a triangle of deep and doleful chasms worn by the water through the live rock not far below begins the cataract the most tremendous i ever saw and whose roaring gives sufficient notice of its vicinity the rocks which bound it are of a vast height and approach very near to each other and want the pleasing accompaniment of trees attendant on most of our cascades one fall is of very great height and beneath that full in view is a succession of four lesser the descent is steep and dangerous and not to be attempted but by those who have strength of body and steadiness of head when down i found myself environed with naked precipices faced with angular columnar rocks pointing in a sloping direction toward the river adding to the strangeness of the scenery  descend a steep hill and arrive in nant conwy or the vale of conwy after passing over pontorlleder beneath which the river lleder hastens to join thar which gives name to the valley observe in the course of the conwy a deep wide and still water called llyn yr afange or the beavers pool beavers from being in old times the haunt of those animals our ancestors also called them with great propriety llostlydan or the broad tailed animal their skin was in such esteem as to be valued at a hundred and twenty pence while that of the martin took no more than twentyfour pence an ermine twelve an otter wolf or fox only twelve leges wallicae   0      they seem to have been the chief finery and luxury of the days of hoel dda  the vale gradually expands from this end and extends about twenty miles terminating at the town of conway it soon widens to about a mile in breadth and improves in beauty especially in the neighborhood of llanrwst where it is divided into the most beautiful meadows the sides of the hills finely cultivated on the western the vast mountains of snowdon rise in a majestic range the eastern consists of low and broken hills chequered with rich pasturage corn fields and groves the river meanders through the whole and before it reaches llanrwst is of a considerable size  visit the church of bettws wyrion iddon bettws wyrion or the beadhouse of the granchildren of iddon within is the figure of gruffydd ap dafydd goch son to dafydd goch natural son of dafydd brother to the last prince of wales he is in armor recumbent with this inscription hic jacet grufud ap davyd goch agnus dei misere mei  dolwyddelan castle   a little farther pass by pont y pair pont y pair a most singular bridge flung over the llugwy consisting of five arches placed on the rude rocks which form most durable piers these rocks are precipitous and in high floods exhibit to the passenger most awful cataracts below the bridge the scenery beyond of rocky mountains fringed which woods is very striking  this bridge was built on the following occasion one howel a mason from penllyn having occasion about the year      to attend the merionethshire assizes then held at conway had his passage over the lleder obstructed by floods this determined him to remove to the spot where he built a bridge at his own expense and received no other gratuity than what resulted from the spontaneous generosity of passengers he afterward moved to the llugwy and began that of pont y pair but died before he completed his work llwyds itin ms i the same authority says that near this place is a great cromleh called cromleh hwva so named from one hwva ap kyfnerth at rhyddon who concealed himself under it when the earl of pembroke desolated these parts   i soon left the bridge and after a steep ascent arrive at dolwyddelan castle dolwyddelan castle seated in a rocky valley sprinkled over with stunted trees and watered by the lleder the boundaries are rude and barren mountains and among others the great bending mountain scabod often conspicuous from most distant places  the castle is placed on a high rock precipitous on one side and insulated it consists of two square towers one forty feet by twentyfive the other thirtyone by twenty each had formerly three floors the materials of this fortress are the shattery stone of the country yet well squared the masonry good and the mortar hard the castleyard lay between the towers  this had been founded by some of our princes but we are ignorant of its origin there were very few castles in north wales before its conquest by the english they were needless for nature created in our rocks and mountains fortifications until our fatal divisions quite impregnable had there been occasion for artificial retreats the wealth of our country could readily have supplied the means of erecting them we had the balance of trade in our favor this prevented our princes from ever making use of their third prerogative that of coining tertiam est jus leges condendi et monetam percutiendi wottous leges wallicae     our herds and flocks were the frequent resource of the english and brought large sums into wales witness the large sums of money we too frequently were obliged to pay as purchasers of disgraceful peace besides cash was far from being requisite since by our laws every subject was bound to assist in building the royal castles excepting the husbandmen belonging to the king leges wallicae       jorwerth drwndwn made this place his residence and here is said to have been born his son llewelyn the great gweair fam    who began his reign in the time of richard i if dolinchalan castle is as i suppose the same with this gryffydd ap tudor in the reign of edward i had a fee of fifteen pounds as constable rotulae walliae      meredydd ap jevan an ancestor of the wynnes of gwedir in the reign of henry vii purchased the lease of this castle and the enclosures belonging to it from the executors of sir ralph berkenet it having been excepted among the places granted by richard iii and resumed by his successor gwedir family     a publication we are indebted for to my respected friend the honorable daines barrington  before that time hoel as evan ap rhys gethin a noted outlaw resided here as soon as it came into possession of meredydd he removed his habitation in evionedd a hundred in the county to this castle giving this excellent reason i had rather fight with outlaws and thieves than with my own blood and kindred if i live in my own house in evionedd i must either kill mine own kinsmen or be killed by them the feuds among the gentry in evionedd occasioned perpetual murders and nantconwy was filled with banditti  this gentleman soon reformed the country he established colonies of the most tall and able men he could procure till at last they amounted to seven score tall bowmen every one arrayed in a jacket or armolet coat a good steel cap a short sword and dagger together with his bow and arrows many of them also had horses and chasing slaves which were ready to answer the cry on all occasions the same   he founded the strong house of penamnaen penamnaen a mile distant from the castle he removed the church which before lay in a thicket to a more open place by way of security for he never dared to quit his house without leaving in it a strong guard and another of twenty tall archers to attend him whenever he went to church besides a watchman on a rock called carreg y big to give notice of the approach of the banditti he ended his useful life in      and left behind him twentythree legitimate and three natural children  the church had been an impropriation of the abbey of beddkelert is very small and has in it a monument commemorating such of the family who were buried here  pedigree of the wynnes see appendix   in my return to pont y pair digressed a little up the river llugwy to see a noted cascade called rhaiader y wenol or the waterfall of the swallow the river runs along a strait stony channel for a considerable way amidst narrow meadows bounded by majestic alpine scenery then falls into an amazing hollow the bottom is difficult of access but when arrived at exhibits a wonderful scene of mountain and precipice shaded with trees which fringe the top and start even from the fissures of the sides  cross pont y pair carreg y gwalch and go beneath a very lofty rock clothed with wood called carreg y gwalch or the rock of the faleon here was the retreat of a famous partizan of the house of lancaster called dafydd ap shenkin who lurked in a cave still named from him ogo davyd ap shenkin the noblest oaks in all wales grew on this rock within memory of man i remember the stools of several which proved that they were equal to any which grow in the deepest soil yet these rocks are totally destitute of all earth for a considerable way so that the nutriment which the oaks received must have been derived from the deep penetration of the roots through the fissures of the stones into some nutritive matter  the ancient house of gwedir stands near the foot of this rock gwedir it is built

supposition that it was derived from its being the first house in wales which had glass windows is not well founded those conveniences having been known long before sir john win himself even mentions a date of      on a window at dolwyddelan which is long before the building of gwedir but the following lines of a poet who flourished some centuries before is still a stronger proof of the antiquity

written by one of the ablest pens in the fine arts let it suffice to say that the first sir richard win procured from jones the plan of this bridge of which he was founder in      determined to do his country all possible honor by the beauty of the design invented by an architect to which wales had at lest a near relation among all the family papers there is not the lest mention of inigo which must have been the case had he been an eleve of the wynnes as has been popularly asserted   there is one circumstance attending this great genius which deserves mention as it bears some relation to the country from whence he may have derived his origin when he was employed to furnish rare devices and paint the scenery for the masks of the festive year      he painted the creigier eira or a scene in snowdonia for the masque for the honor of wales he did it with such success as to excite the envy of the poet ben jonson for the scenes were more admired than the entertainment which might very well be but jonson was so offended as to give vent to his spleen in a copy of verses as imbecil as they were rancorous and illfounded ben jonsons works vi       the river here makes a handsome appearance

fifth of queen elizabeth to elizeus win and it is still possessed by his descendant lady win widow of the late sir john win of glynllivon a large old house built from the materials of the abbey still remains  i returned through llanrwst trefriw and about two miles beyond high over the conwy visit the village of trefriw where numbers of small vessels are built and sent down the river at spring tides it is said that llewelyn the great had near this place a palace and as a proof several hewn stones have been found in ploughing a field called gardd y neuodd the church of trefriw was originally

approach the summit of snowdon from capel cerig to our boasted alps the boundaries of this vale are on one side the base of the crooked mountain moel siabod on the other that of the gludar bach and several other hills of lesser note the bottom is meadowy at this time enlivened with the busy work of hay harvest and filled with drags horses and even men and women laden with hay the middle is varied with two small lakes along whose sides we rode and at some distance beyond them near pont y gwryd quitted our horses to visit the summit of the glyder noted for the report the editor of cambden had made of the singular disposition of the rocks we directed our servants to go on to llanberis with our steeds the ascent was extremely long steep and laborious wet and slippery and almost the whole way covered with loose fragments of rocks beneath which was a continual roar of waters seeking their way to the bottom  our pains were fully repaid on attaining the summit glyder bach the area was covered with groupes of columnar stones of vast size from ten to thirty feet long lying in all directions most of them were of a columnar form often piled on one another in other places half erect sloping down and supported by others which lie without any order at their bases the tops are frequently crowned in the strangest manner with other stones lying on them horizontally one was about twentyfive feet long and six broad i climbed up and on stamping it with my foot felt a strong tremulous motion from end to end another eleven feet long and six in circumference in the thinnest part was poised so nicely on the point of a rock that to appearance the touch of a child would overset it a third enormous mass had the property of a rocking stone  many of the stones had bedded in them shells and in their neighborhood i found several pieces of lava i would therefore rather consider this mountain to have been a sort of wreck of nature formed and flung up by some mighty internal convulsion which has given these vast groupes of stones fortuitously such a strange disposition for had they been the settled strata bared of their earth by a long series of rains they would have retained the regular appearance as we observe in all other beds of similar matter  one side of this mountain is formed into a gap berissce i may call it with sharp rocks pointing upwards one above the other to a great height in the midst of a vale far below rises the singular mountain trevaen trevaen assuming on this side a pyramidal form naked and very rugged a precipice from whose summit i surveyed the strange scene forbad my approach to examine the nature of its composition and whether it might not have been suspected of being formed at the same time with the phoenomena on the top of its neighbor glyder for i have heard that insulated mountains of this form often appear at the base of greater which have been supposed to owe their origin to volcanic force  from glyder bach i passed over a plain above half a mile broad called y waun oer the chilly mountainous flat observe from the edge in a tremendous hollow llyn y boch llwyd or the lake of the gray goat and in the bottom of the valley near the foot of the trevaen llyn ogwen noted for its fine trout  from waen oer we made a most hazardous descent to cwm bochllwyd and from thence to llyn ogwen the way from that place into the valley or rather chasm of nant frankon is called the benglog benglog the most dreadful horse path in wales worked in the rudest manner into steps for a great length on one side in a deep hollow formed under fallen rocks was once the hiding place of rys goch or eryri or rhys the red of snowdon a mountain bard patronised by robert meredydd a partizan of glyndwr an outlawed chieftain of whose fortunes he partooki do assure the traveller who delights in wild nature that a visit to it up nant frankon from bangor will not be repented the waters of five lakes dart down the precipice of the middle of the benglog and form the torrent of the ogwen which falls into the sea a few miles lower this bottom is surrounded with mountains of a stupendous height mostly precipitous the tops of many edged with pointed rocks i have from the depth beneath seen the shepherds skipping from peak to peak but the point of contact was so small that from this distance they seemed to my uplifted eyes like beings of another order floating in the air  the trevaen from this bottom makes also a very singular appearance resembling a human face reclined backward forehead nose lips and chin are very apparent and you may add without any great strain of fancy the beard of an ancient inhabitant an archdruid  begin another hard ascent to cwm idwal cwm idwal infamous for the murder of a young prince of that name son of owen gwynedd by dunawt son of nefydd hardd one of the fifteen tribes of north wales to whom owen had entrusted the youth to be fostered according to the custom of the country it was a fit place to inspire murderous thoughts environed with horrible precipices shading a lake lodged in its bottom the shepherds fable that it is the haunt of demons and that no bird dare fly over its damned water fatal as that of avernus quam super haud ullae poterant impune volantes tendere iter pennis   near this place is a quarry noted for excellent hones of which quantities are sent annually to london  a new and greater toil is to be undergone in the ascent from cwm idwal to the heights i had left the way lies beneath that vast precipice castle y geifr or the castle of the goats in some distant age the ruins of a rocky mountain formed a road by a mighty lapse a stream of stones each of monstrous size points toward the cwm and are to be clambered over by those only who possess a degree of bodily activity as well as strength of head to bear the sight of the dreadful hollows frequent beneath them  observe on the right a stupendous roche fendue or split rock called twlldu twll du and the devils kitchen it is a horrible gap in the center of a great black precipice extending in length about a hundred and fifty yards in depth about a hundred and only six wide perpendicularly open to the surface of the mountain on surmounting all my difficulties and taking a little breath i ventured to look down this dreadful aperture and found its horrors far from being lessened in my exalted situation for to it were added the waters of llyn y cwn impetuously rushing through its bottom  reach the glyder vawr klogwyn du and pass by the edge of klogwyn du ymben y glyder as dreadful a precipice as any in snowdonia hanging over the dire waters of llyn idwal its neighborhood is of great note among botanists for rare plants among which may be reckoned the saxifraga nivalis bulbocodium and the lichen islandicus the last is of singular use to the icelanders a decoction of the fresh leaves in water serves them in the spring as a powerful cathartic and yet when dried changes its quality and if grinded to powder is a common food either made into bread or boiled with milk or water haller and scopoli also mention its use at their time in vienna in coughs and consumptions made into broth or gruel lightfoots fl sectica ii      the prospect from this mountain is very noble glyder vawr snowdon is seen to great advantage the deep vale of llanberris and its lakes nant frankon and variety of other singular views the plain which forms the top is strangely covered with loose stones like the beach of the sea in many places crossing one another in all directions and entirely naked numbers of groupes of stones are placed almost erect sharp pointed and in sheafs all are weatherbeaten timeeaten and honeycombed and of a venerable gray color the elements seemed to have warred against this mountain rains have washed lightnings torn the very earth deserted it and the winds made it the constant object of their fury the shepherds make it the residence of storms and style a part of it carnedd y gwynt or the eminence of tempests  this mountain is connected to the lesser glyder by the weyn oer the traveller therefore has his choice of ways to these wondrous mountains but the most preferable for ease is the road i descend into the vale of llanberis in my way pass close by a rugged brow of a hill which i think is rhiw y glyder recorded by llwyd and ray for its variety of plants from thence descend by oleu fawr  soon after visit the small lake called llyn y cwn llyn y cwn noted for the tale of giraldus who informs us that in his days the three kinds of fish it yielded trouts perch and eels were monocular every one wanting the left eye at present there is not a fish in it to disprove the relation to make amends the botanist will find in it the lobelia dortmanna sabularia aquatica and isoetis lacustris and not far from it the juncus triglumis common to this and some of the highland mountains the hieracium alpinum ruhus saxatilis solidago cambrica and other rare plants are to be met with in the course of this part of the descent leave o the right llider vawr and llider vach two great mountains part of the boundaries of nantberis and arrive in that vale by caunant yr

mountains it is strait and of nearly an equal breadth filled by some meadows and two magnificent lakes which communicate to each other by means of a river the venerable oaks spoken of by leland are no more avarice or dissipation and its constant follower poverty have despoiled much of our principality of its leafy beauties among the numberless errors of this performance i fear the word is clothed with trees must be supplied by the traveller with was but this shadeless tract is still worthy his attention a road once a succession of rude and stony stairs made with much labor ran on one side high above the lake and was often cut out of the rock to form the way this is i am now informed changed into a road which too much facilitates the approach and lessens its propriety and its agreement with the wild environs  on the loftiest part castle dolbadern over one of the lakes stand the remains of castle dolbadern consisting of a round tower and a few fragments of walls it was constructed with the thin laminated stones of the country cemented with very strong mortar without shells the inner diameter of the tower is only twentysix feet this seems to have been built to defend the pass into the interior parts of snowdonia and it was likewise used as a state prison the founder is unknown to me but it was evidently a welsh prince  in this valley are two groupes of wretched houses the farthest is near the end of the upper lake with its church dedicated to st peris who was as we are told a cardinal here is to be seen the well of the saint enclosed with a wall the sybil of the place attends and divines your fortune by the appearance or nonappearance of a little fish which lurks in some of its holes  from hence i took a ride above the lakes to their lower extremity the upper is the lesser but much the most beautiful piece of water it is said to be in places a hundred and forty yards deep to have abounded with char before they were reduced by the streams flowing from the copper mines which had been worked on the sides of the hills the lower lake is about a mile and a half long narrows gradually into the form of a river called the rythell and flows in a diffused channel to caernarvon where it assumes the name of seiont  near this end of the lake lived a celebrated personage margaret uch evan whom i was disappointed in not finding at home this was margaret uch evan of penllyn the last specimen of the strength and spirit of the ancient british fair this extraordinary female was the greatest hunter shooter and fisher of her time she kept a dozen at lest of dogs terriers grehounds and spaniels all excellent in their kinds she killed more foxes in one year than all the confederate hunts do in ten rowed stoutly and was queen of the lake fiddled excellently and knew all our old music did not neglect the mechanic arts for she was a very good joiner and notwithstanding she was seventy years of age was the best wrestler in the country and few young men dared to try a fall with her some years ago she had a maid of congenial qualities but death that mighty hunter at last earthed this faithful companion of here is i must not forget that all the neighboring bards paid their addresses to margaret and celebrated her exploits in pure british verse  about half a mile farther i visited the remains of lls dinorwig a house said to have been one of the palaces of prince llewelyn ap gryffydd the walls high and strong the hall twentyfour yards long and before the house is a deep ditch over which had probably been a drawbridge not very far from hence is a spot called rhiwr cyrn or the brow of the horns where according to old usage an officer stood and blew his horn to give notice to the household of the approach of their master or to summon the vassals to assemble on all emergent occasions  this country is part of the woodless flat british posts between the mountains and the menai its want of strength is supplied with several posts fortified in the british manner dinas dinorwig about half a mile south of the church of llandeniolen in the churchyard is an yew tree twentyseven feet in girth  is the chief the area is very large surrounded with an agger of small stones backed by another of very large ones then succeeds a deep ditch a rampart of earth a second vast ditch and a third rampart within the area is a circle of stones the post probably of the commander in chief  in our way from hence we passed by another called pen y gaer and soon after by a smaller called bryn y castrelau surrounded with a single wall and on a rising on the other side of the rythell is another named caer cwm y glo or caer carregyfran from which had been as we were informed a paved way to lls dinorwig i may here add that after the death of llewelyn edward i bestowed that palace on sir gryffydd llwyd the same gentleman who first brought him the news of the birth of his son edward of caernarvon  return by the same road and after refreshing myself with a nights rest at mr closes agent to the mines in llanberris early in the morning begin our ascent to the highest peak of snowdon under the guidance of hugh shone whom i beg leave to recommend as a most able conductor keep upon the side of the lake for a considerable way then turn to the left and see not far from the road caunant mawr caunant mawr a noble cataract precipitating over two vast rocks into two most horrible chasms near this place were found several beads some of glass and one of jet  ascend above cwm brwynog a very deep bottom fertile in gwair y rhosydd which is composed chiefly of different kinds of rushes particularly juncus squarrosus the mossrush scirpus caspitosus the heath club rush schaenus nigricans the black bog rush and carexes intermixed with few kinds of grass the hay which the lower meadows produce is very different in quality grasses being remarkably fine and soft and consists in great part of the fine bent grass agrostis capillaris as we are on the subject of grasses it may be pleasing to observe how some of them wonderfully change their appearance as they ascend the higher hills the turfy hair grass aira caespitosa sheeps fescue grass pestuca ovina alpine meadow grass poa alpina and some others which in the low countries where they enjoy the due influence of the sun and length of summer to ripen their seeds are propagated in the common manner that grasses are as they reach a more exalted situation where they want continuance of summer and the necessary power of that enlivening body to perfect their seeds become viviparous that is the rudiment of the germen vegetates and shoots into blade in the cup from whence falling it readily takes root and grows a kind and providential dispensation for the advantage of those colder climates which are less favorable to vegetation  this mountanous tract scarcely yields any corn its produce is cattle and sheep which during summer keep very high in the mountains followed by their owners with their families who reside in that season in havodtys summer dwellings or summer dairyhouses as the farmers in the swiss alps do in their sennes these houses consist of a long low room with a hole at one end to let out the smoke from the fire which is made beneath their furniture is very simple stones are the substitutes of stools and the beds are of hay ranged along the sides they manufacture their own clothes and dye their cloths with cenn du y cerrig or lichen omphaloides and another cenn the lichen parietinus native dies collected from the rocks during summer the men pass their time either in harvest work or in tending their herds the women in milking or making butter and cheese for their own use they milk both ewes and goats and make cheese of the milk for their own consumption the diet of these mountaneers is very plain consisting of butter cheese and oatbread or bara cyrch their drink whey not but they have a reserve of a few bottles of very strong beer by way of cordial in illness they are people of good understanding wary and circumspect usually tall thin and of strong constitutions from their way of living toward winter they descend to their hen dref or old dwelling where they lead during winter a vacant life  in the course of our ascent saw on the left above the cwm moel y cynhorion or the hill of council pass through bwlch y maescwm and skirt the side of snowdon till we reach bwlch y cwm brwynog where the ascent becomes very difficult by reason of its vast steepness people here usually quit their horses we began a toilsome march clambering among the rocks on the left were the precipices over cwm brwynog with llyn du yr arddwy at their foot on our right were those over the small lakes llyn glass llyn ynadroedd and llyn coch the high lakes the last is the highest on this side of the mountain and on whose margins we were told that in fairy days those diminutive gentry kept their revels this space between precipice and precipice forms a short and no very agreeable isthmus till we reached a verdant expanse which gave us some respite before we labored up another series of broken crags after these is a second smooth tract which reaches almost to the summit top of snowdon which by way of preeminence is styled y wyddfa or the conspicuous it rises almost to a point or at best there is but room for a circular wall of loose stones within which travelers usually take their repast  the mountain from hence seems propped by four vast buttresses between which are four deep cwms or hollows each excepting one had one or more lakes lodged in its distant bottom the nearest was fsynnon las fynnon las or the green well lying immediately below us one of the company had the curiosity to descend a very bad way to a jutting rock that impended over the monstrous precipice and he seemed like mercury ready to take his flight from the summit of atlas the waters of ffynnon las from this height appeared black and unfathomable and the edges quite green from thence is a succession of bottoms surrounded by the most lofty and rugged hills the greatest part of whose sides are quite mural and form the most magnificent amphitheatre in nature the wyddfa is on one side crib y distill with its serrated tops on another crib coch a ridge of fiery redness appears beneath the preceding and opposite to it is the boundary called the lliwedd another very singular support to this mountain is y clawdd coch rising into a sharp ridge so narrow as not to afford breadth even for a path  the view from this exalted situation is unbounded in a former tour august   th old style  i saw from it the county of chester the high hills of yorkshire part of the north of england scotland and ireland a plain view of the isle of man and that of anglesea lay extended like a map beneath us with every rill visible i took much pains to see this prospect to advantage sat up at a farm on the west till about twelve and walked up the whole way the night was remarkably fine and starry toward morn the stars faded away and left a short interval of darkness which was soon dispersed by the dawn of day the body of the sun appeared most distinct with the rotundity of the moon before it rose high enough to render its beams too brilliant for our sight the sea which bounded the western part was gilt by its beams first in slender streaks at length glowed with redness the prospect was disclosed to us like the gradual drawing up of a curtain in a theater we saw more and more till the heat became so powerful as to attract the mists from the various lakes which in a slight degree obscured the prospect the shadow of the mountain was flung many miles and showed its bicapitated form the wyddfa making one crib y distill the other head i counted this time between twenty and thirty lakes either in this county or meirionyddshire the day proved so excessively hot that my journey cost me the skin of the lower part of my face before i reached the resting place after the fatigue of the morning  on this day august   th new style  the sky was obscured very soon after i got up a vast mist enveloped the whole circuit of the mountain the prospect down was horrible it gave an idea of numbers of abysses concealed by a thick smoke furiously circulating around us very often a gust of wind formed an opening in the clouds which gave a fine and distinct visto of lake and valley sometimes they opened only in one place at others in many at once exhibiting a most strange and perplexing sight of water fields rocks or chasms in fifty different places they then closed at once and left us involved in darkness in a small space they would separate again and fly in wild eddies round the middle of the mountains and expose in parts both tops and bases clear to our view we descended from this various scene with great reluctance but before we reached our horses a thunder storm overtook us its rolling among the mountains was inexpressibly awful the rain uncommonly heavy we remounted our horses and gained the bottom with great hazard the little rills which on our ascent trickled along the gullies on the sides of the mountain were now swelled into torrents and we and our steeds passed with the utmost risque of being swept away by these sudden waters at length we arrived safe yet sufficiently wet and weary to our former quarters  it is very rare that the traveller gets a proper day to ascend the hill attraction of clouds for it often appears clear but by the evident attraction of the clouds by this lofty mountain it becomes suddenly and unexpectedly enveloped in mist when the clouds have just before appeared very remote and at great heights at times i have observed them lower to half their height and notwithstanding they had been dispersed to the right and to the left yet they have met from both sides and united to involve the summit in one great obsscurity  the quantity of water which flows from the lakes of snowdonia rivers is very considerable so much that i doubt not but collectively they would exceed the waters of the thames before it meets the flux of the ocean  the reports of the height of this noted hill have been very differently given height a mr caswell who was employed by mr adams in      in a survey of wales measured it by instruments made by the directions of mr flamstead wrens parentalia i     i suppose caswell was employed by mr adams author of the index villeris  and asserts its height to have been twelve hundred and forty yards but for the honor of our mountain i am sorry to say that i must give greater credit to the experiments made of late years which have sunk it to one thousand one hundred and eightynine yards and one foot reckoning from the quay at caernarvon to the highest peak  the stone that composes this strata and indeed the greatest part of snowdonia is excessively hard large coarse crystals are often found in the fissures and very frequently cubic pyritae the usual attendants on alpine tracts these are also frequented by the rock ouzel a mountain bird and some of the lakes are stocked with char and gwyniads alpine fish the ancient inhabitant the goat decreases daily in value since the decline of orthodoxal wigs to which its snowy hair universally contributed still large flocks are kept for the dairy and milked with great regularity  botany is not within my province botany i shall therefore say nothing more of the plants than that those species which linnaeus so very expressively styles aethereae are entirely confined to the higher parts of the mountains and notwithstanding the seeds must be blown downwards they never vegetate in the lower parts which are deserted by certain plants which are natives of a higher tract of the same hill  the animals of these regions are chiefly foxes stags were found here in the days of leland in such numbers as to destroy the little corn which the farmers attempted to sow but they were extirpated before the year      gwedir mss  a royal forest snowdon being a royal forest warrants were issued for the killing of the deer i have seen one from the duke of suffolk dated april the  0th      and another in the first year of queen elizabeth signed by robert tonesend and a third in      by henry sydney the second was addressed to the master of the game ranger and keeper of the queens highness forest of snowdon in the county of caernarvon the last extended the forest into the counties of meirionydd and anglesea with the view of gratifying the rapacity of the favorite dudley earl of leicester who had by letters patent been appointed chief ranger of the forest in consequence he tyrannized over the counties with great insolence a set of informers immediately acquainted him that most of the freeholders estates might be brought within the boundaries commissioners were appointed to enquire of the encroachments and concealments of lands within the forest juries were empannelled but their returns were rejected by the commissioners as unfavorable to the earls designs the jurors performed an honest part and found a verdict for the country leland who no longer before than the reign of henry viii had gone over this tract as he did most of england under the royal commission and yet reports that all cregery i e snowdon is in caernarvonshire and no part in merionethshire though says he that shire be montanius itin v      a new commission was then directed to sir richard bulkeley of baron hill anglesea sir william herbert and others but this by the firmness of sir richard was likewise soon superseded but in      another was appointed dependent on the favorite a packed jury was directed to appear at beaumaris who went on the same day to view the marsh of malltraeth ten miles distant and found that marsh to be in the forest of snowdon notwithstanding it was in another county and divided from the forest by an arm of the sea because the commissioners had told them that they had met with an indictment in the exchequer of gaernarvon which they had the year before broke open and ransacked by which they had discovered that a stag had been rouzed in the forest of snowdon in caernarvonshire was pursued to the banks of the menai that it swam over that branch of the sea and was killed at malltraeth infra forestam nostram de snowdon the jury appeared in the earls livery blue with ragged staves on the sleeves and were ever after branded with the title of the black jury who sold their country  sir richard bulkeley not the lest daunted with this decision continued steady in his opposition to the tyrant and laid before the queen the odiousness of the proceedings and the grievances her loyal subjects the welsh labored under by the commission insomuch in      her highness was pleased by proclamation at westminster to recall it leicester disappointed in his views pursued sir richard with the utmost inveteracy he even accused him of a concern in babingtons conspiracy before god says the queen we will be sworn upon the evangelists he never intended us any harm and so ran to the bible and kissed it saying we shall not commit him we have brought him up from a boy from the communication of paul panton esquire   snowdon was held as sacred by the ancient britons sacred as parnassus was by the greeks and ida by the cretans it is still said that whosoever slept upon snowdon would wake inspired as much as if he had taken a nap on the hill of apollo the britons in very early times worshipped mountains and rivers gildas but that does not appear from the triambics quoted by our able antiquary mr rowlands rowlands     for the words eiry mynydd are applicable not to this mountain in particular but to all which are covered with snow there are multitudes of these triambics each ending with a moral reflection the work of llywarch heen of which the following may serve as an example eiry mynydd gwangeus jar gochwiban gwynt ar dalar in yr ing goran ywr car mr rhys joness coll of welsh poems p     while the hill is clad with snow fowls for food scream out below fierce the winds on ploughlands blow when deep grief affects your mind balmy cure from kin you will find   the welsh had always the strongest attachment to the tract of snowdon it was say they the appertenance of the principality of wales which the prince and his predecessors held since the time of brute edward i was told by the inhabitants of snowdon in the treaty he held with our countrymen in the year      that even should their prince be inclined to gratify the king in yielding him possession they would not do homage to strangers of whose tongue manners and laws they were ignorant powel      our princes had in addition to their title that of lord of snowdon they had five hardy barons within the tract who held of them such was the importance of this strong region that when llewelyn was at the last extremity he rejected the proposal of edward of a thousand a year and some honorable county in england well knowing that his principality must terminate with the cession  no sooner had edward effected his conquest fair held there than he held a triumphal fair upon this our chief of mountains and adjourned to finish the joy of his victory by solemn tournaments on the plains of nevyn  i shall take my leave of snowdonia name with some remarks on the name and the weather the first is a literal translation by the saxons first into snawdune sax chr  0  of the ancient appellation creigier eira the snowy mountains from the frequency of snow upon them niphates in armenia and imaus in tartary derive their name from the same circumstance some have supposed it to be taken from creigiaur eryri or the eagle rocks but that bird appears very seldom among them the other circumstance is constant not that it is to be imagined that they are covered with snow in some part or other the whole year as has been idly fabled there being frequently whole weeks even in winter in which they are totally free  the earliest appearance of snow weather is commonly between the middle of october and the beginning of november the falls which happen then are usually washed away with the rains and the hills remain clear till christmas between that time and the end of january the greatest falls happen which are succeeded by others about the latter end of april or beginning of may which remain in certain places till the middle of june in which month it has been seen of the depth of some feet it has even happened that the greatest fall has been in april or beginning of may and that never fails happening when the preceding winter has had the smallest falls but the fable of giraldus concerning the continuance of snow the whole year is totally to be exploded  near the end of nantberis pass beneath glyder vawr and observe the strata of a columnar form high above our heads at times vast fragments of this tremendous rock tumble down the ruins are scattered about the base and exhibit awful specimens of the frequent lapses one is styled the cromlech for having accidentally fallen on other stones it remains lifted from the earth with a hollow beneath resembling one of those druidical antiquities the length of the incumbent stone is sixty feet the breadth fortysix the thickness sixteen the hollow is said once to have been occupied by an old woman but now serves for a sheep pen  the ascent from hence is either over loose stones or solid staircase and is exceedingly steep it is a singular road lying in a stupendous chasm bounded for above a mile by nearly equidistant precipices of prodigious height on one side belonging to the glyders on the other by the parts of snowdon  refresh ourselves on a spot called the gorphwysfa gorphwysfa or the resting place at a small distance from which is bwlchy gwyddyl or the pass of the irishmen from whence is a singular view of dyffryn mymbyr the chasm we had left and far below us the picturesque vale of nant gwynnan the scene of many a bloody skirmish in the time of edward iv between william earl of pembroke and the welsh lancastrians under jevan ap robert  descend a very steep road cwm dyli into that part called cwm dyli where we quitted our horses and began a most toilsome journey to visit the hidden vales lodged in the bosom of the mountains we began with clambering up the rugged face of a rock broken into a multitude of short precipices and divided in the middle by a cataract the discharge of the waters from the alpine lakes after about a quarter of a miles labor cwm dyli ucha we reached cwm y cwm dyli a flat tract of hay ground watered by a river and filled with haymakers the farmer and his family being resident here in his havodtu for the summer season after dining with them on curds and whey we kept along the rivers side and found opposed to us another front rugged as the former and attended with a cataract this was surmounted with equal difficulty we found on arriving at the top a bottom a mile in length filled with llyn llydaw llyn llydaw a fine lake winding beneath the rocks and vastly indented by rocky projections here and there jutting into it in it was one little island the haunt of blackbacked gulls which breed here and alarmed by such unexpected visitants broke the silence of this sequestered place by their deep screams we continued our walk ascending along a narrow path above the lake as far as the extremity then descending reached the opposite side in order to encounter a third descent as arduous as the preceding this brought us into the horrible crater immediately beneath the great precipice of the wyddfa in which is lodged ffynnen las ffynnon las its situation is the most dreadful surrounded by more than three parts of a circle with the most horrible precipices of the wyddfa crib y distill and crib coch with the vast mural steeps of lliwedd continued over the other lake and cwm dyli in the lliwedd was a strange break called bwlch y saethau or the pass of the arrows probably a station for hunters to watch the wanderings of the deer  the margins of ffynnon las here appeared to be shallow and gravelly the waters had a greenish cast but what is very singular the rocks reflected into them seemed varied with stripes of the richest colors like the most beautiful lutestrings and changed almost to infinity  here we observed the wheatear wheatear a small and seemingly tender bird and yet is almost the only small one or indeed the only one except the rock ouzel or mwyalchen y graig that frequents these heights the reason is evidently the want of food  we descended from this dreary scene on the other side of the hill crib coch above llyn llydaw having the tremendous red precipices of crib coch high above us rising into a mere ridge serrated or rather herissee its whole length the face of many of the rocks were marked with large veins of coarse white crystal and others especially crib coch were varied with the deep green of the dwarf alpine juniper on attaining the top of the hills above the lower end of the lake we descend to the gorphwysfa where we found our horses and returned once more into nantgwinan  this is the most beautiful vale in snowdonia nant gwynar varied with woods lakes river and meadows besides the most august boundaries being guarded on each side by vast mountains such as crib du or part of mynydd nanmer the aran lliwedd dduallt and wenallt extending about five miles to the church of beddkelert on the left we passed by havod lwyvog the seat of the late meyric meredydd esquire surrounded with large woods a little farther is the pretty lake llyn gwynan about three quarters of a mile long and near it are the ruins of a chapel of the same name the chapel had been an ease to the church of beddkelert and was supported by a stipend of five pounds a year from the estate of gwedir it is said to have been founded by john williams grandson of john coetmor ap meredydd ap jevan ap robert of keselgyfarch and gwedir and goldsmith in london the same who is reported to have furnished michael drayton with lelands papers  near the end of the lake the valley grows so contracted as to form only a narrow straight but almost instantly opens again into a fine expanse chiefly filled with the beautiful llyn dinas beyond that is a tract of meads chequered with woods and watered by the river created by the various lakes but retains the name of avon glaslyn from the lofty ffynnonlas from which it originates  at the bottom rises a vast rock dinas emris insulated and clothed with wood the famous dinas emris from early times celebrated in british story for here prophetic merlin sat when to the british king the changes long to come auspiciously he told   dinas emrys   when vortigern found himself unable to contest with the treacherous saxons its legend whom he had in the year     invited into britain he determined by the advice of his magicians on building an impregnable fortress in snowdon he collected the materials which all disappeared in one night the prince astonished at this convened again his wise men they assured him his building would never stand unless it was sprinkled with the blood of a child born without the help of a father the realm was ransacked at length one of his emissaries overheard some boys at play reproach another and call him an unbegotten knave the child and his mother were brought before the king she confessed he was the offspring of an incubus a species of being now unhappily out of all credit the boy whose name was merlin was ordered to be sacrificed but on confounding all the magicians with his questions and explaining the cause of the miscarriage got his liberty nennius c xl xlii xliii  and to that mighty king which rashly undertook a strong walled tower to rear those earthly spirits that shook the great foundation still in dragons horrid shape that dreaming wizard told making the mountain gape with his most powerful charms to view those caverns deep and from the the top of brith so high and wondrous steep where dinas emris stood showed where the serpents fought the white that tore the red from whence the prophet wrought the britons sad decay then shortly to ensue draitons pellb song x    this is the poetical translation of the legend merlin merlin or merdil emris or ambrosius was in fact the son of a noble roman of the same name his mother a vestal to save her life and honor powels notes on giraldus itin cambriae lib i c x  invented the fable of his father which was swallowed by the credulity of the times merlin was an able mathematician and astronomer and deeply read in all the learning of his age the vulgar as usual ascribed all he did to art magic and his discovery that vortigern had begun to found his castle on a morass was immediately said to have been attended with most portentous circumstances numbers of prophecies were attributed to him the repetition of which is said to have been forbidden by the council of trent  three sides of this famous rock are precipitous on the top is a large area on the accessible part of which are two great ramparts of stone and within is the ruin of a stone building ten yards long the walls are dry but strong since it is certain that vortigern after his misfortunes retired to the snowdon hills and died not very remote from them it is possible he might have selected this for his stronghold as it is admirably adapted for that purpose and nearly fills the straight of the valley and merlin ambrosius might have given to it the name of emris a place close by styled cell y dewiniaid or the cell of the diviners allusive to the magicians of vortigerns court is another circumstance which favors the history of this celebrated supposed prophet  from hence is a pleasant beed kelert but short ride near the river to the village of bed kelert seated in a beautiful tract of meadows at beddkelert the junction of three vales near the conflux of the glass lyn and the colwyn which flows through nant colwyn a vale that leads to caernarvon its situation was the fittest in the world to inspire religious meditation amidst lofty mountains woods and murmuring streams the church is small yet the loftiest in snowdonia the east window consists of three narrow slips the roof is neat and there yet remains some very pretty fretwork a side chapel is supported by two neat pillars and gothic arches i could discover no tombs nor any thing worth transcribing but the following epitaph infra jacet corpus evani lloyd de hafod lwyfog armigeri qui inhumatus fuit paterno et avito tumulo sexto die idus maiae a d      annos natus      this church had been conventual priory belonging to a priory of augustines dedicated to st mary there is reason to suppose they might have been of that class which was called gilbertines and consisted of both men and women who lived under the same roof but strictly separated from each other by a wall the cause of my suspicion is that i discovered a piece of ground near the church called dool y llein or the meadow of the nun  bed kelert had been the most ancient foundation in all the country excepting bardsey tanner ascribes it to our last prince but it must have been long before his days there being a recital of a charter for certain lands bestowed on it by llewelyn the great rymer ii      who began his reign in      it was favored in the same manner by others of the succeeding princes david ap llewelyn bestowed on it some lands in pennant gwernogan belonging to tudor ap madoc to which the prince had no right this occasioned a suit between the sons of tudor and philip prior of the house before william de grandison and r de stanedon at caernarvon when a verdict was given against the convent sebright ms  the prior had for his support the grange of llecheidior and part of a mill the grange of fentidilt and village of gwehelyn the grange of trerbeirdd one plough land and a certain share of the bees the esteem which these insects were held in by the ancient britons on account of their producing the nectareous medd was so great that they considered them as created in paradise that when they quitted it on the fall of man they were blessed by god himself and therefore no mass ought to be celebrated but by the light of their wax leges walliae       the prior had besides an allowance of fifty cows and twenttwo sheep the expenses of the house must have been large it lay on the great road from england and west wales into north wales and from ireland and north wales into england in order to enable this place to keep its usual hospitality after it had suffered in      by a casual fire edward i most munificently repaired all the damages and bishop anian about the year      for the encouragement of other benefactors remitted to all such who were truly repentant of their sins forty days of any penance inflicted on them rymer ii       in      it was bestowed by henry viii on the abbey of chertsey in surry and in      it was given with the last as an appertenance to that of bisham in berkshire dugdale monast iii     on the dissolulution the king gave to the family of the bodvels all the lands in caernarvonshire which belonged to this priory and all those in anglesey to that of the prydderchs excepting the township of trerbeirdd rowlands mss  the revenues of bed kelert were valued by dugdale at seventy pounds three shillings and eight pence by speed at sixtynine pounds three shillings and eight pence edward conway is mentioned as last prior there are not the lest relics of the house  in order to complete the mountain ramble as far as was in my power i made an excursion from this village up a narrow vale ascend a steep road amidst a thin hanging wood and see from the road multitudes of black cattle desending from all parts on their way to a neighboring fair the vale expands is watered by the colwyn which flows from a small lake we passed by called llyn cader llyn cader left on the right another ascent to the wyddfa where its base extends to a considerable breadth and is far less steep than that on the side of nantberis we soon reached the pretty lake of cawellyn noted for its char the mountains hereabouts approach near to each other on the right mynydd mawr forms a striking feature its top is smooth but its front is formed into a most immense precipice retiring inwards in a semicircular shape moel eilio is another mountain of a stupendous bulk most regularly rounded and of a beautiful verdure at bettus garmon a village with a church dedicated to st germanus the scene changes into a range of beautiful meadows watered by a rapid stream  i here turn my back on the humble flats and resume my former road till i had passed cawellyn not far beyond that lake llyn y dywarchen i turned to the right to visit llyn y dywarchen or the lake of the sod long since celebrated by the hyperbolical pen of giraldus itin cambr lib ii c ix p      for its insula erratica its wandering island as he calls it that little lake is seated in the middle of a turbery and at this time actually exhibited the phenomenon recorded by our romantic historian it had on it a floating island of an irregular shape and about nine yards long it appeared to be only a piece of the turbery undermined by the water torn off and kept together by the close entangling of the roots which form that species of ground it frequently is set in motion by the wind often joins its native banks and as giraldus says cattle are frequently surprised on it and by another gale carried a short voyage from the shore  continue our journey to drws y coed drws y coed or the door of the wood a pass toward clynnog it is bounded by vast mountains on one side by tal mignedd on the other by a great clift of mynydd mawr some years ago here were considerable adventures for copper of the yellow kind and in the rocks were sometimes found some very thin laminae of the native metal i was tempted here to exceed a little the limits of my alpine tour for now the mountains descend fast from their majestic heights growing less and less as they approach the irish sea my motive was to obtain a sight of two fine lakes called llynnieu nanlle which form two handsome expanses llynieu nanlle with a very small distance between each from hence is a noble view of the wyddfa which terminates the view through the visto of drws y coed it is from this spot mr wilson has favored us with a view as magnificent as it is faithful few are sensible of this for few visit the spot  near these lakes edward i in the summer of      resided for some days and from hence issued out more than one of his edicts i find some dated july the   th and the  0th others are dated in the same year from bangor caernarvon mold and hope one from caernarvon sebright mss rymer ii     to     is dated as late as the   d of october which shows what attention he paid to the establishment of government in his new dominions by the long visit he deigned to honor them with the place he resided at here was called bala deu llyn or the place where a river discharges itself from two lakes but at present all memory is lost of the situation of the town whose traces might perhaps be still discovered after proper search  i returned by the same road and again reach bed kelert where i made a coarse lodging the evening was so fine that we were irresistibly tempted not to defer till morning our visit to pont aberglas llyn a short walk from hence pont aberglas llyn the first part is along the narrow vale but in a very little time the mountains approach so close as to leave only room for the furious river to roll over its stony bed above which is a narrow road formed with incredible labor impending over the water the way seems to have been first cut out of the rock and then covered with great stones as usual in several of our narrow passes the scenery is the most magnificent that can be imagined the mountains rise to very uncommon height and oppose to us nothing but a broken series of precipices one above the other as high as the eye can reach here is very little appearance of vegetation yet in spots there is here and there enough to tempt the poor goat to its destruction for it will sometimes leap down to an alluring tuft of verdure where without possiblity of return it must remain to perish after it has finished the dearbought repast  the bridge terminates the pass and consists of a single arch flung over a deep chasm from rock to rock above is a considerable cataract where the traveller at times may have much amusement in observing the salmon in great numbers make their efforts to surpass the heights near the place is a salmon fishery here had been a royal wear in the reign of henry iv which was then rented by robert ap meredydd it probably belonged in old times to our natural princes for it seems to have been a most valuable privelege we have seen before that young elphin was endowed with one by his royal father and the effect of his disappointment in missing his usual revenues by finding which i dare say was in those days a very rare instance an empty wear salmon was the most useful and esteemed fish among the welsh it was reckoned among the game and if i remember right is the only species which was preserved by law  on my return to bed kelert rhys goch a stone by the road side was pointed out to me by the name of the chair of rhys goch oryri the famous mountain bard cotemporary with owen glyndwr he was of the house of havod garregog at the entrance into traeth mawr from whence he used to walk and sitting on this stone compose his poems among others is a satire on a fox for killing his favorite peacock he died about the year    0 and was interred in the holy ground at bed kelert after escaping the vengeance of the english for inspiring our countrymen with the love of liberty and animating them by his compositions into a long and gallant resistance to the galling yoke    continuation of the journey from bed kelert i returned to pont aber glass lyn and soon reached traeth mawr a large extent of sands between the counties of caernarvon and meirionydd of most dangerous passage to strangers by reason of the tides which flow here with great rapidity this forms the bottom of the vast bay of cardigan in the year      sir john win of gwedir conceived the great design of gaining this tract and a lesser called traeth bychan from the sea by means of embanking he implored the assistance of his illustrious contryman sir hugh middleton sir johns letter and sir hughs reply will be the best account i can give of the affair which never was carried into execution as i imagine for want of money sir johns is as follows  right worthy sir my good cousin and one of the great honors of the nation i understand of a great work that you have performed in the isle of wight in gaininge too thousand acres from the sea i may say to you what the jews said to christ  we have heard of thy great works done abroad do somewhat in thine own country  there are too washes in merionethshire whereon some part of my being lies called traeth mawr and traeth bychan of a great extent of land and entering into the sea by one issue which is not a mile broad at full sea and very shallow the fresh currents that run into the sea are both vehement and great and carry with them much sand besides the southerly wind usually blows fulle to the havens mouth carries with it so much sand that it has overwhelmed a great quantity of the ground adjacent there and also in the borderinge countries abundance of wood brush and other materials fit to make mounds to be had at a very cheap rate and easily brought to the place which i hear they do in lincolnshire to expel the sea my skill is little and my experience none at all in such matters yet i ever had a desire to further my country in such actions as might be for their profit and leave a remembrance of my endeavors but hindered with other matters i have only wished well and done nothing now being it pleased god to bring you into this country i am to desire you to take a ride the place not being above a days journey from you and if you do see the thing fit to be undertaken i am content to adventure a brace of hundred pounds to join with you in the work  i have lead ore on my grounds great store and other minerals near my house if it please you to come hither being not above too days journey from you you shall be most kindly welcome  it may be you shall find here that will tend to

in seekinge of coals for the town of denbigh  touching the drowned lands near your lyvinge there are many things considerable therein if to be gained which will hardly be performed without great stones which was plentiful at the weight as well as wood and great sums of money to be spent not hundreds but thousands  and first of all his majestys interest must be got as for myself i am grown into years and full of business here at the mines the river at london and other places  my weeklie charge being above l 00 which makes me very unwillinge to undertake any other work and the least of these whether the drowned lands or mines requires a whole man with a large purse  noble sir my desire is great to see you which should draw me a far longer way yet such are my occasions at this time here for the settlinge of this great work that i can hardly be spared one hour in a day my wieff being also here i cannot leave her in a strange place yet my love to public works and desire to see you

resembling a weak blue slame arose during a fortnight or three weeks out of a sandy marshy tract called morva bychan cambden ii     ph trans no  0  lowthorps abridg ii      and crossed over a channel of eight miles to harlech it set fire on that side to sixteen ricks of hay and two barns one filled with hay the other with corn it infected the grass in such a manner that numbers of cattle horses sheep and goats died one character of a mephites was wanting for men went into the midst of it with impunity it was easily dispelled any great noise such as the sounding of horns the discharging of guns or the like at once repelled it it moved only by night and appeared at times but less frequently the following summer after which this phenomenon ceased it may possibly arise as the editor of cambden conjectures from a local casualty such as the fall of a flight of locusts in that spot as really did in the sea near aberdaron which growing corrupt might by the blowing of the wind for a certain period from one point direct the pest to a certain spot while others less remote might for the same reason escape the dreadful effects mouffet gives an account of a plague in lombardy about

deep ditches on each side of the entrance is a great round tower the court is of an irregular form and has the remains of a square tower beyond is another court and in it on the verge of the rock are two others also square it is probable that all the towers were originally square for the insides of the two round towers are of that form they have so much the appearance of the architecture of dolwyddelan castle that i entertain no doubt but that this castle was founded by a welsh prince and that its supposed founder edward i did no more than case the towers which at present are the two rounders after the conquest edward appointed william de leybourn to be constable with a salary of a hundred pounds a year for which he was to maintain a garrison of thirty stout men ten of whom were to be crossbow men one chaplain one surgeon one carpenter and one mason sebright mss   our boasted countryman sir howel y fwyall sir howel y fwyall was constable of this castle a hero descended from

artois froissart tom i chapter clxiiii p     engl froissart i  perhaps we must wave that particular glory but he undoubtedly behaved on the occasion with distinguished valor for the black prince not only bestowed on him the constableship of this castle which he afterward made his residence but knighted him and in perpetual memorial of his good services ordered that from thenceforth a mess of meat should be served up before the poleax with which he performed such great feats for what reason he bore it in his coat of arms and was slyled sir howel y fwyall or of the ax after the mess had appeared before the knight it was carried down and bestowed on the poor eight yeomen attendants were constituted to guard the mess and had eight pence a day constant wages at the kings charge and these under the name of yeomen of the crown were continued on the establishment till the reign of queen elizabeth some do not scruple to say that the yeomen of the crown were grafted upon this stock after the

the gimlet a mile from land to which it is joined by a range of sandhills this place was made a free borough by the black prince by charter dated in the   th year of his principality at caernarvon in compliment to nigel de loryng or lohareyn one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber on whom he had bestowed pwllheli and nevyn in consideration of his great service in gascony and particularly at the battle of poitiers he entitles him to servitiis quorumcunque tenentium tam liberorum quam nativorum by which it may be presumed that he did not include the welsh in the privileges what those were i do not learn but they were the same which the burgesses of rosfair in anglesey enjoyed and for them pwllheli was to pay to nigel fourteen pounds a year and nevyn thirtytwo this borough and nevyn he freely bestowed on him with all its appurtenances together with four librates of land toward the repair of his manors and for all these he was only to pay an acknowlegement of a rose in lieu of all services if he died without issue the whole was to revert to the crown edward iii afterward confirmed these grants at sandwich  from hence i took a ride about five miles inland to carn madryn carn madryn a lofty rocky insulated hill noted for having been a strong hold of the sons of owen gwynedd roderick and malgwn to whom this part of the country belonged the bottom sides and top are filled with cells oblong oval or circular once thatched or covered from the inclemency of the weather many of them are pretty entire the chieftains resided on the top the country with the cattle in times of invasion occupied the sides and bottom the whole summit was surrounded with a wall still visible in many places from the summit is an extensive view of the country with the bay of caerncr on one side and that of cardigan on the other sarn badrig tour in wales ii     is seen extending from meireonyddshire its dangerous length nearly parallel to the shore of lhein south wales may be seen plainly and in clear weather ireland and in front the whole tract of snowdonia exhibits a most magnificent and stupendous barrier  at the foot of this hill is madryn formerly the seat of the bodvels descended from collwyn ap tangno but on the death of the last male heir the estate was purchased by  parry esquire of wern vawr from pwllheli i continued my journey near the shore to llan badrog along the sides of that noble bay the tudwals road sheltered by two islands of that name so named from st tudwal sacred to whom was a small chapel on the greater its present inhabitants are sheep rabbits and in the season puffins  in the promontory penrhyn du penrhyn du one of the points of this bay have been considerable adventures for lead ore and of late years attempts to drain the mines by means of a fire engine but the expenses proved superior to the profits a little beyond this is another bay called hells mouth dreaded by mariners being the scylla to the charybdis of sarn badrig whose extremity lies nearly opposite  in a small time i reached aberaron aberdaron a poor village at the very end of caernarvonshire seated on a sandy bay beneath some high and sandy cliffs the mouth of the bay is guarded by two little islands called ynys gwylan a security to the small craft of the inhabitants who are all fishermen it takes its name from the small rivulet the daron which empties itself here  in the church are two ailes supported by four very handsome pillars this being the place where devotees usually took boat for bardseye island was greatly resorted to it was dedicated to st hywyn a saint of that island was a sanctuary powel      and also much frequented by pilgrims leland says it was called llan engas brenin fanum niniani reguli itin v    ninian died in      ninian is a saint son of a cumbrian prince and whom legend might have sent here to found the church  from this port i once took boat for bardseye island baradseye island which lies about three leagues to the west the mariners seemed tinctured with the piety of the place for they had not rowed far but they made a full stop pulled off their hats and offered up a short prayer after doubling a headland the island appears full in view we passed under the lofty mountain which forms one side after doubling the farther end we put into a little sandy creek bounded by low rocks as is the whole level part on landing i found all this tract a very fertile plain and well cultivated and productive of every thing which the main land affords the abbots house is a large stone building inhabited by several of the natives not far from it is a singular chapel or oratory being a long arched edifice with an insulated stone altar near the east end in this place one of the inhabitants reads prayers all other offices are performed at aberdaron  the island is about two miles in circumference contains a few inhabitants and is rented from lord newborough it was granted by edward vi to his uncle sir thomas seymour and after his death to john earl of warwick tanner  0   the late sir john wynn purchased it from the late reverend dr wilson of newark  the island whose spiritual concerns are at present under the care of a single rustic once afforded during life an asylum to  0000 saints and after death graves to as many of their bodies well therefore might it be called insula sanctorum the isie of saints but with dr fuller i must observe that it would be more facile to find graves in bardseye for so many saints than saints for so many graves worthies of wales     but to approach the truth s dubritius let it be said that dubritius archbishop of caerleon almost worn out with age resigning his see to st david retired here and according to the best account died in     was interred on the spot but in after times his body was removed to llandaff the slaughter of the monks of bangor about the year  0  is supposed to have contributed to the population of this island for not only the brethren who escaped but numbers of other pious britons fled hither to avoid the rage of the saxons  the time in which the religious house was founded convent is very uncertain it probably was before the retreat of dubritius for something of that kind must have occasioned him to give the preference to this place it seems likely to have been a seat of the culdees or colidei the first religious recluses of great britain who sought islands and desert places in which they might in security worship the true god it was certainly resorted to in very early times for our accounts say that it flourished as a convent in the days of cadwan king of britain rowlands      coeval with dubritius it was an abbey dedicated to st mary i find among the sebright mss mention of a petition from the abbot to edward ii in which he sets forth the injuries he had received from the sheriff of caernarvon who had extorted from him   s and  d contrary to his deed of feoffment on which the king directed roger de mortimer justiciary of wales to make enquiry into the matter who reported that the abbot held his lands in the county of caernarvon in puram et perpetuam elemosynam without any service or secular acknowlegement and further that david lord of lhein and brother to the last prince of wales had exacted the same sum as did his pencynydd or master of his dogs possibly under pretense of maintaining them the king therefore by his special favor and by advice of his council does for ever remit the said sum and all arrears and directs that no one in future either on his account or that of his heirs ever should molest the convent  the house underwent the common fate of others at the dissolution its revenues were as dugdale says    l   s   d according to speed    l   s   d in the year      only   l   s   d remained in charge to the surviving religious of this place  the british name of the island is ynys enlli or the island in the current from the fierce current which rages particularly between it and the main land the saxons named it bardseye probably from the bards who retire here preferring solitude to the company of invading foreigners  there are great plenty of fish round the island and abundance of lobsters the spiny lobster br zool iv no    is more frequent here than in most other places  we reembarked from the rocks on the opposite side of the island to that on which we landed rowed through the rapid current called the race of bardsey between the island and the great promontory braech y pwll the canganum promontorium of ptolemy part of it is called from certain yellow stones maem melyn the rest is a vast precipice black and tremendous after landing at aberdaron i rid to its summit and found the ruins of a small church capel vair called capel vair the chapel of our lady and i was informed that at the foot of the promontory below high water mark was a fountain of fresh water to which devotees were wont to descend by a circuitous and most hazardous path to get at low water a mouthful of the spring which if they carried up safe to the summit their wish whatsoever it was was to be surely fulfilled this was under the protection of our lady and called ffynnon vain the chapel was placed here to give the seamen opportunity of invoking the tutelar saint for protection through this dangerous sound and i dare say in old times the walls were covered with votive tables not far from hence i pasfed by the ruins of capel anhelog or the chapel without endowment  after going through a fertile bottom ascended a lofty mountain impending over the sea called uwch mynydd on which were several circular hollows edged with stone the temporary view of bardsey island habitations of perhaps some invader descend and pass by a large and ancient house called bethelem  not far from thence about a quarter of a mile from the shore rises a high rock called maen y mellt or the stone of lightning maen y mellt ride by cefnamwlch the seat of john griffith esquire and soon after to brynodol that of hugh griffith esquire where i met with a most hospitable reception for two nights from hence i visited the neighboring shore which is here low and rocky opening into frequent little creeks useful to the fishermen who find in them during the herringfishery a safe retreat from storms among these are porth towyn porth colman porth gwylan and porth ysgadan near the last about thirty years ago a rock which towered a great height out of the sea was suddenly missed after a horrible night of thunder and lightning supposed to have been struck down by the resistless bolt i observed that the fields about porth gwylan were covered with y ddafad or samphire which sheep and cattle eagerly feed on and grow very fat i was pleased here with the fine blossom of thrift glowing over numbers of the pastures  llyn or lleyn is a very extensive hundred in general flat llyn produce of but interspersed with most characteristic hills or rocks rising insulated in several parts none makes so conspicuous a figure as carn madryn and carn boduon the houses of the common people are very mean made with clay thatched and destitute of chimnies notwithstanding the laudable example of the gentry the country is in an unimproved state neglected for the sake of the herringfishery the chief produce is oats and black cattle i was informed that above three thousand are annually sold out of these parts much oats barley butter and cheese are exported the land is excellent for grazing being watered by a thousand little rills it is destitute of trees except about the houses of the gentry  the herrings about the year      herrings were taken here in vast abundance from porth ysgadan or the port of herrings to bardseye island the capture amounted usually to the value of about four thousand pounds they were sometimes salted on shore at other times bought from the fishers by the irish wherries at sea and carried to be cured in dublin these desultory fish about the period mentioned appear in july and went away in october in earlier times they came in september and went away in november dories are often taken here the fishermen were wont to fling them away on account of their ugly appearance nor was this luxury known to the gentry till one of their servants who was acquainted with the fish informed them of its being an inhabitant of thief seas the atherine br zool iii no     is taken near pwllbeli and a small lobster is often found burrowing in the sand but differs from the common kind only in its place of residence and in size the traps for lobsters are made with packthread like thiefnets and baited with pieces of the lesser spotted shark br zool iii no    the fishers remark that the sexes of these voracious fish confort at certain times apart for at certain periods they take only males at others only females  the churches in this country are of very ancient foundation some cause or other prevented me from seeing several old inscriptions a few of which i have since picked up in the church of llangynodol is said to be this hic jacet gwen hoedl a holy lady who lived in very early times dervori hic jacet is another inscription on a stone now placed over a door of penprys stable in llannor parish sebright mss  and at capel yverach in aberdaron parish is another which i think better expressed by an engraving the same  they are cut on very rude stones and were certainly the work of the early times of christianity  brynodol by advantage of situation on the side of a hill commands a vast view of a flat woodless tract the sea and a noble mass of mountains the eist hills boduon and the vast carn madryn rise in the fore ground and beyond these soars all snowdonia from those alps which surround the wyddfa to the most remote in the county of meireonydd  on quitting brynodol i descended into an extensive flat porth in llyn reached porth in lln a fine safe and sandy bay guarded on the west by a narrow headland jutting far into the sea on part of it are the remains of very strong entrenchments probably an outpost of the romans who as i shall have occasion to mention had another between this place and caernarvon  separated from this bay by a small headland is that of nefyn and near it a small town of the same name nefyn a contributory borough to caernarvon this place had been bestowed on nigel de lohareyn by the black prince in the   th year of his principality and made a free borough was allowed a guild mercatory with every privilege attendant on other free boroughs and all the liberties and customs granted heretofore to that of newborough in anglesey he also gave it a grant of two fairs annually and a market on a sunday to which the inhabitants of that part of the commot y lln then called dynthlayn were obliged to resort  here edward i in      held his triumph on the conquest of wales and perhaps to conciliate the affections of his new subjects in imitation of our hero arthur held a round table and celebrated it with dance and tournament ad rotundam tabulam juxta snowdon praeonizatam in choreis et hastiludiis ad invicem colludentibus annal waverleins in gale ii       where throngs of knights and barons bold in weeds of peace high triumphs hold with store of ladies whose bright eyes rain influence and judge the prize of wit or arms while both contend to win her grace whom all commend tournament the concourse was prodigious for not only the chief nobility of england but numbers from foreign parts graced the festival with their presence  the custom is very ancient for it may be derived even higher than the days of arthur we may allow that he held his round table on account of one of his victories and that he had fourandtwenty knights who sat at the festive board which might have been designedly made of a circular form in order to destroy all dispute about preeminence of seat but the gauls also sat at their round tables and every knight had at his back a squire with his armor in waiting athenaeus lib

ladies danced in silken mantles dugdales warwickshire i       vortigerns valley the first i apprehend to have been performed in those circular areae which we still meet with in some parts of england

of arthurs round table tour in scotland       d ed  others which are far larger i found on thornborough heath in yorkshire of which i may in future time give some account  ascend from nefyn for a considerable way up the side of the high hill and after a short ride on level ground quit our horses in order to visit nant y gwrtheyrn or vortigens valley vortigerns valley the immense hollow to which vortigern is said to have fled from the rage of his subjects and where it was said that he and his castle were consumed with lightning nennius hist br c xlviii places the scene near the teivi in

inspire one with full hopes of security from any pursuit embosomed in a lofty mountain on two sides bounded by stony steeps on which no vegetables appear but the blasted heath and stunted gorse the third side exhibits a most tremendous front of black precipice with the loftiest peak of the mountain eifl soaring above and the only opening to this secluded spot is toward the sea a northern aspect where that chilling wind exerts all its fury and half freezes during winter the few inhabitants the glen is tenanted by three families who raise oats and keep a few cattle sheep and goats but seem to

eight prominent ribs from top to bottom on this might have been the residence of the unfortunate prince of which time has destroyed every other vestige till the beginning of the last century a tumulus of stone within and externally covered with turf was to be seen here it was known by the name of bed gwrtheyrn tradition having regularly delivered down the report of this having been the place of his interment the inhabitants of the parish perhaps instigated by their then minister mr hugh roberts a person of curiosity dug into the carn and found in it a stone coffin containing the bones of a tall man kennes paroch antiq hist allchester      this gives a degree of credibility to the tradition especially as no other bones were found with it no other tumuli on the spot a proof at lest of respect to the rank of the person and that the place was deserted after the death of the royal fugitive about the year        after emerging out of this chearless bottom i found fresh and amazing matter of speculation i got into a bwlch or hollow between two summits of the eifl mountains the eifl hills a range that makes a most distinguished figure with the sugar loaf points from various and distant parts of the country they range obliquely and separate lleyn from the hundred of arfon and jut into the sea near vortigerns valley  across this hollow from one summit of the eifl to the other extends an immense rampart of stones or perhaps the ruins of a wall which effectually blocked up the pass on the eifl is the most perfect and magnificent as well as the most artful of any british post i ever beheld it is called trer caeri trer caeri or the town of the fortresses this which was the accessible side is defended by three walls the lowest is very imperfect the next tolerably entire and has in it the grand entrance this wall in one part points upwards toward the third wall which runs round the edges of the top of the hill the second wall unites with the first which runs into a point reverts and joins the highest in a place where the hill becomes inaccessible the facings on the two upper walls are very entire especially that of the uppermost they are lofty and exhibit from below a grand and extensive front the space on the top is an irregular area part is steep part flat in most parts covered with heath giving shelter to a few red grouse the whole is almost filled with cells to be seen with advantage the station should be taken from the summit about which the cells are very distinct and disposed with much art about the middle is a square place fenced with stones a sort of praetorium surrounded with two rows of cells numbers are also scattered about the plain and others again are contiguous to the wall all along the inside  the cells are mostly perfect of various forms round oval oblong square some of the round were fifteen feet in diameter of the oblong thirty feet in length with long entrances regularly faced with stone all of them when inhabited were well protected from the weather by roofs of thatch or sod  the upper wall was in many places fifteen feet high on the outside and often sixteen feet broad it consisted of two parallel and contiguous parts one higher than the other serving as a parapet to the lower which seemed to have had its walk like that on the walls of chester there was in one place a cell in the thickness of the wall or perhaps a sallyport in part stopped by the fallingin of the stones  i was determined to trace every species of fortress of this nature which lay in the neighborhood on descending from trer caeri to the south gary guwch i very soon ascended moel garn guwh a hill of conic form on the summit of which is a prodigious heap of stones seemingly a shapeless ruin if it was not for the appearance of certain facings of a central cell still remaining to prove that it had been a large tower and an outpost to the preceding place these ruins are called by the country people agd y gs or the apronfull of stones flung down by he gs  i must remark that from the eift saw sveral other lesser eminences fortified in a manner nearly similar i may mention carn madryn before described the hill of boduan above  covered with similar cells meel ben twrch between  and castle gwgan remarkable for a clynnog small circular intrenchment and to these i may add another fortified hill called pen y gaer on the other side of the pass which leads from arfon to lln all which makes it probable that this country was the retreat of multitudes of britons to escape the first fury of the saxon invaders  after viewing the arffedogedygowres i descended to the village and church of llanaelhaiearn llanaelhalearn the last dedicated to st aelhaiearn or the saint with an iron eyebrow from a legend too absurd to relate near it is a fine well once much frequented for its reputed sanctity continue descending on the right are the high conic hills of gern goch and gern ddu the extremity of the long chain which extends obliquely from snowdon beginning at talmignedd reach  clynnog clynnog seated in a small grove near the shore on a plain near the foot of the hills church the church is the most magnificent structure of its kind in north wales built in form of a cross the length from east to west is about a hundred and thirtyeight feet from north to south seventy near the altar are three neat stalls divided by pillars supporting gothic arches the seats of the officiating priests the monuments are few one to william glynn de lleiar with his figure and those of his wife and seven children another to his soninlaw george twisleton esquire of aula barrow in yorkshire and in right of his wife of lleiar i imagine him to be the same with colonel twisleton an active officer under cromwell and the same who had the honor of beating and making prisoner the gallant sir john owen whitelocks memorials     and           adjoining to the church is the chapel of st beuno the passage to it is a narrow vault covered with great flat stones and of far greater antiquity than either church or chapel which seem nearly coeval leland speaks of the first as new work and the architecture verifies his account he speaks also of the old church where st beuno lies being near the new itin v     the passage is the only part left the chapel was probably built after that traveller had visited the place in the room of the old church which might have fallen to ruin in the midst is the tomb of the saint plain and altarshaped tomb of st beuno votaries were wont to have great faith in him and did not doubt but that by means of a nights lodging on his tomb a cure would be found for all diseases it was customary to cover it with rushes and leave on it till morning sick children after making them first undergo ablution in the neighboring holy well and i myself once saw on it a feather bed on which a poor paralytic from meirionyddshire had lain the whole night after undergoing the same ceremony  i have given some account of st beuno in the preceding volume p     st beuno account of after he had assumed the monastic habit he here founded a convent in     cadvan king of north wales was his great patron and promised him much land his son cadwallan performed the promise and received from the saint a golden scepter worth sixty cows the land was clamed in behalf of a little infant and his title proved good the king refuses either to give other land in lieu or to resign the present beuno cursed him and went away but was appeased by gwrddeint first cousin to the king who overtook him and gave the town of celynnog for ever to god and st beuno for his own souls sake and that of the wicked cadwallan long after his time the carmelites or white monks had here an establishment they were suppressed but i

curious in druidical antiquities a cromleh may see a very uncommon cromleh on the tenement of bachwen about half a mile from this place the inclination of the upper stone is to the west on its surface are numbers of small shallow holes with two or three larger than the rest possibly for some purpose of augury at thirty paces distance is an upright stone placed as is supposed to mark the limits of approach to the people while the rites were performing by the druidpriest  the distance from clynnog to caernarvon is ten miles a continued plain the mountains recede gradually from the sea so as to leave a considerable extent of level ground as we approach the capital of the county the road is excellent and the greatest part has the merit of being made at the expense of the parishes the shore is low gravelly or sandy and forms one side of the bay of caernarvon  cross the llyfni a rapid stream flowing out of llyn nanlle i heard here of a strong camp called carreg y dinas of which i find this note in the ms travels of the late ingenious dr mason of cambridge he mentions it as being placed upon the isthmus of the llyfni opposite to the house of lleiar the three sides to the river are very steep the fourth is defended by two fosses and two banks made chiefly of stone especially the inner one which is six yards high in the middle is a mount possibly the ruins of a tower the entrance is at the east end between the ends of the banks  about three miles dinas dinlle turn to the left to visit dinas dinlle a vast mount of gravel and sand on the verge of a great marsh upon the shore on the top is a large area surrounded by an amazing agger seemingly formed by the earth scooped out of the summit within are remains of foundations of buildings of an oblong form constructed with earth and round stones and in one part is a tumulus of the same materials on the outside of the agger on one part is a very deep ditch with another high rampart and the ground toward the base seems every where to have been smoothed by art there is a regular entrance at one end on the other the ground slopes to the sea and is quite open a defense being there needless the waves have made great depredations and worn one side into a cliff i must attribute this fortress to the romans and am the more confirmed in my notion as i am informed that coins have been found here among which was one of alectus the romans might possibly be induced to form this post to secure a landingplace for any necessaries the country might want for the entrance into the port segontium s often even at present very difficult

buildings regularity of the plan and above all the grandeur of the castle the most magnificent badge of our subjecton the place sprung from the ruin of the ancient segontium but it does not owe its name to edward i as is generally supposed giraldus cambrensis mentions it in his journey of the year      iter cambr      and llewelyn the great dates from it a charter in the year      this charter is to the canons of penmon sebright mss  i greatly suspect the caernarvon of those times to have been no other than the ancient segontium whose name the welsh had changed to the apt one of caer ar fon or the strong hold opposite to anglesey but the present town was in all probability a creation of our conqueror a judicious warrior such as edward could not fail profiting of so fit a situation for a curb on the newconquered country it had natural requisites for strength being bounded on one side by the arm of the sea called the menai by the estuary of the seiont on another exactly where it receives the tide from the former on a third side and part of the fourth by a creek of the menai and the remainder has the appearance of having the insulation completed by art edward undertook this great work immediately after his conquest of the country in      and completed the fortifications and castle before      for his queen on april   th in that year brought forth within its walls edward first prince of wales of the english line it was built within the space of one year by the labor of the peasants and at the cost of the chieftains of the country on whom the conqueror imposed the hateful task sebright mss  henry ellerton or de elreton was appointed master mason of the castle sebright and gloddaeth mss  and perhaps was the architect and under him must have been numbers of other skilful workmen for i dare say that the welsh peasants were no mare than cutters of wood and hewers of stone it is probable that many of the materials were brought from segontium or the old caernarvon and tradition says that much ot the limestone with which it is built was brought from twrkelyn in anglesey and of the gritstone from vaenol in this county the menai greatly facilitated the carriage from both places  the external state of the walls and castle are at present exactly as they were in the time of edward the walls are defended by numbers of round towers and have two principal gates the east facing the mountains the west upon the menai the entrance into the castle is very august beneath a great tower on the front of which appears the statue of the founder with a dagger in his hand as if menacing his newacquired unwilling subjects the gate had four portcullises and every requisite of strength the court is oblong the towers are very beautiful none of them round but pentagonal hexagonal or octagonal two are more lofty than the rest the eagle tower is remarkably fine and has the addition of three slender angular turrets issuing from the top edward ii was born in a little dark room in this tower not  caernaryon castle   twelve feet long nor eight in breadth so little did in those days a royal consort consult either pomp or convenience queens gate the gate

convenient gallery with narrow slips for the discharge of arrows the walls of the eagle tower are near two feet thicker the view from its summit is very fine of the menai anglesey and the nearer parts of the british alps  the first whom i find appointed by edward to be governor of the castle was john de havering with a salary of two hundred marks for which he was obliged to maintain constantly besides his own family fourscore men of which fifteen were to be crossbowmen one chaplain one surgeon and one smith the rest were to do the duty of keepers of the gates sentinels and other necessary offices sebright mss   in      i find that the king had appointed adam de wetenhall to the same important office ayloffs rotulae wailiae      the establishment for town and castle was as follows  the

seventyfour yards long the other which points to the river is sixtyfour the height ten feet eight inches the thickness six feet much of the facing is taken away which discovers the peculiarity of the roman masonry it consists of regular courses the others have the stones disposed in zigzag fashion along the walls are three parallel lines of round holes not three inches in diameter nicely plastered within which pass through the whole thickness there are other similar holes which are discovered in the end of the wall and seem to run through it lengthways i can discover the use of neither one or other those that run through the walls are supposed to be for the purpose of annoying an enemy with arrows but from the smallness of the diameter a compass of aim in directing the shot is wanting near the corner of one of the walls is a heap of stones the ruins of a tower for on digging some years ago the foundation of a found one was discovered it was paved and in it were found the horn of a deer and skeletons of some lesser animals this place seems intended to secure a landingplace from the seiont at time of high water and i was informed that in trer beblic on the opposite shore had been other ruins the work of the same people  at a small distance above this segontium and about a quarter of a mile from the menai is the ancient segontium to the use of which the fort had been subservient it forms an oblong of a very considerable extent seemingly about six acres placed on the summit of rising ground and sloping down on every side it is now divided by the public road but in several parts are vestiges of walls and in one place appears the remnant of a building made with tiles and plastered with very hard and smooth mortar this seems to have been part of a hypocaust the mortar in all other parts is very hard and mixed with much gravel and sand at present a public road passes through the midst of this ancient station beyond which the romans had only a small outpost or two in this county a gold coin of about seventeen shillings weight was found here inscribed t divi avg fill avgvtvs  cambden suspects that this might have been the setantiorum portus of ptolemy being willing to read it segontiorum ii      but the situation of the former is certainly at the mouth of the ribble he may be right in supposing it to have been in after times named caer custenin or the castle of constantine nennius  and that hugh lupus who certainly invaded anglesey in  0   had here a temporary post how far the relation of matthew of westminster that censtantius father of constantine was interred here may be depended on i will not say nor whether as the historian farther asserts that edward caused the body to be taken up and honorably reburied in the church i suppose of st publicius mat westminster      mr rowlands says that helen the mother of publicius had a chapel here which he tells us was in being in his days mona antiq     helen was born at segontium  a well

from caernarvon to snowdon from this town may have a very agreeable ride after crossing the fai or gwyrfai this river issues out of llyn cwellyn and separates the two hundreds of uwchgwrfai and

consists of verdant meadows watered by the same river and bounded by hills rising fast into alpine majesty he will go under moel elian a noble mountain of a stupendous bulk clothed with a smooth green turf and most regularly rounded he will pass on the right near castle cedwm said by mr rowlands to be one of the guards to the entrance into snowdon it is a great rock which i did not ascend so cannot certify whether it had any works like those of other british posts the lake cwellyn here almost fills the valley a water famous for its char which are taken in nets in the first winter months and after that season retire to the inaccessible depths in former times this water was called from the steepness of its banks llyn y torlennydd above on the right side of the lake soars the magnificent

this strait they were originally the property of the crown of england till henry viii granted all of them to richard gifford one of the sewers of his chamber who again set them to william bulkely in the   d year of his royal master but since that period every one has been transferred to other hands  i soon reached newborough newborough about three miles from the shore a place greatly fallen away from its ancient splendour here had been one of the residences of his princes in mr rowlands time the foundation of the lls or palace was to be seen a little to the south of the church which is supposed to have been the domestic chapel in its neighborhood at vrondeg is a stone which i overlooked i find it mentioned in the manuscripts of mr rowlands who has given the following inscription cur filius cuuricini erexit hunc lapidem the author of the history of anglesey p    printed for dodsley        to also mentions it but varies in the name of the founder and his father his reading is thus filius ulrici erexit hunc lapidem i am credibly informed that the inscription is at present illegible but the style of the memorial induces me to give it to a dane such are extremely frequent in

monument to his father but from the imperfect state of the inscription we are at a loss to know whether it was sepulchral or votive  newborough or more properly rhosvair the british name was a manor of our princes it was divided into two parts the one consisted of officers of the household under the prince which were of two kinds and had twelve gavels in land between them part maintained the maerdrefyrs or persons who overlooked his demesne the other was for the garddwyr certain persons resembling our cottagers who possessed small parcels of land called gardds record of caernarvon in biblioth litteraria     there were besides eight gavels which were the property of freeholders the posterity of whom enjoyed the same to the very time of my author mr rowlands this was also the feat of justice for the whole commot of menai and continued so long after it became subject to the english a respect to a royal seat was still maintained by the new royal possessors it became a manor of the princes of wales edward i erected the town into a corporation and gave it a gild mercatory and other privileges which were confirmed by parliament in the first year of edward iii mr rowlands mss  from this time it was called newborough in the latter part of that reign were found ninetythree houses thirteen gardens one orchard twelve crots and sixty small pieces of ground enclosed for the use of the houses the crown had its steward for this district with a salary of ten pounds a year the palace and royal chapel existed in the time of edward iii for it appears by an inquisition taken here in      before william de shaldeford representative of richard earl of arundel justiciary of north wales that the tenants of the commot of menai had been required to put those buildings into repair but on their representing that if that duty was put in force they would be of little or no advantage to the king the justiciary was directed to enquire into the truth and whether it would not be better for him to take an annual sum in lieu of the repairs not only of the palace and chapel but of all the other buildings on the royal manor sebright mss in after times it had the honor of sending representatives to the british parliament richard ap rhydderch ap myfyrian sat in the third of henry viii and john ap robert llwyd in the first of edward vi who in the next year transferred this honor

as they were then called weles rowlands mss  yet in the reign of henry viii it was one of the richest prebends in the cathedral of bangor its wealth arose not from the real fertility of the place but from the superstition of the common people from pilgrimages to crosses relics holy wells ordeals and what mr rowlands calls  or divination from fishes the same in the time of owen glyndwr one yerwerth

bird twice or thrice before they settle their first employ is the forming of burrows which falls to the share of the males who are so intent on the business as to suffer themselves at that time to be taken by the hand some few save themselves the trouble of forming holes and will dispossess the rabbits who during the puffin season retire to the other side of the island  they lay one white egg males as well as females perform the office of sitting relieving each other when they go to feed the young are hatched in the beginning of july the parents have the strongest affection for them and if laid hold of by the wings will give themselves most cruel bites on any part of the body they can reach as if actuated by despair and when released instead of flying away will often hurry again into the burrow to their young the noise they make when caught is horrible and not unlike the efforts of a dumb person to speak this affection ceases at the time of remigration which is most exactly about the eleventh of august they then go off to a single bird and leave behind the unfledged young of the later hatches a prey to the peregrine falcon which watches the mouth of the holes for their appearance compelled as they must soon be by hunger to come out  the food of these birds is sprats food or seaweeds which makes puffin auk them excessively rank yet the young are pickled and preserved by spices and by some people much admired  it appears certain that the puffins do not breed till their third year their bills change in the proof arises from the observations made by the reverend mr davies on the different forms of the bills among the thousands of this species which he saw wrecked as i have mentioned in page     he remarked them in their several periods of life those which he supposes to have been of the first year were small weak destitute of any furrow and of a dusky color those of the second year were considerably larger and stronger lighter colored and with a faint vestige of the furrow at the base those of more advanced years were of the vivid colors and great strength among the myriads which annually resort to priestholm not an individual has ever been observed which had not its bill of an uniform growth perhaps the same remark may hold good in respect to the razorbill br zool i no   0 mr davies having found multitudes with bills far inferior in

rounded mounts on each side of a deep gully leading toward llanddona church these seemed to have been the work of the danes cast up to protect their vessels in their plundering excursions a calamity

habitations of the possessors it had been a place of vast strength for besides the artificial defense the hill slopes steeply on all sides and the brink next to the ramparts are mostly precipitous it

called bryncelliddu near the feat of sir nicholas bayley a passage three feet wide four feet two or three inches high and about nineteen feet and a half long which led into a room about three feet in

stone bench on which were found human bones which fell to dust almost at a touch it is probable that the bodies were originally placed on the bench there are proofs that it was customary with the gauls to place their dead in that form in cells but they added to the head of each body a stone weapon which served as a pillow la religion de gaulois ii     plate     but nothing of the king was

of mrs lewis and soon after within sight of the church of llanelian llanelian seated on the rocks not far from the sea it is handsomely built and makes a considerable figure among the churches of this part of wales it is dedicated to st elian surnamed gannaid or the bright he was formerly a most popular saint and had a great concourse of devotees who implored his assistance to relieve them from variety of disorders to gain his favor they made considerable offerings which were deposited in the church in cyff aelian or st aelians chest these amounted to so large a sum that the parishioners purchased with it three tenements for the use of the church which belong to the living to this day  near this place caswallon lawhir or caswallon longimanus kept his llys or court he had made a grant of lands and several privileges to this church among which was that of a nawddfa or sanctuary this was one of the seven churchpatron saints in anglesey which were entitled in capite to several tenures

st machutus or mechel and st cyngar   from hence i visited trysclwyn mountain on part of which paris mountain called paris mountain probably from a robert paris who was chamberlain of north wales there was another of the same name in the reign of edward iii in the reign of henry iv is the most considerable body of copper ore perhaps ever known the external aspect of the hill is extremely rude and rises into enormous rocks of coarse white quartz the ore is lodged in a basin or hollow and has on one side a small lake on whose waters distasteful as those of avernus no bird is known to alight the whole aspect of this tract has by the mineral operations assumed a most savage appearance suffocating fumes of the burning heaps of copper arise in all parts and extend their baneful influence for miles around in the adjacent parts vegetation is nearly destroyed even the mosses and lichens of the rocks have perished and nothing seems capable of resisting the fumes but the purple melic grass melica caerulea lightfoot fl scot i    aira caerulea hudson fl angl i     which flourishes in abundance  i have little doubt but that the ore had been worked in a very distant period vestiges of the ancient operations appear in several parts carried on by trenching and by heating the rocks intensely then suddenly pouring on water so as to cause them to crack or scale thus aukwardly supplying the use of gunpowder see tour in wales i    pieces of charcoal were also found which prove that wood was made use of for that purpose as the britons improted all works in brass it is certain that the romans were the undertakers of these mines and it is very probable that they sent the ore to caerben to be smelted the place where the famous cake of copper was discovered tour in wales p    tab ix  they might likewise have had a smeltinghearth in this island for a round cake of copper was discovered at llanvaethlle a few miles from this place its weight was fifty pounds and it had on it a mark resembling an l  in the year      one alexander frazier came into anglesey in search of mines he visited paris mountain called on sir nicholas bayley and gave him so flattering an account of the prospect as induced him to make a trial and sink shafts ore was discovered but before any quantity could be gotten the mines were overpowered with water in about two years after messrs roe and co of macclesfield applied to sir nicholas for a lease of penrhyn ddu mine in caernarvonshire with which they were much against their wills compelled to take a lease of part of this mountain and to carry on a level and make a fair trial the trial was accordingly made ore was discovered but the expenses overbalanced the profits they continued working to great loss and at length determined to give the affair up they gave their agent orders for that purpose but he as a final attempt divided his men into ten several companies of three or four in a partnership and let them sink shafts in various places about eight hundred yeards eastward of a place called the golden venture on a presumption that a spring which issued from near the place must come from a body of mineral his conjecture was right for in less than two days they met with at the depth of seven feet from the surface the solid mineral which proved to be that vast body which has since been worked to such advantage the day that this discovery was made was march  d      which has ever since been observed as a festival by the miners soon after this discovery another adventure was begun by the reverend mr edward hughes owner of part of the mountain in right of his wife mary lewis of llys dulas so that the whole of the treasure is the property of sir nicholas bayley and himself  the body of copper ore is of unknown extent the ore the thickness has been ascertained in some places by the driving of a level under it several years ago and it was found to be in some places twentyfour yards the ore is mostly of the kind called by cronsted pyrites cupri flavo viridescens and contains vast quantities of sulphur it varies in degrees of goodness some of it is rich but the greater part poor in quality  there are other species of copper ore found here of late a vein of the pyrites cupri griseus of cronsted about seven yards wide has been discovered near the west end of the mountain some is of an iron gray some quite black the first contains sixteen lb of copper per clb the last forty an ore has been lately found in form of loose earth of dark purplish color and the best of it has produced better thatn eight in twenty some years ago above thirty pounds of native copper was found in driving a level through a turbery some was in form of moss some in very thin leaves  it is quarried out of the bed in vast masses is broken into small pieces and the most pure part is sold raw at the rate of about   l to   l per ton or sent to the smeltinghouses of the respective companies to be melted into metal mr hughes has great furnaces of his own at ravenhead near leverpool and at swansey in south wales an idea of the wealth of these mines may be formed by considering that the macclesfield company have had at once fourteen thousand tons of ore upon bank and mr hughess thirty thousand  the more impure ore is also broken to the size of about hens eggs but in order to clear it from the quantity of sulphur with which it abounds as well as other advantitious matter it must undergo the operation of burning for that purpose it is placed between two parallel walls of vast length some kilns are twenty others forty and fifty yards in length some ten others twenty feet wide and above four feet in height the space between is not only filled but the ore is piled many feet higher in a unequal form from end to end the whole is then covered with flat stones closely luted with clay and above is placed a general integument of clay and small rubbish of the work in order to prevent any of the fumes from evaporating of late some kilns have been constructed with brick arches over the ore which is found to be the best method of burning within these few years attempts are made to preserve the sulphur from flying away and that is done by flues made of brick whose tops are in form of a gothic arch many scores of feet in length one end of these opens into the beds of copper which are to be burnt those beds are set on fire by a very small quantity of coal for all the rest is effected by its own phlogiston the volatile part is confined and diredted to the flues in its course the sulphurous particles strike against their roofs and fall to the bottom in form of the finest brimstone brimstone which is collected and carried to adjacent houses where it is melted into what is called in the shops stone brimstone  the beds of copper thus piled for burning are of vast extent some contain four hundred tons of ore others two thousand the first require four months to be completely burnt the last near ten thus burnt it is carried to proper places to be dressed or washed and made merchantable by this process the ore is reduced to a fourth part in quantity but considerably improved in quality and by this means the water is strongly or richly impregnated with copper which is dissolved by the acid quality of the sulphur and is collected or precipitated again by iron in the abovedescribed pits the iron is all dissolved  but a far richer produce of copper is discovered from the water lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore precipitated copper which is highly saturated with the precious metal this is drawn up either by means of whimsies or windmills to the surface and then distributed into numbers of rectangular pits thirtysix feet long some pits more some less twelve to fifteen feet broad and twenty inches deep to speak in the language of the adept venus must make an assignation with mars or this solution will have no effect in plain english a quantity of iron must be immersed in the water the kind of iron is of no moment old pots hoops anchors or any refuse will suffice but of late for the convenience of management the adventurers procure new plates four feet long one and a half broad and three quarters of an inch thick these they immerse into the pits the particles of copper instantly are precipitated by the iron and the iron is gradually dissolved into a yellow ocher great part of it floats off by the water and sinks to the bottom the plates or the old iron as it happens are frequently taken out and the copper scraped off and this is repeated till the whole of the iron is consumed the copper thus procured differs little from native copper and is prized accordingly and sold for prices of    l to    l a ton  this discovery is far from new it has been practiced long in the wicklow mines in ireland and above a century in those of herngrundt in hungary where it is called ziment copper browns travels    keyslers travels iv  0 the waters of the hungarian mines are much more strongly impregnated with copper than those of paris mountain the first effects its operation in twelve or about twenty days the last requires two months horseshoes iron made in shape of hearts and other forms are put into the foreign waters and when perfectly transmuted are given as presents to curious strangers  the ore is not got in the common manner of mining but is cut out of the bed in the same manner as stone is out of a quarry a hollow is now formed in the solid ore open to the day and extends about and hundred yards in length about forty yards in breadth and twentyfour yards in depth the ends are at present undermined but supported by vast pillars and mignificent arches all metallic and these caverns meander far under ground these will soon disappear and thousands of tons of ore be gotten from both the columns and roofs the sides of this vast hollow are mostly perpendicular and access to the bottom is only to be had by small steps cut in the ore and the curious visitor must trust to them and a rope till he reaches some ladders which will conduct him the rest of the descent on the edges of the chasms are wooden platforms which project far on them are windlasses by which the workmen are lowered to transact their business on the face of the precipice there suspended they work in mid air pick a small space for a footing cut out the ore in vast masses and tumble it to the bottom with great noise in such situations they form caverns and there appear safely lodged till the rope is lowered to convey them up again much of the ore is blasted with gunpowder eight tons of which i am informed is annually used for the purpose  nature has been profuse in bestowing her mineral favors on this spot for above the copper ore and not more than three quarters of a yard beneath the common soil is a bed of yellowish greasy clay from one to four yards thick containing lead ore and yielding from six hundred to a thousand pounds weight of lead from one ton and one ton of the metal yields not less than fiftyseven ounces of silver mixed with the earth are frequently certain parts of the color of cinnabar whether these are symptomatic of the sulphurous arsenical silver ores or of quicksilver i will not pretend to decide something interferes with the successful smelting of this earth in the great insomuch that it has not yet been of that profit to the adventurers which might reasonably be expected from the crucible assays of it and they have at this time about eight thousand tons on bank undisposed of this place has been worked for lead ore in very distant times in the bottom of the pool was found an ancient smelting hearth of gritstone and several bits of smelted lead of about four inches in length two breadth and half an inch thick  these works have added greatly to the population of the island for about fifteen hundred persons are employed who with their families are supposed to make near eight thousand persons getting their bread from these mines the little village of amlwch the port of the place is increasing fast and the market grows considerable at the season of the greatest work mr hughess men alone receive for many weeks two hundred pounds in one week and a hundred and fifty in another merely for subsistence the port is no more than a great chasm between two rocks running far into land and dry at low water into which sloops run and lie secure to receive their lading  from paris mountain i visited the northwest parts of the island and passed over a sandy plain country fertile in grain see to the right the middle mouse and farther on

quarry of marble common to this place some parts of italy and to corsica marble quarry and known in the shops by the name of verde di corsica its colors are green black white and dull purple irregularly disposed in different blocks one or other of the colors are frequently wanting but among the green parts are often found narrow veins of a most elegant and silky white asbestos it is a compound species of marble part is calcareous and may be acted on by aqua fortis the green parts partake of the nature of jasper it is apt to be intersected by small cracks or by asbestine veins therefore incapable of taking a high polish this quarry lies on the lands of monachty in the parish of llanfairynghornwy and it is found again in the isle of skerries off this parish  neither the quarry not the asbestos are at present in use the ancients set a high value on the last a price equal to that of pearls they wove napkins of it and at great feasts diverted themselves in order to clean them to fling them into the fire from which they returned unhurt and with improved luster they likewise made of it shrouds for the bodies of great men before they were placed on the funeral pile

called and the third was y corny y pencynydd or the horn of the chief huntsman each of them was to be worth a pound leges walliea      to drink out of the royal cup at great entertainments was a privilege of the officers of the palace thus the governor was to receive a cup of metheglin by the hand of the high steward the same officer was also dispenser of horns of drink to several others among them to the royal porter who at certain seasons had besides his horn from the king and queen another from the master of the horse which was styled gwirawd ir ebysdyl or the waissail cup of the apostle the same        whom they probably invoked at the time of drinking this custom was in frequent use in old times the danes invoked the highest powers to assist the mighty draught help got unde

undaunted courage he persisted in all that was right and being subject to the failings of his country great passion pride and vanity sometimes in what was wrong he discharged his office foreign as it was to his profession with distinguished credit near five years soon after the accession of charles i by the influence of the favorite buckingham he was suddenly dismissed for he always had resisted the unreasonable demands of that minion  in two parts of his conduct i must consider him as a wife but not as a good man  his advice to his distressed master in the case of the earl of strafford had too great a share of duplicity to be vindicated perhaps of resentment for he hated the devoted minister the spirit of machiavel arose strong in him when he spoke of a public and private conscience and still more strongly when he advised charles in case the king could not gain cromwell by promises of fair treatment to catch him by some stratagem and cut him short he may appear in these instances a great minister but a bad divine the infirmity the inequalities which may be met in men even of firstrate abilities may be exemplified in his attempt to defend himself from a frivolous accusation for

shoulder rest in his hand helmet on his head and mitre on the ground the rage of the common people increased even so far as to seize him in his way to the house of lords and to tear his robes from his

phrenetic protest against all acts that should be done in the house of lords during their forced absence clarendon ii   0  this brought an impeachment of high treason against them imprisonment of

a vast cataract precipitates down a double fall cascade the lowest is of a very great height and forms partly a broad white sheet partly a snowy dew not unlike the staubhauch or dusty cascade in switzerland  at the entrance of the glen close to the village is a very large artificial mount flat at top and near sixty feet in diameter widening toward the base it was once the site of a castle belonging to llewelyn the great some foundations are yet to be seen round the summit and in digging traces of buildings have been discovered in this place was detected the intrigue of william de breos son of reginald a potent baron in the reign of henry iii with the wife of llewelyn it seems that william by chance of war had before fallen into the hands of our prince at which time probably the familiarity with the princess commenced but was not discovered till after he was released on a large ransom dugdale baron i      the vindictive llewelyn in the following year      inveigled breos into

expanse of water between them and llandudno or ormshead the vast cape rising like the rock of gibraltar high out of the waves before me soared the great promontory of penmaen mawr protruding itself into the sea and exhibiting a fine contrast to the fertility which it interrupts by a rude view of gray weatherbeaten stone and precipice i passed by bryn y neuodd a house late the property of humphrey roberts esquire now of his daughter and sole heiress relict of robert win esquire of plasnewydd near denbigh a little farther is the small village and church of llanvair vechan from whence is a very short ride to the once tremendous road over this celebrated rock  in past times it was justly the terror of the traveller penmaen mawr extremely narrow bad and stoney and what added to his fears for a considerable way the danger increased with his progress by reason of the precipice gaining additional height generally it was without the protection of a wall to secure him in case of a false step which might in the loftiest place precipitate him some scores of yards either on sharp rocks or into the sea according to the state of the tide a vein of a crumbling stratum in one part so contracted the road as to excite new horrors the british parliament eased the fears of the travelers by a generous aid which by means of the judicious employment of john sylvester about the year      effected what was before thought beyond the reach of art to remedy the road is now widened to a proper breadth and near the verge of the precipice secured by a strong wall the descent toward penmaen bach or the little penmaen which before was hardly practicable is now destroyed and the road is brought on a level for two or three miles at a vast height above a return of rich slopes and the deep bottom of dwygyfylchig till we arrive at the rude back of that lesser promontory when we labor up the steep ascent of sychnant with a horrible and almost precipitous mountain on one side and hills with tops broken into most singular crags on the other from the top of sychnant the road is continued about two miles on a perpetual descent to the town of conway  the breach occasioned by the crumbling stratum is now effectually repaired by a series of arches a work the just admiration of travelers and a high credit to the ingenious contriver one danger yet remains which must for ever baffle the art of man the side of this great rock above the road breaks into millions of vast masses depending often on precarious tenures which loosened by the frequent torrents sometimes though rarely descend in stoney streams  two or three accidents accidents there which have happened on this road will remain as miracles an exciseman fell from the highest part and escaped unhurt the reverend mr jones who in      was rector of llanelian in the isle of anglesey fell with his horse and a midwife behind him down the steepest part the sage femme perished as did the nag the divine with great philosophy unsaddled the steed and marched off with the trappings exulting at his preservation  i have often heard of another accident attended with such romantic circumstances that i would not venture to mention it had i not the strongest traditional authority to this day in the mouth of every one in the parish of llanvair vechan in which this promontory stands above a century ago sion humphries of this parish had made his addresses to anne thomas of creyddyn on the other side of conway river they had made an appointment to meet at a fair in the town of conway he in his way fell

april   th      aged     he survived her five years and was buried december  0th      was buried close by her in the parish churchyard where their graves are familiarly shown to this day  i have more than once visited the summit of this noted rock to view the fortifications described by the editor of cambden from some notes of that sensible old baronet sir john wynn of gwedir and have found his account very just cambden ii  0  and seq before sir john wynn a sir thomas ap william medicus m a had described it but his account never appeared in print he was eighth son of one of the family of cochwillan lived in the year      and is said to have resided at trefriw  the ascent is laborious soon after leaving the inn i met with the ruins of st seiriols chapel or as it is here called his gweli or bed and after passing a considerable way amidst small trees and brushwood attain the bare and stoney part or the braich y ddinas i e the arm of the city which rises in form of another hill out of this promontory a mr caswel its height at the request of mr flamsteed the great astronomer measured the height and found it to be from the sands      feet  after climbing for some space among the loose stones the front of three if not four an ancient fortress walls presented themselves very distinctly one above the other in most places the facings appeared very perfect but all of dry work i measured the height of one wall which was at the time nine feet the thickness seven feet and a half between these walls in all parts were innumerable small buildings mostly circular and regularly faced within and without but not disposed in any certain order these had been much higher as is evident from the fall of stones which lie scattered at their bottoms and probably had once the form of towers as sir john asserts their diameter in general is from twelve to eighteen feet but some were far less not exceeding five feet the walls were in certain places intersected with others equally strong on the northwest and southeast sides are the plain marks of two roads of a zigzag form with the remains of walls on both sides which lead to the summit on the small area of the top had been a group of towers or cells like the former one in the center and five others surrounding it three are still distinct of the two others are only faint vestiges near this had been i believe a similar group but at present reduced to a shapeless heap of stones near one of these groups is a well cut in the live rock and always filled with water supplied by the rains and kept full by the frequent impending vapors  this strong hold of the britons is exactly of the same kind with those on carn madryn carn boduan and trer caeri described pp      0   0  this was most judiciously founded to cover the passage into anglesey and the remoter part of their country and must from its vast strength have been invincible except by famine being inaccessible by natural steepness toward the sea and on the other parts fortified in the manner described see a plan of the top and one side of this strong hold in the archaelogia iii plate xxix p       the white beam or aria theophrasti aria theophrasti is frequent on the sides of this rock and in many similar places in wales no use is made of it in our country the swiss procure from the berries a good spirit the wood is very hard and excellent for flutes and the wood from its great solidity was esteemed to make the best charcoal  i descended from the summit into a hollow between the penmaen and an adjacent mountain got upon my horse and directed my course on a good sheepwalk toward conway in my way observed above gwdhw glass in the parish of dwygyvylcheu a long series of antiquities some of which are mentioned in the account of penmaen mawr preserved in cambden for a very considerable length of way i saw circles of stones of various diameters and great carneddau circles and carneddau the principal circle consists at present of ten upright stones at unequal distances from each other the largest of which is eight feet three inches high on the ground is another eleven feet two the circle is completed by a low bank of loose stones placed between the greater the diameter of this circle is eighty feet near this are four other circles far inferior in size in the center of one is a flat stone the remains of a cromlech probably the rest might have had those memorials before they were removed for the purpose of walling or the like about a quarter of a mile from these is a large carnedd composed of small stones and near it another of large stones and not far from these a circle composed of small ones an assemblage of antiquities of this nature may be seen in plate ii book iii of mr thomas wrights louthirna that book is a small specimen of his great abilities the vast treasure he possesses of drawings of irish antiquities in the highest degree merit publication and clame the assistance of some distinguished patron to enable a person of his merit to enrich the literary world with more of his labors  near the last is a great rude stone standing upright called maen y campiau maen y campiau or stone of the games and almost contiguous is a carnedd and a small circle of twelve stones this tract had certainly been much inhabited for all around are the foundations of small buildings made of rounded stones suitable to the rudeness and simplicity of distant ages small upright stones and numbers of small carnedds are scattered in various places and the vestige of a formed road is to be seen pointing from hence toward the conway  whatsoever purpose the lesser circles might be designed for there is great reason to suppose that the greater especially that near to the maen y campiau were the british circus for the exhibition of ancient games probably the eisteddfods or sessions for deciding the merits of rivals in our british olympics might have been originally held here or in similar places of british games the ancient games we had twentyfour pedair camp ar hugain whose names as preserved by dr davies in his dictionary i shall give with their explanation as far as in my power of these ten were called gwrolgampau or manly games of these six depended on bodily strength alone and were styled tadogion i e father games because no instrument whatsoever was necessary to perform them for they depended on the man naked as he was born the greeks had their pentathlum we had one more i strength to raise weights ii running iii leaping iv swimming v wrestling vi riding i imagine that the word marchogaeth extends farther than the common acceptance and that the game intended was a contest between charioteers for no people were more skilled in the use of chariots in war than the britons it is therefore improbable that they would not in time of peace exert their art in mimic combat or in competitions of speed in the festive field and these six were undoubtedly original games of this island and from the earliest of times of others some doubt may be made  the remaining four manly games were o rymarfau or what depended on skill in arms i archery ii playing with the sword and buckler iii playing with the cleddyf deuddwrn or the twohanded sword the ancient weapon of the britons as exemplified in a statue of a soldier found in digging among the ruins of london after the great fire in      monfaucons antiq iv    tab ix  iv chwarau ffon ddwybig or playing with the twoend staff which seems to correspond with the more modern quarterstaff  after these were the ten mabolgampau or juvenile games among them three species of the chare i coursing with the grehound ii fishing iii fowling the remaining seven were of the domestic kind i bairddoniath or poetical competitions of which i have before spoken in my account of the eisteddfoddau caerwy tour in wales i     to     some light is thrown on this and certain of the following articles  ii playing upon the harp iii reading welsh iv singing a cywydd with music v singing a cywydd between four with accents vi drawing of coats of arms vii heraldry these two seem so congenial as to be unnecessarily separated  after these were four gogampiau or subgames i chwarau gwyddbwyll a game like that of draughts played with men and probably the game of fox and goose gwydd signifying a goose and gwerin y wyddbwyll the men of that game  ii chwarau tawl bwrdd is probably back gammon words of british origin bach little and gammon a battle the strife of gamesters and tawl bwrdd is literally the cast on the table  iii chwarau ffristeal or the games of the dicebox of which we know no more than that dice had a concern in it and ivthly cyweiriaw felyn or the tuning of the harp  after leaving the antiquities of goddw glass i joined the turnpike road above sychnant on the left was pointed to me a lofty hill impending over conway march on its summit is castle caer lleion a british post surrounded with ditches and strong ramparts of stones an additional defense to the country besides that of penmaen mawr the view of part of conway and a large bend of the river with its rich and wooded banks are seen from the descent to them to great advantage  i entered conway at the upper gate conway a more ragged town is scarcely to be seen within or a more beautiful one without the situation is on a steep slope to the verge of the river here a mile broad at high water the form is nearly triangular surrounded with lofty walls guarded by twentyfour round towers the lower face of the triangle borders on the river a castle of matchless magnificence rises on a lofty rock at one corner and from near each end of the townwalls fronting the conwy a curtain terminated with a round tower ran some way into the river the more effectually to prevent the approach of an enemy from the water only one of these curtains exists the other with both the towers have long since perished  in front is an extensive quay from which is a delightful view up and down the river the opposite side is hilly varied with conway castle conway castle woods and gentlemens seats and the bifurcated hill of diganwy a fortress the ground called arcadia laid out by my worthy friend and old schoolfellow owen holland esquire and plastyrion the house of the reverend mr owen jones well merit a visit from the traveller  the castle was built by edward i in the year      who i believe employed the architect who built caernarvon all his skill seems to have been exerted here a more beautiful fortress never arose its form is oblong placed on all parts on the verge of the precipitous rock one side is bounded by the river another by a creek full of water at every tide and most beautifully shaded by hanging woods the other two sides face the town within are two courts and on the outside project eight vast towers each with a slender one of amazing elegance issuing from its top within which had been a winding staircase in one of the great towers is a fine window in form of an arched recess or bow ornamented with pillars this in ancient times was an elegant part of architecture called the oriel usual in the houses of people of rank and appears from a poem of the very age in which this was built to have been the toilet of the ladies and probably might have been that of queen elinor in her oryall there she was closyd well with royal glass fulfullyd it was with ymagery every window by and by on each side had there a gynne sperde with many a dyvers pynne part of the poem of the squire of low degree see mr wartons hist poetry i      the gynnes were the fastenings of the casements which were often secured with pynnes of yvere    the great hall suited the magnificence of the founder hall it is of a curved form conformable to the bend of the outward walls including one end with a large window which seems to have been the private chapel it extended a hundred and thirty feet in length was thirtytwo broad and of a fine height the roof once supported by eight noble arches six of which still remain a great fireplace at one end and another on the side warmed it and six windows to the country and three to the court gave light to this spacious apartment beneath were vast vaults the magazines of all that contributed to the convivial mirth above  there were two entrances into this fortress entrances to the castle both contrived for security the one from the conwy up a steep rock once a winding narrow stairs ending in a small advanced work before one of the gates of the castle and protected by small round towers at the other extremity is a similar work from which had been a drawbridge occasionally dropped into the town over a great fosse this entrance is expressed in the vignette p   of this volume  the town contains but few inhabitants town a considerable space being vacant of buildings it has four entrances the upper gate the lower or that next to the water a portal between that and the castle and another to the creek called porth y felin or the gate to the mill  edward i made conwy a free borough and ordered that the mayor who was the constable of the castle for the time being should preserve its privileges william sikun was appointed first to that honor at present it is governed by one alderman a recorder coroner waterbailiff and two sergeants at mace hall in conway castle chosen annually the privileges extended from caernarvon to the river clwyd for none could be convicted of any crime within that district but by a jury collected within that tract such was the case with all the other english garrisons in north wales  the ferry is at present the property of the owner of marle ferry an order was issued by edward ii for either the repairing the boat or building a new one for the use of which the inhabitants were to pay eight marks sebright mss  at low water the river is not fifty yards broad nor above eight feet deep the springtides rise twelve feet but the aproach to this port is unsafe by reason of the sandbanks  there are some remains of the cistercian abbey abbey founded in      by llewelyn ap jorwerth prince of north wales in honor of the blessed virgin and all saints dugdales monasticon i      a long vaulted room of good masonry worked with clay but plaistered with lime and a saxon door are still to be seen he endowed it with lands to a vast extent in caernarvonshire and in anglesey the same          and with privileges of great value among the lands are mentioned caput wedva vawr and caput grybcoch and morva dinllin it was exempted not only from the maintenance of all men horses dogs and hawks and even of those of the prince no one was to interfere in the elections or affairs of the house they were to enjoy all benefits of wrecks on the shores of their property in the same manner as the prince did on his but no advantage was to be taken of similar misfortunes to the religious men but all their goods so wrecked were to be restored they and their servants were to be exempt in all parts from tolls pontage and the like and their free passage over the menai conwy barmouth abermaw and dyni perhaps dyfi is particularly provided for numbers of other privileges are mentioned the charter of which is dated from aberconwy and witnessed by yorwerth gam gwin ap ednewein ydon the princes chaplain and by madog ap cador dugdales monasticon   0  this shows that conwy was a place of some note before the english conquest it probably had some sort of fortress before the existence of the present its ancient name being caer gyffin gyffin being that of the stream that flows into the creek beneath the castle ms in the possession of his grace the duke of beaufort  cambden in vol ii p  0  tells us that hugh lupus had fortified the place i suppose on his march into anglesey in  0    edward i did not choose to trust within his new walls religious of the principality but immediately removed them to his new foundation at maynan see p     of this work  removed to maynan a few miles higher up the river he acted with tenderness toward the monks and left them all their lands and privileges and preserved to them the presentation of their conventual church at conway now made parochial provided they found two able and worthy englishmen as chaplains and a third a welshman for the benefit of those who did not understand english one of the english was to be perpetual vicar to be named by the convent on every vacancy and presented by the diocesan dugdale monast i       among the illustrious persons buried in the church tombs was cynan ap owen gwynedd who was interred in the year   00 in a monks cowl because says powel it was then made to believe by the moonks and friars that that strange weed was a sure defense betwixt their souls and hell howsoever they died powels hist wales      its great founder was also buried here but on the dissolution his coffin was removed to llanrwst and is still to be seen  a very rude figure cut on stone preserves the memory of mary mother to archbishop williams who died of childbirth of twins october  0th      and a singular epitaph on a mr hooks proves the remarkable secundity of the family here lies the body of nicholas hooks of conway gent who was the   st child of his father william hooks esquire by alice his wife and the father of twentyseven children who died the  0th day of march       in the street not far from the abbey is a very old house with a singular window with several coats of arms sculptured beneath some relative to the stanlies this house is called the college college as it is said that edward i took this abbey into his hands he possibly might establish here a place for the instruction of youth  the plas mawr is a vast house built by robert wynn plas mawr esquire of the house of

allies or patrons scattered over the walls and ceilings are swans owls cranes ostriches and bears and ragged staves the last the badges of robert dudley earl of leicester a piece of flattery paid to him by the founder of the house  few of the remarkable events which have befell this place events are preserved in history when henry iii made his calamitous encampment under diganwy opposite to this town he dispatched three hundred renegado welshmen of the borders with some other troops to rescue a ship of provision which had been stranded on this side they succeeded but instigated by avarice sacrilegiously plundered the abbey and burnt several houses belonging to it the loyal welsh grew desperate attacked the banditti laden with spoils slew numbers and hung or beheaded every prisoner whom they took powel       richard ii before his return from ireland directed that the rendezvous of his forces destined to oppose the usurping bolingbroke should be here forty thousand loyalists out of cheshire and wales had assembled under the banners of the earl of salisbury wearied by the delays of their illfated prince numbers disbanded themselves yet sufficient remained animated against the usurper and determined to follow their king through all his fortunes richard seized with a panic stole from conwy in the night helinshed      was betrayed by the earl of northumberland and soon after perished in the hands of his enemy in the tour in wales i    is the sequel of his story     the town was almost depopulated by the plague in   0  and numbers of people were buried in the streets it was observed to break out here within three weeks of the time it appeared in london probably brought here by some sugitives  in mention of the transactions in this place during the civil wars the last active scene of the life of archbishop williams must be related especially as it was a part for which he underwent the greatest but perhaps unjust calumny as soon as he retired into wales in      he was resorted to by all the loyalists being the person on whose prudence and spirit they could fully rely he had received in charge from his majesty all north wales and in particular the castle of conway philips life of archbishop williams      he began with fortifying his house at penrhyn and was at considerable expense in strengthening this fortress in the perilous state of those times multitudes of the country gentlemen requested the archbishop to receive into the castle their writings plate and most valuable movables he undertook the charge and gave to every owner a receipt by which he made himself liable to the loss and put his nephew william hooks in possession of the place in january   0   philips      his grace from that time was the protector of the country not only from the violence of the enemy but from the oppression of his own party in may      prince rupert unfortunately superseded the prelate in his command and caused sir john owen to take possession of the castle this he did with most blameable violence and with a constant evasion of giving the archbishop any security of the valuables he had in charge the same           affairs were in this state till june      when williams foreseeing ruin to himself irritated by injuries from those who had embarked in the same cause with himself and in the critical time when the kings affairs were desperate invited by general mytton to put himself on the favor of parliament accepted his offer and assisted him in the reduction of the place general myttons letter in drakes parl hist xv     mytton by the advice of the archbishop took the town by storm on august   th the latter assisted personally and was wounded in the neck rushworth iv part i      with the severity usual at that time toward the irish mytton seized on all that were found and caused them to be tied back to back and flung into the river whitelook      the castle surrendered on the  0th of november and mytton who is represented as a generous character more haughty than covetous philips  00  restored to every individual the property entrusted to williams for these services the parliament granted him a general pardon and a release from all his sequestrations  the beauty and grandeur of this fortress seemed to have induced the governing powers to forbear offering any violence to its walls that impiety was reserved for loyal hands a grant had been made of it by the king to edward conway earl of conway in      the earl employed his servant milward to take down the iron timber and lead and to transport it to ireland under pretense of its being for his majestys service the earls letter in the appendix  thomas bulkely esquire colonel wynn and several of the principal gentlemen of the country opposed the design but their remonstrance was overruled and this noble pile reduced to nearly its present condition at present it is held from the crown by owen holland esquire  several years ago the folly of some of the inhabitants by getting stones from the rock beneath one of the great towers brought down a vast segment the ruins are the most awful i ever beheld lying in stupendous fragments on the shore some so unbroken as to preserve both the grand external rotundity and inward concavity a hardened cement of stone and mortar eleven feet thick the prospect of the upper part of the tower remains entire suspended at a vast height above our heads exhibiting in the breach such a strength of walling as might have given to the architect the most reasonable hope that his work would have endured to the end of time when i image to myself the gay appearance of this fortress filled by the festive court of edward his beloved elinor and all the train of gallant nobility who passed a christmas here exulting at the conquest of my hardy countrymen and when i survey its present ruins my mind naturally falls into melancholy reflections suitable to the scene around me let me only change the rock on towys flood for that of conwy and a favorite poet will express the ideas that must arise in the mind of its past and present state  deep at its feet in conwys flood his sides are clothed with waving wood and ancient towers crown his brow that cast an awful look below whose ragged walls the ivy creeps and with her arms from falling keeps so both a safety from the wind on mutual dependence find it is now the ravens blank abode it is now the apartment of the toad and there the fox securely feeds and there the poisonous adder breeds concealed in ruins moss and weeds while ever and anon there falls huge heaps of hoary moulderd walls yet time has seen that lifts the low and level lays the lofty brow has seen this broken pile complete big with the vanity of state but transient is the smile of fate

the church are some remains of walls which are all that are left of this once noted place the itinerary places it twentyfour miles from segontium and nineteen from varis  i proceeded a little farther and turned up a very steep road by the church of llanbedr to the summit of a very lofty hill called pen caer helen pen caer helen to try to discover more of helens noted road but my search was fruitless yet my pains were rewarded by the sight of a british post of great strength and in some parts singularly guarded it had the usual fosses and vast ramparts of stones with some remains of the facing of walls and the foundations of three or four round buildings but what struck me much were two considerable spaces of ground thickly set with sharppointed stones set upright in the earth as if they had been to serve the use of chevaux du frize to impede the approach of an enemy from this hill is one way a wild and barren prospect of carnedd llewelyn and a long tract of rude hills and stoney

narrow tract of great fertility it had been an appendage to the abbey of conway of which there remains part of a very strong building  i ascended on a very long and steep path to the top of llandudno llandudno or orms head a beautiful sheepwalk consisting of a fine turf except where the rock appears extending near four miles in length and one in breadth it lies in the manor of gogarth belonging to the sea of bangor the western extremity is a vast precipice the haunt of various seafowls in the season of breeding seafowls the gulls possess the lowest part above them the razorbills and guillemots have their quarters over them croak the corvorants and herons occupy the highest regions and scattered in different parts are a few puffins and black guillemots the peregrine falcon builds in these rocks falcons the kind was in the days of falconry so excellent that the great minister burleigh sent a letter of thanks to an ancestor of sir roger mostyn for a present of a cast of hawks from this place  falconry was in high esteem among the welsh ancient falconry our prince had his chief falconer who held the fourth rank among the officers of his court he held his lands free had a double portion of provender for his horse the prince supplied him with woollen clothes the princess with linen he brought his cup with him into the hall but was not allowed to drink more than would quench his thirst least he should get fuddled and neglect his hawks he was allowed the hearts and lungs of all the animals in the royal kitchen and sometimes a barren ewe to feed his birds whenever his hawks killed any of the three most noble species of game the heron the bittern or the crane he received from the prince three services that of holding his stirrup when he descended from his horse of holding his horse while he was taking the hawks from the game and of holding his stirrup again when he mounted his horse and at night the prince honored him with serving him thrice at table with his own hands in case the falconer took any of the royal birds in the princes absence he was to bring it into the hall and show it to him on that the prince was to arise or if he did not he was to bestow on him the robe which he then wore during the time that the hawks were in their mew the falconer was not bound to answer any suit if he killed his horfe in the exercise of his office the prince was to find him another the fine for an injury to the chief falconer was vi cows and cxxvi pence his slaughter was not to be atoned for less than cxxvi cows lges wallicae    to     let me conclude with saying that there was a peculiar tax for the support of this office called cylch hebog yddjon record of caernarvon in bibliotheea litteraria     which fell on the vassals for the prince contributed little or nothing to the expense of his amusements  the northern side of this promontory is broken into precipices of various heights and the base of both these sides is washed by a very deep water it is well worth the labor of ascending to the highest point to view the extensive and various prospects  on the same side are the remains of several rude walls without mortar called llety vadog or the house of madoc a supposed ancestor of gloddaeth and not far from it is a strait narrow path with stones on each side probably the remains of two walls a watchplace for deer as the name wylfa yr ceirw signifies  on a great eminence called dinas is a large enclosure the edge of the hill is surrounded with a rude wall and within are multitudes of small circular hollows about twelve feet in diameter environed with walls such as are found on trer caeri and similar places the rough habitations of our distant ancestors near this place is a maen sigl rockingstone a great one whose point of contact with the ground is so small as to make it moveable with the left touch the country people call it crd tudno st tudnos cradle this is surrounded with a fosse and has a formed road to it it is the conjecture of the learned that the druids made these stones an instrument of imposition on their votaries and in case of any judicial determinations pretended that none but their holy hands could move them and probably they were surrounded with a fosse and had their prescribed road to keep off the vulgar and give greater solemnity to the miraculous decision the ingenious bernier relates a superstition not very foreign from this at sendbrary in the kingdom of cachemire the bramins the druids of india showed him a stone which the strongest man could not lift yet eleven of those holy men with the tip of their finger could effect it on praying to their saint berniers vojage of cachemire       from hence i passed by the church llandudno church on the bleakest of situations above the sea and remote from all dwellings it is dedicated to st tudno of maes gwyddno the country now overflown by the sea between meirionyddshire and llein in descending from this promontory i passed by several copper works which at times are worked to advantage the ride from hence along the side of llandudno bay is extremely pleasant i ascended to gloddaeth near the foot of rhewledin a vast rock which swarms in the season with razorbills and puffins and with rock pigeons abundance of which regularly breed here in preference to the dovehouses which they constantly quit at their layingtime  i descended from gloddaeth to the sea side about two miles distant saw close to the shore the singular little building called st trillos chapel it is oblong has a window on each side and at the end a small door and a vaulted roof paved with round stones instead of being slated within was a well the whole building is surrounded with a stone wall  on a hill about half a mile distant from this chapel is the church of llandrillo llandrillo dedicated to the same saint near it is a large ruined house called bryn euryn formerly called lls maelgwyn gwynedd who had a palace on this spot about the twelfth century it was inhabited by the great ednyfed vychan and some time in the last was possessed by a family of the name of conwy of welsh descent derived from gryffydd goch lord of rhos and rhyfoniod  keep along the shore and pass by rhos vynach rhos vynach or the marsh of the monks having been the property of conwy abbey the church still keeps share in a considerable wear which runs from this point the bishop and the vicar of llandrillo having the fish of every tenth tide between them at times they have a good chance of a profitable capture for in two successive tides forty pounds worth of mackrel have

rock juts into the sea at the end of the bay in my memory the traveller went along a narrow path cut on its front like the road on penmaen mawr but infinitely more terrible and dangerous a fine coachroad has of late years been formed far behind this precipice from thence i descended to llanddulas a small village and church in one of the deep bottoms of this neighborhood was betrayed the unfortunate prince richard ii who had been deceived by the earl of northumberland to go along with him from conwy to meet bolingbroke to settle amicably the quarrel between them hereabouts he suddenly found himself surrounded by a large band of armed men placed there by the treacherous earl who seizing on richard delivered him captive to the usurper in flint castle see the whole story agreeably expressed by suitable prints from old illuminated mss in mr strutts regal antiquities   a little farther on the right hand high above the road is cefn ogo cefn ogo a lofty precipice white unless where darkened by the ivy which spreads along the front in the middle is the most magnificent entrance into a cave which britain can boast it seems like the portal of a noble cathedral arched and divided

lies near the sea abergeleu about a mile from cefn ogo it lies near the clayey cliffs which impend over the sea tradition says that in old times that element had overwhelmed a vast tract of inhabited

limestone hills at times productive of lead ore on one of them projecting from the rest called coppa yr wylfa coppa yr wylfa or the mount of the watchtower is a very strong british post the front is a great precipice out of whose interstices grows the aria theophrasti and across the accessible part are defenses of stone and earth in a glen beneath is a ditch called ffos y bleiddiaid or the ditch of the wolves possibly from the frequency of those animals in these parts mr llwyd in his itinerary speaks of a mount near abergeleu divided in two on which formerly stood a castle called pen y pil pen y

parishioners were obliged to repair the street wall of the churchyard  high above this place on the top of a hill called pen y parc is a very strong post said to have been occupied by owen gwynedd after his fine retreat before henry ii camp of owen gwynfdd whom he kept here at bay and politically secured his dominions from further invasion for it was on this spot not among the snowdon hills as lord lyttelton ii      d ed octavo supposes that our gallant prince made a most effectual stand and stopped all further progress of the invader on the accessible sides are double and treble ditches and ramparts the others are sufficiently guarded by precipices the area is near three quarters of a mile round and near the edge of the steep part facing rudland is smoothed into the form of a terrace  st george had in this parish his holy well superstitions at which the british mars had his offering of horses for the rich were wont to offer one to secure his blessing on all the rest he was the

well of st aelian a parish not far from llandrillo in caernarvonshire has been in great repute for the cures of all diseases by means of the intercession of the saint who was first invoked by earnest prayers in the neighboring church he was also applied to on less worthy occasions and made the instrument of discovering thieves and of recovering stolen goods some repair to him to imprecate their neighbors and to request the saint to afflict with sudden death or with some great misfortune any persons who may have offended them the belief in this is still strong for three years have not elapsed since i was threatened by a fellow who imagined i had injured him with the vengeance of st aelian and a journey to his well to curse me with effect  i shall here bring into one point of view the several religious customs used among us in former times religious customs which have been gradually dropped in proportion as the age grew enlightened several were local several extended through the whole country perhaps some which were expressive of their hatred of vice or which had a charitable end might as well have been retained notwithstanding the smack of folly that was often to be perceived in them  in church at the name of the devil an universal spitting seized the congregation as if in contempt of that evil spirit and whenever judas was mentioned they expressed their abhorrence of him by smiting their breasts  if there be a fynnon vair the well of our lady or any other saint the water for baptism was always brought from thence and after the ceremony was over old women were very fond of washing their eyes in the water of the font  previous to a funeral it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier for the next of kin be it widow mother sister or daughter for it must be a female to give over the coffin a quantity of white loaves in a great dish and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it to certain poor persons after that they present in the same manner a cup of drink and require the person to drink a little of it immediately when that is done all present kneel down and the minister if present says the lords prayer after which they proceed with the corpse and at every crossway between the house and the church they lay down the bier kneel and again repeat the lords prayer and do the same when they first enter the churchyard it is also customary in many places to sing psalms on the way by which the stillness of rural life is often broken into in a manner finely productive of religious reflections  to this hour the bier is carried by the next of kin a custom considered as the highest respect that filial piety can pay to the deceased this was a usage frequent among the romans of high rank and it was thought a great continuance of the good fortune which had attended metellus macedonicus through his whole being that when he had in the fullness of years passed out of life by a gentle decay amidst the kisses and embraces of his nearest connections he was carried to the funeral pile on the shoulders of his four sons valor max lib vii c    and let me add that each one of them had enjoyed the greatest offices of the commonwealth plinii hist not lib vii c      among the welsh it was reckoned fortunate for the deceased if it should rain while they were carrying him to church that his bier might be wet with the dew of heaven  in some places it was customary for the friends of the dead to kneel and say the lords prayer over the grave for several sundays after the interment and then to dress the grave with flowers  manibus date lilia plenis purpureos spargam flores animamque nepotis his saltem accumulem donis et fungar inani munere bring fragrant flowers the fairest lilies bring with all the purple beauties of the spring these gifts at lest these honors i will bestow on the dear youth to please his shade below warton it is still usual to stick on the eve of st john the baptist over the doors sprigs of st johns wort or in lieu of it the common mugwort the intent was to purify the house from evil spirits in the same manner as the druids were wont to do with vervaine which still bears with the welsh the significant title of cas began gythral or the demons aversion  upon christmas day plygan about three oclock in the morning most of the parishioners assembled in church and after prayers and a sermon continued there singing psalms and hymns with great devotion till broad day and if through age or infirmity any were disabled from attending they never failed having prayers at home and carols on our saviors nativity the former part of the custom is still preserved but too often perverted into intemperance this act of devotion is called plygan or the crowing of the cock it has been a general belief among the superstitious that instantly  at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine but during the holy season the cock was supposed to exert his power throughout the night from which undoubtedly originated the welsh word plygan as applied to this custom accordingly shakespeare finely describes this old opinion  some say that ever against that season comes wherein our saviors birth is celebrated the bird of dawning sings all night long and then they say no spirit walks abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes no witch has power to charm so hallowed and so gracious is the time soon after leaving st george kinmael i passed by kinmael house and park in a lofty situation on the left this place had been during four generations the property of the hollands of a noble english descent long settled in this part of britain and branched into several respectable families the pedigrees derive them from a sir thomas holland who tradition says came with another brother into wales in troublesome times i have reason to suppose them to have been william and thomas the two younger sons of john holland duke of exeter who died in      and left to each of them an annuity of forty pounds dugdales baron ii     they were of a most unpopular family therefore probably retired to shun the miseries they might experience in that age of civil discord pierce holland eleventh in descent from sir thomas made his settlement at kinmael by his marriage with catherine daughter to richard ap evan ap dafydd vychan and alice his wife heiress of the place daughter of gryffydd lloyd ap evan ap rhys ap gryffydd lloyd ap rohyn ap rhys ap robert  in the last century one of his descendants had two daughters colonel carter an officer in the service of the parliament made choice of catherine the youngest and took the estate with her a wag said that he had chosen the best piece of holland in the country he left the eldest sister mary to colonel price of rhiwlas a royalist about fifty years ago a descendant of his john carter esquire alienated the place to the late sir george win bart  in a very wet situation vaenol beneath kinmael is vaenol one of the best old houses in the county of flint it was built in      by john lloyd a younger son of wickwer

mutton in his scarlet robes a ruff and great hat and another of lady mutton a handsome woman in a black gown high hat and with a feather fan and great kerchief aet         from hence i passed through rudland and newmarket to the comforts of my fireside  from downing to montgomery and shrewsbury on wednesday july  th      i left home breakfasted with the reverend mr lloyd at caerroys and with him descended into the pretty little vale which leads from mold to denbigh and immediately on crossing it ascend the steep and lofty side of bwlch coed y mynydd a great hill the last of the clwydian chain before it is broken by the straight of bodvari on the side of this hill at llys coed y mynydd toward the left lived ednowain bendew or ednowain the strongheaded lord of tegengl in  0   and one of the fifteen tribes of north wales  these llwythau tribes of north wales or tribes were the nobility of north wales they commenced extremely early and at different times were lords of distinct districts and called to that honor by several princes the latest were about the time of dafydd ap owen gwynedd who began his reign in      we are left ignorant of the form by which they were called to this rank  all we know is that each of them enjoyed some office in the court of our princes which seems to have been hereditary and probably to be attendant on the honor  after reaching the summit of the hill a rich and extensive view presented itself of the fertile vale of clwyd beneath and the great range of our alpine country at length jutting into the sea at the bold promontories of llandudno and penmaen mawr the descent into the vale is gradual along a beautiful terrace for a considerable space far above it vronyw the seat of john madocks esquire commands a delightful prospect its master adds to the many illustrious proofs we have at this period that the modern welsh are as eminent in persuasive rhetoric as our gaulish neighbors were in days of yore  pass by the small churches of llangwifan llandyrnog llangynbafal and llanrhychan dedicated to the saints gwyfan tyrnog cynhafal and rhychan all in the county of denbigh and diocese of bangor beneath the church of llanbeder reach nearly the bottom of the vale and continue my journey through ruthin and along nantclwyd by a good old house of the same name  after resting one night at corwen proceed as far as llandrillo on the road to bala and near that village turn to the left into a narrow glen much wooded watered by a rude torrent and bounded by high hills at its extremity near a farm called blaen y cwm milltir gerric begin to ascend milltir gerrig or the stoney mile a bwlch or pass amidst the berwyn hills about a mile in length with the mountains black with heath soaring on each fide to a stupendous height it is the great pass in these parts from meirionyddshire into and divides the counties the latter is called by the welsh sir tree faldwyn or the shire of the town of baldwin lieutenant of the marches in the time of the conqueror who built the town the name of which was afterward changed to that of montgomery derived from roger de montgomery the founder of the castle which name it gave to the county when it was formed into one by henry viii the first member that appears on record was edward leech esquire who sat in      humphry llwyd justly celebrates the fertility of its valleys the stature and beauty of its inhabitants but stigmatizes them with the character of idleness and of being addicted to useless amusements commentariolum      the descent from this pass is very steep but a fine road was then forming with the great view of giving the irish a shorter way into their country through oswestry and over the bwlch through the county of meirionydd this is one of the vast designs of the present age which will effect communications with places before almost inaccessible  on arriving at the bottom i again found myself in narrow vales loftily bounded after about three miles riding reached llangynog llangynog a small village in the parish of the same name in the diocese of st asaph this place was the source of shortlived wealth to the maternal relation of the present earl of powys lead mine a lead mine was discovered here in the year      which was in most parts a vein of three yards and a half thick and was worked to the depth of a hundred yards when the water became too powerful it continued in a flourishing state during a period of near forty years yielded about four thousand tons annually was sold at   l a ton and smelted on the spot and brought in a clear revenue to the family of twenty thousand pounds a year  a slate quarry has been discovered of late years in the parish about  0 000 were sold from november        to november        which sell at the rate of from   s to  0 s a thousand but the want of water carriage is a great loss to the work  at about two miles distance from llangynog i turned up a small valley to the right to pay my devotions to the shrine of st monacella st monacella or as the welsh style her melangell her legend relates that she was the daughter of an irish monarch who had determined to many her to a nobleman of his court the princess had vowed celibacy she fled from her fathers dominions and took refuge in this place where she lived fifteen years without seeing the face of man brochwel yscythrog prince of powys being one day a harehunting pursued his game till he came to a great thicket when he was amazed to find a virgin of surprising beauty engaged in deep devotion with the hare he had been pursuing under her robe boldly facing the dogs who retired to a distance howling notwithstanding all the efforts of the sportsmen to make them seize their prey even when the huntsman blew his horn it stuck to his lips brochwel heard her story and gave to god and her a parcel of lands to be a sanctuary to all that fled there he desired her to found an abbey on the spot she did so and died abbess in a good old age she was buried in the neighboring church called pennant church of pennant melangell and from her distinguished by the addition of melangell her hard bed is shown in the cleft of a neighboring rock her tomb was in a little chapel or oratory adjoining to the church and now used as a vestryroom this room still is called cellybedd or the cell of the grave but her relics as well as her image have been long since removed but i think the last is still to be seen in the churchyard the legend is perpetuated by some rude wooden carvings of the saint with numbers of hares scuttling to her for protection she properly became their patroness they were called mwyn melangell  st monacellas lambs till the last century so strong a superstition prevaled that no person would kill a hare in the parish and even later when a hare was pursued by dogs it was firmly believed that if any one cried god and st monacella be with thee it was sure to escape see her life   in the churchyard is a stone with the figure of an armed man which now serves as a common gravestone but once covered the remains of the eldest son of owen gwynedd jorwerth drwyndwn tomb of jorwerth drwyndwn or edward with the broken nose who was put aside of the succession on account of the blemish powels hist wales      hither he had fled for refuge from the cruelty of his brother dafydd ap owen gwynedd this place having been one of our most celebrated sanctuaries on his shield is inscribed hic jacet etwart tradition says he was killed not far from hence at a place called bwlch croes jorwerth  this valley is exceedingly picturesque

valley is the house of llechweddgarth the property of thomas thomas esquire continue my journey for some time along the valley then ascend and descend a series of grassy hills of a moderate height and observe in many parts the narrower passes crossed by entrenchments in old times designed to interrupt the inroads of an invader it is said that a roman road goes near this place toward aberystwyth bodfach descend to bodfach the seat of my friend bell lloyd esquire by virtue of his marriage with miss price heiress of the place this and several other estates even as far as the borders of shropshire belonged to the kyffins so named from being kyffiniad or borderers they were descended from eneon evell or eneon the twin brother to kynric evell illegitimate sons of madoc ap meredydd ap

the valley about bodfach expands is admirably cultivated is watered by the cain and prettily bordered by low hills finely wooded the town and church of llanvyllin happily fill one angle and vary the view  from bodfach i made an excursion to llwydiarth llwydiarth a large old house in the parish of llanwddyn seated in a hilly naked country it was formerly the property of the great family of the vaughans descended from aleth hen king of dived or pembrokeshire the estate was conveyed to the late sir watkin williams wynn by his first wife daughter and heiress to the last owner from one part of the ride had a view into cardiganshire and of the great naked mountain of plynlimmon covered with heath or moory grass  i cannot omit in this place mention of an excursion formerly made to llanrhaiadr in mochnant a neighboring parish partly in this county partly in denbighshire llanrhaiadr in mochnant the church is seated in the last dedicated to st dogvan son of brychan dr william morgan who first translated the bible into welsh was vicar of this he was rewarded by queen elizabeth with the bishopric of llandaff in      and was removed to that of st asaph in   0  where he died september  0th   0  and was interred in the cathedral  the facetious but learned preacher dr south was the last rector of the parish on his decease the rectorial tithes were appropriated by act of parliament to the maintenance of the choir and repair of the cathedral church of st asaph  i must speak with due respect of the memory of the late worthy vicar pistill rhaiadr dr worthington to whose hospitable house i was indebted for a seasonable reception the wet evening which fortunately preceded my visit to the celebrated cataract pistill rhaiadr it terminates the precipitous end of a very narrow valley and as it were divides a bold front of the berwyn mountains after sliding for some time along a small declivity it darts down at once twothirds of the precipice and falling on a ledge has in process of time worn itself a passage through the rock and makes a second cataract beneath a noble arch which it has formed on the slippery summit of which a daring shepherd will sometimes terrify you with standing the second fall reaches the bottom and assumes the name of the rhaiadr or the cascade the desect of this noble fall is the want of wood when i visited it the approach was very bad but that is not only effectually remedied by the late benevolent vicar but as i am informed he has besides erected a cottage as a retreat to the traveller from the fury of a storm  the abundance of sheep which enliven these hills brought at the time i visited the country great wealth into it the flannel manufacture and that of a coarse cloth for the army and for the covering the poor negroes in the west indies is manufactured in most parts of the county it is sent and sold in the rough to shrewsbury a practice very contrary to the interest of the country  leave bodfach and for the sake of a beautiful view am led by mr lloyd a little out of my way to the top of a hill from whence is a prospect of a rich expanded vale with the church of llanvechan in the midst part is bounded by low and fertile hills the great rock of llan y mynach the magazine of limestone for a vast tract of country closes one side beyond them extends the great flat of shropshire with the wrekin hill rising insulated in the distant ground i returned through llanfyllin llanfyllin a small town which had a charter bestowed on it by llewelyn ap gryffydd ap gwynwynwyn in the reign of edward ii and confirmed by edward de charlton lord of powys this gave the burgesses exemption from tolls theme throughout his territories gileam and hampsum they could take imprison and try any thieves or malefactors and should such escape they had liberty of pursuing them for a league round the town any stranger residing in it and paying scot and lot for a year became free it is governed by two bailiffs chosen annually who among other privileges granted it by charles ii were made justices of the peace within the corporation during the time of their office cambden ii       ride for some time on the oswestry road ascend to the right go near bryn gwyn a seat of william mostyn esquire above which is a circular british post numbers of them front the low country on the hills which jut into it as if guards to protect the internal parts from invasion across the road in one place i met the vestiges of a very strong rampart to defend a pass into the vale of meivod which soon after appeared in view the church and village are situated in the middle of the valley vale of meivod which is quite flat extends in length more than five miles and about half a mile broad three parts are bounded by low hills prettily wooded one end opens into the plain and is finely terminated by the freiddin hills a vast mass and conspicuous feature in this county and part of shropshire the vyrnyw called by dr powel marnovia a beautiful river winds along the middle of the vale its borders rich in wheat rye and grass  the church is dedicated to st tyssilio a prince of powys the supporter of the british churches against austin the monk in old times it belonged to the abbey of strata marcella ystrat marchell in this county it is the mother church to pool and guildsfield all which in the   th of henry vii the bishop of st asaph had license to appropriate to himself notitia on st asaph diocese ms  the vicarage of meivod is now appropriated to christchurch oxford it is a place of great ecclesiastical antiquity there is reason to suppose that it took its name from its having been in the very early ages of christianity the residence of a hermit or recluse for meudwyfod implies a hermits habitation and lan is frequently added to many welsh words to imply them to have been enclosed places such as gwinllan a vineyard corlan a sheepfold ydlan a stackyard so that meudwylan would signify the precinct of the hermit and by the assistance of a roman termination become meudwylanium and that readily more latinized into mediolanum the name we find it bears in the itinerary iter britanniarum  where it is placed between bovium bangor and rutunium rowton we find it again in the chorography of the ravennas and in ptolemy horsely          if those periods are supposed to have been too early for the institution of monastic life in this island i must defend my opinion by that of the learned tanner who reasonably supposes it to have been nearly coeval with christianity in great britain preface   the roman antiquity rests upon the authority of one of our older writers girald cambr itin dr bowels note c iv lib ii  who mentions that in his time there were considerable remains of venerable antiquity that several foundations floors and causeways have been dug up but whether any coins arms or inscriptions have been met with does not appear cambden also mentions a field called erwr porth or the field of the gate where he concludes might have stood one of the portae or gates cambden ii           to revert to the christian antiquities meivod is said to have been the archdeaconry of all powystand and that it had two churches besides the present whether the chapel whose ruins were standing in no very remote period and was called eglwys gwyddfarch from a british saint of this country might not have been one i cannot say the other was named eglwys vair or the church of the virgin which was built in      powel  0    in the chief church were interred the princes and great men of powys among whom may be enumerated madoc ap meredydd ap blyddyn ap cynvyn prince of powys who died in    0 at winchester and was conveyed here and the noble gryffydd maelor lord of bromefield who died in      powel   0       the churchyard of the present is not less than nine acres churchyard and yields to the minister as many pounds as a pasture  not far above meivod is an union of two rivers both of the name of vyrnyw both of them diverge considerably from each other and take their rise remote from one another the poetical topographer draiton therefore very justly styles the river forkt vurnway bringing tur and tano growing rank she plies her toward the pool canto vi  both are large streams in many places black and deep soon beyond their junction the ground rises on a steep bank above one of the rivers stood mathraval once the seat of the princes of powis the name at present preserved only by a farmhouse i could easily trace the site of the ancient castle it occupied the space of about two acres one side was guarded by the steep over the river the other three sides by a vast rampart of stone and earth and a very deep fosse a high exploratory mount on which perhaps had been a castelet fills one corner from which is a clear view of all that passes up and down the vale  after this place was deserted by its princes the castle was possessed or as dr powel says built by robert de vepont a potent baron high in favor with king john it is most probable that he only restored and strengthened it with new works in      llewelyn ap jorwerth laid siege to it but the king coming with a potent army obliged llewelyn to retire and after that caused the castle to be demolished hist wales       in gwern ddu a wood opposite to mathraval beyond the river is a circular entrenchment and in a field beyond the other branch is a round mount both which certainly had respect in early times to the fortress at mathraval i must therefore agree with the learned burtons conjecture that this might have been the mediolanum of the romans it having been customary with british as well as saxon princes to have their palaces where formerly roman stations had their situation and being burtons com     let me add also that this might have been the winter station and the low meivod subject to overflowings from the river the summer station  the country beyond mathraval grows hilly clayey and barren pass by the church of llangyniw to the left is dolarddyn where henry vii is said to have lodged a night  a few miles farther i rid through the village of castle caereneon seated on the vyrnyw a castle was built here in      by madoc ap meredydd prince of powys powel  0   i had not leisure to enquire whether there were any remains  the country for seven miles more continued hilly crygynnog and full of unpleasant commons reach crygynnog the seat of arthur blainey esquire whose hospitality i experienced for two or three days under his conduct i saw every thing in the neighborhood which merited attention the very worthy owner is descended from brochwel yschythrog the elder branch of the family has been ennobled in ireland since the year    0 by the title of lord blainey of monaghan an honor well earned by sir edward blainey knight by services in ireland in the reigns of queen elizabeth and her successor  one evening i was conducted to castle dolforwyn castle dolforwyn a castle on a high ridge of a hill very steep and almost surrounded by wooded dingle at the bottom runs a small brook which falls into the severn about a mile distant this fortress is very ruinous being built with the small shattery stone of the country and resembles much in its masonry castle dinas bran on the two more accessible sides are deep trenches cut through the rock it commands a fine view of the rich vale of severn according to dugdale monast ii      it was built by dafydd ap llewelyn a prince who reigned from    0 to      but i prefer the authority of john dafydd rhys quoted by the reverend mr evan evans dissertatio de bardis     which assures us it was founded by that worthy prince bleyddyn ap cynvyn between the years  0   and  0   roger de mortimer obtained a grant of it together with the castles of kedewen and keri from edward i in      to hold to himself and his heirs by the service of three knights fees dugdale baron i       what is the origin of the name of dolforwyn or the meadow of the maiden i cannot with any certainty pronounce but from some legendary tradition of the country i suspect that it has allusion to the story of sabra or sabrina of which our poets have made so beautiful an use sabrina her story she was says jeffry of monmouth daughter of locrine king of britain by estrildis one of the three captive virgins of matchless charms which he took after he had defeated humber king of the huns to whom they belonged locrine had divorced his former queen guendolen in her favor on the death of the british monarch guendolen assumed the government pursued estrildis and sabra her daughter with unrelenting cruelty and caused them to be drowned in the river which with a slight alteration assumed the name of the innocentvictim milton in his brief and elegant description of our rivers speaks of the severn swift guilty of maidens death but in his incomparable mask of comus he enters fully into her sad story and makes her the goddess of chastity and calls her from the deep to undo the charmed band of true virgin here distressed through the force and through the wile of unblest inchanter vile   no reader of taste will i am sure be displeased with me for relating the history of the goddess in the beautiful numbers of our poet  sabrina is her name a virgin pure whilome she was the daughter of locrine that had the scepter from his father brute she guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit of her enraged stepdame guendolen commended her fair innocence to the flood that stayed her flight with his crossflowing course the waternymphs that in the bottom played held up their pearled wrists and took her in bearing her strait to aged nereus hall who piteous of her woes reared her lank head and gave her to his daughters to imbathe in nectard lavers strowd with asphodil and through the porch and inlet of each sense dropped in ambrosial oils till she revived and underwent a quick immortal change made goddess of the river still she retains her maiden gentleness and often at eve visits the herds along the twilight meadows helping all urchin blasts and illluck signs that the shrewd meddling else delights to make which she with precious viald liquors heals for which the shepherds at their festivals carol her goodness loud in rustic lays and throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream of pansies pinks and gaudy daffadils and as the old swain said she can unlock the clasping charm and thaw the numming spell if she be right invoked in warbled song for maidenhood she loves and will be swift to aid a virgin such as was herself in hard besetting need not far from dolforwyn is abervechan abervechan an old house which after being owned by the blaineys the prices and the lloyds is now possessed by sir gervase clifton baronet by virtue of his marriage with the heiress of the place daughter of richard lloyd esquire  from hence we descended into the vale of severn and cross the river on a wooden bridge it is the misfortune of this part of the country to be destitute of several most necessary materials the rich are obliged to burn wood instead of coal and the poor a wretched turf lime is extremely remote and stone fit for masonry at a vast distance from the head of the severn as low as llandreinio there is not a stone bridge should it happen in any remote period that timber should fail the better sort of people must probably be reduced to distress for want of fuel and at times one part of the country become inaccessible to the other for want of bridges the moral of this is plant and preserve your woods  visit tre newydd newtown or newtown a neat small town with a good market on the banks of the severn in a pretty park near to the town is the seat of the pryses the family derives itself from elystan glodrydd one of the five royal tribes of wales prince of all the country between wye and severn and earl of hereford in right of his mother rhiengar daughter of grono ap tudor trevor it became possessed of this place about the time of henry vi sir john pryse the late owner sir john pryse was a gentleman of worth but of strange singularities he married three wives and kept the two first who died in his

cheshire who healed all diseases by prayer faith and an embrocation of fastingspittle multitudes resorted to her from all parts and kept her salival glands in full employ sir john with a high spirit

is not offensive to both god and you  i am madam your most obedient and very much afflicted humble servant john price   the following day our ride was directed toward caer sws a place of roman antiquity our way lay over some high grassy lands roman road on gwyn vynydd was easily traced the roman road called sarn swsan it runs from caer sws points toward meivod and is distinctly traced as far as the banks of the vyrnyw near llyssin i am not able to pursue it either to or from meivod but the late dr worthington assured me that it was met with in his parish at street vawr near coed y clawdd that it crossed rhos y brithdir to pen y street and from thence to llamjwrch to caerfach which is supposed to have been a small roman camp dr worthington supposed that this road tends to chester  notwithstanding it is rather out of its place let me speak of another road in the same parish and mentioned to me by the same gentleman this seems to lead from rutunium rowton in shropshire it crosses the tanat at gartheryr from whence it passes through street y planirau to maengwynedd and winds up bwlch maen gwynedd and retains the name of ffordd gam elen or the winding road of helen dr worthingtons letter on his parish addressed to me nov   th        to return to gwynvynydd caer sws i observed on the side of the roman road a small suboval camp the road conducts us to caer sws a hamlet with a few houses on the side of the severn the adjacent fields are divided to this day from each other by lanes which intersect each other as it were to point the very places which had formed the ancient streets on the northwest sides are hollows which possibly were part of the fosses of the old precincts bricks have been found one was presented to me with letters that baffle my guess the figure of them is given for the conjecture of the more profound antiquary    as to coins i have heard of only one being met with and the owner could not ascertain to me the emperor this station is unnoticed by every roman writer  opposite to it rhos ddiarbed at some distance from the river is rhos ddiarbed or the common where no quarter was given the reason is now lost in an adjacent field is a camp of a very uncommon form at the south is a vast exploratory mount of a conic form surrounded with a fosse of a vast depth on the north part of the fosse is an oblong area about seventy yards wide in the greatest diameter guarded by a very high rampart and on the outside by a ditch in the lower part is a porta opening into a great rectangular camp about two hundred yards long and above one hundred broad opposite to the other porta is a second placed at the extremity but there are no others as usual in roman camps which this certainly was but an eccentric one prout loci qualitas aut necessitas postulaverat the whole is encompassed with a rampart and ditch in a field opposite to caer sws are some trenches perhaps relative to the camp the former i suppose to have been the winter this the summer station  from hence i returned into the road on the right opens another vale watered by the carno the mountains of carno like the mountains of gilboa were celebrated for the fall of the mighty battle of carno the fiercest battle in our annals happened in  0   amidst these hills when gryffydd ap cynan supported by rhys ap tudur prince of south wales disputed the sovereignty of north wales with trahaern ap caradoc the reigning prince followed by caradoc ap gryffydd and meilir sons of rywallon ap gwyn his cousingermains after a most bloody contest victory declared itself in favor of the first trahaern and his kinsmen disdaining flight fell on the spot and gryffydd ap cynan was put into possession of his rightful throne which he filled during fiftyseven years with great dignity  the church of carno belonged to the knights of st john of jerusalem church who are said to have had a house near it as one part of their business was the protection of their fellow creatures from violence it is very possible that they might have had a station in these parts which were long filled with a lawless banditti  in view is park the residence of  herbert esquire i have been informed that queen elizabeth kept here a stud of horses possibly the famous breed of spanish horses introduced into the country by robert earl of shrewsbury williss bangor      might render these

c     opposite to llanddinam on the summit of a high mountain is a british post called y caer vychan y caer vychan or the little fortress surrounded with a number of fosses from one to five according as the strength or weakness of the parts required  my journey was continued along a most beautiful road the vale grows narrow is bounded by lofty hills whose bottoms are in many places skirted with beautiful hanging woods those of berthlwyd are far the most considerable berthlwyd the poor remains of the ancient house of that name stand in the valley its masters were the old family of the llwyds descended from dyngad second son of tudor trevor dafydd seventeenth in descent from dungad first took the name of llwyd and probably gave the additon of title to the house it continued in the family several generations after and of late years passed by purchase to sir edward lloyd baronet  about a mile farther is llanidlos llanidlos a small town with a great market for yarn which is manufactured here into fine flannels and sent weekly by waggonloads to welsh pool the church is dedicated to st idlos within are six arches the columns surrounded with neat round pillars ending in capitals of palmleaves the inhabitants assert that they were brought from the abbey of cwm her in radnorshire a date on the roof is      which soon followed the period of monastic ruin in this kingdom  this is a country of sheepwalks the flocks like those of spain are driven to them from distant parts to feed on the summer herbage the farms in the valleys are only appendages slate for winter habitations and provisions a coarse slate is found in the neighboring hills but there still remains in many parts the ancient covering of the country shingles heart of oak split and cut into form of slates this was introduced by the saxons as the word is derived from schindel which signifies the same thing  a little beyond llanidlos the vale closes the severn here dwindles into an inconsiderable stream by wonderful instinct salmon force their way from the ocean higher up even than this distant spot for the sake of depositing their spawn the other fish are trouts samlets graylings and pike the river runs in a hollow to its source fifteen miles distant in plynlimmonis ardua moles the vast hill of plynlimmon plynlimmon i was dissuaded from making it a visit being informed that it was an uninteresting object the base most extensive the top boggy and the view over a dreary and an almost uninhabited country that part lay in the county of montgomery and part in cardiganshire and that besides the severn it gave rise to the ridal which flows to the sea near aberystwyth and the wye which precipitating from its fountains down some most romantic rocks continues its course till it falls into the severn below chepstow i was told that the road to it from cregynnan was by caer sws park and treveglws and that from the last it is necessary to get a guide to conduct the traveller over the mountains   after a most pleasing ride return to cregynnan with my good host the best shewer of a country i ever had the good fortune of meeting  on the morning i took leave of cregynnan and attended by mr blainy skirt the hilly country our ride was chiefly through narrow lanes stop to see the church of bettws bettws church seated in a bottom dedicated to st beuno and formerly belonging to the

camp called the gaer seated in the parish or rather chapelry of fordin it is of the usual rectangular form a little beyond near the house of nantcribba the seat of lord viscount hereford rises a great conoid rock a few years ago on taking away the top were discovered the remains of a little fort a small fort and on paring away the rubbish it appeared to have been square with a round tower probably at each corner one is tolerably entire and is only nine feet diameter within the walls seven feet seven inches thick there had been some small square rooms with doorcases of good freestone the rest of the building is of rough stone cemented with clay this place was probably ruined by fire for i observed some melted lead mixed with charcoal and several pieces of vitrified stuff there is no history relative to it it must be very ancient for on the top is the stool of a vast oak the base of the rock is surrounded with a ditch cut through it leaving only a narrow pass to the sort at a distance is another trench offas ditch lies about two hundred yards from the rock enter a part of shropshire at walcot and keeping southerly soon reach chirbury chirbury a church and village which give name to the hundred and title to the celebrated flower of chivalry edward lord herbert in whom madness and abilities kept equal pace this hundred did in old times belong to the castle of montgomery which was then reputed to be in it in the  th of edward vi chirbury hundred was given by the crown to edward herbert and his heirs but charles i in the  d year of his reign permitted sir edward herbert to alienate it to william neye and thomas gardener esqrs  near this village stood a priory of benedictines priory founded in the reign of king john the church was given to the priory with all the lands along the road side as far as merebroc by a composition between prior philip and the parson of montgomery the right of burials and christening was reserved to the church of chirbury the same year the prior had a grant of the tithes of montgomery wood and the mill hubert de burgh was a benefactor to this house in    0 the prior and convent removed to snede the place of their first constitution and abode it being represented that chirbury was not so proper a place for celebrating divine mysteries but this removal was not to affect the souls of those buried at chirbury to whom they were bound to do the same services as before the removal neither were the religious to lose any of their rights at chirbury halston mss   this house maintained a prior and five or six monks its revenues    l   s

annum willis ii   0 two miles farther is the town of montgomery a small neat town montgomery partly built on the slope partly on the summit of a hill beneath the shadow of a much higher it owes its foundation to baldwyn lieutenant of the marches to william the conqueror from whom the welsh called it tree faldwyn that he also built a castle here or some kind of defense is probable for we are informed that in the year  0   roger de montgomery earl of shrewsbury entered powisland and won the town and castle of baldwyn i suppose at that time possessed by the welsh roger fortified the place and called it after his own name montgomery but in  0   the welsh took the castle put the garrison to the sword and carried destruction through the neighboring parts the king william rufus assembled a vast army and repossessed himself of the low parts of the country the earl of shrewsbury rebuilt the castle which the welsh had destroyed it was again ruined but we are not informed of the period only we are told that henry iii built a new castle there in      powel   0  henry granted it to his great justiciary hubert de burgh with two hundred marks annually and a greater salary in case of war dugdale baron i      during the time it was possessed by hubert it was besieged by the welsh but speedily relieved by the english many bloody skirmishes happened about this time in the neighborhood in one of which was taken by the welsh william de breose a potent baron who was obliged to pay a considerable sum for his ransom in      llewelyn assembled a great army and so terrified hubert that he evacuated the castle which was seized and burnt by the exasperated prince powel       on an inquisition taken on the reversal of the attainder of the famous roger mortimer earl of march in      dugdale baron i      he was found to have been possessed of it at his death and also of the hundred of chirbury in which at that time the castle and manor of montgomery were reputed to lie it continued in the family at the time of the death of his grandson roger for it formed part of the jointure of his widow dugdale baron i      and probably remained in his descendant edmund who died without issue  i leave a long interval before i discover any thing more of this place lord herbert speaks of it as the habitation of some of his ancestors his life p    i suppose holding it from the crown as steward of the castle and of the hundred of chirbury  in the civil wars it was seized for the use of the parliament siege in      by sir thomas middleton in      who on the appearance of the kings army was obliged to make a sudden retreat to oswestry and leave it ill provided both with garrison and provisions the royal forces under lord biron laid siege to it but sir thomas being joined by sir william brereton sir john meldrum and sir william fairfax returned under the command of brereton with about three thousand men to the relief of the place the kings army was five thousand strong who on approach of the enemy took possession of the hill above the castle battle september   th the castle was relieved and a most bloody battle ensued the kings army descended from their post and making a most vigorous attack on the forces of the parliament at first gained considerable advantage but the last actuated by despair made the most violent efforts at length obtained a most complete victory the pursuit was continued near twenty miles above five hundred were slain and fourteen hundred taken prisoners the loss on the side of the parliament only forty slain and about sixty wounded

shrewsbury they are both in the parish of st mary shrewsbury shrewsbury my entrance into the town was through the north gate which for greater security in reality consists of two gates at a small distance from one another with a round tower on each side  the castle stands on an eminence on the left castle only one part with two rounders remain and the walls of the north and eastern sides the keep was on a large artificial mount which shows this fortress to have been of saxon or british origin notwithstanding the foundation is ascribed to the great earl of shrewsbury roger de montgomery the inside is cleared from buildings excepting one house the whole castleyard is a garden and the mount is at present admirable only for its beautiful view  the town of shrewsbury is seated within a peninsula with the ground finely sloping in most parts to the river the castle was judiciously placed on a narrow isthmus two hundred yards wide which connects it to the main land roger de montgomery founded by roger de montgomery on whom almost the whole county was bestowed by the conqueror besides a hundred and fiftyeight manors in other parts of the kingdom made this his principal seat in order to extend his fortifications he demolished fortyone houses for this part of the town at that period was very populous these houses paid taxes yet no remittance was made to the owners notwithstanding the greatness of their loss the first constable was warine the bald a man of small stature but great courage this place continued in the possession of the two sons of roger de montgomery hugh who was slain in anglesey and that monster of cruelty see dugdale baron i    robert surnamed de belesme who after various struggles was at length obliged to surrender this place his honors and all his mighty possessions into the hands of his sovereign henry i as soon as it became a royal fortress the lands and demesnes which followed it were parceled out into serjeanties for its defense thus robert the son of adam de leyton was obliged by his tenure to continue in this castle fifteen days cum una balista with one crossbow and william de wichard held the manor of cold hatton to keep ward in this castle at his own expense twenty days in time of war cum uno equo lorica capello ferreo et lancea the constables were usually men of the first note and very often it was committed to the care of the sheriff of the county after it had been dismantled in the civil wars it was granted by charles ii to francis lord viscount newport afterward earl of bradford in our times it got into the hands of pulteney earl of bath and is now in those of william pulteney esquire  the first attempt toward the walls of this town walls was made by robert de belesme who to defend it against the kings forces then marching against him drew a wall from each side of the castle across the isthmus to the waterside one is still remaining and as i have been informed terminated with a square tower both these walls are preserved in speeds plan of the place the town was not defended by walls till the year      when henry iii strongly urged the inhabitants to consider of some means of defense against an enemy at first he made them a grant of various small tolls but at length finding those insufficient was obliged to assist them but the work went on so slowly that they were not completed in less than thirtytwo years the town was paved in the next reign by the assistance of certain customs granted for that purpose  in almost every part the original walls were at a distance from the river those on

ymwithig or the delight i suppose of our princes the period in which the town arose is not certainly known but it is supposed to have been on the ruin of the roman uriconium the vreken ceaster of the saxons and the modern wroxeter a small village about four miles from hence upon the severn where may be still seen a large fragment of the ancient wall  in the time of edward the confessor in saxon times scrobbes byrig as the saxons called it was a considerable place at that period there were two hundred and fiftytwo houses and the burgesses paid yearly   l    s   d in excise whenever the king lay in the town twelve of the chief inhabitants kept watch about his person and if he came there to hunt the better sort of burgesses who kept horses rode armed as his guard and the sheriff sent thirtysix footmen for their support while the king was resident among them when the king left the town the sheriff sent twentyfour horses to lenteurde to conduct him to the first stage in staffordshire  when the sheriff went against the welsh which he had frequent occasion of doing it was customary to summon thirtysix men at marseteley park to give their service for eight days those who neglected to go forfeited forty shillings  the king had here three masters of the mint who like the other coiners of the county were obliged to pay him twenty shillings at the end of fifteen days while the money was out of the mint and while it was current the town paid in all twenty pounds yearly the king had twothirds the sheriff one as soon as the norman reign commenced it paid to its new earl forty pounds  the first charter extant for that of henry i is lost was one in      charters from richard i it confirms all its ancient customs and privileges for which the town was to pay forty marks in silver including ten for the purpose of providing a brace of hunters for the royal personage it likewise grants to the burgesses the town and all its appurtenances which had been seized by henry i on the forfeiture of earl robert king john in      enlarged their charter permitting the citizens to elect two substantial discreet persons of their body as bailiffs for the government of the town and that the common council might choose four others to determine all pleas of the crown in the corporation and to be a check on the bailiffs themselves various other charters with additional privileges were granted by succeeding princes till queen elizabeth made it a body corporate and charles i confirmed and enlarged her royal charter it now consists of a mayor twentyfour aldermen and

place is the chief mart for them about  00000 yards of welsh webs a coarse kind of woollen cloth are brought here annually to the thursday market and bought up and dressed that is the wool is raised on one side by a set of people called shearmen at this time only forty are employed but in the time of queen elizabeth the trade was so great that not fewer than six hundred andersons dict i  0  maintained themselves by this occupation the cloth is sent chiefly to america to clothe the negroes or to flanders where it is used by the peasants  flannels both coarse and fine are brought every other monday except when fairs intervene to welsh pool and are chiefly consumed in england to the amount of about   or  00000 yards the shrewsbury drapers go every market to welsh pool for the sake of this commerce  the disposition of the streets in shrewsbury is extremely irregular streets as is the case with all ancient towns not of roman origin many of the buildings are old but the modern buildings are in general scattered in various places  the free school stands near the castle in a broad handsome street free school it was founded by edward vi in      who endowed it with tithes at that time amounting to  0 l   s and empowered the bailiffs burgesses and their successors to appoint one schoolmaster and one underschoolmaster and with the consent of the bishop of lichfield to frame statutes for its government queen elizabeth added considerably to the endowments so that at present the revenues are very large the building was originally of wood but in      a beautiful and extensive edifice of stone arose in its place which contains the school houses for the masters and a library filled with a valuable collection of books and several curiosities among them are three large sepulchral stones discovered by ploughing at wroxeter  the first has on its summit a pinecone between two lions and beneath the pediment a rose the first is taken from the picea what pliny calls

by her husband placida aged fiftyfive and thirty years his wife in the next is an inscription to deuccus a boy fifteen years old son to the same person cur agente patre the third panel is a blank so it is probable as was hinted to me by a most ingenious friend that the man who had erected this monument designed to have been buried in the same place with his wife and son but dying elsewhere this panel remains unfilled  the third stone is inscribed to m petronius signifer or standard bearer to the legio quatuor decima gemina or the fourteenth double legion or a legion in which two had been

shrewsbury and his countess adelissa it was built on the site of a timber church erected by siward who exchanged it and probably the ground about it with the earl for the village of langafielda which siward at his death bequeathed to the new foundation it was peopled with benedictine monks from seez in normandy who arrived hungry and naked roger himself with the permission of his lady was shorn and became a monk of his own abbey and enriched it with the coat of st hugh of the monastery of cluni which he sometimes wore himself as a most precious relic he endowed the house largely and encouraged every body who held under him to do the same among the after endowments i smile at these good men receiving from earl hugh the tithe of all the venison in shropshire except such which

doors are of the same species of architecture most of the other parts are more modern the west window is an elegant piece of sharppointed gothic and above is a statue the tomb of the founder is preserved in the church on which is represented his figure in mail and a mantle and in the attitude of drawing his sword    in the garden is a most beautiful stone pulpit open on all sides i refer the

masters and mistresses to be taught such arts as would make them useful members of society on the decline of the capital hospital this great building became useless and is at present no more than a place of confinement for prisoners of war  beyond the quarry augustines close to the river stood the house of augustine friars leland itin iv  00 says it was founded by one of the staffords and that several persons of note slain in the battle of shrewsbury were interred here and in the church of the black friars the friars of this house lay under a very bad fame it is even said that a neighboring lane took its name from their nocturnal amors dr powel seems to think that the celebrated incubi were nothing more than mendicant friars who might encourage the notion in order to remove scandal from themselves and their religious paramours hi says the zealous annotator incubi daemones ita religiosas virgins illis diebus opprimebant ut nulla eos crucis signatio nec aqua benedicta nec ipsum

antiquity churches that of st chad was probably founded by the saxons soon after the expulsion of the welsh at the conquest it was found to be collegiate and to have a dean and ten prebendaries in      the old church was burnt down by the carelesseness of a workman the fellow seeing the mischief he had done ran home put some money in his pocket and attempting to escape was drowned in fording the

king edgar philips  0  the last by the heroine elfleda tanner      each of them had been collegiate but the church which is said to be the most ancient is that of st giles st giles seated at the skirt of the suburbs beyond the abbey it is small and only remarkable for the vast size of one side of the roof it had the honor of receiving the bones of st wenefrede before they were deposited in the shrine in the abbey it is called in doomsday book the parish of the city philips     which gives it stronger clame to antiquity than any of the others it is now annexed to the church of the holy cross or the abbey  among the more remarkable civil transactions may be reckoned the parlements held in this town the first was summoned formally by writ by the first the lords to appear on september   th      the second writ directed the commonalty of every county to choose two knights the third to the cities and boroughs the fourth to the judges at this august assembly was tried and condemned david

hundred barons were commissioned to try him drakes parl hist i     as a subject of england for he had received from edward a barony and a considerable pension he was the first who suffered the death of a traitor in the form of the sentence now in use which he underwent in its fullest extent  another parliament was held here in      it was called the great parliament on account of the number of people assembled in it here the unfortunate richard by this obsequious senate obtained a stretch of power unknown before and by a strange concession obtained that the whole power of the nation should devolve on the king twelve peers and six commoners the popes bull was thought necessary to confirm so irregular a proceeding rapin i       the military transactions relative to this place were numerous but so brief and so rapid that i shun mention of all except three battle of shrewsbury the first was the important battle on st magdalenes eve july   d   0  which is best known by the name of that of shrewsbury between henry iv and the brave henry percy surnamed hotspur it was the design of the northern insurgents to make themselves masters of this town and here to strengthen their forces by a junction with the great glyndwr and his countrymen they made rapid marches through lichfield and stafford but the active henry stimulated by the advice of the earl of dunbar a scotch nobleman then in his army advanced with a speed which saved his crown and proved the destruction of his enemies he flung himself into shrewsbury as some assert sto      at the instant that the insurgents were going to scale the walls he immediately quitted the town and encamped before the gates the high spirit of percy would not suffer him to wait till the arrival of glyndwr who was no farther distant than oswestry so that only four thousand of the welsh were able to join the northern forces percy sent that night thomas kaiton and thomas salvaigne two of his esquires with a most reproachful manifesto concluding in the romantic manner of the times with hurling defiance in his teeth we defy thee defiance thy fautoures and compliers as common traitors and destroyers of the realm and the invadours oppressors and confounders of the very true and right heirs to the crown of england which thing we entende with our hands to prove this day almighty god helpyng us halle fol xxii   the fight began early in the morning and very near to the town for the spirited percy had made his advances much sooner and nearer than the king expected the onset was made in oldfield or bulfield at a small distance beyond a little brook north of the northgate and the battle raged toward berwick carte ii      and as far as what is now called battlefield let the old historians paint the conflict in their plain but animated language  the king perceivyng that the battayll was nerer than he either thought or looked for least that long tarryinge might be a minishyng of his strength set his battayles in good order likewise did his enemies which both in puissaunce and courage were nothing to him inferior then suddenly the trumpets blewe the kings part cried st george upon them the adversaries cried esperaunce percie and so furiously the armies joined the scotts which had the forward on the lords side intending to be revenged of their old displeasures done to them by the english nation set so fiercely on the kings forward that they made them draw back and had almost broken their arraie the welshemen also which sith the kings departure out of wales had lurked and lien in wooddes mountaignes and marshes heringe of this battayl toward came to the aid of the earls and refreshed the weary people with new succors when a fearful messenger had declared to the king that his people were beaten down on every side it was no need to bid him stir for suddenly he approached with his fresh battaill and comforted hartened and encouraged his part so that they took their hearts to them and manly fought with their enemies the prince henry that day help much his father for though he were sore wounded in the face with an arowe yet he never ceased either to fight where the battaill was most strongest or to courage his men where their hearts was most danted this great battaill continued three long hours with indifferent fortune on both parts that at last the king crying saint george victory brake the arraie and entered into the battaill of his enemies and fought fiercely and adventured so far into the battaill that the earl douglas struck him down and slew sir walter blonte and three other appareled in the kings suite and clothyng saying i marvaill to see so many kings s suddenly arise again others say that the earl of dunbar withdrew the king from the place that he flood in which was a good turn for

capetain on the part adverse when his death was known the scotts fled the welshmen rann the traitors were overcome then neither wooddes let nor hills stopped the fearful hearts of them that were vanquished to fly and in that flighte the earl douglas which for have falling from the cragge of a mountaigne haghmond hill was taken and for his valiauntness of the king freely and frankely delivered on the kings part were slain xvi c persons and above v thousand on the other and as to the scotts few or none escaped alive halle fol xxii       the body of gallant percy was found among the slain and delivered to thomas nevil lord furnival to be interred but the next day the king ungenerously ordered it to be taken up placed between two millstones in shrewsbury and guarded by armed men after which he caused it to be beheaded and quartered and hung in different parts of the kingdom stew       henry after slaughtering five thousand people in his bad cause most piously returned thanks to the giver

mainguard in the marketplace and killed the captain the castle foregate was next secured and the drawbridge let down for the admittance of the horse at one in the afternoon the castle was surrendered on condition that the irish should be given up and the english march to ludlow crow was soon after hanged for his treachery or cowardice the governor and great numbers of people of rank in the county

a square tower at each corner its founder or perhaps restorer was robert burnel lelands itin viii  0  fullers br worthies shropshire    bishop of bath and wells treasurer and afterward chancellor of england who in      was sent to the marches of scotland where he was employed on no less an affair than to demand of the scots what they had to object to the clame of his master to the right and exercise of the superiority and direct dominion over their kingdom drakes parl hist i  00  0  in this office he died and was carried to be interred in his cathedral at wells he was of a very ancient family dignified with barons or knights from the time of the conquest but he had acquired great wealth which he laid out with true munificence by certain monuments with the arms of the family in the church of burnel in normandy it is supposed that they came originally from that country the castle was honored by a session of parliament in      the lords sat in the fortress the commons in a great barn the gable ends of which are still to be seen the statutum de mercatoribus enacted here is from the place known by the name of the statute of acton burnel it is probable that it was by the influence of the prelate that his habitation was so distinguished  his successor in the castle was sir edward burnel who served in many actions in scotland under edward i and appeared with great splendour he was always attended with a chariot decked with banners on which as well as on the trappings of his horses were depicted his arms he married alice daughter of lord despenser by whom he had no issue on his decease in      his sister maud became sole heir she married first john lord lovel of tichemersh surnamed the rich he died in      her second husband was john de handlow who died in      and left by her one son named nicholas lord burnel the subject of much contest in the court of chivalry with a robert de morley curious trial about a coat of arms on account of the arms which nicholas bore in right of certain lands of the barony of burnel bestowed on him by his mother these arms de morley had assumed without any just pretense but because as he declared it was his will and pleasure so to do and that he would defend his so doing probably he had no arms of his own having been the first of his family who had appeared in a military capacity he had served as esquire to sir edward burnel without any other domestic than one boy and ever since the death of his master assumed the arms in dispute it happened that they both were at the fiege of calais under edward iii in      arrayed in the same arms nicholas lord burnel challenged the arms as belonging to the burnels only he having at that time under his command a hundred men on whose banners were his proper arms sir peter corbet then in his retinue offered to combat with robert de morley in support of the right which his master had to the arms but the duel never took place probably because the king denied his assent the suit was then referred to the court of chivalry held on the sands before calais before william bohun earl of northampton high constable of england and thomas beauchamp earl of warwick earl marshal the trial lasted several days when robert apprehending that the cause would go against him took an opportunity in presence of the king to swear by gods flesh that if the arms in question were adjudged from him he never more would arm himself in the kings service on this the king out of personal regard for the signal services he had performed in those arms and considering the right of nicholas lord burnel was desirous to put an end to the contest with as little offense as possible he therefore sent the earl of lancaster and other lords to nicholas to request that he would permit robert de morley to bear the arms in dispute for the term of his life only which nicholas out of respect to the king assented to the king then directed the high constable and earl marshal to give judgment accordingly this they performed in the church of st peter near calais and their sentence was immediately proclaimed by a herald in the presence of the whole army there assembled  robert de morley was seized with his last illness in burgundy in the year    0 when the english army was on its return from the blockade of paris feeling the approach of death he directed that his banner with the arms of burnel should upon his decease be delivered to nicholas lord burnel in pursuance of the judgment before passed in the court of chivalry and accordingly his bannerbearer having in his hands the banner rolled up delivered it to lord burnel in presence of numbers of the nobility convened as witnesses of the ceremony lord burnel died in the year      and was interred in acton burnel church under an altar tomb with a brass inlaid in it of the figure of an armed man and a brass label inscribed hic jacet dominus nich burnel miles dominus de holgot qui ob   0 die jan ad      cujus animae propitietur deus amen  among the witnesses in this cause were several lords and knights and many very ancient people some of them above a hundred years of age one of a hundred and forty and one of a hundred and twenty probably of shropshire as may be collected from their names and the testimony they gave relative to the descents of the burnels and several private affairs of the family which were likely to be best known in the neighborhood of their residence this account is from a curious ms i had the pleasure of receiving from sir edward smythe   from longnor i visited caer caradoc after a

certain marbles in mostyn library brought from narbonne vol i p      no ii extracts out of a manuscript treatise of the lordships marchers in wales taken august    0 vol i p     the treatise was borrowed of thomas lloyd of overton esq  the treatise shows    how why and when the lordships marchers were first erected   how why and when they were suppressed and   how they may be known and tried at this day from other lordships that were not lordships marchers for the true knowledge and perfect understanding of the state of lordships marchers in wales the following questions are fit to be moved    when lordships marchers began in wales   how long the creating lordships marchers in wales continued   when the same was given over and why   why they were at first ordained and to what end they served   how they became lordships marchers and to have regal authority   how long they continued their force and authority from their first erection   when they were spoiled of their liberty and the same was resumed into the kings hands   why they were deprived of their regal power   how they are to be known at this day  0 why they were at first and are now called lordships marchers and how they first took the name    what difference is at this day between them and other lordships wales was the refuge to the ancient britons when they were driven by the saxons out of england and there they preserved the ancient blood royal of their kings their laws and ancient language from the fury of the saxons  there continued an implacable hatred and wars between the two nations and though the heptarchy was reduced to a monarchy by egbert king of the west saxons who first called that part england yet he and his successors received no obedience or subjection from the kings or princes of wales but they held wales as absolute monarchs and acknowledged no superior under god  here cadwallader the last king of britain of the british line and his desendants did govern the people as their lawful kings and princes all the time of the saxon government  when william the conqueror subdued england he dispossessed the saxon issue of the crown he rooted out most of their nobility and brought in his own people the normans and when he was in quiet possession of the kingdom the welsh took no notice of his conquest over the saxons but accounted of it only as a war between two strange nations  long before the conquest all wales fell to roderick the great who divided it between his three sons to cadell he gave south wales containing    cantreds to anarawd north wales of    cantreds and to mervyn powys of    cantreds  the issue of these three sons possessed wales according to the said division in the conquerors time viz rice son of theodore ruled south wales griffith ap conan north wales and blethyn ap confyn powys these three princes would never acknowledge that the conqueror had any superiority over wales and for this reason there arose cruel wars between them and they made daily incursions on each other  the kings of england often invaded the borders of wales and forced the inhabitants to fly to the mountains and the welsh at other times made diverse inroads over severn and carried great spoils out of england this so provoked them that they resolved to make a conquest of wales but the roughness of the country the hills woods and bogs was such a protection that a great army could hardly be brought to annoy them but were often forced to return home with lofss as william rufus and henry ii who entered wales three times with royal armies king john made war upon llewelin ap forwerth prince of north wales and henry iii upon llewellin ap griffith which brought great loss to themselves as well as damage to the welsh  the kings of england seeing it difficult to make a conquest of wales by a great army gave to the lords and other great men of england such countries in wales as they could win from the welshmen these are the words of diverse of their grants  by these means many were drawn to bring great armies of englishmen and normans into wales who conquered many great lordships which they held to them and their heirs for ever of the kings of england as lands purchased by conquest  the kings of england having built diverse strong towns of garrison on the frontiers of wales after the conquest such as bristow gloucester worcester salop and chester as places ready to chastise the welshmen upon all attempts the great men began to invade the countries next to those towns as namely peter corbet for cause mortimer for wigmore fitzalan for clun and oswestry walter lacy for ewyaslacy dru de baladan for abergaveny monthault for hawarden gilbert lord of monmouth for monmouth fulk fitzwarren for whittington roger le strange for elesmere and shortly after came robert fitzhamon with his twelve knights into glamorgan bernard newmarch into brecknock strongbow to dyfed or pembrokeshire martin to kemes morris de londres to cydwel and cornwallon lacy earl of lincoln to rhos and rhyvoniog now the lordship of denbigh brewis to gower buelt radnor melenith and elvel and to roger mortimer the country now called chirk then called mochnant and to cynlleth and nantheudw and others to other lordships  that the lords might the better govern the people when subdued they were suffered to take upon them such prerogative and authority as were fit for the quiet government of the country  the ancient historiographer lampridius says that the kings of england did then use the same policy with lands on the borders of scotland  no record to be found in the tower of london or elsewhere of any grant to be a lordship marcher in wales the kings writs out of the courts at westminster did not run into wales except pembrokeshire which was counted part of england and called little england beyond wales nor were there any sheriffs to execute such writs but the lords did execute laws themselves over the people which they subdued which the kings permitted for a time  no charters of these liberties could conveniently be granted for three reasons    the kings of england did not know beforehand what lands a lord should conquer or whether he should conquer any and therefore could not grant any liberties within a certain precinct or territory   the lords after their conquest of any country were not overhasty to purchase any charter because they were not sure but that those lands might be restored by composition between the kings of england and the princes of wales as they sometimes were or they might be recovered by force and the lords expelled but   the learned say that the lords marchers had no charters of such liberties because the liberties were of so high a nature so royal and so united to the crown that by the law it was not in the kings power to grant them from the crown the government by lords marchers continued in wales till the time of henry viii who perceiving the welsh to live in quietness and subjection thought they might be governed by civil laws as the english were and therefore anno    c    he resumed most of those jurisdictions into his own hands and appointed justices of peace sheriffs and other officers and divided the country into shires he governed them by the laws of england and left little or no authority to the lords marchers  the lords at their conquest of the country built castles for themselves and towns for their followers in the most fertile part and by this means the towns and castles in wales were built as may be seen in the ancient charters of those towns  pembroke tenby and haverfordwest by strongbow william de valence and the hastings being his posterity newport by martin lord of kemes cydwely by londres and augmented afterward by the duke of lancaster to whom it came by marriage  swansey oystermouth loghor radnor buelt raiadr and others by the brewises from whom they came to the mortimers and beauchamps by a female issue of brewis brecknock by bernard newmarch  blaenllyfney by herbert caerdiff and cowbridge by fitzhamon and the earls of gloucester neath by greenfield abergaveny by dru de baladan miles earl of hereford and others his posterity ruthin by lord gray denbigh by lacy earl of lincoln  some of these were towns before the conquest but being destroyed in the winning of them they were rebuilt by the lords  the lords held their lordships of the kings of england in chief as of the crown immediate by serving the king in his wars with certain numbers of men and they were bound to keep their castles with sufficient men and munition for the keeping of the kings enemies in subjection  they executed the english laws for the most part within their lordships and brought them to be of english tenure and to pass the same according to the laws of england by fine recovery feoffment and livery of seisin but such parts as they left to the ancient inhabitants to possess were by some lords suffered to be held after the old welsh custom the laws of howel dda which was to pass the same by surrender in court which they called cof ls and ystn wialen whereof the word ystynnol was derived and where that custom was permitted there is no deed to be found of any lands before the   th henry viii when wales was made shireground but for such lands as were turned to english tenures you may find deeds of two three or four hundred years past written in latin or french as was used in england in those days  the laws of england were brought in by the lords marchers because the laws of the land were unknown to the english but they suffered the ancient tenants to retain some part of the old welsh laws such as the use of gavelkind for parting lands between the brothers and the passing of lands by surrender in court and for this in many lordships there is a welsh court for the welshmen called welchrie and another for the english called englishrie in some lordships the lands were divided by gavelkind but passed by feoffments from whence comes english tenure and welsh dole in welsh cyfraith saesnig a rhancymraig and the lords had the wardship of all the brethren as if they had been sisters  the lords marchers increased in number till llewellin ap griffith the last prince of wales was slain anno    ed i who then took the principality of wales into his hands and gave it to edward ii his son and made him prince of wales since which time no more lordships marchers could be erected for the welsh in general submitted themselves to the kings of england  since the principality came to the kings of england no lord marcher could claim any liberty or prerogative more than they had before without a grant  edward i immediately held a parliament at ruthlan castle and there ordained laws and officers to govern wales after the english manner  the lordship of pows had not its original from conquest as the lordships marchers had but in this manner  griffith son of meredith ap blethyn lord of pows seeing the king of england and english lords preparing themselves to conquer wales did in discretion and policy submit himself to henry i and yielded to hold his lordship of the king of england in chief as the lords marchers did and to do the king the like service and thereupon was suffered to hold the same to him and his heirs and was created lord pows by the said henry i and made baron of the parliament of england  his descendant haws gadarn fell to be the king of englands ward by reason of the alteration of the tenure in capite who gave her in marriage to a valiant gentleman of his named john charlton and so the lordship of pows came to the possession of the english lords  mowthwy and others did the same these with the lords marchers held their lordships of the kings in chief and not of the princes of wales  the lord of pows thus submitting himself to the king of england the comots in that lordship continue whole and entire to this day and there is a court baron in every one of them but the lords marchers to reward those that assisted them in their conquests gave them diverse manors and so divided the comots into several parts and erected a court baron in each the comots were six carcinion mechan uwchcoed mechan iscoed mochnant llannerchhudol and ystradmarchell  the like may be found in the counties of anglesey caernarvon merioneth flint carmarthen and cardigan where the ancient comots remain entire without alteration and retain their ancient names and bounds and keep the same courts the reason is because they were not conquered by the lords marchers but continued in the hands of the princes of wales till llewellin the last prince was slain by edward i  it appears by ancient record that the lordship of bromefield and yale anciently called dinas bran being the chief castle of the lordship came to the possession of english lords as follows  emma daughter to lord audley and widow to griffith ap madog lord of bromefield and yale chirk nantheudw maelor and other lands parcel of ancient pows having four sons between whom their fathers inheritance was divided strife grew between her and her husbands kindred about the custody of her sons they fearing that if the sons should be brought up by the mother in england they would become english and rather incline to the king of england than to the princes of wales but the mother getting into her possession the two eldest madog and llewellin the first having to his part bromefield and yale and the other chirk and nantheubw and not being able to keep them to herself nor to remain in quiet upon her jointure she delivered her sons to edward i showing that by right they were his wards because their ancestors had formerly made their submission to the kings of england the king took them to his ward and committed madog the eldest to the care of john earl warren and llewellin to roger mortimer third son to ralph lord mortimer of wigmore the two guardians having the sons and their lands in their custody earl warren built the castle of holt in bromefield and roger mortimer the castle of chirk and placed garrisons of english in each to defend the country from the welsh and the wards dying shortly after without issue the said guardians still kept the lands and obtained grants of the king to hold the same  0th of edward i only the castle of hope and lands thereto belonging were reserved to the king in earl warrens grant the ancient rent of bromefield and yale was   0 l a year  emma being molested in her jointure because she had delivered her sons to the king and so procured the coming of those lords to build the castles of bromefield and chirk she desired the king to take maelor her jointure and to give her lands in england for it which the king did and so got into possession of maelor saesnaeg and held the same ever after not suffering any of the heirs to have it pretending that they were rebels against him  no lord marcher without a castle and a sufficient garrison to suppress such of the welsh as should annoy the kings subjects and therefore all castles had towns close to them inhabited by the english and by   henry iv c    it is enacted that castles and walled towns in wales should be possessed by valiant englishmen strangers to the seigniories  the charters of those towns give great liberty to the english but no welshman might be a burgess or purchase any land therein see   henry iv c    and  0 it was also enacted that no welshman should have any castle or fortress saving such as was in the time of edward i except bishops and temporal lords  the more to encourage the english to conquer wales the kings of england created them peers of the realm by the name of lords baron of the places they conquered their number once was twentyone but now are reduced to one viz abergaveny who is the first lord baron of england the rest lost their name and place by coming either to the crown or to lords who had other places and titles in parliament the castles in wales were about      the welsh submitted to henry vii because he was paternally descended from their princes and his son henry viii made several statutes for the future government of them anno     lords marchers seized on the goods of their tenants who died intestate  all the lordships marchers have lost their ancient jurisdictions and authorities which were the common signs whereby they were known so that it is now a doubt which were such lordships but they may still be known by several tokens    there can be no lordship marcher but such as was subdued before the death of prince llewellin   such lordship must be held of the king in chief and not of the principality of wales   it must have been in ancient time the inheritance of some english lord   if any suit arose about the title it was to be pleaded at common law in westminster hall and there were fines levied of those lordships and none other in wales   the escheator of the marches of wales did in ancient time inquire of the tenure and find office post mortem of the lord and that by writ out of the chancery of england and as those lordships were not in any shire in england and the king had no escheators to enquire of the tenure of them the same was laid on the escheator of the next english shire and such escheators had the charge care and survey of all lordships marches that were holden of the king and such escheator was to go into any lordship marcher in wales and swear an inquest and find an office after the death of the lord and inquire of the tenure and value of the lordship  n b all offices of other manors that were holden of the king as of his principality were found by virtue of writs out of the kings exchequer of caernarvon or chester for north wales and carmarthen or cardigan for south wales and out of pembroke for lands in that earldom   these lords by stat    henry viii c   have the penalty for killing of wainlings and for nonappearance at their courts and by stat    henry viii c   and    c    they have the forfeiture of common mainprize recognizances mizes power to keep courtbarons and courtleets and to have waifs strays infangthefe outfangthefe treasuretrove deodands goods and chattels of felons persons condemned and outlawed and also wreck de mere wharfage and custom of strangers from the river tifi in south wales to the river conwy in north wales there was no lordship marcher but all that country remained wholly to the princes of wales until the principality came to the crown by prince llewellins death  as the river severn was the ancient limit between wales and england a doubt has arisen why all the land that is over that river viz all herefordshire and so much as is part of gloucestershire worcestershire and shropshire had not been lordships marchers as the rest of wales was that was won since the conquest  the reason is this all herefordshire and those parts of the other counties were won from the welsh in or shortly after the time of offa king of mercia the welsh were expelled thence the country was new planted with englishmen and this was long before the dividing of england into shires the same was annexed to the kingdom of mercia and so as part of that kingdom it came to the hands of king alfred who first divided england into shires he finding those countries subdued and the welsh expelled divided them with the rest on the other side severn he added part to gloucestershire part to worcestershire and part to shropshire and made herefordshire a shire of itself  here lies the difference between conquering of wales by the saxons and the normans  so much of wales as the saxon kings won they did it at their own charge and for their own use and did not suffer their subjects to deal therein but the norman conqueror contenting himself with the realm of england did not bend his forces against wales more than he was forced to do by their invading of his people and country and he and his successors thought it better policy to give to the nobility such parts of wales as they could conquer  herefordshire was not won since the conquest appears from the lordship of urchinfield which is ancient demesnelands such as is not to be found in england but what was in the possession of its kings before the conquest see silas tailor of urchinfield in his history of gavelkind p  0  and humphrey lhwyd in his fragment of the description of wales his latin book p    first edition

thereby got possession of the principality of wales being at aberconwy and fearing that there would be a scarcity of victuals wrote to the officers of all the good towns and countries in south wales

april      giving an account of the discontents in france in the beginning of the reign of louis xiii my humble duty premised  our ambassador being returned to england and my acquaintance in paris retired with him i am uncertayn where to dyrect my lres that i may be assured they may come to hand  this state of france is in division with ytselfe for certain of the princes are discontentedly retired to their governments where they fortify themselves in the strongest cytties those of them who want place of importance in their own country join with the rest to make good the hold they find fit to make resistance and so many are joined together in champaigne being the government of the duke of nevers who also is one of the number but the chief of all is the prince of conde with whom also is the duke of vendosme bastard son to the late king of france who not long since was committed to prison but finding that opportunite to shift him self into the habit of a scullion he escaped and put himself into the company of the malcontents being in number about six or   dukes besides others assembled together upon there guard in the cytty of misiers and cedan upon the borders of the low countries being frontyre towns of champaign whence the prince of conde writ to the king and queen showing the cause of his retyrednes so far as touched himself being as he said out of the care he had of the king and kingdom to reform the one and give contentment to the other which could not be don without the assembly of the states which he earnestly desired principally to abridge the extreme taxations of the subjects to purge the kingdom of the unnecessarie offices who served to no other use than to impoverish the people and withal to forbear to proceed in the marriadge between france and spayn untyll the assembly of the estates wear dissolved least any thing should be concluded to the pjudice of those of the reformed religion the lre was well written and carried with yt a show of great good to the common wealth but the people are so fearful of the name of civil war that very few stir of the part of the princes it is very true that the prince of conde was drawn into the number by some other of the dukes and not out of any just cause that he has of discontent more then for the love of some of them who he wod protect  there is watch and ward in all towns and good order for provision of arms whereof there is no want in these parts  the queen makes great preparation to go to meet the king of spayn to conclude the marriage notwithstanding the distaste the princes have of that proceedinge  the report hear is that the princes will submit themselves to the kings mercy and will offer themselves to attend the king to his marriage but how that will prove is uncertain for they fortify themselves daily and while they speak of peace they prepare for war but that which will turn to there mischife is the want of money which all know otherwise they are well seated to do the king a shrewd turn these sturrs in france causes the kingdom to be more difficult for travail and makes many strangers remove to other countries myself among the rest am resolved of my remove with as much speed as i may to savoy and so to piemont and to see some part of lombardie before the extreamitie of the heat i have continued here in burbonnoise to exercise myself to ride whereto i have applied myself among the bestnatured people of the world god contynewe you your health and make my return as happy as you desire  i rest your obedient son john win  st aprilis      his next lre is dated    april      from marseilles and directed to his father my humble duty remembered  sythence the writing of my last i removed from the place where i was to lions being  0 leagues of burbonnoise before i set forth i ridd to the bath which is   leagues distant from moulins as well to see the castle as other remarkable things which are well worthy a strangers observion the governor of the country sent expressly to cause all things to be showed me being arrived i bestowed that nyht to see the new work which the last king caused to be built near the spring but that which was wonderful was   enclosed places within the bath the waters whereof is so extreme hot that there is not any that care adventure to go bath himself within though the weather be never so could for experience whereof the last great frost a young maid goinge to take up water her feet slipped because of the ice and falling into the water was taken up dead being boiled by reason of the extroardinarie heat of the spring the next morninge i saw the castle of bourbon which is extroardinarie well seated for strength and adorned within with a very fair chapel being on of the rarest pieces of work of france within which there is a piece of the very true cross of our savior if we may give credit to them that have the keepinge thereof which was brought from jerusalem by st clovis king of france with on of the thorns of the crown of our savior which marvilouslie does flowr upon the passion day between nine and ten of the clock and after  0 does vanish away i wod upon that day have gone to see yt but i found all men at there devotion so that non wod travail that day i doubt nothing of the omnipotency of the almighty who has made all things of nothing but i make question of many superstitious observations of these papists who have often belyed god attributinge to reliks more then to god this thorn is enclosed in crystal within the same that the cross is being all set in gould with works of imagerie contayninge the passion of our savior which the houldinge in your hand the bud appears at that time of the day upon good friday remains on flowr and so vanishes  from thence to lions where i continued a week and so by water i voyaged to avignon which is belonging to the pope where entering into the town i was demanded by the guard at the gate whence i was and of what religion where havinge related all things according to there demand i was let pass toward my lodginge being somewhat melancholic because i supposed that i shod not have that liberty to see all places in that town as i desired but havinge encountered with a french lord of that country of whom i inquired whether i might freely see all places in town who used me with that extroardinarie kindness that being invited to supper that night he speak of me to the cardinal being vicelegat and the next morninge brought me to the cardinal who was returned from mass having a hundred gentlemen well appointed who in rank went before him by three and by three until the pallaisie my self coming by with that lord i was saluted by the legate and honorably entertained with many good words tellinge me that yt was not lawful for those of our religion to remain above three days but for me i might stay as long as i wod  with many other circumstances of love and courtesy enjoyninge that id to show me all places in town and principally to conduct me to see a company at a gentlemans house who wear ready to mask and dance in honor of a babtisme whereunto the cardinals brother was entreated as godfather in end being after dinner at the church to see the manner of yt though i had before seen the like behold a great number of violence and musitiens came marching before the godfather who brought the child upon his arm according to the french manner to the church and then the ladies and gentlewomen accompanyinge the godmother entered and so they went to the ceremony my self went among the rest and stood by to hear and see what they did which some gentlemen perceivinge who had taken notice of me in the morninge demanded of me how i liked of the ceremony i said well and whether there wear great difference between the english manner and that of france for the babtisme i answered for that i had seen that they differed from us i was further pressed by those gent whether yt pleased me to see the manner of yt or not i said yea but that i cod not enter for the press then the gent made me place and brought me close to the place where in interpretinge unto me the manner of all circumstances he was louder than the curit who babtized the child when all was done the godfather kissed the godmother openly in the church the company being many that came about me seeing i was a stranger to hear what the other gent and i discoursed of i was asked by the parent of the child in what sort we differed in england from the manner of france in babtisme i answered that our children wear not so well fed before they received babtisme as this child was the gent fell all to a laughter for indeed the child was so old that he was almost ready to go and had such a broad face that all the company were made merry with the mouths the child made at the priest duringe the time he was using his office the gent told me that yt was the manner in these countries also to christen them when they wear   or   days old but for this the godfather being in italy they wear constrained to stay till his return after the babtisme i was offered all the courtesy that i could desire and so i went to aix being the parliment of provence and from thence to marselles where i now am from hence to nezi being the duke of savoys country and from thence to genua and thence to lucca and so to florence which is  00 miles hence where i shall not have so much money as will conduct me further but only what will maintayn me until i receive money from england which i humbly entreat you to use means to send me my michaelmas rent have patience with me if i continewe a little longer then you wod i do yt for my experience which i wod gain if i may as well as others but without time a man can do but what he can i hope you would not that i should be less sufficient then other gent who seek out there experience by the same means that i do i hope that yt shall not repent you anythinge of the course i have taken no more then yt does

account of sir richard bulkeley in which is a strong description of the tyranny of the favorite earl of leicester sir richd bulkeley served in parlt for the county of anglesey the  d and  d sessions of q mary the  d of eliz and  st of james  he was of goodly person fair of complexion and tall of stature he was temperate in his diet not drinking of healths in his habit he never changed his fashion but always wore round breeches and thick bumbast doublets though very gallant and rich in the last year of queen eliz being then somewhat stricken in years he attended the counsil of marches at ludlow in wintertime when the lord president zouch went in his coach to church or elsewhere sir richard used to ride on a great stone horse and some time he wod go from his lodging to church in frost and snow on foot with a short cloak silk stockings a great rapier and dagger tarry all prayers and sermon in very cold weather insomuch yr ld zouch was wont to say he was cold to see him  he was a great reader of history and discourses of all estates and countries of very good memory and understanding in matters belonging to housekeeping husbandry maritime affairs building of ships and maintaining them at sea he drew his own letters and answered all letters with his own hand and being complained of at the counsil of the marches for breach of an order of that court he drew his own answer  that he cod not be evicted out of his possession but by course of common law  pleaded magna charta  and demanded judgment which answer being put into court the chief justice sir richard shuttleworth called for a sight thereof and after perusal said to the counselors at the bar look my masters what a bone sr richd bulkeley has cast into the court for you to tire upon and the matter being argued it was referred to the comon law  he was a great housekeeper and entertainer of strangers especially such as passed to or from ireland he nobly entertained the earl of essex in his way there to be lord lieutent he made provision of all necessaries for his table beforehand he sent yearly two ships to greenland for cod ling and other fish which he did use to barter in spain for malaga and sherrie wines and always kept a good stock of old sack in his cellar which he called amabile besides other wines he kept two parks well stored with red and fallow deer which did afford such plenty of venison as furnished his table   or   times every week in the season besides pleasuring of friends he kept several farms besides his demesne in his hands which furnished his house with fat beef mutton lamb etc etc he was an excellent horseman and an expert tilter keeping two great stables of horses one in cheshire and another in beaumaris and a great studd of mares his estate in anglesey was l   00 in carnarvonshire l  00 and in cheshire l  000 a year having always a great stock of ready money lying in his chest he kept many servants and attendants tall and proper men two lacqueys in livery always ran by his horse he never went from home without  0 or    to attend him he was a great favorite of queen eliz he had powerful friends at court and had the gentry and commonalty of the county of anglesey at his service except the woods of rhosmore who were always his ennemies  he had great contests with dudley earl of leicester who obtained the queens letters patents under the great seal to be chief ranger of the forest of snowdon in which office he behaved very injuriously to the counties of merioneth carnarvon and anglesey attempting to bring within the bounds and limits of that forest most of the freeholders lands in those   counties and for that purpose the earl procured several commissions from the queen to inquire of encroachments and concealments of lands the return of the jury in anglesey not being agreeable to the earls commissioners they went in a rage to carnarvon forcibly entered the exchequer there ransacked the records and carried away what they pleased but the earl after making many attempts to the great grievance of the country was obliged to desist being defeated in all schemes upon snowdon by the power and interest and spirit of sir richd bulkeley but manet alta mente repostum the earl bore a poisonous hatred to sir richd yet he continued still in favor with the queen and counsel though often molested by the earl his agents and creatures  sr richard being one of the deputy lewtenants of anglesey upon intelligence of the spanish armadas threatening england was to cesse the country in arms and cessing mr woods of rhosmore he was highly offended and thought himself too heavily laden therefore went up to court to the earl of leicester carrying a false tale with him that sir richard bulkeley a little before the attainder and execution of those salusbury one of the accomplices of anthy babington the traitor      had been in the mountains of snowdon conferring with him and that at a farm of sir richards called cwmligie they had layne together two or   nights the earl glad of this information presently acquaints the queen and council therewith sir richard being called before the council and examined absolutely denied the whole matter and when the earl at yt time president of the queens counsil did severely enforce it agt him he told the earl to his face your father and the very same men as now inform against me were like to undo my father for upon the death of k edw   by letters from your father he was commanded to proclayme queen jane and to muster the country which he did accordingly and had not my mother been one of queen marys maids of honor he had come to great trouble and danger hearing these words the counsil hushed and rose and sir richard departed the earl hastened to the queen and told her the counsil had been examining sir richard bulkeley about matters of treason that they found him a dangerous person and saw cause to commit him to the tower and that he dwellt in a suspicious corner of the world what sir richard bulkeley said the queen he never intended us any harm we have brought him up from a boy and have had special trial of his fidelity you shall not commit him we said the earl have the care of your majestys person see more and hear more of the man than you do he is of an aspiring mind and lives in a remote place before god replied the queen we will be sworn upon the holy evangelists he never intended us any harm and so ran to the bible and kissed it saying you shall not comitt him we have brought him up from a boy then the lords of the counsill wrote a letter to dr hugh bellot lord bishop of bangor to examine the truth of the accusation laid to sir richards charge which the bishop found false and forged and so certifyed to the counsil whereupon he was cleared to the queens majestys great content to the abundant joy of his country and to his own great credit and reputation and afterward diverse of the lords of the council wrote letters to the justices of assize of north wales to publish sir richards wrongs and to notify to the queens subjects his clear innocence  but that sir richard might not rest in peace one green belonging to the earl of leicester in the name of

good thereby  i pray you sir by lent next when your son is capable of a place let there be some order taken that the money you are willing to disburse for his place be at london in some readiness for

match with john fourth son of robert owen of bodsilin in anglesea this gentleman who was father of sir john had been secretary to the great walsingham and made a fortune of ten thousand pounds a sum

worthy and respectable family of the shakerlies who settled there soon after the restoration they were originally of cheshire but removed to this place almost immediately on the return of the royal family colonel afterward sir jeffry shakerly was a distinguished loyalist and had the command of a regiment of horse under charles i during his service he contracted a great frindship with colone robinson owner of the upper gwersilt which induced him soon after the year    0 to purchase this estate from captain sutton an old cavalier descended from tudor trevor and ruined in the royal cause this the colonel did not only to replace a considerable estate he had been obliged to sell in kent in support of the cause but to be near his friend and fellowsoldier no mention is made of him in any of the histories of our civil commotions notwithstanding he was engagd in most of the actions of any note the following account of what preceded the battle of rowtonheath near chester is extremely curious and merits preservation which i deliver in the manner i received it by the favor of his grandson peter shakerley esquire  the heath upon which sir marmaduke langdale was drawn up carries the name of rowton heath a mile beyond which in the london road from chester is another heath called hatton heath the order which sir marmaduke had received from the king was only to beat poyntz back sir marmaduke performed the same effectually for having marched his men over holt bridge undiscovered by the enemy who had taken the outworks and suburbs of the city on the east side thereof and poyntz coming in a marching posture along the narrow lane between hatton heath and rowton heath sir marmaduke having lined the hedges fell upon him and killed a great many of his men and having so done ordered colonel shakerley who was best acquainted with that country to get the next way he could to the king who lodged then at sir francis gamulls house in chester and acquaint him that he had obeyed his orders in beating poyntz back and to know his majestys further pleasure the colonel executed his orders with better speed than could have been expected for he gallopped directly to the river dee under huntingdon house got a wooden tub used for slaughtering of swine and a battingstaff used for batting of coarse linen for an oar put a servant into the tub with him and in this desperate manner swam over the river his horse swimming by him for the banks were there very steep and the river very deep ordered his servant to stay there with the tub for his return and was with the king in little more than a quarter of an hour after he had left sir marmaduke and acquainted the king that if his majesty pleased to command further orders to sir marmaduke he would engage to deliver them in a quarter of an hour and told the king of the expeditious method he had taken which saved him the going nine or ten miles about by holt bridge for the boats at eaton were then made useless but such delays were used by some about the king that no orders were sent nor any sally made out of the city by the kings party till past three oclock afternoon which was full six hours after poyniz had been beaten back and so poyntz having all that time for his men to recover the fright they had been put into in the morning poyntz rallied his forces and with the help of the parliament forces who came out of the suburbs of the city to his assistance upon whom the kings party in the city might then successfully have fallen put all those of the kings to the rout which was the loss of the kings horse and of his design to join montross in scotland who was then understood to be in a good condition  this is what my father the said colonel shakerley afterward sir geffrey shakerley has often declared in my hearing and since no mention is made of him in all this history though he faithfully served the king in all the wars was personally engaged in almost all the field battles for the king sold part of his estate to support that service and was for many years sequestered of all the rest i thought it my duty as his eldest son and heir to do that justice to his memory to insert this here under my hand

their town of a fishery to the monks of valle crucis for want of a seal of their own they affixed to their grant that of madoc the founder of the abbey the monks erected new works on the river for the purpose of taking the fish this caused a dispute between them and the freemen the last referred it to the abbot and five monks of their own choice who were to adjust the matter on oath madoc and his secretary john parvus appointed a day for the purpose the assembly was held the oath solemnly administered and the abbot and monks made the decision in their own favor they alleged that they had bought the right of erecting what works they pleased and of repairing of them from the heirs of llangollen the prince confirmed the decree and the donation of the fishery by an instrument dated in
