an account of the epidemical sorethroat with the method of treatment illustrated by cases and observations  by g levison m d physician to the general medical asylum  london printed for b white fleetstree j bew no    paternosterrow and w sharp in the strand opposite somerset house       preface the putrid sorethroat has so long continued in this nation almost every year with a new train of symptoms as the celebrated dr fothergill foresaw it is probable says that great practitioner in his account on the sorethroat that this kind of sorethroat may continue amongst us for the future breaking out with more or less severity as season situation and other circumstances may concur and in another place he says it may also be necessary to observe that the disease is described as it appeared in      and      that if the symptoms should hereafter vary in any circumstance the diversity may be attributed to the nature of the disease and not imputed to design or inattention a description therefore of this raging disease can never be thought useless especially as the symptoms seem to differ in some respect from the former  i am conscious that an accurate description of diseases and their method of treatment requires both great abilities and great practice neither of which i am able to boast but as i have had in this disease frequent opportunities of making various observations as a great many came under my inspection i think it neither presumption nor arrogance to lay them along with the history of the diseases before the public perhaps it may excite men of greater sagacity and practice to give the world their more precise and more learned observations and then i shall not think my labor ineffectual or unrewarded  lately published by the author an essay on the blood the spirit and union of the natural moral and divine law a dissertation on the law and sciences sold by w sharp in the strand opposite somerset house  an account etc about the   th of july a sorethroat of the malignant kind nearly such as described by dr fothergill and dr huxham only without the efflorescence and attended with costiveness made its appearance among children from three to seven years of age by which many were cut off in the space of six or eight days some by suffocation and others by vomiting of blood at the same time a complaint of a roughness in the throat most probably arising from a deprivation of its mucus prevailed among adults without the least appearance of ulceration or malignancy which however in a few days yielded to an external application of the volatile liniment or camphorated oil  about the beginning of august the same sorethroat extended its baleful influence more generally chiefly attacking children from three to ten years of age and also a few adults of a lax and ill habit of body in some it was very malignant joined with an erysipelatose inflammation and a diarrhea the degree of malignancy however seemed to have been more adapted to the situation than to the constitution of the patients insomuch that the disease was very fierce in low marshy and confined and extremely benign in high and open places thus in hampstead and highgate it was very slight whereas in kentishtown it raged with great fury and in endfieldchace it swept away many in the space of twentyfour hours  the disease was not uniform but seemed to have been of two kinds in some there appeared only a superficial whiteness on the uvula tonsils and velum palatinum whilst in others those parts were beset with thick ulcerations running very deep in the fauces so as to be almost invisible in both species however about the second or third d y hard swellings appeared externally on each side the neck almost meeting together upon the throat which occasioned a stiffness of the neck lasting in some for a month  though the attack of the disease was different in different persons yet most of them were taken with a nausea and shiverings succeeded by heat and an efflorescence over the breast and extremities and often the whole body was of a crimson red some were spread over with a kind of little millets similar to that in the miliary fever and which scaled off the skin the sixth or seventh day in which cases the ulcerations were very slight as also all other symptoms of malignancy in all the different kinds of the efflorescence most of the patients complained of a violent itching and had a dry and hot skin the pulse was commonly small quick and sometimes fluttering and unequal the mouth full of sloughs the teeth black and covered with a crust the tongue white sometimes a little furred but frequently beset with blisters the lips parched the tonsils and uvula were often so much enlarged that every thing attempted to be swallowed was ejected by the nose the urine was commonly discharged in small quantities high colored and a thin cloud suspended in its middle some discharged a small quantity of blood for a few days out of the nose the nose was stuffed up with a greenish sanies which dropped out continually and seemed not to be of an excoriating nature but rather to occasion only a slight titillation as a constant picking of the nose was observable in all those cases some were costive whilst others were afflicted with a species of an autumnal dysentry as their stools appeared knotty such as described by my ingenious and sagacious friend dr wilson in his treatise on the autumnal dysentry the purging and efflorescence however did not seem to correspond with one another for first the disappearance of the one seldom aggravated the other secondly they were often concomitant thirdly sometimes a costiveness attended though there was not any efflorescence nor did the efflorescence appear to be a critical discharge as is the case in eruptive diseases of the malignant kind for the efflorescence and the sorethroat were often met with separately a cough attended in most throughout the whole disease probably occasioned by the irritation of the larynx great depression of strength dejection of spirits a total inactivity a delirium a pulse that beat   0 or     in a minute and a great disponae were fatal omens  it was remarkable that though most of the young patients had a great aversion to all manner of food yet they seemed not unwilling to take medicines which made me imagine that immediate relief was found from it  the disease had neither an apparent crisis nor any regular progress for all the symptoms often vanished of a sudden about the eighth or ninth day whilst at other times they were at a stand for about    days but frequently they diminished or increased from the  0th to the   th or   th day when either a total recovery was seen excepting the external swelling which lasted often for weeks or the scene of life was closed the patient suffocating or expiring in a lingering way in one case only which i shall mention hereafter i beheld all the malignant symptoms in the highest degree the patient laboring under them for three weeks and at last recovered  an oedematous swelling after the absence of all the fatal symptoms and when nothing but an entire recovery was expected appeared to be very frequent in children of an ill habit of body the lips nose and face were bloated sallow shining and greasy as it were which swelling spread itself sometimes over one side and at others over the whole body especially the abdomen the swelling i have observed to increase always in the morning and to abate toward evening dr huxham in his dissertation on the malignant ulcerous sorethroat has observed the same but only before the fatal period not after a total recovery nor does he take notice of that particular circumstance concerning its increase and abatement different from all other dropsical swellings however some have been carried off by it a month after the first invasion of the disease whilst many recovered by the use of proper cathartics and full doses of the bark  this disease was sometimes mistaken for the measles not only because the cough being an idiopatic symptom of the same but because the efflorescence in the benign kind was so very similar to those of the measles and which were also epidemical the latter end of august great mischief would have been done in treating it according to the mistake with expectorants opiates and antiphlogistics but the very aspect of the throat even in the benign kind the external swellings and the cough itself so different from that of the measles where it is much stronger and deeper if i am allowed this expression could soon detect the error though i had often occasion to think that some patients were attacked with both diseases at once and then i have treated them accordingly  if we consider that in this epidemic the efflorescence appeared often independent of the angina and was similar to the miliary or scarlet fever that further no great connection has been observed between the diarrhoea and the efflorescence and the disappearance of the latter did not always aggravate the former moreover that often a constipation accompanied the whole disease notwithstanding the absence of the efflorescence again that both the angina and the erysepelatose inflammation often appeared separately and that the stools were similar to those of the autumnal dysentry i say considering all these circumstances it seems as if the efflorescence were not always a critical discharge as is the case in most putrid diseases of the pustular kind but that the genuine and principal disease was the epidemic sorethroat which began early in summer and consequently to speak in the language of sydenham was either an early autumnal or a late vernal epidemic to which in autumn two other epidemics namely either the scarlet or miliary fever and a purging like the autumnal dysentry were joined the first and genuine epidemic namely the sorethroat being at the same time predominant as often observed by the great sydenham and though that great observer attributed epidemics to the occult and not to the sensible qualities of the air yet latter observers favor the contrary opinion as it appears from the writings of dr shaw arbuthnot on air dr hales statical experiments dr huxham de aere et morb epid and others and it is very probable that the present arose from the frequent showers and stormy winds which continued the greatest part of june and july though often with easterly winds yet the sun piercing through the clouds in the intervals of the showers might have much contributed to the epidemic in question warning the floating vapors and producing a change in the constitution of the air which when bred in has in adults only affected the mucus membrane of the throat and occasioned there a roughness whereas in childen and those of a laxhabit it has introduced its malignancy deeper and brought on putrid ulceration the sultry and warm autumn then approaching has roused again as it were the lurking epidemic which then spread itself more general and more malignant joined with two autumnal epidemics these however are only probable conjectures which i shall quit and return to the method of treating the disease  as the principal disease was of the malignant kind antisceptics the king of which the bark may justly be called were the first indications a vomit has sometimes cut the disease short and which in the first onset of the disease ought never to be omitted as it rouses the nervous system and the principles of life the energy of which it so much depends upon in the removal of putrid diseases and as it clears the stomach of its crudities for the powers of digestion are always impaired in putrid attacks especially in the present case where most probably the oesophagus and perhaps the stomach itself were affected however as most commonly physical assistance was sought for some days after the invasion emetics could not always have been administered with safety especially when the fauces were much ulcerated the admission of free and pure air was highly recommended as many patients panted for the free air and which i never found doing any harm insomuch that three children afflicted with the disease came to me every other day at the asylum which cases i shall mention hereafter the room in which the patient lay was frequently sprinkled with vinegar a gargle or rather an injection in the throat was administered of a strong decoction of the bark and the tincture of myrrh with which also the mouth was continually washed internally the bark was given sometimes with the spirit of minderery and at others with the cardiac confection according to the degree of the fever the camphorated oil or the volatile leniment was applied to disperse the external swellings for as they seemed to be of a malignant nature it was not advisable to invite by poulticing them more humors thither for fear of converting a greater quantity of matter into a malignant nature and consequently increasing the disease nor did blisters seem to have been of any efficacy in either lessening the degree of the malignancy or the size of the swellings though in compliance with common practice they were sometimes ordered when they occasioned a great discharge of a thick matter but without the least relief to the patient bleeding and antiphlogistics were seldom requisite and those who have been treated in the strict cold regimen were only protracted in their misery in cases of costiveness i ordered for the patient to eat prunes boiled with sena and a little of the powder of ginger in it as they served also for nourishment especially as there was an aversion to all manner of food where a purging attened it was moderated by cordials and often only by the bark with the addition of the confect card or a few drops of the tinct thebaic and which relieved the patient often by bringing on a gentle diaphorasis to promote which plenty of warm and diluting liquors were also recommended  the oedematous swelling that appeared in many eight days after a total recovery was best removed by repeated doses of calomel and rhubarb and full doses of the bark and as far as i have been able to observe that dreadful symptom seldom happened where proper cathartics were administered after the disease to carry off the remainder of the putrid colluvies lodging in the intestinal tube  as in many cases the young patients could not be prevailed upon to take medicines a foot bath of bran and sometimes cataplasms of horseradish and mustard were ordered with success both in promoting by their stimulus the energy of the nerves and in bringing on a revulsion and indeed as in germany such methods are too frequently used so are they here too much neglected that applications to the lower region have a great influence upon the upper parts of the system is evident from the following simple experiment i felt often a coughing and a dispon coming on suddenly upon holding may feet in cold water which shows the great sympathy between the nerves of the feet and those of the lung diaphragm and of the trachi so that cold applied to the feet will irritate the nerves of the lungs etc upon the same principle any stimulus applied to the feet will rouse the nerves of the upper region and give them energy such remote applications must even have a better effect than when the stimulus is applied immediately to the affected parts or near them for it may often bring on alarming symptoms by increasing the weakness of the already debilitated and tender parts as i have seen putrefactions take place where the blister was when applied near the affected part and which putrefaction made so rapid a progress that it was not in the power of art to stop it remote applications therefore such as cataplasms and semicupiums are certainly more salutary and less dangerous not to mention the inconvenience arising from blisters when the cantharides are absorbed in a system that has a tendency to putrefaction even in deliriums applications to the feet such as mentioned above are preferable to either blisters or opiates for the former may often increase the delirium by increasing its cause debility as observed before and the latter may aggravate the disease by diminishing the sensibility and consequently the energy of the nerves so requisite to counteract all putrid diasthasis the semicupium is frequently used in germany in the beginning of eruptive diseases especially in the smallpox where it often relieves the nobler parts from their fatal invasion dr wilson assured me that he always orders it and never found any dangerous consequence of a paralyses as has been insinuated by some but as the disease in question is somewhat similar to the smallpox might not the semicupium be of the same use  case i a young lady of a delicate habit of body about six years old was taken september the   d      with all the symptoms at once a nausea great fainting and an efflorescence all over the body much like little mellets a difficulty of swallowing stiffness of the neck and costiveness under which symptoms she labored three days on the fourth i saw her and found a small ulceration on the uvula and tonsils with a large swelling of each side the throat her pulse was   0 the skin dry and hot the urine high colored and a cloud suspended in it no sanies discharge of the nose though she picked it continually the palate much inflamed and the tongue white i ordered a vomit blistered the top of the neck recommended the admission of free air and the bark was ministered with the addition of   drops of the theb tinct in the night draught there was neither a disponoe nor the usual croaking noise the volatile liniment was applied to the swellings and the mouth was continually washed with a decoction of the bark and tinct of myrrh the symptoms began to subside daily and the ninth day she was quite recovered only that a stiffness in the neck remained the efflorescence also remaining till the fourteenth day when it began to scale off i have seen many other cases in which either the efflorescence or swelling last for near a month after all the other symptoms in some there was a hoarseness remaining for months the efflorescence therefore does not seem to be a critical discharge as is the case in putrid disorders of the pustular kind  case ii merryman a girl about seven years of age was taken october   th with a nausea vomiting and a diarrhoea the second day the sickness abated but a purging of knotty stools still remained a swelling appeared on both sides the neck which almost met together upon the throat her pulse was     there was a discharge of a sanies matter through the nose the mouth full of slime and slough the teeth very black the tongue furred she picked her nose constantly and the uvula and tonsils were so much enlarged that every thing taken in the mouth could hardly be swallowed but was ejected by the nose here the great use of medicines was so obvious insomuch that whenever the child could not be prevailed on to take them all the symptoms grew worse yet as soon as the medicines mentioned in case i were taken an amazing change followed as i saw the child in this state of alternate relapse and recovery for fifteen days i would not trust any longer to her whims but ordered glysters which her mother would not give her i had then refuge to semicupiums and cataplasms by which means all the symptoms gradually abated and though that child seemed to recover in a lingering way yet in the beginning of november she was so much better that she condescended to take the bark and which in a few days restored her entirely  case iii october the  th i was called to see two sisters the one eight and the other nine years of age both had the confluent smallpox six months before they were so malignant in the youngest that the apothecary then attending despaired of her recovery which proves that her constitution was much disposed to putridity however both were seized with nausea shivering succeeded by heat great depression of strength and inactivity they were in a comatose state the throat was ulcerated but the ulceration was so deep in the fauces as to be hardly perceptible the tongue was full of blisters white and a little furred the lips black and parched the teeth very black an efflorescence all over the body great swelling on each side the neck and a purging of knotty stools attended the pulse of the youngest beat   0 in a minute and that of the eldest   0 and in general all the symptoms were more violent in the youngest i ordered a vomit the cortex with the confect card to be taken internally the mouth to be washed and the throat to be syringed with a decoction of the bark and the tinct of myrrh and a blister was laid on the back the symptoms were at a stand till the twelfth day when after the blisters had discharged plenty of a thick matter a mortification came on on the place were the blister laid and which carried the youngest off in three days in spite of all antisceptics that were administered to stop it as she was really putrified for blisters were tried a few days before the mortification came on different parts which did not draw at all the eldest however mended gradually and was entirely recovered the   th went abroad eat and drank hearty but to my greatest surprise the   th her nose and lips began to be bloated and of a greasy look an oedematous swelling spread itself over her right side and abdomen which increased remarkably toward morning repeated doses of calomel and rhubarb were administered and the bark in full doses the swellings seemed to abate the third day after its invasion but the fourth and fifth day the child could not swallow at all and convulsive fits the last struggle of life closed the miserable scene on the   th of october  case iv october the  0th i was called to see a girl about three years of age i looked in her throat and found it slightly ulcerated her pulse beat   0 in a minute she was attacked with nausea and shiverings succeeded by heat and an efflorescence all over the body a costiveness and great thirst attended throughout the whole disease there were no outward swellings nor any great anxiety i ordered her prunes boiled with sena to keep the body open and to afford her some nourishment a great aversion against all manner of food and the bark with the spirit mind were administered along with the usual syringe and wash for the mouth and throat the symptoms were at a stand for eight days the   th the efflorescence disappeared the costiveness still remaining along with a hoarseness which lasted for three weeks sudorifics and the bark were given and she recovered entirely both her sisters one eight and the other ten years of age were taken two days after with all the symptoms similar to the first excepting they had large and hard external swellings and a great stiffness of the neck which was inclined to the right shoulder and which they could not move without the greatest pain they were treated in the same manner with the addition of the camphorated oil to the swellings and they recovered nearly at the  0th of october five days after they were all attacked with the oedematous swelling as mentioned in case ill but by the administration of cathartics and the bark they all recovered six days after the attack  case v jeremiah wray aged three years of a weak constitution was recommended to the asylum october the   d by mr babbs the child was seized two days before with nausea and vomiting succeeded by shiverings and heat an efflorescence all over the body and a purging when he came to the asylum i found his throat ulcerated and swellings on both sides the neck his pulse   0 strokes in a minute and he was in a comatose state the decoction of the bark with the confect card was ordered to be taken internally the same decoction with the tinsture of myrrh was administered for a gargle a blister was put on his neck and the outward swellings rubbed with the camphorated oil the child came every other day my days in attendance to the asylum the symptoms were at a stand till the   th of october when the efflorescence and the purging both abated the swellings began to subside and the  d november he was quite recovered and returned thanks  case vi james bullock and william bullock two brothers one of five and the other of seven years of age were recommended by mr ashburner and mr heart september    they were taken with nausea and vomiting which succeeded by a slight degree of fever and ulceration in the throat hardly perceptible neither of them had any outward swelling nor an efflorescence but both had a purging till the  th day when by the use of the medicines nearly like those mentioned in case iv they returned thanks the  th october  case vii william rooter aged six years came recommended by chamberling esquire october    he was attacked three days before with a sickness succeeded by a slight fever i found his throat deeply ulcerated the uvula and tonsils covered with sloughs an outward swelling on the right side the neck but there was neither an efflorescence nor purging on the contrary he was costive throughout the whole disease laxitives were ordered to keep his body open and the bark was administered he was treated nearly as those mentioned in cases iv and v excepting the blister which i omitted he came every other day to the asylum and returned thanks the   th october  my ingenious friend dr lettsom whose practice is extensive and observations accurate informed me that he generally observed that a fever with alternate shiverings and hot fits and a pain and difficulty in swallowing attended the first onset of this disease a nausea headache restlessness and a sensation of general soreness of the body and other symptoms of fever were also present in greater or less degree even before any ulceration of the tonsils took place its approach however might be ascertained by the enlargement of these glands and the livid appearance and turgescence of their vessels an efflorescence of the skin most generally appeared at this time and a flushing and bloatedness of the face  the ulcerations of the tonsils usually began to slough off about the fourth or fifth day but a low remittent fever continued frequently for some days afterward as did likewise the efflorescence and as the fever ceased this gradually vanished and fell off in branlike scales and all the symptoms subsided  when the angina was more violent in its attack the sloughs were not removed till the seventh or eighth day about which period when the patient appeared more favorable considerable and unequal swellings in one or both sides of the neck arose and these if not discussed in two or three days formed large tedious suppurations which either discharged externally or behind the uvula or carried off the patient by suffocation or by debility but most generally in these malignant cases the ulcerations spread inferiorly producing the angina trachaealis which often proved fatal in grown persons as well as in infants these ulcerations likewise extended along the whole membranes of the mouth and nostrils in such instances particularly a delirium almost constantly supervened and many died in a state of raving which made him suspect that the erysipelatous inflammation might extend to the membranes contiguous to the brain  the eruption often put on a peculiar appearance in this virulent state of the disease instead of falling off in scales numerous little suppurations might be discovered upon the skin a little larger than the miliary eruption and sometimes as broad as a silver penny they contained purulent matter which might be discovered upon opening them  a dysentery sometimes preceded the angina oftener however it came on about the third or fourth day the discharges were darkcolored offensive and thin dysenteries also prevailed with angina particularly in october while it was requisite to evacuate these foetid congestions in the abdomen by mild means large and sudden evacuations were apt to augment the debility  dr lettsom also observed that the country in the vicinity of london suffered much likewise especially in the villages in low marshy situations wherein the disease raged through the summer as well as in the spring and autumn of      and proved full as fatal as in the metropolis  when he was consulted at the commencement of the disease he generally began the cure by an antimonial emetic given in small and repeated doses till it vomited by which much bilious fluids were discharged and as soon as the operation was over he did not hesitate to exhibit the bark either in decoction or in substance although the fever was then considerable it seldom appeared to him to increase it or the dyspnoea which often attended the angina occasionally however where the fever was very violent he intervened emotic tartar in small doses as a relaxant and joined neutralized lemon juice with the cortox when a diarrhaea was alarming the confectio cardiaca was added and small doses of thebaic tincture sometimes with rhubarb or small doses of ipecacoanha instead of the emetie tartar but throughout the whole progress of the disease the bark was seldom relinquished cordial drinks and acidulated liquors formed a part of the diet he usually prescribed the volatile liniment to the fauces and throat but where there was danger of suffocation he applied blisters to the neck they sometimes appeared to him to have beneficial effects but he observed that most of those anginas which terminated in tedious glandular suppurations of the neck had been previously treated with visicatories from whence it was suspected whether the stimulus of the cantharides had not excited this troublesome and dangerous symptom and thereby rather increased than lessened the danger of suffocation  he seldom found the delirium and restlessness which accompanied the angina yielded to an opiate they were sometimes increased by it but that pediluvium and fomentations of vinegar and water to the legs produced a more salutary effect when both were used together the opiate usually produced a more salutary effect  out of several cases of glandular suppurations which have occurred to him in practice he has favored me with the following cases and dissection  mary pulling aged nine years was attacked on the   th of may      with rigors and vomiting which were succeeded by fever and efflorescence of the skin i first visited her on the   th the heat was then excessive and the efflorescence general the pulse beat about   0 in a minute a slight cough was occasionally excited and a delirium now and then prevailed she complained of a soreness of the throat which i found to be ulcerated  cordial remedies were administered with preparations of the bark laxatives were occasionally prescribed and mild opiates when necessity required the volatile liniment was applied to the throat and fauces and gargles were carefully used about the  th day a blister was applied behind each ear  in about ten days time no symptoms of the angina appeared the fever had subsided and the efflorescence of the skin had vanished but the strength was reduced and the nourishment and drinks which the patient swallowed were discharged by vomiting at the same time neither a difficulty of breathing nor of swallowing occurred opiates did not subdue the vomiting mineral acids had no effect and laxatives did not divert this by opening another discharge and even quicksilve was ejected the want of nutrition would augment the debility to obviate which broth clysters were recommended and to take off the determination to the stomach a blister was applied to each foot the vomiting however never subsided till the   th of june when the emaciated patient expired without either previous dyspnoea catarrh or difficult deglutition  on the   th the patient was opened by surgeon vaux in the presence of dr hulme and other medical gentlemen  the brain was found in a perfect state the intestines also did not appear diseased the omentum was almost dissipated what remained of it was flaccid and not indurated the gallbladder was considerably enlarged on the lest side of the thorax an effusion of water appeared and the left lobe of the lungs afforded a tubercle of considerable magnitude the heart was in a healthy state and so were the liver and stomach  upon opening the throat a considerable tumor was found on the right side immediately behind the tonsil but it had no duct or passage into the trachoea the tumor contained about three ounces of foetid pus in its cavity the child continued sensible through the disease but for the last fortnight never complained of any affection near the throat or that the constant inclination to vomit all food or liquids proceeded from irritation near the part diseased and deglutition continued familiar to the exit of the patient  about the same time i was attending another child with very similar symptoms of the angina trachoealis the tumor of the neck was however much larger and a slight dyspnoea attended the child which increased to such a degree one night as threatened suffocation on the next day the fever and dyspnoea very suddenly diminished and upon examining the throat internally i observed a quantity of pus discharging from behind the tonsil of the same side of the neck and this discharge was augmented by gently pressing the tumor externally the child from this period gradually recovered  suppurations of this kind do not unfrequently accompany the angina maligna or appear during its secession and continue sometimes feveral days after the mucous membrane which was first affected in the angina has recovered its natural state in such instances wherein a fatal tendency is suspected would it not be advisable to open the abscess that is formed either by an incision through the tonsil on the side affected in imitation of the natural operation which occurred in the last instance or through the external integuments where the tumor points externally  on the extremes of the cold and hot regimen in the sorethroat and other putrid diseases sydenham and morton practiced at one time in london the former introduced the antiphlogistic whilst the latter continued the alexipharmic regimen in the smallpox as well as in different putrid affections both perhaps with equal grounds and success as the practice of the one was mostly in the airy and court part of the town where all diseases are less malignant and where the air is purer than it is in the close part of the town the city full of gaols and impure air in which the other resided an observation communicated to me by dr fothergill who insists even now upon the hot regimen in the malignant sorethroat and has assured me that notwithstanding in compliance with other physicians he often tried the bark yet never found it to answer the desired effect and was obliged to have recourse again to his method of treating it with cordials etc he observed further that even animal food seemed not to be so hurtful in this disease as is commonly thought for he has taken notice that the patients have a particular longing for it a call of unerring nature for support and strength and the doctor thinks that acids are not so beneficial and so great antisceptics as is imagined all which remarks are certainly not theoretical but founded on the solid basis of a long and great practice and repeated observations other practitioners however insist much upon the bark and some even upon the antiphlogistic regimen  it is true that the indications of cure according to the state of the patient his situation and the degree of malignancy of the disease and its symptoms and not this or that regimen ought to be the guide of the artist it is also undeniable that even nature which is so much talked of cannot always be consulted as the true guide for if we were to encourage nature in all her endeavors she would lead us often astray in many erysipelous cases and cutaneous eruptions where nature endeavors to throw out some peccant matter upon the skin experience has thought not to assist her by sudorifics and warm medicines but on the contrary to use cathartics in the putrid sorethroat and the confluent smallpox the diarrhea often attending must be checked and moderated and so in many cases where nature must be opposed as she often acts not upon wise but upon mechanical principles and it is the business of the physician to watch her only and to let experience be his guide in encouraging moderating and counteracting her efforts it is only therefore practice and not theory that enables the artist to distinguish between the critical and symptomatical appearances of diseases but when practitioners differ so widely even those who practice in one and the same part of the town and all appeal to facts then i should think theory might have some right to interfere and bring in its verdict i know that i am far from being equal to the task nor do i propose to decide in so important and intricate a subject but mean only to throw out some thoughts and vehemently wish that the subject might be handled by my superiors both in knowledge and practice  the antiphlogistic regimen in the confluent smallpox especially is hot so modern as it is commonly thought the arabian physicians have already recommended the free and cold air primus est cum nimium tecti et cooperti aegri suffocantur et in lipothymiam incidunt tunc aeri frigido vento etiam paulatim tamen aegri exponendi alter est fi dum erumpunt variolae non subleventur aegri sed perseveret vel augeatur inflammatio interna and lingua nigrescat tunc cavendum est a calefactione aeris frigidus et sussitu quodum cordiali alteratus est imperandus avicen fen   can   tract   cap  0 evacuations and large bleeding even ad sincopium vid rhazis c   c         sydenham has only renewed and introduced it more generally which regimen as it was at first so much opposed so has it afterward been too much embraced and extended to too great a length as we are commonly apt to run to either of the extremes especially when we are actuated by the evil spirits of novelty and contradiction  though there is a great difference between the nature of the confluent smallpox and the disease in question as the latter consists chiefly in the constitution of the air evidenced by its attacking the fauces whereas the former lies dormant and lurking as it were in the system and the whole mass of blood obvious from the nature of inoculation yet are they in so far similar as all putrid diseases or those which appear with great depression of strength are related to one another and therefore what holds of the one is caeteris paribus applicable to the other as in both the view of the physician must be directed in supporting the strength of his patient and in avoiding every application that may in the least tend to increase the general debility either of the extremes will often increase the disease for to confine the patient to his bed heat his body with wine and cordials and debar him of the air must certainly rarify the blood relax the fibers and increase the tendency to putrefaction by increasing its too great principles heat and moisture as on the other hand the too cold regimen will greatly contribute to lessen the energy and motion of the solids as well as of the fluids and indeed many young and tender patients have perished by cold and been frozen to death as it were though others have often recovered under the coldest regimen yet this will prove no more than that nature often cures diseases in spite of all mismanagement of art  bleeding can seldom be proper for the spontaneous nasal hoemorrhage in the onset of both diseases the putrid sorethroat and the confluent smallpox does not seem to be a hint of nature insinuating the necessity of emptying the vessels but i should imagine its being merely symptomatical owing to the loose texture of the blood as is evident in cases of great malignancy where the blood when drawn from a vein is so watery and putrid that it does not coagulate as usual and might be divided and moved any way with the slightest touch of a feather like water the air confined in the blood increases its elasticity is set loose by the heat and fermentation of the fluids and expands itself to such a degree that it compasses a much greater room than usual by which means it stretches the fibers and forces them to dilate beyond their natural dimensions which in the smaller capillary veins occasions their bursting and consequently hoemorrhages that are only symptomatical and indicate antisceptics bracers and free air not bleeding though the arabian physicians have considered such discharges as critical and accordingly recommended the opening of the veins of the nose in the beginning of the smallpox et cum erit conveniens flebotomare venas narum i principis est satis utile rhazis dwis p  0    the same observation holds of the diarrhaea often attending the smallpox as well as the putrid sorethroat which is symptomatical owing to the weakness and irritable state of the intestinal tube and to the stimuli of the juices corrupted by the disease but is not a critical discharge and therefore must be moderated  in all putrid diseases the principle of life and the nerves are chiefly concerned insomuch that astrue thought from examining the brains of those who died in putrid fevers that the seat of the disorder lies originally in the brain itself but if even that alteration found he in the brain was only as it most probably seemed to be the effect and not the cause of the disease yet has no physician ever disputed that all putrid disorders impart much to the eneaphlon and the nervous system as is evident from the anxiety dejection of spirits and prostration of strength attending the very onset of putrid diseases clearly painted upon the eyes and languishing and pityful countenance of the patient and which by itself is sufficient for a good observer to give him an exact idea of the disease and its degree of malignancy without examining the state of the pulse and inquiring into all other symptoms whether the nerves are primary or secondary affected it matters not the indications of cure coeteris paribus remain notwithstanding the same namely to excite and rouse the motion and energy of the nerves and to brace the whole system which may be done either by applications acting with their stimulating quality such as cordials spirits and blisters or by administering such as are able to corroborate and compact as it were the loose and relaxed fibers as are all the bitters the bark cold air etc either of which applications however are not attended without some disadvantages for what concerns cordials and stimuli it is well known that although they wonderfully rouse the spirits yet that great exertion of the nerves is only a temporary tumult as it were which soon ceases and leaves commonly behind it a great langour and relaxation of the fibers as on the other hand strengtheners and bitters alone without the junction of some stimuli to exert the fibers into motion and action will sometimes have no effect at all and often do great mischief for i have elsewhere see the authors essay on the blood endeavored to show that all medicines and application to living bodies can act only in degree and proportion to the reaction of the living fibers and as long as the fibers are too weak to react the effects of corroborating medicines will be just to make use of a familiar simile as a heap of coals thrown upon a little fire which instead of making it burn brisker will extinguish it entirely  the immediate effects of the bark when given to patients whose lungs are affected in bringing on an insupportable dyspnoea is a plain proof that it diminishes the irritation of the fibers and which i have seen often restored by administering what are called expectorants and stimuli especially a solution of gum ammoniac with the sal c c seeing therefore that there is some difficulty attending in each of the applications and regimens separately the most rational method i should imagine would be to hit upon the medium of both regimens and to join the bark along with stimulants and cordials by which means both intentions might be answered at once namely that of rousing the fibers and exerting them to react when at the same time they are coroborated and strengthened by the bark practice convinces the truth of this theory that the bark does often not answer the expectations of the physician is most probably owing to either of its not being properly guarded with stimulating and warm medicines or which i believe is too often the case to its not been given in full doses and not being persevered in though it must be allowed that whenever an anginal dyspnoea is at hand that the bark cannot be administered without bringing on alarming symptoms but might it not often succeed when joined with balsamics and aromatics  finis
