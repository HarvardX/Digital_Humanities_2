the drummer or the haunted house a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants   falsis terroribus implet ut magus  hor london printed for jacob tonson at shakespeares head over against katharinestreet in the strand mdccxv    the preface having recommended this play to the town and delivered the copy of it to the bookseller i think my self obliged to give some account of it  it had been some years in the hands of the author and falling under my perusal i thought so well of it that i persuaded him to make a few additions and alterations to it and let it appear upon the stage i own i was very highly pleased with it and liked it the better for the want of those studied similes and repartees which we who have writ before him have thrown into our plays to indulge and gain upon a false taste that has prevailed for many years in the british theater i believe the author would have fallen into this way a little more than he has had he before the writing of it been often present at theatrical representations and observed the effect that such ornaments generally have upon the town i was confirmed in my thoughts of the play by the opinion of better judges to whom it was communicated who observed that the scenes were written very much after molieres manner and that an easy and natural vein of humor ran through the whole  i do not question but the reader will discover this and see many beauties that escape the audience the touches being too delicate for every taste in a popular assembly my brothersharers were of opinion at the first reading of it that it was like a picture in which the strokes were not strong enough to appear with advantage at a distance as it is not in the common way of writing the approbation was at first doubtful but has risen every time it has been acted and has given an opportunity in several of its parts for as just and good action as i ever saw on the stage  the reader will consider that i speak here as the patentee for which reason i forbear being more particular in the character of this play least i should appear like one who cries up the wares of his own shop to draw in customers  richard steel  prologue spoken by mr wilks in this grave age when comedies are few we crave your patronage for one that is new though twere poor stuff yet bid the author fair and let the scarceness recommend the ware long have your ears been filled with tragic parts blood and blankverse have hardened all your hearts if ever you smile it is at some partystroaks roundheads and woodenshooes are standing jokes the same conceit gives claps and hisses birth youre grown such politicians in your mirth for once we try though it is i own unsafe to please you all and make both parties laugh our author anxious for his fame to night and bashful in his first attempt to write lies cautiously obscure and unreveald like ancient actors in a masque concealed cenre when no man knows who writes the play were much good malice merely thrown away the mighty critics will not blast for shame a raw young thing who dares not tell his name goodnatured judges will the unknown defend and fear to blame least they should hurt a friend each wit may praise it for his own dear sake and hint he writ it if the thing should take but if youre rough and use him like a dog depend upon it  he will remain incog if you should hiss he swears he will hiss as high and like a culprit join the hueandcry if cruel men are still averse to spare these scenes they fly for refuge to the fair though with a ghost our comedy be heightened ladies upon my word you shall not be frightened o it is a ghost that scorns to be uncivil a wellspread lusty jointurehunting devil an amorous ghost that is faithful fond and true made up of flesh and blood  as much as you then every evening come in flocks undaunted we never think this house is too much haunted  dramatis personae sir george truman mr wilks tinsel mr cibber fantome the drummer mr mills vellum sir george trumans steward mr johnson butler mr pketman coachman mr miller gardener mr norris lady truman mrs oldfield abigal mrs saunders the drummer or the hauntedhouse act i scene i a great hall enter the butler coachman and gardener but there came another coach to town last night that brought a gentleman to enquire about this strange noise we hear in the house this spirit will bring a power of custom to the george  if so be he continues his pranks i design to sell a pot of ale and set up the sign of the drum   coach i will give madam warning that is flat  i have always lived in sober families i will not disparage my self to be a servant in a house that is haunted   guard i will even marry nell and rent a bit of ground of my own if both of you leave madam not but that madams a very good woman  if mrs abigal did not spoil her  come here is her health   but it is a very hard thing to be a butler in a house that is disturbed he made such a racket in the cellar last night that i am afraid he will sower all the beer in my barrels   coach why then john we ought to take it off as fast as we can here is to you  he rattled so loud under the tiles last night that i verily thought the house would have fallen over our heads i durst not go up into the cockloft this morning if i had not got one of the maids to go along with me   guard i thought i heard him in one of my bedposts  i marvel john how he gets into the house when all the gates are shut   but why look ye peter your spirit will creep you into an augrehole  he will whisk ye through a keyhole without so much as justling against one of the wards   coach poor madam is mainly frighted that is certain and verily believes it is my master that was killed in the last campaign   but out of all manner of question robin it is sir george mrs abigal is of opinion it can be none but his honor he always loved the wars and you know was mightily pleased from a child with the music of a drum   guard i wonder his body was never found after the battle   but found why ye fool is not his body here about the house do thou think he can beat his drum without hands and arms   coach it is master as sure as i stand here alive and i verily believe i saw him last night in the townclose   guard ay how did he appear   coach like a whitehorse   but pho robin i tell ye he has never appeared yet but in the shape of the sound of a drum   coach this makes one almost afraid of ones own shadow as i was walking from the stable the other night without my lanthorn i fell across a beam that lay in my way and faith my heart was in my mouth  i thought i had stumbled over a spirit   but thou might as well have stumbled over a straw why a spirit is such a little little thing that i have heard a man who was a great scholar say that he will dance ye a lancashire hornpipe upon the point of a needle  as i sat in the pantry last night counting my spoons the candle methought burnt blue and the spayd bitch looked as if she saw something   coach ay poor cur she is almost frightened out of her wits   guard ay i warrant ye she hears him many a time and often when we dont   but my lady must have him laid that is certain whatever it cost her   guard i fancy when one goes to market one might hear of some body that can make a spell   coach why may not the parson of our parish lay him   but no no no our parson cannot lay him   coach why not he as well as another man   but why ye fool he is not qualified  he has not taken the oaths   guard why do you think john that the spirit would take the law of him  faith i could tell you one way to drive him off   coach how is that   guard i will tell you immediately drinks  i fancy mrs abigal might scold him out of the house   coach ay she has a tongue that would drown his drum if any thing could   but pugh this is all froth you understand nothing of the matter  the next time it makes a noise i tell you what ought to be done  i would have the steward speak latin to it   coach ay that would do if the steward had but courage   guard there you have it  he is a fearful man if i had as much learning as he and i met the ghost i would tell him his own but alack what can one of us poor men do with a spirit that can neither write nor read   but thou art always cracking and boasting peter thou do not know what mischief it might do thee if such a silly dog as thee should offer to speak to it for ought i know he might flea thee alive and make parchment of thy skin to cover his drum with   guard a fidlestick tell not me  i fear nothing not i i never did harm in my life i never committed murder   but i verily believe thee keep thy temper peter after supper well drink each of us a double mug and then let come what will   guard why that is well said john an honest man that is not quite sober has nothing to fear  here is to ye  why how if he should come this minute here would i stand ha what noise is that   but and coach ha where   guard the devil the devil oh no it is mrs abigal   but ay faith it is she it is mrs abigal a good mistake it is mrs abigal   enter abigal ab here are your drunken sots for you is this a time to be guzling when gentry are come to the house why dont you lay your cloth how come you out of the stables why are not you at work in your garden   guard why yonder is the fine londoner and madam fetching a walk together and methought they looked as if they should say they had rather have my room than my company   but and so forsooth being all three mettogether we are doing our endeavors to drink this same drummer out of our heads   guard for you must know mrs abigal we are all of opinion that one cannot be a match for him unless one be as drunk as a drum   coach i am resolved to give madam warning to hire herself another coachman for i came to serve my master do you see while he was alive but do suppose that he has no further occasion for a coach now he walks   but truly mrs abigal i must needs say that this same spirit is a very odd sort of a body after all to fright madam and his old servants at this rate   guard and truly mrs abigal i must needs say i served my my master contentedly while he was living but i will serve no man living that is no man that is not living without double wages   ab ay it is such cowards as you that go about with idle stories to disgrace the house and bring so many strangers about it you first frighten your selves and then your neighbors   guard frightened i scorn your words frightened quotha   ab what you sot are you grown potvaliant   guard frightened with a drum that is a good one it will do us no harm i will answer for it it will bring no bloodshed along with it take my word it sounds as like a trainband drum as ever i heard in my life   but prithee peter dont be so presumptuous   ab well these drunken rogues take it as i could wish aside   guard i scorn to be frightened now i am in for it if old dubadub should come into the room i would take him    but prithee hold thy tongue   guard i would take him   the drum beats the guard endeavors to get off and falls but and coach speak to it mrs abigal   guard spare my life and take all i have   coach make off make off good butler and let us go hide our selves in the cellar  they all run off abigal sola ab so now the coast is clear i may venture to call out my drummer  but first let me shut the door lest we be surpised mr fantome mr fantome he beats nay nay pray come out the enemys fled  i must speak with you immediately  dont stay to beat a parley  the back scene opens and discovers fantome with a drum fan dear mrs nabby i have overheard all that has been said and find thou have managed this thing so well that i could take thee in my arms and kiss thee  if my drum did not stand in my way   ab well of my conscience you are the merriest ghost and the very picture of sir george truman   fan there you flatter me mrs abigal sir george had that freshness in his looks that we men of the town cannot come up to   ab oh death may have altered you you know  besides you must consider you lost a great deal of blood in the battle   fan ay that is right let me look never so pale this cut cross my forehead will keep me in countenance   ab it is just such a one as my master received from a cursed french trooper as my ladys letter informed her   fan it happens luckily that this suit of clothes of sir georges fits me so well  i think i cannot fail hitting the air of a man with whom i was so long acquainted   ab you are the very man  i vow i almost start when i look upon you   fan but what good will this do me if i must remain invisible   ab pray what good did your being visible do you the fair mr fantome thought no woman could withstand him  but when you were seen by my lady in your proper person after she had taken a full survey of you and heard all the pretty things you could say she very civilly dismissed you for the sake of this empty noisy creature tinsel she fancies you have been gone from hence this fortnight   fan why really i love thy lady so well that though i had no hopes of gaining her for my self i could not bear to see her given to another especially to such a wretch as tinsel   ab well tell me truly mr fantome have not you a great opinion of my fidelity to my dear lady that i would not suffer her to be deluded in this manner for less than a thousand pound   fan thou art always reminding me of my promise  thou shall have it if thou can bring our project to bear do not know that stories of ghosts and apparitions generally end in a pot of money   ab why truly now mr fantome i should think my self a very bad woman if i had done what i do for a farthing less   fan dear abigal how i admire thy virtue   ab no no mr fantome i defy the worst of my enemies to say i love mischief for mischief sake   fan but is thy lady persuaded that i am the ghost of her deceased husband   ab i endeavor to make her believe so and tell her every time your drum rattles that her husband is chiding her for entertaining this new lover   fan prithee make use of all thy art for i am tired to death with strowling round this wide old house like a rat behind a wainscot   ab did not i tell you twas the purest place in the world for you to play your tricks in there is none of the family that knows every hole and corner in it besides my self   fan ah mrs abigal you have had your intrigues    ab for you must know when i was a romping young girl i was a mighty lover of hide and seek   fan i believe by this time i am as well acquainted with the house as your self   ab you are very much mistaken mr fantome but no matter for that here is to be your station to night this is the place unknown to any one living besides my self since the death of the joyner who you must understand being a lover of mine contrived the wainscot to move to and fro in the manner that you find it i designed it for a wardrobe for my ladys cast clothes oh the stomachers stays pettycoats commodes laced shoes and good things that i have had in it  pray take care you dont break the cherrybrandy bottle that stands up in the corner   fan well mrs abigal i hire your closet of you but for this one night  a thousand pound you know is a very good rent   ab well get you gone you have such a way with you there is no denying you any thing   fan i am a thinking how tinsel will stare when he sees me come out of the wall for i am resolved to make my appearance to night   ab get you in get you in my ladys at the door   fan pray take care she does not keep me up so late as she did last night or depend upon it i will beat the tattoo   ab i am undone i am undone  as he is going in mr fantome mr fantome you have put the thousand pound bond into my brothers hands   fan thou shall have it i tell thee thou shall have it   fantome goes in ab no more words  vanish vanish   enter lady ab opening the door oh dear madam was it you that made such a knocking my heart does so beat  i vow you have frighted me to death  i thought verily it had been the drummer   lady i have been showing the garden to mr tinsel he is most insufferably witty upon us about this story of the drum   ab indeed madam he is a very loose man i am afraid it is he that hinders my poor master from resting in his grave   lady well an infidel is such a novelty in the country that i am resolved to divert my self a day or two at least with the oddness of his conversation   ab ah madam the drum begun to beat in the house as soon as ever this creature was admitted to visit you all the while mr fantome made his addresses to you there was not a mouse stirring in the family more than used to be    lady this baggage has some design upon me more than i can yet discover aside  mr fantome was always thy favorite   ab ay and should have been yours too by my consent mr fantome was not such a slight fantastic thing as this is  mr fantome was the bestbuilt man one should see in a summers day mr fantome was a man of honor and loved you poor soul how has he sighed when he has talked to me of my hardhearted lady  well i had as lief as a thousand pound you would marry mr fantome   lady to tell theetruly i loved him well enough till i found he loved me so much but mr tinsel makes his court to me with so much neglect and indifference and with such an agreeable sauciness  not that i say i will marry him   ab marry him quotha no if you should you will be awakened sooner than married couples generally are  you will quickly have a drum at your window   lady i will hide my contempt of tinsel for once if it be but to see what this wench drives at aside   ab why suppose your husband after this fair warning he has given you should sound you an alarm at midnight then open your curtains with a face as pale as my apron and cry out with a hollow voice what do thou do in bed with this spindleshankd fellow   lady why will thou needs have it to be my husband he never had any reason to be offended at me i always loved him while he was living and should prefer him to any man were he so still mr tinsel is indeed very idle in his talk but i fancy abigal a discreet woman might reform him   ab that is a likely matter indeed did you ever hear of a woman who had power over a man when she was his wife that had none while she was his mistress oh there is nothing in the world improves a man in his complaisance like marriage   lady he is indeed at present too familiar in his conversation   ab familiar madam in troth he is downright rude   lady but that you know abigal shows he has no dissimulation in him  then he is apt to jest a little too much upon grave subjects   ab grave subjects he jests upon the church   lady but that you know abigal may be only to show his wit  then it must be owned he is extremely talkative   ab talkative do you call it he is downright impertinent   lady but that you know abigal is a sign he has been used to good company  then indeed he is very positive   ab positive why he contradicts you in every thing you say   lady but then you know abigal he has been educated at the inns of court   ab a blessed education indeed it has made him forget his catechism   lady you talk as if you hated him   ab you talk as if you loved him   lady hold your tongue here he comes   enter tinsel tin my dear widow   ab my dear widow marry come up aside   lady let him alone abigal so long as he does not call me my dear wife there is no harm done   tin i have been most ridiculously diverted since i left you  your servants have made a convert of my booby his head is so filled with this foolish story of a drummer that i expect the rogue will be afraid hereafter to go upon a message by moonlight   lady ah mr tinsel what a loss of billetdoux would that be to many a fine lady   ab then you still believe this to be a foolish story i thought my lady had told you that she had heard it her self   tin ha ha ha   ab why you would not persuade us out of our senses   tin ha ha ha   ab there is manners for you madam aside   lady admirably rallied that laugh is unanswerable now i will be hanged if you could forbear being witty upon me if i should tell you i heard it no longer ago than last night   tin fancy   lady but what if i should tell you my maid was with me   tin vapors vapors pray my dear widow will you answer me one question  had you ever this noise of a drum in your head all the while your husband was living   lady and pray mr tinsel will you let me ask you another question do you think we can hear in the country as well as you do in town   tin believe me madam i could prescribe you a cure for these imaginations   ab dont tell my lady of imaginations sir i have heard it my self   tin hark thee child  art thou not an old maid   ab sir if i am it is my own fault   tin whims freaks megrims indeed mrs abigal   ab marry sir by your talk one would believe you thought every thing that was good is a megrim   lady why truly i dont very well understand what you meant by your doctrine to me in the garden just now that every thing we saw was made by chance   ab a very pretty subject indeed for a lover to divert his mistress with   lady but i suppose that was only a taste of the conversation you would entertain me with after marriage   tin oh i shall then have time to read you such lectures of motions atoms and nature  that you shall learn to think as freely as the best of us and be convinced in less than a month that all about us is chancework   lady you are a very complaisant person indeed and so you would make your court to me by persuading me that i was made by chance   tin ha ha ha well said my dear why faith thou were a very lucky hit that is certain   lady pray mr tinsel where did you learn this odd way of talking   tin ah widow it is your country innocence makes you think it an odd way of talking   lady though you give no credit to stories of apparitions i hope you believe there are such things as spirits   tin simplicity   ab i fancy you dont believe women have souls do you sir   tin foolish enough   lady i vow mr tinsel i am afraid malicious people will say i am in love with an atheist   tin oh my dear that is an oldfashioned word  i am a freethinker child   ab i am sure you are a freespeaker   lady really mr tinsel considering that you are so fine a gentleman i am amazed where you got all this learning i wonder it has not spoiled your breeding   tin to tell you the truth i have not time to look into these dry matters my self but i am convinced by four or five learned men whom i sometimes overhear at a coffeehouse i frequent that our forefathers were a pack of asses that the world has been in an error for some thousands of years and that all the people upon earth excepting those two or three worthy gentlemen are imposed upon cheated bubbled abused bamboozld    ab madam how can you hear such a profligate he talks like the london prodigal   lady why really i am a thinking if there be no such things as spirits a woman has no occasion for marrying  she need not be afraid to lie by her self   tin ah my dear are husbands good for nothing but to frighten away spirits do thou think i could not instruct thee in several other comforts of matrimony   lady ah but you are a man of so much knowledge that you would always be laughing at my ignorance  you learned men are so apt to despise one   tin no child i would teach thee my principles thou should be as wise as i am  in a weeks time   lady do you think your principles would make a woman the better wife   tin prithee widow dont be queer   lady i love a gay temper but i would not have you rally things that are serious   tin well enough faith where is the jest of rallying any thing else   ab ah madam did you ever hear mr fantome talk at this rate aside   tin but where is this ghost this son of a whore of a drummer i would fain hear him methinks   ab pray madam dont suffer him to give the ghost such ill language especially when you have reason to believe it is my master   tin that is well enough faith nab do thou think thy master is so unreasonable as to continue his claim to his relict after his bones are laid pray widow remember the words of your contract you have fulfilled them to a tittle  did not you marry sir george to the tune of till death us do part   lady i must not hear sir georges memory treated in so slight a manner  this fellow must have been at some pains make himself such a finished coxcomb aside   tin give me but possession of your person and i will whirle you up to town for a winter and cure you at once oh i have known many a country lady come to london with frightful stories of the hallhouse being haunted of fairies spirits and witches that by the time she had seen a comedy played at an assembly and ambled in a ball or two has been so little afraid of bugbears that she has ventured home in a chair at all hours of the night   ab hum  saucebox aside   tin it is the solitude of the country that creates these whimsies there was never such a thing as a ghost heard of at london except in the playhouse  oh wed pass all our time in london it is the scene of pleasure and diversions where there is something to amuse you every hour of the day lifes not life in the country   lady well then you have an opportunity of showing the sincerity of that love to me which you profess you may give a proof that you have an affection to my person not my jointure   tin your jointure how can you think me such a dog but child will not your jointure be the same thing in london as in the country   lady no youre deceived you must know it is settled on me by marriagearticles on condition that i live in this old mansion house and keep it up in repair   tin how   ab that is well put madam   tin why faith i have been looking upon this house and think it is the prettiest habitation i ever saw in my life   lady ay but then this cruel drum   tin something so venerable in it   lady ay but the drum   tin for my part i like this gothic way of building better than any of your new orders  it would be a thousand pities it should fall to ruin   lady ay but the drum   tin how pleasantly we two could pass our time in this delicious situation our lives would be a continued dream of happiness come faith widow let us go upon the leads and take a view of the country   lady ay but the drum the drum   tin my dear take my word for it it is all fancy besides should he drum in thy very bedchamber i should only hug thee the closer  clasped in the folds of love i would meet my doom and act my joys though thunder shook the room  act ii scene i scene opens and discovers vellum in his office and a letter in his hand vel this letter astonisheth may i believe my own eyes  or rather my spectacles  to humphrey vellum esquire steward to the lady truman vellum i doubt not but you will be glad to hear your master is alive and designs to be with you in half an hour the report of my being slain in the netherlands has i find produced some disorders in my family i am now at the georgeinn if an old man with a gray beard in a black cloak enquires after you give him admittance he passes for a conjurer but is really  your faithful friend g truman ps let this be a secret and you shall find your account in it     this amazeth me and yet the reasons why i should believe he is still living are manifold  first because this has often been the case of other military adventurers  secondly because the news of his death was first published in diers letter  thirdly because this letter can be written by none but himself  i know his hand and manner of spelling  fourthly    enter butler but sir here is a strange old gentleman that asks for you he says he is a conjurer but he looks very suspicious i wish he bent a jesuit   vel admit him immediately   but i wish he bent a jesuit but he says he is nothing but a conjurer   vel he says right  he is no more than a conjurer bring him in and withdraw exit butler  and fourthly as i was saying because    enter butler with sir george but sir here is the conjurer  what a devilish long beard he has i warrant it has been growing these hundred years aside exit   sir g dear vellum you have received my letter but before we proceed lock the door   vel it is his voice  shuts the door sir g in the next place help me off with this cumbersome cloak   vel it is his shape   sir g so now lay my beard upon the table   vel after having looked on sir george throd his spectacles it is his face every lineament   sir g well now i have put off the conjurer and the old man i can talk to thee more at my ease   vel believe me my good master i am as much rejoiced to see you alive as i was upon the day you were born your name was in all the newspapers in the list of those that were slain   sir g we have not time to be particular i shall only tell thee in general that i was taken prisoner in the battle and was under close confinement for several months upon my release i was resolved to surprise my wife with the news of my being alive i know vellum you are a person of so much penetration that i need not use any further arguments to convince you that i am so   vel i am  and moreover i question not but your good lady will likewise be convinced of it her ho  nour is a discerning lady   sir g i am only afraid she should be convinced of it to her sorrow is not she pleased with her imaginary widowhood tell me truly was she afflicted at the report of my death   vel sorely   sir g how long did her grief last   vel longer than i have known any widows  at least three days   sir g three days say thou three whole days i am afraid thou flatterest me  o woman woman   vel grief is twofold   sir g this blockhead is as methodical as ever  but i know he is honest aside   vel there is a real grief and there is a methodical grief she was drowned in tears till such time as the tailor had made her widows weeds  indeed they became her   sir g became her and was that her comfort truly a most seasonable consolation   vel but i must needs say she paid a due regard to your memory and could not forbear weeping when she saw company   sir g that was kind indeed i find she grieved with a great deal of goodbreeding but how comes this gang of lovers about her   vel her jointure is considerable   sir g how this fool torments me aside   vel her person is amiable    sir g death aside   vel but her character is unblemished she has been as virtuous in your absence as a penelope    sir g and has had as many suitors   vel several have made their overtures   sir g several   vel but she has rejected all   sir g there thou revivst me  but what means this tinsel are his visits acceptable   vel he is young   sir g does she listen to him   vel he is gay   sir g sure she could never entertain a thought of marrying such a coxcomb   vel he is not ill made   sir g are the vows and protestations that past between us come to this i cannot bear the thought of it is tinsel the man designed for my worthy successor   vel you do not consider that you have been dead these fourteen months    sir g was there ever such a dog aside   vel and i have often heard her say that she must never expect to find a second sir g truman  meaning your ho  nour   sir g i think she loved me but i must search into this story of the drummer before i discover my self to her i have put on this habit of a conjurer in order to introduce my self it must be your business to recommend me as a most profound person that by my great knowledge in the curious arts can silence the drummer and dispossess the house   vel i am going to lay my accounts before my lady and i will endeavor to prevail upon her ho  nour to admit the trial of your art   sir g i have scarce heard of any of these stories that did not arise from a love intrigue  amors raise as many ghosts as murders   vel mrs abigal endeavors to persuade us that it is your ho  nour who troubles the house   sir g that convinces me it is a cheat for i think vellum i may be pretty well assured it is not me   vel i am apt to think so truly ha  ha  ha   sir g abigal had always an ascendant over her lady and if there is a trick in this matter depend upon it she is at the bottom of it i will be hanged if this ghost be not one of abigals familiars   vel mrs abigal has of late been very mysterious   sir g i fancy vellum thou could worm it out of her i know formerly there was an amor between you   vel mrs abigal has her allurements and she knows i have picked up a competency in your ho  nours service   sir g if thou have all i ask of thee in return is that thou would immediately renew thy addresses to her coax her up thou have such a silver tongue vellum as twill be impossible for her to withstand besides she is so very a woman that she will like thee the better for giving her the pleasure of telling a secret in short wheedle her out of it and i shall act by the advice which thou give me   vel mrs abigal was never deaf to me when i talked upon that subject i will take an opportunity of addressing my self to her in the most pathetick manner   sir g in the mean time lock me up in your office and bring me word what success you have  well sure i am the first that ever was employed to lay himself   vel you act indeed a threefold part in this house you are a ghost a conjurer and my ho  noured master sir george truman he he he you will pardon me for being jocular   sir g o mr vellum with all my heart you know i love you men of wit and humor be as merry as thou please so thou do thy business mimicking him you will remember vellum your commission is twofold first to gain admission for me to your lady and secondly to get the secret out of abigal   vel it suffices   the scene shuts enter lady sola lady women who have been happy in a first marriage are the most apt to venture upon a second but for my part i had a husband so every way suited to my inclinations that i must entirely forget him before i can like another man i have now been a widow but fourteen months and have had twice as many lovers all of em professed admirers of my person but passionately in love with my jointure i think it is a revenge i owe my sex to make an example of this worthless tribe of fellows who grow impudent dress themselves fine and fancy we are obliged to provide for em but of all my captives mr tinsel is the most extraordinary in his kind i hope the diversion i give my self with him is unblameable i am sure it is necessary to turn my thoughts off from the memory of that dear man who has been the greatest happiness and affliction of my life my heart would be a prey to melancholy if i did not find these innocent methods of relieving it but here comes abigal i must teaze the baggage for i find she has taken it into her head that i am entirely at her disposal   enter abigal ab madam madam yonder is mr tinsel has as good as taken possession of your house marry he says he must have sir georges apartment enlarged for truly says he i hate to be straightened nay he was so impudent as to show me the chamber where he intends to consummate as he calls it   lady well he is a wild fellow   ab indeed he is a very sad man madam   lady he is young abigal it is a thousand pities he should be lost i should be mighty glad to reform him   ab reform him marry hang him   lady has not he a great deal of life   ab ay enough to make your heart ache   lady i dare say thou think him a very agreeable fellow   ab he thinks himself so i will answer for him   lady he is very goodnatured   ab he ought to be so for he is very silly   lady do thou think he loves me   ab mr fantome did i am sure   lady with what raptures he talked   ab yes but twas in praise of your jointurehouse   lady he has kept bad company   ab they must be very bad indeed if they were worse than himself   lady i have a strong fancy a good woman might reform him   ab it would be a fine experiment if it should not succeed   lady well abigal well talk of that another time here comes the steward i have no further occasion for you at present  exit abigal enter vellum vel madam is your ho  nour at leisure to look into the accounts of the last week they rise very high  housekeeping is chargeable in a house that is haunted   lady how comes that to pass i hope the drum neither eats nor drinks but read your account vellum   vel putting on and off his spectacles in this scene a hogshead and a half of ale  it is not for the ghosts drinking  but your ho  nours servants say they must have something to keep up their courage against this strange noise they tell me they expect a double quantity of malt in their smallbeer so long as the house continues in this condition   lady at this rate they will take care to be frightened all the year round i will answer for em but go on   vel item two sheep and a  where is the ox  oh here i have him  and an ox  your ho  nour must always have a piece of cold beef in the house for the entertainment of so many strangers who come from all parts to hear this drum item bread ten peckloaves  they cannot eat beef without bread  item three barrels of table beer  they must have drink with their meat   lady sure no woman in england has a steward that makes such ingenious comments on his works aside   vel item to mr tinsels servants five bottles of port wine  it was by your ho  nours order  item three bottles of sack for the use of mrs abigal   lady i suppose that was by your own order   vel we have been long friends we are your ho  nours ancient servants sack is an innocent cordial and gives her spirit to chide the servants when they are tardy in their business he he he pardon me for being jocular   lady well i see you will come together at last   vel item a dozen pound of watchlights for the use of the servants   lady for the use of the servants what are the rogues afraid of sleeping in the dark what an unfortunate woman am i this is such a particular distress it puts me to my wits end vellum what would you advise me to do   vel madam your ho  nour has two points to consider imprimis to retrench these extravagant expenses which so many strangers bring upon you  secondly to clear the house of this invisible drummer   lady this learned division leaves me just as wise as i was but how must we bring these two points to bear   vel i beseech your ho  nour to give me the hearing   lady i do but prithee take pity on me and be not tedious   vel i will be concise there is a certain person arrived this morning an aged man of a venerable aspect and of a long hoary beard that reaches down to his girdle the common people call him a wizard a whitewitch a conjurer a cunningman a necromancer a    lady no matter for his titles but what of all this   vel give me the hearing good my lady he pretends to great skill in the occult sciences and is come hither upon the rumor of this drum if one may believe him he knows the secret of laying ghosts or of quieting houses that are haunted   lady pho these are idle stories to amuse the country people this can do us no good   vel it can do us no harm my lady   lady i dare say thou do not believe there is any thing in it thy self   vel i cannot say i do there is no danger however in the experiment let him try his skill if it should succeed we are rid of the drum if it should not we may tell the world that it has and by that means at least get out of this expensive way of living so that it must turn to your advantage one way or another   lady i think you argue very rightly but where is the man i would fain see him he must be a curiosity   vel i have already discoursed him and he is to be with me in my office half an hour hence he asks nothing for his pains till he has done his work  no cure no money   lady that circumstance i must confess would make one believe there is more in his art than one would imagine pray vellum go and fetch him hither immediately   vel i am gone he shall be forthcoming forthwith  exeunt enter butler coachman and gardener but rare news my lads rare news   guard what is the matter have thou got any more vales for us   but no it is better than that   coach is there another stranger come to the house   but ay such a stranger as will make all our lives easy   guard what is he a lord   but a lord no nothing like it  he is a conjurer   coach a conjurer what is he come a wooing to my lady   but no no you fool he is come a purpose to lay the spirit   coach ay marry that is good news indeed but where is he   but he is locked up with the steward in his office they are laying their heads together very close i fancy they are casting a figure   guard prithee john what sort of a creature is a conjurer   but why he is made much as other men are if it was not for his long gray beard   coach look ye peter it stands with reason that a conjurer should have a long gray beard  for did ye ever know a witch that was not an old woman   guard why i remember a conjurer once at a fair that to my thinking was a very smockfacd man and yet he spewed out fifty yards of green ferret i fancy john if thou would get him into the pantry and give him a cup of ale he would show us a few tricks do think we could not persuade him to swallow one of thy caseknives for his diversion he will certainly bring it up again   but peter thou art such a wiseacre thou do not know the difference between a conjurer and a jugler this man must be a very great master of his trade his beard is at least half a yard long he is dressed in a strange dark cloak as black as a cole your conjurer always goes in mourning   guard is he a gentleman had he a sword by his side   but no no he is too grave a man for that a conjurer is as grave as a judge  but he had a long white wand in his hand   coach you may be sure there is a good deal of virtue in that wand  i fancy it is made out of witch elm   guard i warrant you if the ghost appears he will whisk ye that wand before his eyes and strike you the drumstick out of his hand   but no the wand look ye is to make a circle and if he once gets the ghost in a circle then he has him  let him get out again if he can a circle you must know is a conjurers trap   coach but what will he do with him when he has him there   but why then he will overpower him with his learning   guard if he can once compass him and get him in lobspound he will make nothing of him but speak a few hard words to him and perhaps bind him over to his good behavior for a thousand years   coach ay ay hell send him packing to his grave again with a flea in his ear i warrant him   but no no i would advise madam to spare no cost if the conjurer be but well paid he will take pains upon the ghost and lay him look ye in the red sea  and then he is laid for ever   coach ay marry that would spoil his drum for him   guard why john there must be a power of spirits in that same red sea  i warrant ye they are as plenty as fish   coach well i wish after all that he may not be too hard for the conjurer i am afraid he will find a tough bit of work on it   guard i wish the spirit may not carry a corner of the house off with him   but as for that peter you may be sure that the steward has made his bargain with the cunningman beforehand that he shall stand to all costs and damages  but hark yonder is mrs abigal we shall have her with us immediately if we do not get off   guard ay lads if we could get mrs abigal well laid too  we should lead merry lives  for to a man like me that is stout and bold a ghost is not so dreadful as a scold  act iii scene i scene opens and discovers sir george in vellums office sir g i wonder i dont hear of vellum yet but i know his wisdom will do nothing rashly the fellow has been so used to

will engage to give a good account of him i am more in pain about tinsel when a ladys in the case i am more afraid of one fop than twenty conjurers   ab to tell you truly he presses his attacks with so much impudence that he has made more progress with my lady in two days than you did in two months   fan i shall attack her in another manner if thou can but procure me another interview there is

respect   ab believe me mr fantome there is not so great a difference between woman and woman as you imagine you see tinsel has nothing but his sauciness to recommend him   fan tinsel is too great a coxcomb to be capable of love  and let me tell thee abigal a man who is sincere in his passion makes but a very awkard profession of it  but i will mend my manners   ab ay or you will never gain a

lady ay i know you wits have your commonplace jests upon us poor widows   tin i will tell you a story widow i know a certain lady who considering the craziness of her husband had in case of mortality engaged her self to two young fellows of my acquaintance they grew such desperate rivals for her while her husband was alive that one of them pinkd the the other in a duel but the good lady was no sooner a widow but what did my dowager do why faith being a woman of honor she married a third to whom it seems she had given her first promise   lady and this is a true story upon your own knowledge
