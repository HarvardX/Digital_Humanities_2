avete gl intelletti sani mirate la dottrina che si asconde sotto il velame degli versi strant dante inferno canto   preface it seems to be a kind of duty incumbent on those who devote themselves to poetry to raise if possible the dignity of a declining art by making it as beneficial to life and manners as the limits of composition and the character of modern times will allow the ages indeed are past in which the song of the poet was idolized for its miraculous effects yet a poem intended to promote the cultivation of good humor may still perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of some little service to society in general or if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by sober reason it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delusions in which a poetical enthusiast may be safely indulged  the following production owes its existence to an incident in real life very similar to the principal action of the last canto but in forming the general plan of the work it seemed to me absolutely necessary to introduce both the agency and the abode of spleen notwithstanding the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of pope i considered his cave of spleen as a most exquisite cabinet picture and to avoid the servility of imitation i determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy power on a much wider canvass happy indeed if the judgment of the public may enable me to exclaim with the honest vanity of the painter who compared his own works to the divine productions of raphael e son pittore anch io  the celebrated alessandro tassoni who is generally considered as the inventor of the modern heroicomic poetry was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters but even gave a ms copy of his work to his native city of modena with an inscription in which he styled it a new species of poetry invented by himself  a few partial friends have asserted that the present performance has some degree of similar merit but as i apprehend all the novelty it possesses may rather require an apology than entitle its author to challenge commendation i shall explain how far the conduct of the poem differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing and slightly mention the poetical effects which such a variation appeared likely to produce  it is well known that the favorite poems which blend the serious and the comic represent their principal characters in a satirical point of view it was the intention of tassoni though prudence made him attempt to conceal it to satirize a particular italian nobleman who happened to be the object of his resentment boileau openly ridicules the french ecclesiastics in his lutrin garth our english physicians in his dispensary and the rape of the lock itself that most excellent and enchanting poem which i never contemplate but with new idolatry is denominated the best satire extant by the learned dr warton in his very clegant and ingenious but severe essay on pope a sentence which seems to be confirmed by the poet himself in his letter to mrs fermor where he says the character of belinda as it is now managed resembles you in nothing but in beauty though i think that no composition can surpass or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of genius as a sportive satire i imagined it might be possible to give a new character to this mixed species of poetry and to render it by its object though not in its execution more noble than the most beautiful and refined satire can be we have seen it carried to inimitable perfection in the most delicate raillery on female foibles  it remained to be tried if it might not also aspire to delineate the more engaging features of female excellence the idea appeared to me worth the experiment for if it succeeded it seemed to promise a double advantage first it would give an air of novelty to the poem and secondly what i thought of much greater importance it would render it more interesting to the heart on these principles i have endeavored to paint serena as a most lovely engaging and accomplished character yet i hope the coloring is so faithfully copied from general nature that every man who reads the poem may be happy enough to know many fair ones who resemble my heroine  there is another point in which i have also attempted to give this poem an air of novelty i mean the manner of connecting the real and the visionary scenes which compose it by shifting these in alternate cantos i hoped to make familiar incident and allegorical picture afford a strong relief to each other and keep the attention of the reader alive by an appearance particularly diversified i wished indeed but i fear most ineffectually for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of ariosto and the more serious sublime painting of dante with some portion of the enchanting elegance the refined imagination and the moral graces of pope and to do this if possible without violating those rules of propriety which mr cambridge has illustrated by example as well as precept in the scribleriad and in his sensible preface to that elegant and learned poem  i have now very frankly informed my reader of the extent or rather of the extravagance of my desire for i will not give it the serious name of design they whom an enlightened taste has rendered thoroughly sensible how very difficult it must be to accomplish such an idea will not only be the first to discern but the most ready to pardon those errors into which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me i had thoughts of introducing this performance to the public by a dissertation of considerable length on this species of poetry but i forbear to indulge myself any farther in such preliminary remarks as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce from the reflection that however ingeniously written they add little or nothing to the success of a good poem and are utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect or oblivion which is the inevitable fate of a bad one  in dismissing a work to my fair readers which is intended principally for their perusal i shall only recommend it to their attention and bid them farewell in the words of the pleasant and courteous tassoni  vaglia il buon voler s altro non lice e chi la leggera viva felice   eartham jan         the triumphs of temper canto i the minds soft guardian who though yet unsung inspires with harmony the female tongue and gives improving every tender grace the smile of angels to a mortal face her powers i sing and scenes of mental strife which form the maiden for the accomplished wife where the sweet victor sees with sparkling eyes love her reward and happiness her prize daughters of beauty who the song inspire to your enchanting notes attune my lyre and o if happily your soft hearts may gain or use or pleasure from the motley strain though formal critics with a surly frown deny your artless bard the laurel crown he still shall triumph if ye deign to spread your sweeter myrtle round his honored head in your bright circle young serena grew a lovelier nymph the pencil never drew for the fond graces formed her easy mien and heavens soft azure in her eye was seen she seemed a rosebud when it first receives the genial sun in its expanding leaves for now she entered those important years when the full bosom swells with hopes and fears when conscious nature prompts the secret sigh and sheds sweet languor over the melting eye when nobler toys the female heart trepan and dolls rejected yield their place to man beneath a fathers care serena grew the good sir gilbert to his country true a faithful whig who zealous for the state in freedoms service led the loud debate yet every day by transmutation rare turned to a tory in his elbowchair and made his daughter pay however absurd passive obedience to his sovereign word in his domestic sway he borrowed aid from prim penelope an ancient maid his upright sister conscious of her worth who valued still her beauty and her birth though from her birth no envied rank she gained and of her beauty but the ghost remained a restless ghost that with remembrance keen proclaimed incessant what it once had been delighted still the steps of youth to haunt to watch the tender nymph and warm gallant and with an eye that petrified pursuit hang like the dragon over the hesperian fruit though strictly guarded by this jealous power the mild serena no restraint could sour pure was her bosom as the silver lake ere rising winds the ruffled water shake when the bright pageants of the morning sky across the expansive mirror lightly fly by vernal gales in quick succession driven while the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven in gay content a sportive life she led the child of modesty by virtue bred her light companions innocence and ease her hope was pleasure and her wish to please for this to fashion early rites she paid for this to venus secret vows she made nor held it sin to cast a private glance over the dear pages of a new romance eager in fictions touching scenes to find a field to exercise her youthful mind the touching scenes new energy impressed on all the virtues of her feeling breast sweet evelinas fascinating power had first beguiled of sleep her midnight hour possessed by sympathys enchanting sway she read unconscious of the dawning day the modern anecdote was next conveyed beneath her pillow by her faithful maid the nymph attentive as the brooding dove pored over the tender scenes of franzels love the sinking taper now grew weak and pale serena sighed and dropped the unfinished tale but as warm clouds in vernal ether roll the soft ideas floated in her soul free from ambitious pride and envious care to love and to be loved was all her prayer while these fond thoughts her gentle mind possessed soft slumber settled on her snowy breast scarce had her radiant eyes began to close when to her view a friendly vision rose a fairy phantom struck her mental sight light as the gossamer as ether bright arrayed like pallas was the pigmy form when the sage goddess stills the martial storm her casque was amber richly graced above with down collected from the callow dove her burnished breast plate of a deeper dye was once the armor of a golden fly a lynxs eye her little aegis shone by fairy spells converted into stone and worn of old as elfin poets sing by aegypts lovely queen a favorite ring mysterious power was in the magic toy to turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy her tiny lance whose radiance streamed afar was one bright sparkle from the bridal star a filmy mantle round her figure played fine as the texture by arachne laid over some young plant when glittering to the view with many an orient pearl of morning dew the phantom hovered over the conscious fair with such a lively smile of tender care as on her elfin lord titania cast when first she found his angry spell was past round her rich locks serena chanced to tie an ample ribband of caerulean dye high over her forehead rose the graceful bow whose arch commanded the sweet scene below the hovering spirit viewed the tempting spot and lightly perched on this unbending knot as the fair flutterer of psyches race is seen to terminate her airy chase when pleased at length her quivering wings to close fondly she settles on the fragrant rose now in soft notes more musically clear than ever fairy breathed in mortal ear these words the visionary voice conveyed to the charmed spirit of the sleeping maid thou darling of my care whose ripened worth shall spread my empire over the smiling earth whom nature blessed forbidding modish art to cramp thy spirit or contract thy heart screend from thy thought nor in thy visions felt long on thy opening mind i have fondly dwelt in childhoods sorrows brought thee quick relief and dried thy april showers of infant grief taught thee to laugh at the malicious boy who broke thy playthings with a barbarous joy to bear what ills the little female haunt the testy nurse the imperious governante and that tyrannic pest the prying maiden aunt now ripening years a nobler scene supply for life now opens on thy sparkling eye thy rising bosom swells with just desire rapture to feel and rapture to inspire not the vain bliss the transitory joys that childish woman feels in radiant toys the costly diamond or the lighter pearl the massive nabob or the tinsel earl thy heart demands each meaner aim above the imperishable wealth of sterling love thy wish to please by every softer grace of elegance and ease of form and face by lively fancy and by sense refined the stronger magic of the cultured mind thy pure ambition and thy virtuous plan to fix the variable heart of man short is the worship paid at beautys shrine but lasting love and happiness are mine mine though the earths mistaken blinded race despise my influence and my name debase nor breathe one vow to that aetherial friend on whom the colors of their life depend but to thy innocence i will now display the mystic marvels of my secret sway and tell in this thy fatedeciding hour my race my name my office and my power first hear what wonders human forms contain and learn the texture of the female brain by natures care in curious order spread this living net is framed of tender thread fine as thy hand some favored youth to grace knits with nice art to form the mimic lace within the center of this fretted dome her secret tower her heavenconstructed home soft sensibility sweet beautys soul keeps her coy state and animates the whole invisible as harmony who springs waked by young zephyr from aeolian strings her subtle power more delicately fine dwells in each thread and lives in every line whose quick vibrations without end impart pleasure and pain to the responsive heart as zephyrs breath the willing chord inspires whispering soft music to the trembling wires so with fond care i regulate unseen the softer movements of this nice machine temper my earthly name the nurse of love but called sophrosyne in realms above when lovely woman perfect at her birth blessed with her early charms the wondering earth her soul in sweet simplicity arrayed nor shared my guidance nor required my aid her tender frame nor confident nor coy had every fiber tuned to gentle joy no vain caprices swelled her pouting lip no gold produced a mercenary trip soft innocence inspired her willing kiss her love was nature and her life was bliss guide of his reason not his passions prey she tamed the savage man who blessed her sway no jarring wishes filled the world with woes but youth was ecstacy and age repose the powers of mischief met in dark divan to blast these mighty joys of envied man the fiends at their infernal leaders call framed their base wiles in demogorgons hall in the deep center of that dreadful dome an hellish cauldron boiled with fiery foam in this wide urn the circling spirits threw ingredients harsh and hideous to the view page     stothard del sharp sculpt  london published sept  st      by t cadell strand   while the terrific master of the spell with adjurations shook the depths of hell and in dark words unmeet for mortal ear bade the dire offspring of his art appear forth from the vase with sullen murmurs broke a towering mass of pestilential smoke emerging from this fog of thickest night a phantom swells by slow degrees to sight but ere the view can seize the forming shape from the mocked eye its lineaments escape it seemed all passions melted into one assumed the face of all and yet was none hell stood aghast at its portentous mien and shuddering demons called the spectre spleen hie thee to earth its mighty master cried over the vexed globe in heavy vapors ride within its center fix thy shadowy throne with shades thy subjects and that hell thy own reign there unseen but let thy strong control be hourly felt in womans wayward soul with darkest poisons from our deep abyss taint that pure fountain of terrestrial bliss the enormous phantom at this potent sound rolled forth obedient from the vast profound the quaking fiends recovered from their dread and hell grew lighter as the monster fled but now round earth the gliding vapors run blot the rich ether and eclipse the sun all nature sickens and her fairest flower enchanting woman feels the baneful power as in her soul the clouds of spleen arise the sprightly essence of her beauty flies in youths gay prime in hours with rapture warm love looks astonished on her altering form to pleasing frolics and enchanting wiles lifedarting looks and soulsubduing smiles dark whims succeed thickcoming fancies fret the sullen passion and the hasty pet the swelling lip the teardistended eye the peevish question the perverse reply the moody humor that like rain and fire blends cold disgust with unsubdud desire flies what it loves and petulantly coy feigns proud abhorrence of the proffered joy for natures artless aim the wish to please by genuine modesty and simple ease fashions pert tricks the crowded brain oppress with all the poor parade of tawdry dress the sickly bosom pants for noise and show for every bauble and for every beau the voice that health made harmony disowns that native charm for languors mimic tones and feigns disease till feeling what it feigns its fancied maladies are real pains such and a thousand still superior woes from spleens new empire over the earth arose each simple dictate of the soul forgot then first was formed the mercenary plot andbeauty practiced that pernicious art the art of angling for an old mans heart though crawling to his bride with tottering knees his words were dotage and his love disease from sex to sex this base contagion ran and gold grew beauty in the eyes of man courtship was traffic and the married life but one loud jangle of incessant strife the gentle sprite who on his radiant car shines the mild regent of the eveningstar and joys from thence those genial rays to shed that lead the bridegroom to the nuptial bed while earths new ills his friendly soul absorb from cynthia called me to his kindred orb and eager to redress the woes of man the brilliant son of vesper thus began thou softest being of the aetherial kind be thy benignant cares no more confined to smooth the ruffled plume of zephyrs wing to guard from cruel frost the infant spring to drive gross atoms from the rays of noon or chase the halo from the vapourish moon thy friendly nature will not now deny to quit for nobler toils thy native sky thou see how spleens infernal vapors roll across the sweet serene of womans soul and earth which darkens as her beauties fade must grow a second hell without thy aid take then thy station fix thy nobler reign over those fine chords that form the female brain that used ere injured by the rust of spleen to fill with harmony the human scene go lest her touch their tender tones destroy teach them to vibrate to thy notes of joy go and restore by stilling mental strife health to faint love and happiness to life so spoke that friend of man who lights above his heavenly lamp of hymenaeal love in his just aim my kindred spirit joined and flew obedient to the charge assigned hence as the biass sways the unconscious bowl i long unseen have swayed the careless soul though often i feel my power by spleen subdued in the shrill vixen and the sullen prude in some fair forms my soft dominion grows like fragance rising from the opening rose still i preserve in many a lovely face that gay good humor and that constant grace which heavenly powers united to infold in perfect womans newcreated mould when nature in her infant beauty blessed the last and loveliest of her works carest but of those nymphs who delicately fair draw their soft graces from my forming care my young serena shines her peers above pride of my hopes and darling of my love hence i to thee such mysteries unfold as mans pedantic eye shall never behold whose narrow science though it proudly boast to pierce the sky and count the starry host sees not the lucid band of airy powers who flutter round him in his secret hours but if to me thy guardian now displayed thy duteous orisons are justly paid thou to those realms shall pass with me thy guide where spleens pale victims after death reside then to that orb in vision shall thou rise unseen by mortal astronomic eyes where i  but first let me thy soul prepare to meet our secret foes insidious snare it is my fond purpose in thy form to show the sweetest model of my skill below a youth i destine to thy dear embrace crowned with each mental charm and manly grace with whom thy innocence secure from strife shall reap the beauteous joys of blameless life pleased i observe thy little heart begin to ask what charms the mighty prize may win but know though elegance herself be seen to guide thy motion and to form thy mien though beauty over thy filial cheek diffuse the soft enchantment of her roseate hues not from their favor shall this glory rise temper shall singly gain the splendid prize the sudden conquest shall be mine alone and love with transport shall my triumph own such are my hopes but i with pain relate what hard conditions are annexed by fate as chemic fires that patient labor blows draw the rich perfume from the persian rose so must thou form by fiery toils refined the living essence of thy sweeter mind dimly i see on destinys dull glass three dangerous trials it is thy doom to pass and oh if once forgetful of my power good humor fail thee in the fatal hour farewell those joys that wait the happy wife farewell the vision of unclouded life fain would my love thy secret perils show which fate allows not even me to know in spleens dark court a thousand agents dwell who bind her victims in the wayward spell perchance three prime supporters of her sway the busiest of her fiends may cross thy way stern contradiction her illfavored child of fierce demeanor and of spirit wild bane of delight and horror of the sex his plan to puzzle and his pride to vex  or scandal filthy hag who blindly limps round the wide earth supported by her imps her inky demons who delight to print her base suggestion and her envious hint  or groundless jealousy pert changeling born of amorous vanity and angry scorn whose bitter taunts with public insult dare basely to wound the unoffending fair proud the sweet joys of innocence to crush and spread over beautys cheek the burning blush whether these kindred fiends or one or all shall aim thy airy spirit to enthrall are points my fondness tries in vain to reach but trust my caution and beware of each lest to thy lively mind my words may seem the vain chimera of a common dream by one unquestionable sign be taught to prize my presence in thy waking thought an azure ribband on thy toilet thrown shall make the magic of my empire known on this thy sportive needle tried its powers and silver spangles formed the mimic flowers on these my love shall breathe a secret charm with this my caestus thy soft bosom arm above it let the decent tucker rise to hide the mystic band from mortal eyes when spleens dark powers would teach that breast to swell this guardian cincture shall those powers repel as the touched talisman more swift than thought to save her charge the arabian fairy brought so shall this zone if justly i am obeyed bring my soft spirit to thy certain aid in loves great name observe this high behest revere my power  be gentle and be blessed here the kind sprite her friendly counsel closed and lightly vanished  still serena dozd still in sweet trance she fondly seemed to hear the soft persuasion vibrate in her ear but waking now far different notes she found less pleasing echoes in her chamber sound for now the heralds of the london day sing their loud mattins in the uncrowded way the impatient milkmaid now with early din screams to the rattle of her pail of tin with sweeps faint cry and latest of the crew the deeptond music of the murmuring jew end of the first canto canto ii ye radiant nymphs whose opening eyes convey warmth to the world and luster to the day think what oershadowing clouds may cross your brain before those lovely lids shall close again what funds of patience twelve long hours may ask when cold discretion claims her daily task ah think betimes and while your morning care sheds foreign odors over your fragrant hair tinge your soft spirit with that mental sweet which may not be exhaled by passions heat but charm the sense with undecaying power through every chance of each diurnal hour o might you all perceive your toilets crowned with such cosmetics as serena found for to the warning vision fondly true now the quick fairone to the toilet flew with keen delight her ravished eye surveyed the mystic ribband on her mirror laid bright shone the azure as auroras car and every spangle seemed a living star with sportive grace the smiling damsel pressed the guardian cincture to her snowy breast more lovely far than juno when she strove to look most lovely in the eyes of jove and willing venus lent her every power that sheds enchantment over the amorous hour for spells more potent on this band were thrown than venus boasted in her beauteous zone her dazzling caestus could alone inspire the sudden impulse of shortlived desire these finer threads with lasting charms are fraught here lies the tender but unchanging thought silence that wins where eloquence is vain and tones that harmonize the madning brain soft sighs that anger cannot hear and live and smiles that tell how truly they forgive and lively grace whose gay diffusive light puts the black phantoms of the brain to flight whose cheering powers through every period last and make the present happy as the past such secret charms this richer zone possessed whose flowers now sparkling on serenas breast give though unseen those swelling orbs they bind smiles to her face and beauty to her mind for now observant of the sprites behest the nymph conceals them by her upper vest safe lies the spell no mortal may descry not keen penelopes allpiercing eye who constant as the steps of morn advance surveys the household with a searching glance and entering now with all her usual care reviews the chamber of the youthful fair beneath the pillow not completely hid the novel lay  she saw  she seized  she chid with rage and glee her glaring eye balls flash ah wicked age she cries ah filthy trash from the first page my just abhorrence springs for modern anecdotes are monstrous things yet will i see what dangerous poisons lurk to taint thy youth in this licentious work she said and rudely from the chamber rushed her pallid cheek with expectation flushed with ardent hope her eager spirit shook vain hope to banquet on a luscious book so if a priest of the arabian sect in turkish hands forbidden wine detect the sacred mussulman with pious din arraigns the culprit and proclaims the sin curses with holy zeal the inflaming juice but cursing takes it for his secret use the gay serena with unruffled mind the pleasing novel thus unread resigned the vision on her soul such virtue left she only smiled at the provoking theft the teazing incident she deemed a jest nor felt the zone grow tighter on her breast now in full charms descends the finished fair for now the morning banquet claims her care already at the board with viands pild her sire impatient sits and chides his tardy child on his imperial lips rude hunger reigns and keener politics usurp his brains but when her loveinspiring voice he hears when the soft magic of her smile appears in that glad moment he at once forgets his empty stomach and the nations debts he bends to natures more divine control and only feels the father in his soul quick to his hand behold her now present the indian liquor of celestial scent not with more grace the nectard cup is given by roselipd hebe to the lord of heaven while her fair hands a fresh libation pour fashions loud thunder wakes the sounding door the light serena to the window springs on curiositys amusive wings her quick eyes sparkle with surprise to see the glories of a golden visavis its glittering tablet gleamd with mimic pearl and the rich coronet announcd an earl the good old knight grew somewhat proud to hear of this new visit from the early peer serena recollects the visions truth and fluttering hopes it is the promised youth penelope from her high chamber peeps there her unfinished charms she coyly keeps with sage reserve her modesty abhorred to show her morning face before a lord the peer alights the wellrangd vassals bawl his sounding title through the spacious hall till in the deep saloons extremest bound the eartickling words lord filligree resound as when great hector setting war apart advanced to parley with his spear athwart the greeks beheld him with a still delight and silent reverence stopped the rising fight with such respect but unchastisd by fear sir gilbert and the nymph first meet the peer and while his morning compliments commence the slighted breakfast stands in cold suspense but far unlike to hectors ruder grace his modern stature and his modish face nor less he differs from those barons old whose arms are blazoned on his car of gold whose prostrate castle guarded once the lands where spruce in motley pride his villa stands by taste erected in her trimmest mode her mushroom structure and her quaint abode as the neat daisy to the suns broad flower as the french boudoir to the gothic tower such is the peer whom fashion much admires compared in person to his ancient sires for their broad shoulder and their brawny calf their coarse loud language and their coarser laugh his finer form more elegantly slim displays the fasionable length of limb with foreign shrugs his country he regards and her lean tongue with foreign words he lards while gallic graces who correct his style forbid his mirth to pass beyond a smile as the nice workman in the wooden trade hides his coarse ground with finest woods oerlaid thus our young lord with fashions phrase refined fineerd the mean interior of his mind and hence in courtesys soft luster seen his spirit shone as graceful as his mien the artless fair on fashions kind report thought him the mirror of a matchless court much she his dress his language much observes whose finer accents prove his feeling nerves her fancy now the destined lover spies but her free heart abjures the quick surmise yet as he spoke at every flattering word the visions promise to her thought recurrd far more parental pride contrives to blind the good sir gilberts moreexperiencd mind who fondly saw and at the prospect smiled a future countess in his favorite child but what new flutterings shook serenas breast what hopes and fears the modest nymph oppressed when with a simpering smile and soft regard the peer displayed a mirthexpressive card where the gay graces in a sportive band show the sweet art of ciprianis hand where in their train his airy cupids throng and laughing drag a comic mask along we cries my lord with selfsufficient joy twirling with lordly airs the graceful toy we who possess true science we who give the world a lesson in the art to live we for the the fair a splendid fete design and pay our homage thus at beautys shrine he spoke and speaking to the blushing maid with modish ease the inviting card conveyed where mirth announcd her masquedevoted hour in characters intwind with many a flower the blushing maid with eyes of quick desire viewed it and felt her little soul on fire for of all scenes she had not yet surveyed her heart most panted for a masquerade but her gay hopes increasing terrors drown and dread forebodings of her fathers frown in mute suspense to read his thought she tries and strongly pleads with her prevailing eyes her eyes for doubt enchaind her modest tongue while on his sovereign word her pleasure hung with such a tender and persuasive air of soft endearment and of anxious care thetis attended from the almighty sire his fateful answer to her fond desire the good old knight like the olympian god blessed the fair suppliant with his gracious nod her lively spirit the kind signal took and her glad heart in every fiber shook the party settled it imports not how the peer politely made his parting bow the nymph with eyes that sparkled joyous fire kissed the round cheek of her complying sire then swiftly flew and summoned to her aid the important counsel of her favorite maid to vent her joy and as the moments press to fix that first of points a fancydress quick as the poets eyes over nature fly piercing the deep or traversing the sky with such light speed her fond ideas glance over play and poem story and romance while all the characters she ever has read flash on her brain and fill her busy head now in dianas form she hopes to meet a fond endymion sighing at her feet now her proud thought terrestrial pomp assumes and dians crescent yields to indian plumes now in the habit of the grecian isles she hears some osman suing for her smiles and sees his soul that blaze of dress outshine whose wealth impoverished a diamondmine now simpler charms her quick attention draw the rosecrownd bonnet and the hat of straw a villagemaid she seems in neat attire a faithful shepherd now her sole desire thus as new figures in her fancy throng she is every thing by starts and nothing

power which sure though slow corrodes the unconscious prey and ends its triumph on a distant day page     stothard del heath sculp  published july  st      by t cadell strand   thus the departing fury left behind her venom latent in sir gilberts mind the hidden mischief though no eye observes he feels it fretting on his altered nerves but the kind habit of his healthy soul still struggled hard against its base control now spleens dark vapors in his bosom hid prompt him the promised pleasure to forbid now loves soft pleadings that dire thought destroy and save the blossom of his daughters joy her envious aunt now serves him for a jest and gay good humor reassumes his breast while spleens dark power now sinks and now revives at length the day the important day arrives which in his breast must end the close debate and fix the color of serenas fate now comes the hour when the convivial knight waits to begin the dinners cheerful rite his fond heart ever with a fathers pride joys to behold his darling at his side but most the absence of her smile he feels in the gay season of his social meals hence while for her the rich repast attends his hasty summons to the nymph he sends the happy nymph superior cares induce to risk his anger by a rash excuse she craves his pardon but for time distressed she still is busy on her magic vest to range her diamonds in a sparkling zone she begs to snatch her scanty meal alone the knight in sullen state begins to dine spleen like a harpy flutters over his wine invisible she poisons every dish tinging with gall his mutton fowl and fish the more he eats the more perverse he grows for as his hunger sunk his choler rose the cloth removed he cries with vapors sick the pears are mellow and the port is thick though nicer fruit pomona never knew and his rich wine surpassed the rubys hue a thousand times his dizzy brain revolves a stern command now doubts and now resolves to bid the nymph descend and disarrayd quit her dear project of the masquerade as often kind nature to his heart recurrd and love parental stopped the cruel word mean time unconscious of the brooding storm the nymph exults in her improving form gay is her smile as those the queen of love darts on the graces in her court above while they contrive with loveinspiring cares new modes of beauty for the robe she wears at length each duty of the toilet past the glance of triumph on the mirror cast now the light wand our finished ariel arms glad jenny glories in her ladys charms and gives full utterance as she smooths her vest to the sweet bodings of serenas

goal anticipates the prize such was serenas feardiscarding state her eye beheld not the dark frowns of fate she only saw the combat all forgot the triumph promised as her glorious lot now eager to

chaperones informed she need not wait so change your dress and sit with me sedate as the proud dame whose avaricious glee built golden castles in the rich south sea gazed on her broker when he told her first her wealth was vanished and the bubble burst so gazed the nymph hearing her sire destroy her airy palace of ideal joy first her fond thoughts to flattering doubt incline and deem the harsh command no fixed design but the quick sally of a peevish word that love revokes the moment it is heard or happily mirth in mimic wrath expressed a feigned forbiddance uttered but in jest to this short hope her sinking spirit clung to see his softening eyes refute his tongue ah fruitless hope for there she cannot find the wellknown signals of the friendly mind stern contradiction with the frown of fate on his dark visage reigned in sullen state felt in each feature in each accent shown lowered in his look and thundered in his tone hence the warm bosom of the lively fair now shivers with the chill of blank despair now disappointments thickning shadows roll a cloud of horror over the darkened soul and fancy in a sick delirium tossed gives double value to each pleasure lost the blasted joys she labors to forget rush on her mind and waken keen regret her cheek turns pale  the tear prepares to start and palpitation heaves her swelling heart but here sophrosyne thy guardian aid saves from her potent foe the sinking maid her bosom into strong emotions thrown now feels the pressure of thy friendly zone swift thy kind cautions to her soul recur more quick to cancel faults than prone to err as the rough swell of the insurgent tides by the mild impulse of the moon subsides so by her mystic monitor represt the flood of passion leaves her lightened breast from her clear brain each cloudy vapor flies and joys bright ray rekindles in her eyes reviving gaiety full luster spread over all her features and with smiles she said let others drive to pleasures distant dome be mine the dearer joy to please at home scarce had she spoke when she with sportive ease pressed her pianofortes favorite keys over softest notes her rapid fingers ran sweet prelude to the air she thus began sophrosyne thou guard unseen whose delicate control can turn the discord of chagrin to harmony of soul above the lyre the lute above be mine thy melting tone which makes the peace of all we love the basis of our own so sung the nymph not uninspird the sprite invoked so fondly in the mystic rite with richest music swelled her warbling throat and gave new sweetness to her sweetest note as when the seraph uriel first begun his carol to the newcreated sun the sacred echo shook the vast profound and chaos perished at the potent sound so at the magic of serenas strain spleen vanished from her sires chaotic brain whose fibers lightened of that load rejoice in the dear accents of her dulcet voice much he inclines his mandate to recall and send the fairone to the promised ball but stubborn pride forbids him to revoke the solemn sentence which illhumour spoke still conscious of her power the nymph prolongs the soft enchantment of her soothing songs which his fond mind in firm attention keep to his fixed hour of supper and of sleep this now arrived the knight retiring shed a double blessing on his darlings head and with unusual exultation pressed his lovely child to his parental breast thus while to rest the happy sire withdrew the nymph more happy to her chamber flew and jenny now dismissed the grateful fair breathes to her guardian sprite this tender prayer thou kind preserver whose attentive zeal gives me in this contented hour to feel that dearest pleasure of a soul refined the triumph of the selfcorrected mind if happy in the strength thy smiles impart i own thy favor in no thankless heart still let me view thy form so justly dear still in kind visions to these eyes appear thy friendly dictates teach me to fulfill and let thy aid avert each future ill while fond devotion

transporters of the excursive soul ye visions that when night enwraps the pole the lively wanderer to new worlds convey escaping from her heavy house of clay how could the gentle spirit foe to strife bear without you this coil of waking life its griefembitterd cares its joyless mirth and all the flat realities of earth it is you sweet phantoms who new powers inspire who give to beauty charms to fancy fire when soaring like the eagles kindred frame the poet dreams of everlasting fame or tickled by the feather of the dove the softer virgin dreams of endless love there was a time when fortunes bright decrees were seen to realize such dreams as these now dangerous visions the fond mind decoy vainly to hope for unexisting joy while belles and bards with mournful sighs exclaim mortality has seized both love and fame ah fair serena might the boast be ours to clear from such a charge these heavenly powers blessed might thy bard deserve in fame to see a guard as faithful as love proves to thee blessed if that airy being gild his life who saved thee trembling on the brink of strife and now kind prompter of thy nightly dream filled thy rapt spirit with her sacred beam for soon as slumber set thy soul at large thy guardian power revisited her charge and lightly hovering over the illumined bed thus with fond smiles of approbation said well have thou past sweet maid one trying scene one fiery ordeal of the tyrant spleen thus my serena may thy force sustain each harder trial that may yet remain against the fiend to fortify thy soul by useful knowledge of her dark control i come to show thee what no mortal eye save thine was ever permitted to descry the realms where spleens infernal agents goad the ghostly tenants of her drear abode now summon all thy strength throw fear aside and firmly trust in thy aetherial guide she spoke and through the nights surrounding shade the obedient nymph not unappalld conveyed through long long tracts of darkness on they past with speed that struck the trembling maid aghast till now recovering by degrees she found her soft foot press upon the solid ground encouraged by her guide at length she tries to search the gloomy scene with anxious

here through scenes of endless vapors hurled are punished in the forms they plagued the world justly they feel no joy who none bestow all ye who enter every hope forego over an arched cavern rough with horrid stone on which a feeble light by flashes shone these characters that chilled her soul with dread serena fixed in silent wonder read as she began to speak her voice was drowned by the shrill echo of far other sound forth from the portal lamentable cries of wailing infants without number rise compassion to this poor and piteous flock led the soft maid still nearer to the rock the pining band within she now espied and touched with tender indignation cried how could these little forms of life so brief deserve this dire abode of lasting grief   well may thy gentle heart be sore concerned at sight so moving the mild sprite returned thou see in those whose wailings wound thy ears the puny progeny of modern peers their sires by avarice or ambition led aliens to love approached the nuptial bed with proud indifference and with cold distaste their homely brides reluctantly embraced and by such union gave disastrous birth to these poor pale encumbrances of earth who bred in vanity with pride their dower were spleens sure victims from their natal hour and in their splendid cradles pulled and pined till fate their illspun thread of life untwind and to this vestibule conveyed their ghosts to form the vanguard of the infernal hosts but let not pitys ineffectual charm impede thy progress or thy strength disarm follow and fear not guarded by my care from all the phantoms that around thee glare she spoke and entered ere the nymph replied a pass that opened in the caverns side low dark and rocky  with her body bent serena followed down the dire descent a sudden light soon struck her dazzled view but twas a light of such infernal hue as double horror to the darkness gave with dread reflection from a dusky wave round a black water tattered specter stand with each a tiny taper in its hand fierce mendicants who strive some alms to win from the fair wanderer with incessant din the guardian spirit saw serena grieve to hear of wants she knew not to relieve and to the generous nymph in pity cries the gulf of indolence before us lies over whose dull flood to which no bank is seen a boat must waft thee to the dome of spleen these pallid figures that around thee press and haunt thee with importunate distress on earth were beggars of each different class though blended here in one promiscuous mass the poor who spurned kind industrys control the rich who begged from penury of soul both by their abject pride alike debased blasphemed that nature which they both disgraced and hither by the sullen fiend conveyed here still they ply their ineffectual trade in chase of each new passenger they run condemned to beg from all to gain bynone but from these wretches turn thy fruitless care behold the gulf before thee and beware nor touch the stream which mortal sense oercomes and by its baleful charm the soul benumbs  can mortal pass the shuddring nymph replied this sullen slow unnavigable tide in whose black current this enormous mound of shapeless stone appears this horrid bound that seems an everlasting guard to keep over the dull waters that beneath it creep while yet she spoke with a resounding shock forth from the arch of the impending rock which over the murmuring eddy hung so low the lazy river scarce had room to flow of rude construction and in roughest plight a boat now issued to serena s sight an empty boat that slowly to the shore advanced without the aid of sail or oar selfmovd it seemed but soon the nymph beheld a grifly figure who the stern impelled wading behind the horrid form appeared above the water his strong arm he reared and cross the creeping flood the crazy vessel steered the heavenly sprite observed her trembling ward whose growing fears the hideous pass abhorred and cheering thus she spoke this spectre boasts the chief dominion of these dreary coasts to him thy pilot without dread consign and place thy body in his bark supine so through this arching rock thou wilt pass alone safe from the perils of the incumbent stone embark undaunted  on the farther side thou wilt surely find me thy unfailing guide nor let this pilot raise thy groundless dread this sullen charon of the froward dead a phantom never blessed with human life though often on earth his noxious power is rife and in that region never from error free the words he dictates are assigned to me observe this fiend that nature scorned to frame offspring of pride and apathy his name passions he never can feel and never impart a miscreated imp without a heart in place of which his subtle parent pinned a bladder filled with circulating wind which seems with mimic life the mass to warm and gives false vigor to his bloated form but place thee in the boat his arms direct my love shall watch thee and my power protect so spoke the friendly sprite the obedient maid her form along the narrow vessel laid but oh what terrors shake her tender soul as from the shore the bark begins to roll and severed from her friend her eyes discern the steering spectre wading at the stern far stronger fears her resolution melt than those which erst the bard of florence felt when by the honored shade of virgil led through all the dreary circles of the dead hells fiercest demons threatened to divide the living poet from his shadowy guide page     stothard del heath sculpt  london published septr  st      by t cadell strand   and bade him friendless and alone return through the dire horrors of the dark sojourn not long the lovely fairones terrors last for safely through the impending rock she past and slow advancing to the gloomy strand the sullen pilot brings her safe to land there fondly hovering on her guardian plumes the heavenly monitor her charge resumes and smiling leads along the rocky road whose windings open into spleens abode thou queen of shades whose spiritdamping spell too often is seen the poets pride to quell when the sharp workings of unrelishd wit plunge thy pale victim in a bilious fit may i unpunished by thy subtle power dare to display thy subterranean bower and to this wondering upper world explain the shadowy horrors of thy secret reign entering beneath a wide fantastic arch round the drear circuit of the dome they march which a pale flash from many a fiery sprite frequent illumes with intermitting light such as on earth to superstitions eye denounces ruin from the northern sky while she discerns amid the nightly glare armies embattled in the blazing air around the nymph unnumberd phantoms glide here swell the bloated race of bulky pride in close and horrid union there appear the wilder progeny of frantic fear misshapen monsters whose stupendous frame abhorrent nature has refused to name here in cameleon colors lightly flit the motley offspring of disordered wit all things prodigious the wide cave contained and forms beyond what fable ever feigned but as the worm that on the dewy green springs half to view and half remains unseen perceiving near its cell a human tread slinks back to earth and hides its timid head so where the heavenly spirit deigned to lead the startled specter from her step recede and as abashed they from her eye retire sink into mist or melt in fluid fire high on an ebon throne superbly wrought with each fierce figure of fantastic thought in a deep cove where no bright beam intrudes over her black schemes the sullen empress broods the shriekowls mingled with the ravens plume shed over her furrowed brows an aweful gloom a garb that glares with stripes of lurid flame wraps in terrific pomp her haggard frame round her a serpent as her zone is rolled which writhing stings itself in every fold near her pavilion in barbaric state four mutes the mandates of their queen await from sickly fancy bred by sullen sloth both parents curse yet pampered still by both first stands disease an hag of magic power varying her frightful visage every hour her horrors heightening as those changes last and each new form more hideous than the past detraction next a shapeless fiend appears whose shrivelled hand a misty mirror rears framed by malignant art the infernal toy inverts the lovely mien of smiling joy robs roseate beauty of attractive grace and gives a stepdames frown to natures face the third in place but with a fiercer air see the true gorgon disappointment glare by whose petrific power delights overthrown and hopes warm heart

pursues each grave conceit or idle whim in arms in arts in government engages with monarchs poets politicians sages but drops each work the moment it is begun and trying all things can accomplish none yet over each rank and age and sex his sway spreads undiscerned and makes the world his prey the light coquet amid flirtation sighs to find him lurk in pleasures vain disguise and the grave nun discovers in her cell that holy water but augments his spell as the strange monster of the serpent breed that haunts as travelers tell the marshy mead devours each nobler beast though firmly grown to size and strength superior to his own  for on the grazing horse or larger bull subtly he springs of dark saliva full with swiftlydarting tongue his prey anoints with venom potent to dissolve its

dismal deep enormous dungeon blaze stones of red fire the hideous wall composed and massive gates the horrid confine closed the infernal portress of this doleful dome with fiery lips that swelled with poisonous foam pale discord raged with whose tormenting tongue through all its caves the extensive region rung a living vulture was the furys crest and in her hand a rattlesnake she pressed whose angry joints incessantly were heard to found defiance to the screaming bird the boundless depth of this dire prison holds the untamed spirits of imperious scolds nor think that females only fill the cave male termagants have lived and here they rave all of each sex are pent within this pale who knew no use of language but to rail thus to her charge exclaimed the heavenly guide and as she spoke the portals opened wide and to the observance of the shuddering maid the immeasurable den was all displayed but oh what various noises from within fill the vexed air with one stupendous din mournings deep groan and angers furious call terrors loud cry and affectations squall the sob of passion the hysteric scream and shrieks of frenzy in its fierce extreme in this wild uproar every sounds combined

furious look spurned her nice food and bellowed at her cook here justly feels a culinary rack bound like lxion to a whirling jack but lo the tityus of this realm whose hulk is stretched supine and whose enormous bulk to such extent in this wide scene is spread nine acres seem too narrow for his bed this form was once but many years are past since in his civic furs he breathed his last lord

where nine bucks have gored his monstrous haunch see fifty turkies gobble on his paunch over his broad side twelve creeping turtles spread and fowls unnumberd flutter round his head serena gazed but soon she turned away sick with disgust and shuddering with dismay to scenes less hideous let us now repair said the kind guard of the dejected fair and cheering her faint charge her step she led to the near dwelling of the fretful dead of dusky adamant the dungeon rose a dingy mirror its dark sides compose reflecting with a thousand quaint grimaces the pale inhabitants distorted faces here like a dame of quality arrayed sits peevishness presiding over the shade and frowning at her own uncomely mien whose coarse reflection on the wall is seen a snarling lapdog her right hand restrains her lap an infant porcupine contains which while her fondness tries its wrath to still wounds her each moment with a pointed quill the froward spirits here in durance fret whose testy life was one continued pet here they in trifles that vexation find which teased on earth their irritated mind observe the phantom who with eyes askance still to the mirror turns her eager glance see to her cheek incessant as she turns her vexed blood rushes and her visage burns beauty for lasting bliss had formed the maid love to her charms his faithful homage paid but all this swelling tide of joy to check a fatal freckle rises on her neck her soft cosmetics the grieved nymph applies success attends her and the freckle dies but ah this victory avails her not she finds an hydra in the teazing spot fast as one flies another still succeeds and with eternal food her fretful humor feeds near to the nymph in a more moody fit see the pale phantom of a peevish wit mark with what frowns his eager eyes peruse wet from the press three critical reviews with wounded vanitys distracting rage how rapidly he runs through every page he finds some honors lavished on his verse and joys faint gleams his gloomy spirit pierce but oh too soon these feeble sparks decay and keen vexation reassumes her prey hating reproof in every fiber sore one censured particle torments him more more than a hundred happier lines

root the bough still blackens with successive fruit the tribes who taste it burst into a fit of raving mockery and rancorous wit and pleased their tyrants ghastly smile to court by vile distortions

gambols round their work they throng with antic dance and rude discordant song satires rank offals on the block they fling and call it nature to delight their king while in their features he exults to see the frowns of torture mixed with grins of glee for as these abject toils engage the crew their own grim idol darkens to their view wide and more wide its horrid stature spreads and over the tribe new consternation sheds for each forgets in his bewildered gaze it is but a monster which he helped to raise as over its form their dizzy glances roll it strikes a chearless damp through all the soul

sense but trust my care to bear thee safely hence as thus she spoke above the gazing throng high in a sailing cloud the spectre swept along vain of his power of elocution proud in mystic language he harangud the crowd the bounds he marked with measure so precise of equine virtue and of human vice that cursing natures gifts without remorse each sullen hearer wished himself a horse pleased with the pure effect his sermon wrought the ambitious priest a rich tiara caught which hovering over his highaspiring head sarcastic humor dangled by a thread the rich tiara for his temples fit blazed with each polished gem of brilliant wit and sharpfacd irony his darling sprite who raised her patron to this giddy height fast on his brow the dangerous honor bound but in the moment that her priest was crowned his airy throne dissolved and thunder rent the ground forth from the yawning earth with lightnings speed sprang the fierce phantom of a fiery steed spurring his sides whence bloody poison

sound pierced through all the depths of hell the fiends all answered in one hideous yell and in a fearful trance the soft serena fell hence from the lovely nymph her senses fled till through the parted curtains of her bed the amorous sun who now began to rise kissed with a sportive beam her opening eyes the opinion of some respectable critics had almost led me to change the close of this canto as containing too severe a censure on one of the great writers who have done most honor to our language and indeed when i reflect on the inimitable talents the public spirit and the charitable institutions of swift i am almost ready to address his spirit with this humiliating apostrophe i confess that i have done thee wrong  but a superior attention to the interest of society inclines me to persevere in a very different sentiment and still to think that no talents no virtues in a writer can properly exempt even the most brilliant work from severe reprehension when instead of improving it has an evident tendency to debase and vilify human nature  a tendency that i consider as most evident in the composition to which i have alluded  if i am wrong in this idea i may yet shelter myself under the authority of two most honorable names  a moral poet of a generous and exalted spirit and a learned critic of infinite candor and discernment  in youngs essay on original composition and in the posthumous work just bequeathed to the public by the lamented mr harris the misanthropy of swift is most warmly censured the words of the latter are so striking and apposite that i cannot wish for a stronger justification misanthropy is so dangerous a thing and goes so far in sapping the very foundations of morality and religion that i esteem the last part of swifts gulliver that i mean relative to his houyhnhnms and yahoos to be a worse book to peruse than those which we forbid as the most flagitious and obscene one absurdity in this author a wretched philosopher though a great wit is well worth remarking  in order to render the nature of man odious and the nature of beasts amiable he is compelled to give human characters to his beasts and beastly characters to his men so that we are to admire the beasts not for being beasts but amiable men and to detest the men not for being men but detestable beasts harriss philological enquiries vol ii page      end of the third canto

than factious bickerings or foreign leagues yet while she saunters idle and alone her careless eyes are on the paper thrown as some gay youth whom sportive friends engage to view the furious ourang in his cage if while amused he sees the monster grin and trusts too careless to the bolts within if the sly beast as near the grate he draws tear him unguarded with projected paws starts at the wound and feels his bosom thrill with pain and wonder at the sudden ill so did serena start so wildly gaze in such mixed pangs of anguish and amaze feeling the wound which scandal had designed to lacerate her mild and modest mind startled as one who from electric wire unheeding catches unsuspected fire she reads then almost doubts that she has read and thinks some vision hovers round her head now her fixed eye some striking words confine and now she darts it thrice through every line nor could amazement more her senses shake had every letter been a gorgons snake now rising indignation takes its turn and her flushed cheeks with tingling blushes burn with restless motion and with many a frown through the wide room she paces up and down now musing makes a momentary stand the fatal paper fluttering in her hand so the shy bird by cruel sportsmen sprung and by their random fire severely stung scared not disabled by the distant wound now trembling flies now skims along the ground now vainly tries in some sequestered spot from her gored breast to shake the galling shot ye tender nymphs whose kindling souls would flame touched like serenas by injurious blame o let your quick and kindred spirits form a vivid picture of the mental storm in which she labored and whose force to paint the muses strongest tints appear too faint in sympathetic thought her suffering see but o for ever from such wrongs be free her faithful girdle tried its power to save and often a monitory impulse gave still unregarded still unfelt it pressed with useless energy her heaving breast her mind forgetful of the magic zone full of the burning shaft by scandal thrown with blended notes of sorrow and disdain thus in disordered language vents its pain  had malice dared my honor to defame the selfrefuted lie had lost its aim but here the world deceived by slandrous art must think serena has a venal heart a venal heart at that detested sound in swelling anguish her sunk voice was drowned now was a fearful crisis of her fate distended now by passions growing weight and for its mistress filled with conscious dread the magic girdle cracked through every thread and snappd perchance by scandals force accursed from her full heart the guardian zone had burst and spite of all the virtues of the fair the spell of happiness had sunk in air but that sophrosyne whose friendly fear timely foresaw this trial too severe an early succor gained from secret love from the fell kite to snatch the falling dove as nature studies in her wide domain to blend some antidote with every bane thus her kind aid the friendly power contrived that from the quarter whence the wound arrived there flowed the anguish of that wound to calm a soothing soft and medicinal balm as in her agitated hand the fair waved the loose paper with disordered air in capitals she saw serena flame she blushed she shudderd as she viewed the name her ready fears subside in new surprise and eager thus she reads with lightened eyes go faithful sonnet to serena say what charmspeculiar in her features reign a stranger whom her glance may never survey pays her this tribute in no flattering strain tell her the bard in beautys ample reign has seen a virgin cheek as richly glow a bosom where the blue meandring vein sheds as soft luster through the lucid snow eyes that as brightly flash with joy and youth and locks that like her own luxuriant flow then say for then she cannot doubt thy truth that the wide earth no female form can show where natures legend so distinctly tells in this fair shrine a fairer spirit dwells with curious wonder the reviving maid viewed this fond homage to her beauty paid a second glance over every line she cast and half pronounced and half suppressed the last while modest pleasure and ingenuous pride her burning cheek with deeper crimson died o praise thy language was by heaven designed as manna to the faint bewildered mind beauty and diffidence whose hearts rejoice in the kind comfort of thy cheering voice in this wild wood of life were thou not nigh must like the wandering babes lie down and die page  0  stothard del sharp sculpt  london published septr  st      by t cadell strand   but thy sweet accents wake new vital powers and make this thorny path a path of flowers as oil on oceans troubled waters spread smooths the rough billow to a level bed the soothing rhyme thus softened into rest the painful tumult of serenas breast now to herself restored the conscious maid the lurking fiends insidious snare surveyed her nerves with grateful trepidation own a slighter pressure from the faithful zone and in fond thought she breathes a thankful prayer for her aetherial guardians constant care yet with a keen desire her bosom glowed to hear from whom the gentle sonnet flowed but kind sophrosyne who watched unseen to shield her votary from the wiles of spleen as friendly love had fixed a future time when to reveal the secret of the rhyme strove till that hour her fancy to restrain nor let her anxious wishes rise to pain as gaietys fresh tide began to roll east in the swelling channel of her soul the good old knight descends though eager slow the gout still tingling in his tender toe and now paternal salutations past his eyes he keenly on the paper cast while his sweet daughter with attentive grace before him flies his ready cup to place for tea and politics alternate share in friendly rivalship his morning care though smooth as oil the knights good humor flows when the mild breeze of pleasant fortune blows yet quick to catch the casual sparks of ire like oil it kindles into mounting fire and fiercely now his flaming spirit blazed while on those galling words he wildly gazed whose force had almost worked into a storm the gentler elements in beautys form as the sarcastic sentence caught his view back from the board his elbowchair he drew and by sharp stings of sudden fury pricked far from his foot his gouty stool he kicked fierce as achilles by atrides stung he poured the stream of vengeance from his tongue but ah those angry threats he deigned to speak had sounds alas far differing from the greek rage from his lips in legal language broke of juries and of damages he spoke and on the printers lawdevoted head he threatened deep revenge in terms most dread terms that with pain the ear of beauty pierce and oaths too rough to harmonize in verse while thus the good old knight with passion hot his toast neglected and his tea forgot the discord of the drama to increase now prim penelope assails her niece for as sir gilbert now with choler dumb points her the period with his angry thumb ah brother cries the stiff malignant crone her sharp eye swiftly through the sentence thrown scandal could never rise to heights like this but from the manners of each modern miss had but my niece less giddy and more grave observed the prudent hints i often gave   the honest knight her vile conclusion saw and quick curtailed it with a testy pshaw mean while the gentle maid who heard the taunt surveyed without a frown her prudish aunt far other thoughts employed her softer mind to one sweet purpose all her soul inclined how she might close the unpleasant scene how best restore good humor to her fathers breast her airy guardian with delight surveyed these tender wishes in the lovely maid and to accomplish what her heart desired trains of new thought above her age inspired as venus on her sons enlightened face shed richer charms and more attractive grace when issuing forth from the dissolving cloud his bright form burst on the admiring crowd so kind sophrosyne unseen supplies a livelier radiance to serenas eyes and ere she speaks to captivate her sire touches her lips with patriotic fire it chanced that tossed upon a vacant chair a volume of that wit lay near the fair whose value tried by fashions varying touch once rose too high and now is sunk too much the book which fortune placed within her reach contained o chesterfield the liberal speech in which thy spirit like an attic sage strove to defend the violated stage from fetters basely forged by ministerial rage from this the nymph her useful lesson took and thus began reclining on the book  if on this noble lord we may rely scandal is but a speck on freedoms eye and public spirit then will rather bear the casual pain it gives by growing there than by a rash attempt to move it thence hazard the safety of a precious sense and by the efforts of a vain desire rob this lifedarting eye of all its fire though the soft breast of innocence may smart by cruel calumnys corroding dart yet would she rather ache in every nerve and bear those pangs she knows not to deserve much rather than be made a senseless tool to aid the frenzy of tyrannic rule or forge one dangerous bolt for power to aim at sacred libertys superior frame  as ancient chiefs were wont of old to gaze with eyes of tender awe and fond amaze on the fair priestess of the delphic fane when first she uttered her prophetic strain entranced in wonder thus sir gilbert viewed his child yet more inspired who thus pursued for me i own these lines with gall replete shot through my simple heart a sudden heat but happier thoughts my rising rage represt and turned the pointless insult to a jest and o should slander still new wrath awake still may my father for his daughters sake disdain the vengeance of litigious strife and let serenas answer be  her life she ended with a smile whose magic flame shot youthful vigor through her fathers frame his age his anger and his gout are fled enchanting girl with tears of joy he said enchanting girl twice echoed from his tongue as speaking from his elbowchair he sprung come to thy fathers arms  by heaven thou art his own true offspring and a whig in heart he spoke and his fond arms around her curled with proud grasp seeming to infold the world her conscious heart she feels with triumph beat and joys to find that triumph is complete for stiff penelope who near them stood albeit unused to the melting mood squeezed from her eyelid one reluctant tear and softened with a smile her brow severe but twas a smile of such a gloomy grace as lightened once upon alectos face when orpheus past her leading back to life from plutos regions his recovered wife when love connubial joined to musics spell moistened with tender joy the eyes of hell far other smiles with pleasures softest air gild the gay features of the youthful fair she looks like sportive spring when her young charms wind round her hoary sires reluctant arms and by a frolic infantine embrace banish the rugged frown from winters face through the long day she felt the glowing tide of exultation through her bosom glide and often she wished for slowapproaching night to hold sweet converse with her guardian sprite at length the hour approached her heart desired and in her lonely chamber now retired her tender fancy gave the fondest scope to ardent gratitude and eager hope dear airy being the soft nymph exclaimed whose power can break the spell that spleen has framed can by the waving of thy viewless wing over darkest forms a golden radiance fling and make in minds by sorriest thoughts perplexed this moments grief the triumph of the next i bless thy succor in each trial past be present still and save me in the last thus with her lovely eyes devoutly fixed where rays of hope and fear and reverence mixed the tender fair her faithful guard addressed then with her cheek her downy pillow pressed but long her wakeful lids refuse to close for curiosity dispels repose her busy mind the mystic veil would pierce that hides the author of the pleasing verse her lips involuntary catch the chime and half articulate the soothing rhyme

shadowy hosts the vassals of his thought in joys gay garb in terrors dread array darker than night and brighter than the day who at his bidding through the wilds of air raised willing mortals far from earthly care and led them wondering through his wide domain beyond the bounds of natures narrow reign while their rapt spirits in the various flight shook with successive thrills of new delight return sweet season graced with fictions flowers let not cold system cramp thy genial powers shall mild morality in guard uncouth the housewife garb of plain and homely truth robbed by stern method of her rosy crown chill her faint votaries by a wintry frown no thou sweet friend of man as suits thee best shine forth in fables richembroiderd vest o make my verse thy vehicle thy arms to spread over social life thy potent charms and thou sophrosyne mysterious sprite if happily i may trace thy steps aright roving through paths untrod by mortal feet to paint for human eyes thy heavenly seat shed on

learnings proud cant with envys artful sneer and the vexed poets last and worst disgrace his cold blank booksellers rhymefreezing face hence ye dark omens that to spleen belong ye shall not check the current of my song while beautys lovely race for whom i sing fire my warm hand to strike the ready string as quiet now her lightest mantle laid over the still senses of the sleeping maid her nightly visitant her faithful guide descends in all her empyrean pride that fairy shape no more she deigns to wear whose light foot smooths the furrow ploughd by care in mortal faces while her tiny spear gives a kind tingle to the cautioned ear now in her nobler shape of heavenly size she strikes her votarys soul with new surprise joves favorite daughter armed in all his powers appeared less brilliant to the attending hours when on the golden car of juno raised in heavenly pomp the queen of battles blazed with all her luster but without the dread which from her arm the frowning gorgon shed sophrosyne descends with guardian love to waft her gentle ward to worlds above from her fair brow a radiant diadem rose in twelve stars and every separate gem shot magic rays of virtue to control some passion hostile to the human soul round her sweet form a robe of ether flowed and in a wondrous car the smiling spirit rode firm as pure ivory it charmed the sight with finer polish and a softer white the hand of beauty with an easy swell scoopd the free concave like a bending shell and on its rich exterior art displayed the triumphs of the power the car conveyed here in celestial tints surpassing life sat lovely gentleness disarming strife there young affection born of tender thought in rosy chains the fiercer passions caught ambition with his scepter snapt in twain and avarice scorning what his chests contain round the tame vulture flies the fearless dove soft innocence embraces playful love and laughing sport the frolic child of air buries in flowers the sinking form of care these figures pencild with a touch so light that every image seemed an heavenly sprite breathe on the car whose sightenchanting frame four wheels sustain of pale and purple flame for no fleet animals to earth unknown bear through aetherial fields this flying throne as by the subtle electricians skill globes seem to fly obedient to his will so these four circles of instinctive fire move by the impulse of their queens desire mount or descend by her directing care or rest supported by the buoyant air now springing from her car that hovering staid high in the chamber of the sleeping maid the goddess with a voice divinely clear breathed these kind accents in her votarys ear  come my fair champion who so well have fought the useful battles of contentious thought to aid thy gentle spirit to sustain the final conflict of thy destined pain view the rewards that in my realms of bliss wait the sweet victor in such war as this so happily may thy mind with strength renewed the dark devices of the fiend elude by one blessed effort seal thy triumphs past and gain thy promised guerdon in the last as thus she spoke her heavenly arms embraced and in the car the conscious maiden placed quick at her wish the flaming wheels ascend no clouds impede them wheresoeer they bend as through the empire of the winds they rushed the winds were all in mute submission hushed and now serena from the exalted car looked down astonished on each sinking star flying over lucid orbs whose distant light yet has not reached the scope of human sight and now not distant from the bounds of space the guardian sprite suspends their rapid race and while in deep amaze the nymph admires the circling meteors inoffensive fires pleased at her wonder the mild power addressed with kind intelligence her earthly guest  of those three orbs that in yon crystal sphere a separate system in themselves appear the last whose luminous and steady form shines softly bright and moderately warm contains my palace and the gentle train whom i have wafted to this pure domain at equal distance my dominions lie from these two larger worlds more near thine eye observe their difference as our wheels advance and passing take of each a transient glance so speaking to the grosser globe she sprung her car suspended over its surface hung in heavy air for round this orb was rolled a circling vapor dull and damp and cold here says sophrosyne those beings dwell who wanted soul to act or ill or well who saunterd thoughtless through their mortal time without a care a virtue or a crime here still they saunter in this languid scene but pass the dozing crowd and mark their queen and now slow riding on a tortoise back her features lifeless and each fiber slack full in their view the nymph indifference came the quick serena soon perceived her name for as in solemn creeping state she rode in her lax hand she held fair grevilles ode never did the muse from her sweet treasure cull incense so precious for a power so dull still as she moved along her even way the heavy goddess tried to read the lay but at each pause her inattentive eye strayed from the paper which she held awry nor could her lips a single line repeat though the soft verse most ravishingly sweet through times dull ear will lasting pleasure spread and charm the poppy from oblivions head thus like a city mayor whose heavy barge steers its dull progress at the public charge this power so cumberd by her empires weight makes her slow circuit round her sluggish state around her tribes of rambling skeptics crawl though moving dubious if they move at all before her languid pomp her marshal creeps whose hand her banner half unfolded keeps its quaint device her dull dominion spoke  an eagle numbed by the torpedos stroke enough of scenes so foreign to thy soul sophrosyne exclaimed from this dark goal pass we to regions opposite to this she spoke and darting over the wide abyss her car like lightning in soft flashes hurled shot to the confines of a clearer world now lovelier views the virgins mind absorb for now they hovered over a lucid orb here the soft air luxuriously warm imparts new luster to serenas form her eyes with more expressive radiance speak and richer roses open on her cheek here as she gazed she felt in every vein a blended thrill of pleasure and of pain yet every object opening to her view her quick regard with soft attraction drew sophrosyne who saw the gentle fair lean over these confines with peculiar care smiled at the tender interest she displayed and spoke regardful of the pensive maid well may thou bend over this congenial sphere for sensibility is sovereign here thou see her train of sprightly damsels sport where the soft spirit holds her rural court but fix thine eye attentive to the plain and mark the varying wonders of her reign as thus she spoke she poised her airy seat high over a plain exhaling every sweet for round its precincts all the flowers that bloom filled the delicious air with rich perfume and in the midst a verdant throne appeared in simplest form by graceful fancy reared and decked with flowers not such whose flaunting dies strike with the strongest tint our dazzled eyes but those wild herbs that tenderest fibers bear and shun the approaches of a damper air here stood the lovely ruler of the scene and beauty more than pomp announcd the queen the bending snowdrop and the briarrose the simple circle of her crown compose roses of every hue her robe adorn except the insipid rose without a thorn through her thin vest her heightened beauties shine for earthly gauze was never half so fine of that enchanting age her figure seems when smiling nature with the vital beams of vivid youth and pleasures purple flame gilds her accomplished work the female frame with rich luxuriance tender sweetly wild and just between the woman and the child her fair left arm around a vase she flings from which the tender plant mimosa springs toward its leaves over which she fondly bends the youthful fair her vacant hand extends with gentle motion anxious to survey how far the feeling fibers own her sway the leaves as conscious of their queens command successive fall at her approaching hand while her soft breast with pity seems to pant and shrinks at every shrinking of the plant around their sovereign on the verdant ground sweet airy forms in mystic measures bound the mighty master of the revel love in notes more soothing than his mothers dove prompts the soft strain that melting virgins sing or sportive trips around the frolic ring coupling with radiant wreaths of lambent fire fair fluttering hope and rapturous desire page      stothard del neagle sculp  published at the act directs by t cadell strand feby  st        unnumberd damsels different charms display pensive with bliss or in their pleasures gay and the wide prospect yields one touching sight of tender yet diversified delight but the bright triumphs of their joy to check in the clear air there hangs a dusky speck it swells  it spreads  and rapid as it grows over the gay scene a chilling shadow throws the soft serena who beheld its flight suspects no evil from a cloud so light for harmless round her the thin vapors wreath not hiding from her view the scene beneath but ah too soon with pitys tender pain she saw its dire effect over all the plain sudden from thence the sounds of anguish flow and joys sweet carols end in shrieks of woe the withered flowers are fallen that bloomed so fair and poison all the pestilential air from the rent earth dark demons force their way and make the sportive revellers their prey here gloomy terror with a shadowy rope seems like a turkish mute to strangle hope there jealous fury drowns in blood the fire that sparkled in the eye of young desire and lifeless love lets merciless despair from his crushed frame his bleeding pinions tear but pangs more cruel more intensely keen wound and distract their sympathetic queen with fruitless tears she over their misery bends from her sweet brow the thorny rose she rends and bowed by griefs insufferable weight frantic she curses her immortal state the soft serena as this curse she hears feels her bright eye suffusd with kindred tears and her kind breast where quick compassion swelled shared in each bitter suffering she beheld the guardian power surveyed her lovely grief and spoke in gentle terms of mild relief for this soft tribe thy heaviest fear dismiss and know their pains are transient as their bliss rapture and agony in natures loom have formed the changing tissue of their doom both interwoven with so nice an art no power can tear the twisted threads apart yet happier these to natures heart more dear than the dull offspring in the torpid sphere where her warm wishes and affections kind lose their bright current in the stagnant mind here grief and joy so suddenly unite that anguish serves to sublimate delight she spoke and ere serena could reply the vapor vanished from the lucid sky the nymphs revive the shadowy fiends are fled the newborn flowers a richer fragrance shed the gentle ruler of the changeful land smiling resumed her symbol of command replacd the roses of her regal wreath still trembling at the thorns that lurk beneath but to her wounded subjects quick to pay the tender duties of imperial sway their wants she succored they her wish obeyed and all recovered by alternate aid while on the lovely queens enchanting face departed sorrows faint and fainter trace gave to each charm a more attractive grace now laughing sport from the enlightened plain cleared with quick foot the vestiges of pain the gay scene grows more beautifully bright than when it first allured serenas sight still her fond eyes over all the prospect range flashing sweet pleasure at the blissful change her curious thoughts with fond attachment burn yet more of this engaging land to learn she finds the chief attendants of the queen sweet females wafted from our human scene but as it chanced while all the realm revived a spirit masculine from earth arrived two airy guides conduct the gentle shade genius in robes of braided flames arrayed and a fantastic nymph in manners nice profusely decked with many an odd device sister of him whose luminous attire flashes with unextinguishable fire like him in features in her look as wild and singularity by mortals styled the eager queen and all her smiling court surround the welcome shade in gentle sport for in their new associate all rejoice all pant to hear the accents of his voice though over his frame the armenian robe was flung the pleasing stranger spoke the gallic tongue but in that language his enchanting art inspired new energy that seized the heart in terms so eloquent so sweetly bold a story of disastrous love he told convulsed with sympathy the listening train at every pause with dear delicious pain entreat him to renew the fascinating strain and now serena with suspended breath listened and caught the tale of julias death and quick she cries ere tears had time to flow blessed be this hour for now i see rousseau fondly she gazed till the enchanting sound in such a potent spell her spirit bound that lost in sweet illusion she forgot the promised scenes of the sublimer spot till now her mild remembrancer whose care strayed not a moment from the mortal fair roused her rapt mind preparing her to meet the brighter wonders of her blissful seat while her instinctive cars obedient frame now upward rose like undulating flame as when some victor on the watery world bright honor gilding all his sails unfurled steers into port while to the laughing sky his streamers tell his triumph as they fly expecting thousands line the crowded strand swell the glad voice or wave the joyous hand pressing to view the sight their vows implored and hail their glory and their strength restored so the blessed beings of this smiling scene flocked round the car of their returning queen the radiant car from which they now alight careful she gives to a selected sprite a nymph of snowy vest and lovely frame fidelity her fair and spotless name then happy to review her hallowed home leads

pants to guide weak mortals to thy heavenly haunts grant him in notes that like thy soft control allure attention and possess the soul grant him to show in luminous display the mystic wonders of thy secret sway now at the sight of the presiding power wide spread the gates of a stupendous tower on whose firm height commanding natures bound the faithful warder of the fort they found wakeful intelligence a trusty sprite whose eyes are piercing as the solar light and ever on the watch to sound alarm if aught of dusky hue portending harm should in defiance of her mandate dare approach the palace of the imperial fair within his ward magnificently great lies the rich armoury that guards her state here stands convictions strong and lucid spear whose touch annihilates suspense and fear here truths unsullied adamantine shield which save sophrosyne no power can wield and reasons trenchant blade of blazing steel its edge and polish formed by friendly zeal and not less sure their destined mark to hit pointed by virtues hand the shafts of wit and ridicules strong bolt whose stunning blow lays towering vice and fearless folly low here too the goddess kept in mystic state those sweet rewards that on her champions wait guerdons more precious than triumphant palms  the glance of gratitude for mental alms peaces soft kiss and reconcilements tear and smiles of sympathy are treasured here these precincts past now hand in hand they came to the rich fabric of majestic frame instinct with joy their sovereign to behold the gates of massive adamant unfold and as the gentlymoving valves unclose mysterious music from their motion flows the airy notes through all the palace roam and dulcet echoes fill the festive dome a gorgeous hall amazed serenas eyes compared to which in splendour strength and size the noblest works of which tradition sings judaic shrine or seat of memphian kings would seem more humble than the waxen cell in which the skilful be is proud to

every science vital strength imparts and rears the circle of the social arts with such solicitude she gives to each powers of sublimer aim and wider reach and now sophrosyne who near her pressed thus spoke her title to her earthly guest  behold the honored form without whose aid my strength must vanish and my glory fade source of my being and my lifes support eunoia called in this celestial court benevolence the name she bears on earth the guard of weakness and the friend of worth she ended and the mild maternal form embraced serena with a smile as warm as the gay spirit vegetation wears when she to crown her favorite nymph prepares when pleased her flowery treasures to display she pours them in the lap of youthful may but how serena how may human speech thy heavenly raptures in this moment reach if aught of earthly sentiment may vie with the pure joy these happy scenes supply it is when unmixt with trouble and with pain love glides in secret through the glowing vein when some fond youth unconscious of its fire free from chill fear and turbulent desire with every thought absorbed in soft delight sees all creation in his fair ones sight and feels a blissful state without a

 haste my fair charge for of this ample state tracts yet unseen thy visitation wait the pressing hours forbid me to unfold each separate province which these confines hold but i will lead thee to that blissful crew whose kindred spirits best deserve thy view so speaking her attentive guest she led through scenes that still increasing wonder bred wherever she trod through all her gorgeous seat soft music echoed from beneath her feet passing a portal on whose lucid stone emblems of innocence and beauty shone they reach a lawn with verdant luster bright and view the bowers of permanent delight no fiery sun here forms a scorching noon no baleful meteor gleams no chilling moon but from a latent source one soothing light whose constant rays repel the mist of night though tender cheerful and though warm serene gives lasting beauty to the lovely scene no sensual thought this paradise profanes for here tried excellence in triumph reigns benignant cares eternal joy supply and bliss angelic

feeling heart with all a mothers care reared the young offspring of a rival fair far other trials raised yon lovely crew though in connubial scenes their merit grew it was their chance ere judgment was mature when glittering toys the infant mind allure following their parents avaricious rule to wed with hopes of bliss a wealthy fool when time removed delusions veil by stealth and showed the drear vacuity of wealth when sad experience proved the bitter fate of beauty coupled to a senseless mate these gentle wives still gloried to submit these though invited by alluring wit refused in paths of lawless joy to range nor murmured at the lot they could not change but with a lively sweetness unopprest by a dull husbands lamentable jest their constant rays of gay good humor spread a guardian glory round their idiots head the next in order are those lovely forms whose patience weathered all paternal storms by filial cares the minds unfailing test well have they earned these seats

youthful hearts engage to watch the weakness of parental age turn to this cheerful band and mark in this spirits who justly claim my realms of bliss most lovely these when judged by generous truth though beauty is not theirs nor blooming youth for these are they who in lifes thorny shade repined not at the name of ancient maid no proud disdain no narrowness of heart held them from hymens tempting rites apart but fair discretion led them to withdraw from the prized honor of his proffered law to quit the object of no hasty choice in mild submission to a parents voice the valued lover

this thy last sight with careful eyes survey and mark the extensive nature of my sway thus with fond zeal the guardian spirit said and to new precincts of her palace led the scene she entered of her richest state where on her voice the subject passions wait here rose a throne of living gems so bright no breath could sully their benignant light this her immortal seat the gracious guide assumed her ward stood wondering at her side swift as they felt their ruling power enthroned aetherial beings who her empire owned crowded in glittering pomp the gorgeous scene to pay their homage to their heavenly queen first came chaste love whose sweet harmonious form never felt suspicions soulconvulsing storm no baleful arrow in his quiver lies no blinding veil enwraps his sparkling eyes there all the rays of varied joy unite and jointly shed unspeakable delight with him was friendship like a virgin dressed the soft asbestos formed her simple vest whose wondrous folds in fiercest flames entire mock the vain ravage of consuming fire around this robe a mystic chain she wore each golden link a star of diamonds bore force could not tear the finished work apart nor interest loose it by his subtlest art but strange to tell if the presiding power who to her favorite gave this precious dower if kind sophrosyne could fail to breathe her vital virtue on this magic wreath the parts must sever faithless to their trust the gold grow dross and every diamond dust these valor followed decked with verdant palm gracefully bold majestically calm a mingled troop succeed with festive sound wisdom with olive wit with feathers crowned here hand in hand they move no longer foes their charms increasing as their union grows pure spirits all who hating mental strife exalt creation and embellish life

pleasure lost and fair serena in her wishes crossed has planned in honor of the lovely maid a fancied ball a private masquerade and supplicates her sire with warm esteem to smile indulgent on the festive scheme all arts he uses to insure the grant nor leaves unasked the eager maiden aunt quick at the sound serenas glowing heart throbs with gay hopes but soon those hopes depart reflection in her soul a faithful guard the opening avenues of pleasure barred she deemed the plan of this delightful show but the new ambush of her secret foe the bliss too bright to realize she guessed and chased the idea from her guarded breast while these discreet resolves her thought employ tranquil she triumphs over her smothered joy not so the knight  to his parental eyes in dazzling pomp delusive visions rise that coronet the object of his vow he sees suspended over his daughters brow eager he burns to snap the pendent thread and fix the glory on his darlings head far wiser aims the ancient maiden caught no empty gewgaw flutters in her thought but while more keenly she applauds the plan her hope is solid and substantial man not for her infant niece whose baby frame she holds unfit for hymens holy flame but for her riper self whose strength may bear the heaviest burden of connubial care though different phantoms dance before their sight niece aunt and father in one wish unite to join the banquet is their common choice the business past with no dissenting voice and the warm sire in whom ambition burned a note of grateful courtesy returned his billet sealed the glad goodhumored knight launched forth like nestor on his youthful might  o could i now in spite of age retain that active vigor and that sprightly vein which led me once the lively laugh to raise among the merrier wits of former days when rival beauties would around me throng and gay ridottos listen to my song such were i now as on the festive night when ch  hs charms amazed the public sight when the kind fair one in a veil so thin that the clear gauze was but a lighter skin masked like a virgin just prepared to die gave her plump beauties to each greedy eye on that famed night for then with frolic fire youth filled my heart and humor strung my lyre pleased in the sunshine of her smile to bask i danced around her in a devils mask and idly chaunted an infernal ode in praise of all this female tempter showed the jocund crowd who thronged with me to gaze extolled my unpremeditated lays and sport who still of this old revel brags  see nestors speech in the   th iliad styled her the first of maids and me of wags

females saw his word was fate for never did jove with so resolved a brow to smiling love his joyous scheme avow when he concerted for his special mirth a masquerading on the stage of earth and of the swans soft plume or bulls rough hair ordered the fancydress he chose to wear from whence let sapient antiquarians show the ancient use of masquerades below serena smiled to see this joyous fire infuse new youth in her determined sire but mute penelope with half a sigh with one auspicious and one dropping eye heard the firm knight his fixed resolve impart tickling at once and torturing her heart the ball she relished but abhorred the task to hide her beauties in a beldams mask mirandas name would better suit her plan a simple maiden not afraid of man but used alas her brothers law to feel she knows that law admits not of repeal trusting her charms will any garb enrich she deigns to take the habit of a witch never did sorceress in the shades of night try to illuminate a filthy sprite with fonder efforts or with worse success than pen now labored in this wayward dress to give the sprightly show of living truth to the poor ghost of her departed youth as witches over their magic cauldron bend anxious to see their menial imps ascend so in her glass the ancient maiden pries and dreams new graces in her person rise no such delights whose dear delusions please the mild serena in her mirror sees she at whose toilet beautys latent queen attends enchanted with her filial mien and over her favourites unconscious face breathes her own roseate glow and vivid grace she hastes her glittering garments to adjust with all the modest charms of sweet distrust doubting that beauty which she doubts alone which dazzles every eye except her own the native diffidence which swayed her

deformitys wellsuited pride sour sycorax is stationd by his side and last with sportive smiles divinely sweet light ariel perches on the vacant seat fancy now paints the scene of pleasure near yet fluttering gaiety is checked by fear her wish to view the festive sight runs high but the fond nymph remembers with a sigh from hopes keen hand the cup of joy may slip and fall untasted though it reach the lip as the fine artist whose nice toils aspire to fame eternal by encaustic fire if he with grief has seen the faithless heat mar the rich labor it should make complete when next his hands with trembling care confide to the fierce element his pencils pride watches unceasing the pernicious flame terror and hope contending in his frame while his fair work the dangerous fire sustains feels it in all his sympathetic veins and at each trivial sound that chance may cause hears the gem crack and sees its cruel flaws with such solicitude the panting maid past the long street of every noise afraid now while around her rival flambeaus flare and the coach rattles through the crowded square she fears some dire mischance must yet befall some demon snatch her from the promised ball and dreams no trial more severe than this so bright she figures the new scene of bliss yet horrid as it seems her heart is bent to bear even this and bear it with content but whirled at length within the porters gate she thinks what perils at the ball may wait and as she now alights the fluttering fair invokes her guardian to protect her there till thoughts of danger thoughts of caution fly before the magic blaze that meets her eye the advancing nymph at every step she takes pants with amazement doubtful if she wakes far as her eyes the glittering scene command it is all enchantment all a fairy land no

of one unceasing stare and if prophetic of her nobler doom each rival beauty shudders at her bloom the die is cast  he weds  the point is clear she cannot slight the vows of such a peer thus argued in his mind the festive earl and lest he lightly choose an awkward girl wisely convened on this important case each fashionable judge of female grace here beaux esprits in various figures lurk of jew and

circling whisper of her praise heard envy own her lovely charms though loath heard taste attest them with a modish oath and nuptial projects thickening in his mind now his fair partner in the dance rejoined as now the sprightly music paused my lord eager resolved to touch a softer chord secure of all repulse he vainly meant half to display half hide his fond intent and in dissembled passions

his speech no nymph replied page      stothard del sharp sculp  london published septr  st      by t cadell strand   for in the moment the lost fair devotes her willing ear to more attractive notes the minstrel happened near the nymph to walk rapt with a bosomfriend in secret talk and at the instant when the earl began half to unfold his matrimonial plan edwin in whispers from the crowd retired chanced to repeat the sonnet she inspired the sounds though faint her recollection caught drew her quick eye and fixed her wondering thought lost in this sweet surprise she could not hear a single accent of the amorous peer spleen saw the moment that she sought to gain and perched triumphant on the nobles brain with jealous envy stung and baffled pride contemptuous girl with sudden rage he cried if here to happier youths thy views incline i want not fairer nymphs who challenge mine thy breast in vain with penitence may burn but once neglected i no more return thus loudly speaking with distempered heat rudely he turned with rancorous scorn replete serena startled at the injurious sound surveyed the insulting peer who sternly frowned shame and resentment through her bosom rush swell every vein and raise the burning blush love newborn love but in its birth concealed nor to the nymph herself as yet revealed and just disdain and angers honest flame with complicated power convulse

insulting peer as spleen if mortal must expire to hear but driven for ever from the lovely girl the foul fiend riots in the captive earl he answers not but with a sullen air on happier edwin who approached the fair darts such a glance of rage and envious hate as satan cast on edens blissful state when on our parents first he fixed his sight and undelighted gazed on all delight so doomed to

the generous heart never fails to beat when worth insulted wakens virtuous ire and injured beauty sets the soul on fire quick to his voice the startled virgin turned with wonder hope and joy her bosom burned with sweet confusion flurried and amazed on his attractive form she wildly gazed full on her thought the friendly visions rushed blushing she viewed him viewed him still and blushed and soft affection quickening at the sight perchance had swoond with fullness of delight but that her fathers voice with quick control recalled the functions of her fainting soul when on the distant seat where fondly fixed he viewed the nymph as in the dance she mixed he indistinctly heard with wounded ear the spleenful outrage of the angry peer swift at the imperfect sound with choler wild he sprung to succor his insulted child but ere his fury into language broke love calmed the storm that arrogance awoke the sudden burst of falklands tender flame his winning manners his distinguished name his liberal soul by fortunes smile carest all joined to harmonize the fathers breast his fiery thoughts subside in glad surprise and to the generous youth he warmly cries ingenuous falkland by thy

blushes springing from the heart declare the dawn of fondness in the modest fair the enchanted youth with ecstasy conveyed forth from the troubled feast the trembling maid as the keen sailor whom his daring soul has drawn too venurous near the freezing pole who having slighted cautions tame advice seems wedged within impervious worlds of ice if from each chilling form of peril free at length he

on the unebbing flood of real joy eartham january   th      w hayley  preface as the following plays were intended only for a private theater i have been tempted by that circumstance to introduce a kind of novelty into our language by writing three comedies in rhyme though the comic muse of our country has been long accustomed to express herself in prose and her custom has the sanction of settled precept and successful example the antiquarian indeed may remind me that gammer gurtons needle one of the earliest of our old plays with other comic productions of that rude period was written in rhyme and possibly some fastidious enemies of that gothic jingle as they affect to call it may consider the present publication as nothing more than a relapse into the most barbarous mode of dramatic composition  for the boldness of an attempt which has no modern precedent to plead in its behalf some apology may be due to the public  in the first place i beg it may not be supposed that by writing a comedy in rhyme i mean to convey an indirect censure on the contrary practice no one can prize more highly than i do the many excellent comedies in prose with which our language is enriched i am very far from entertaining a wish to overturn the ceremonial which the comic muse of england has established but i hope to find our country as much a friend to toleration in the forms of literature as in those of religion the custom of other enlightened nations both ancient and modern may be pleaded on this occasion in behalf of verse aristophanes in his play of the clouds seems to pride himself on his poetry ariosto having written two comedies in prose converted them both into meter at a maturer period of his life and moliere the unrivalled master of the french comie theater who has written admirably both in prose and rhyme is i think most admirable and most truly comic when he adheres to the latter  to the author who attempts a comedy in english rhyme our language seems to offer an advantage which the french poet did not enjoy the comic muse of france has chiefly confined herself to that structure of verse which belongs equally to her tragic sister in the poetry of our nation this particular measure is appropriated to sportive subjects and though hitherto not used in comedy it possesses to an english ear a very comic vivacity that it is highly calculated for poems of wit and humor we have a striking proof in that most exquisite production the bath guide how far it may succeed through the varied scenes of an english play experiment only can determine as some readers on the first sight of a comedy in rhyme may hastily suppose that the fashion and the materials of the work are borrowed from the theater of france i think it proper to declare in justice to the writers of that country that they are by no means answerable for any defects which may be found in these dramatic performances i am not conscious of having borrowed a single character or situation from any comic writer whatever either foreign or domestic  the first of the three comedies contained in the present publication was founded on a real anecdote related to me by an intimate friend who concealing the names of the parties mentioned their ludicrous adventure as a new and tempting subject for the comic muse  the plan of the second arose in the mind of its author from his remarking the various effects of connoisseurship in different characters an attachment to the fine arts which is allowed to refine and strengthen the virtues of a manly and a generous spirit has perhaps a peculiar tendency not only to show but to increase the narrowness of a vain and feeble mind and if such a tendency exists it is the province of a comic writer to counteract and correct it  the aim of the third comedy in this collection is to laugh at two distinct species of affectation very prevalent in our age and country the affectation of refined sentiment and the affectation of pompous and pedantic expression i protest however against personal application and to guard against it let me declare that this ridicule is levelled not at the great and respectable veteran in the field of literature whose phrases may sometimes be borrowed by a character in the play but at the nameless and servile herd of his awkward imitators  vigor and originality of thought give a sanction to the pomp and peculiarity of his language if singularities of style are united with genius and moral excellence they are properly regarded with a partial respect but when these singularities are preposterously copied and seem to prevail as a fashion they become i apprehend very fair subjects of sportive satire  when i reflect what long and established prejudice a rhyming play must encounter  when i remember that even dryden himself the most able advocate and the greatest master of rhyme in our language has expressly condemned the use of it in comedy  i am alarmed at the hardiness of my attempt but when i recollect that time the most infallible test of literary opinion has fully shown the mistake of that immortal poet in recommending the use of rhyme in english tragedy i am inclined to hope that he might be equally mistaken in supposing it utterly unsuited to our comic muse it may be urged indeed with great truth that a comedy in rhyme cannot be so close a copy of nature as a comedy in prose the latter adhering to the very language of common life but from a sisterart we may borrow at least a plausible argument in favor of poetry on the present occasion the great master who has descanted so happily on the principles of painting observes with great propriety in one of his discourses that we are not always pleased with the most absolute possible resemblance of an imitation to its original object cases may exist in which such a resemblance may be even disagreeable i shall only observe that the effect of figures in waxwork though certainly a more exact representation than can be given by painting or sculpture is a sufficient proof that the pleasure we receive from imitation is not increased merely in proportion as it approaches to minute and detailed reality we are pleased on the contrary by seeing ends answered by seeming inadequate means sir joshua reynolds discourse of december        on these principles which perhaps are equally just in the two kindred arts a comedy in rhyme may be still more entertaining than a comedy of equal merit in other points which confines itself to prose and a critic who exclaims against the unnatural effect of a rhyming dialogue may as justly censure a portrait on canvass because it is not so exact a copy of life as an image of colored wax in both cases the artist whether painter or poet may be justly called a true and a pleasing copier of nature if he preserves as high a degree of resemblance as his mode of imitation will admit and embellishes his work with the attractive and almost indispensable graces of ease spirit and freedom  it is said by voltaire of theatrical composition in general tous les genres sont bons horse le genre ennuyeux if the present comedies fall not within the class which that lively writer has so justly proscribed the author may be allowed to hope that his liberal and enlightened readers will look with indulgence on a publication which arose from his wish to introduce a striking

dutiful heir  mrs felix dear cousin in spite of his worships decision you cannot be certain of such a provision attempts of that nature are subject to fail  sir nicholas my designs you shall see madam always prevail for if this nice gipsy by your machination declines every offer to give me vexation like my late jolly neighbor sir timothy trickum who vindictively married the frail molly quickum i will make sure of the matter and choose me a wife with an heir ready placed on the threshold of life for as i have said though a foe to restriction i never will suffer perverse contradiction you now know my mind which no mask ever covers so farewell and prepare to receive your two lovers exit mrs felix go thy way thou strange mixture of sense and of blindness a model at once of oppression and kindness thy will thou odd compound of goodness and whim is a stream against which it is treason to swim yet we must cross the current   selina dear cousin say how direct opposition he will not allow what can you devise as a plan of prevention how divert his keen spirit from this new intention i had much rather die than be ever united to one of the lovers that he has invited my heart has a thorough aversion to both yet to make him unhappy i am equally loath when i think what i owe to his tender protection the worst of all ills is to lose his affection  mrs felix dear girl your warm gratitude gives you new charms it is an amiable fear which your bosom alarms and i from your uncles quick humor would screen you not loosen the bands of affection between you he merits your love and you know he has mine yet we somehow must baffle his hasty design nor suffer his whim thus to make you a wife to repent the rash business the rest of his life take courage kind chance may assist us   selina i doubt it yet heaven knows how we shall manage without it for when his hearts set on a favorite scheme his ardor and haste as you know are extreme like a medicine illtimed opposition is vain and inflames the disorder twas meant to restrain  mrs felix in his fevers indeed there is no intermission and thanks gentle coz to your soft disposition so sweet and compliant your temper has been you have taught him to think contradiction a sin and here all around him confirm that belief his vassals all bow to the nod of their chief here shut from the world in this rural dominion no mortal opposes his will or opinion and thus he is spoiled  politicians all say human natures not fashioned for absolute sway  selina it is true though the world as you say think him odd in this sphere he is held a diminutive god and when i behold how his fortune is spent in suppressing vexation and spreading content when i hear all the poor his kind bounty expressing and thoroughly know how he merits their blessing my feelings with theirs in his eulogy join and confess that his nature is truly divine  mrs felix thou excellent girl if such fondness and zeal for a warmhearted whimsical uncle you feel with what fine sensations your bosom will glow what tender attachment your temper will show when your fortunate lord love and hymen invest with higher dominion over that gentle breast but tell me dear cousin  be honest  declare has no young secret swain formed an interest there i suspect  but dont let my suspicion affright you though the good knights rare virtues amuse and delight you from this gloomy old hall you would wish to get free had not cupid preserved you from feeling ennui come tell me the name of the favorite youth i am sure i guess right  selina no in sad sober truth i never have seen in the course of my life a mortal to whom i should choose to be wife  mrs felix ye stars what a pity  i wish i could learn that my colonel from india would shortly return both for your sake and mine for our present distress he would speedily turn into joyous success as his regiment must some young hero afford who might throw at your feet both himself and his sword what say you my dear to a soldier   enter jenny jenny oh madam here is young mr sapphic  i vow if i had them i would give fifty pounds had you seen how politely he begged me to tie a sweet nosegay up tightly which is jolted to pieces  well he is a sweet beau and now with his pencil he is writing below i believe it is a posy he writes it so neatly and i am sure it is fine verse maam it sounded so sweetly  mrs felix oh charming his vows will be very sublime and i trust we shall hear his proposals in rhyme  selina how can you dear cousin so cruelly jest in a business you know i am really distressed in i shall certainly forfeit my uncles protection for i never can wed where i feel no affection do help me  mrs felix good girl this perplexity smother and think your two lovers will banish each other there is much to be hoped from our present affairs  jenny o maam mr sapphic is coming up stairs aside as she goes out i am mightily pleased with this marrying plan and i hope in my spirit that he will be the man exit enter sapphic sapphic fair ladies the moments have seemed to be hours while i stopped in your hall to adjust a few flowers for the season i am told they are uncommonly fine but i still wish the tribute more worthy the shrine  bowing and presenting them to selina selina mr sapphic is always extremely polite these roses indeed are a wonderful sight you are far better florists than we are  mrs felix my dear mr sapphic has magic to make them appear and flora is bribed by the songs he composes to produce for her poet extempore roses into this early bloom all her plants are bewitched but you do not observe how the gift is enriched here is a border of verse if my eyes dont deceive me  selina aside to mrs felix dear cousin you will read it  i pray you relieve me i shall blush like a fool at each civil expression  mrs felix aside to selina taking the paper now with emphasis just and with proper discretion mrs felix reads ye happy flowers give and receive perfume as on selinas fragrant breast ye bloom from earth though not arrangd in order nice ye are transplanted into paradise if on that spot ye languish into death twill be from envy of her sweeter breath it is a delicate compliment tender and pretty what original spirit how graceful and witty  sapphic dear maam youre too good to find any thing in it it is a mere hasty trifle  the work of a minute on the anvil i had not a moment to hammer and i fear in my haste i have sinned against grammar  mrs felix all slight imperfections i never regard when i meet with such vigor of thought in a bard with a fancy so brilliant   sapphic o maam youre too kind but candors the test of an amiable mind i wish that your taste all our critics might guide to soften that rigor with which they decide  mrs felix from critics dear sir you have little to fear if mr decisive himself had been here he must have been charmed with this sweet jeu desprit which as he is coming today he shall see i am eager to hear how his wit will applaud it to conceal it would be of due praise to defraud it  sapphic in mercys name ladies i beg your protection preserve my poor rhymes from decisives inspection consider how hasty   mrs felix say rather how springhtly   sapphic composed in a moment   mrs felix produced so politely  sapphic he will cut them to atoms  mrs felix dear sir he is your friend and i thought he had seen all the poems you penned i was told that to him your long works you rehearse  does mr decisive himself write in verse  sapphic i wish from my soul that he did now and then but he uses the penknife much more than the pen and too freely has flashed all who write in the nation to give them an opening for retaliation my old friend decisive has honor and wit to the latter indeed he makes most things submit and thinks it fair sport as a friend or a foe to knock down a bard by a flaming bon mot to your sex indeed his chief failings i trace for the fairones so flattered his figure and face that too early he ceased the chaste muses to follow and being adonis would not be apollo  mrs felix yet he has much fancy  sapphic o madam no doubt and genius that study would soon have brought out had his thoughts been less turned to his legs and his looks ere this he would have written some excellent books it is pity such parts should through indolence fall but he never composes and reads not at all  selina not read mr sapphic you surely mistake your friend cannot be an illiterate rake our neighbors who lately from london came down declare that his word forms the taste of the town  sapphic dear madam the business is easily done he judges all authors but never reads one  mrs felix i am sure he must own this impromptu is sweet and i vow he shall read it   sapphic dear maam i entreat i conjure you to spare me this earnest petition i know you will grant me   mrs felix on this one condition that for six lines suppressed you indulge me with twenty come show us your pocketbook  there you have plenty of tender poetical squibs for the fair  sapphic taking out his pocketbook dear maam here is nothing  mrs felix a volume i swear o charming  well now youre an excellent man it is stuffed like a pincushion   sapphic yes maam  with bran  mrs felix fie fie youre too modest and murder my meaning what a harvest is here yet i ask but a gleaning it would not be fair to seize all the collection though all is most certainly worthy inspection indulge us dear sir come i will take no refusal  sapphic indeed maam here is nothing that is fit for perusal  mrs felix there are fifty fine things and one cannot choose amiss  sapphic taking out a paper here is one new little song   mrs felix well then let me have this  sapphic after giving a paper they all are so jumbled i fear i am wrong i meant to have shown you a new little song which was written last week on the ball at our races where i heard the miss trotters compared to the graces i could not help saying twas very profane it was taking the name of the graces in vain  mrs felix reads  on seeing selina and jenny near each other in the garden   sapphic o mercy dear madam you must not read those a stanza unfinished   mrs felix how sweetly it flows selina pray hear it  selina aside to mrs felix dear cousin enough how can you delight in his horrible stuff  mrs felix reads though each in the same garden blows the poet must be crazy who when invited by the rose can stoop to pick the daisy  selina aside to mrs felix if you love me dear cousin assist me i pray to end all this nonsense and get him away  pray sir when you came was my uncle below  sapphic he is abroad maam your servant informed me   selina o no you have heard he is building a temple to pan and we hope that your taste may embellish the plan at the end of the walk in his favorite grove where there formerly stood an old ruined alcove you will find him and as it is an art you are skilled in twill please him to know what you think of the building  mrs felix aye do mr sapphic inspect what is done for the workmen all blunderd when first they begun your opinion i am sure will oblige the good knight  selina an inscription he once said he wished you to write  sapphic dear madam  the hint is delightful i vow to the god of arcadia i hasten to bow i shall find the good knight in the midst of the dome i am heartily glad that he is not from home we shall surely contrive something clever between us and the muse will compose by the order of venus  bows tenderly to selina and exit selina how could you so praise that impertinent creature and praise him without discomposing a feature  i could not have thought before this conversation that your frankness could turn into such adulation  mrs felix the world my dear child is to you quite unknown when you see it you will find such discourse is the ton fine folks in high life learn to praise with great glee such persons and things as they sicken to see to me your best thanks for my speeches are due  by thus flattering the poet i surely serve you he will now play the skylark instead of the dove and stun me with songs while youre saved from his love  enter jenny jenny dear maam now i hope mr sapphics quite blessed for he flies through the walks like a bird to his nest  he is a sweet pretty gentleman  mrs felix aside to selina this if i show it will soon banish jennys regard for the poet  jenny see what your friend mr sapphic has written  jenny dear maam with his verses i always am smitten  having read the stanza a daisy indeed to be sure i am neat but though i am a servant i hope i am sweet when he makes my young mistress a rose or a lily he might turn me at least to a daffydowndilly but a daisy forsooth with no fragrance at all  i will cross him for this   selina what is that noise in the hall  jenny as sure as i live it is your other gay spark for i saw a new chaise driving into the park  i will see maam aside going out i will show this fine poet a trick  a daisy that no one but children will pick exit mrs felix this simile jenny i see cannot swallow and her anger may ruin this son of apollo for in courtship this maxim is often displayed he has half lost the mistress who loses the maid  enter decisive decisive alone my dear ladies  they told me below our friend sapphic was here your poetical beau i was almost afraid that my sudden intrusion might check the rich stream of some lyric effusion to selina i am happy to see you so lovely today but i hope i have not frighted your poet away  selina o no  mr sapphic had bid us adieu   mrs felix and not without saying some fine things of you he declares that with those brilliant parts you possess it is a sin you never send any work to the press  decisive good sapphic  in truth it is his comfort to think the whole duty of man lies in spilling of ink and at paradise gate his large volumes of meter will i hope be allowed a fair pass by saint peter  mrs felix then the saint must be free from your critical spirit for i know you have little esteem for their merit youre a rigorous judge and to poets terrific  decisive i wish my friends muse was not quite so prolific but in rhymes when a child i have heard he would squeak and so proved a poet before he could speak on his deathbed i doubt not he will still think of verse and groan out a rhyme to his doctor or nurse  mrs felix i fancy your favorite reading is prose here is a new set of travels pray have you read those  decisive taking the book this author is lucky to meet with a buyer a travellers but a soft word for a liar such works may please those who have never been abroad but men who have traveled perceive all the fraud  mrs felix is the work so deceitful it seems you have read it  decisive not a syllable madam   mrs felix pray who then has said it  decisive not a soul that i know  but such books are a trade and i perfectly know how those volumes are made  mrs felix it is a work i am told that has great reputation both for wit and for truth   decisive we are a credulous nation   mrs felix pray what kind of books are your favorite study  decisive i find modern works only make the brain muddy as my friends grew by reading more awkward than wise and ruined their persons and clouded their eyes i have wisely resolved not to read any more since each living author is turned to a bore  mrs felix how can you so waste all your bright mental powers it is pity you men have not such works as ours  what do you say to my knotting takes out her work  decisive your box wants a hinge and i will give you a much better pattern for fringe i brought it from france  mrs felix now i see my good friend there is no kind of work which your skill cannot mend in all arts you possess a distinguishing head from building a temple to knotting a thread  decisive apropos of a temple  pray has the good knight raised his altar to pan  he had fixed on the site is the structure begun  i have not seen his plan   mrs felix then hasten and pay your devotions to pan sir nicholas now in his vestibule stands to guide all his workmen and quicken their hands and sapphic is gone to attend the good knight and try what inscription his genius can write  decisive poor pan by the graces you are left in the lurch thy temple will look like a trim parish church with sapphics inscriptions like scraps of the bible put up as the churchwardens say in a libel  mrs felix indeed we much fear so  pray haste to inspect it and exert all your exquisite taste to correct it  decisive maam i will do what i can for it puts me in wrath to see a fine temple disgraced by a goth exit mrs felix well my dear your two lovers like true men of fashion do not pester you much with the heat of their passion you will be quite at your ease  thanks to pan and the muse  enter jenny hastily jenny news news my dear ladies most excellent news  selina the girl is quite wild  mrs felix what transports you so jenny  jenny i have news for you madam that is well worth a guinea i have news from the colonel   mrs felix a letter where is it  jenny no maam here is a stranger arrived on a visit and he comes from the place where the colonel is fighting  mrs felix and with letters for me  jenny madam that i am not right in for i run from his man when i got half my story but the colonel he says is all riches and glory  mrs felix dear girl that is enough through my life i shall feel due regard for thy warm and affectionate zeal but where is this stranger  jenny just walked to my master his poor man has met with a cruel disaster he was wounded in battle  selina pray treat him with care  in your joy my dear cousin i heartily share  mrs felix this strangers a jewel for you from the east he is a captain i hope my dear jenny at least  jenny ah madam my fancy supposed him so too but we are both in the wrong and for miss he will not do for i learnt from his man he is only a doctor  mrs felix poor jane how the difference of title has shocked her for my part i cannot find by my reason or feeling that the art of destroying excels that of healing we may equally love the professors of both  jenny that miss though should marry a doctor i am loath  mrs felix come my dear let us meet em  i cannot rest above  how slowly fly letters from hands that we love  end of act i act ii scene i enter jenny and jonathan jenny come dear mr jonathan tell me the whole an account of a battle i love to my soul there is nothing on earth i so truly delight in as to hear a brave soldier discourse about fighting  so the colonel was wounded you say near the wall whereabouts was the shot did he instantly fall  jonathan no recoiling a little he rushed on again and fought like a lion made fiercer by pain though a cursed keen arrow an indian let fly pierced the bone of his cheek just below the right eye twas a horrible wound but it could not appall him  jenny o mercy that such a hard fate should befall him alas i am afraid that his fine manly face must have lost by the scar all its spirit and grace does he look very hideous  jonathan no thanks to my master you can hardly perceive that he ever wore a plaster there never was known a more wonderful cure but kind heaven assists my good master i am sure without it the skill of no mortal could save the many brave lads he has kept from the grave you would weep with delight to behold him surrounded with a hundred fine fellows once horribly wounded who with thanks for their lives are still eager to greet him and hail him with blessings whenever they meet him  jenny god reward him say i for the good he has done and of those he has saved i am glad you are one  jonathan aye twice he preserved me when all thought me dead and once brought me off at the risque of his head it was not his business to mix in the strife and some thought him mad when he ventured his life to bring off a poor mangled private like me but i have still a heart left in this trunk that you see which loves the brave spirit who snatched me from death and will serve him i hope till my very last breath  jenny your scenes of hard service i hope are all over it is now fairly time you should both live in clover your master i trust has brought home as much treasure as will make him a parliament man at his pleasure and to recompense you for the wound in your arm perhaps he will buy you a snug little farm  jonathan when a gentleman comes from the east my good girl you all think he is loaded with diamonds and pearl you fancy his treasure too great to be told and suppose he possesses a mountain of gold a few daring blades by a bold kind of stealth have indeed from the indies brought home so much wealth that with all their keen senses they never could employ it and have died from the want of a heart to enjoy it but some hundred brave lads whom gay youth led to enter that promising region of hope and adventure have toiled many years in those rich burning climes with small share of their wealth and with none of their crimes now my master and i both belong to this tribe not a single nabob have we killed for a bribe and to tell you a truth which i hope you will not doubt we are as poor and as honest as when we set out  jenny what your master still poor in so thriving a trade and with patients so rich has he never been paid for the wounds he has healed  jonathan yes my dear for his fees i know he has touched many thousand rupees but the sight of distress he could never endure what he took from the rich he bestowed on the poor  jenny well heaven will pay him no doubt in due season but what brings him home  i would fain know the reason why he leaves that rich land in the bloom of his life i suppose from the want of a cherrycheekd wife they say those black wenches are sad nasty creatures and though they have fine shapes they have horrible features does he want a white sweetheart or has he a black  jonathan it is indeed a white woman that brings us both back but alas it is an old one  my master it seems has a fond simple mother that is troubled with dreams and he like a tender and softhearted youth resigns his fine prospect and comes home forsooth because the old dame has expressed her desires to see him in england before she expires and egad since he is come she will live long enough for she seems to be made of good durable stuff  jenny well now i shall love him a hundred times more than i did for the stories you told me before god bless the kind soul who behaves to his mother as if he well knew he could never have another and were he my son i could not live without him i could stay here all day while youre talking about him  but it is time to be gone we must both disappear for the colonels sweet wife and your master are here  jonathan stop i must peep at her  she is as bright as the day  jenny and her heart is as good as her spirit is gay  come i will show you our walks  we may get out this way exeunt enter mrs felix and morley mrs felix dear excellent friend since i owe to your worth the safety of what i most value on earth with those it loves best my heart yields you a place and i clasp your kind hand with a sisters embrace to judge of the man whom such service endears i want not the tardy acquaintance of years but in strong though quick ties that no chances can sever in an instant he seizes my friendship for ever and had i much less obligation to you my regard and esteem i should still think your due from the picture my felix has drawn of your mind  morley his warm soul to his friends is most partially kind but such as i am i most truly am yours your goodness my grateful attachment ensures and my heart with proud transport your friendship embraces though i never gazed before on your personal graces i have beguiled some long weeks of hard wearisome duty with frequent discourse on your virtues and beauty and i own for the colonel it raised my esteem to mark with what pleasure he dwelt on the theme  mrs felix youre an excellent creature to sooth a fond wife who regards her lords love hardly less than his life but since you have replied with good humor so steady to the ten thousand questions i have asked you already i will spare you today and if it is in my power mention felixs name only once in an hour that my thoughts to the indies no longer may roam let me talk to you now about matters at home your counsel may make our perplexity less and finish our odd tragicomic distress first tell me and speak without any disguise though i fancy i read all your thoughts in your eyes what do you think of my cousin  morley her graces indeed the glowing description of felix exceed though in praising her often he with pleasure has smiled like a father describing his favorite child for my part i think she is lavishly blessed with those beauties by which the pure mind is expressed that her heart is with truth and with tenderness warm that sweet sensibility shines in her form a form on which no man his eye ever turned without feeling his breast in her welfare concerned it is the lot of such graces wherever they dwell none can see their soft mistress and not wish her well  mrs felix very gallantly said and the praise is her due  but how came her lovers so well known to you  morley her lovers  dear madam i hope youre in jest  or if by their vows your sweet friend is addressed heaven grant for the peace of her delicate mind that her hand may be never to either resigned  mrs felix from my soul i assure you i join in your prayer but whence does it spring  morley i will freely declare though they are both men of fortune fair birth and good name with figures that set some young nymphs in a flame though at each many ladies are ready to catch at what the world calls a most excellent match yet if i have read your fair cousin aright a bosom so tender a spirit so bright must be wretched with such a companion for life as each of these lovers would prove to his wife  mrs felix you are right but their characters where could you know  morley i knew them at college a few years ago before by a whimsical odd sort of fate and some family losses too long to relate in europe my views of prosperity ceased and chance sent me forth to my friends in the east  mrs felix pray what sort of youths were these two modish men  morley you now find them both what they seemed to me then two characters formed like most young men of fashion whose cold selfish pride is their sovereign passion in each though they are men of an opposite turn the same heartfreezing vanity still you discern to indulge that dear vanity each still displays all the force of his mind though in different ways thence in spinning weak verse sapphics toil never ends and decisive never stops in deriding his friends each equally fancies no nymph can resist his lips which he thinks all the graces have kift  mrs felix perfect knowledge of both your just picture has shown  the warmth of these lovers diverts me i own of conquest each seems to himself very clear and feels from his rivals no diffident fear it is easy to see from their satisfied air each loves his own person much more than the fair but my poor gentle coz wishes both at a distance and i want to contrive by your friendly assistance to relieve her and quietly send them from hence without the knights knowledge  morley as neither wants sense cannot the lady pronounce their dismission at once which none can mistake but an impudent dunce  mrs felix this measure seems easy indeed at first view but alas it is a measure we dare not pursue our warmhearted whimsical positive knight allows not to woman this natural right and hence my young friend in a pitiful case knows not how to reject what she never can embrace for nothing her uncles resentment would smother should she banish one suitor and not take the other  morley then indeed i am grieved for the ladys distress but how can i aid her  mrs felix it is hard i confess to a sudden retreat this bold pair to oblige and make two such heroes abandon a siege yet i wish we could do it  and when they recede the departure of both must appear their own deed  morley after a pause well  my friendship for you has suggested a scheme  mrs felix it is a service our hearts will for ever esteem but what is your project  morley dont question me what lest you think me a fool for too simple a plot it is simple and yet i would venture my life it will drive from these beaus all their thoughts of a wife and if my scheme prospers with joy i will confess what a whimsical trifle produced our success  mrs felix well keep your own secret if silence is best though a woman for once i will in ignorance rest  here comes our friend sapphic  he seems in a flurry  morley his step shows indeed a poetical hurry and we shall be called in as gossips fair neighbor for by the bards bustle his muse is in labor  enter sapphic sapphic dear maam may i ask you for paper and ink lest a fresh jeu desprit in oblivion should sink for when my free fancy has brought forth my verse my treacherous memory proves a bad nurse  mrs felix o pray for your muse let us rear her young chit for the bantling no doubt must have spirit and wit as a cradle to hold it i beg you will take that giving him a paper and your friend here will aid you in dressing the brat at a rite so important i merit no place and i beg to withdraw while youre washing its face exit sapphic that is charming gay creature  luxuriant and young  but i have lost half a stanza  the deuce take her tongue  let me see  let me see if i cannot recollect it  it is done  and now morley pray hear or inspect it  morley the poet himself his own verse should recite  sapphic youre a sensible fellow  your maxim is right reads thy old arcadia pan resign for this more rich retreat a fairer nymph here decks thy shrine be this thy favorite seat well my friend will not this bring the old god out of greece  morley aye and make good sir nicholas give you his niece  sapphic yes i fancy this stanza will make the girl mine  morley what poet can wish for a prize more divine i give you much joy on your conquest my friend yet the eyes of regret on your nuptials i bend and grieve in reflecting that conjugal joy your poetical harvest of fame must destroy  sapphic what the deuce do you mean  morley to those great works adieu which the world now expects with impatience from you the poet when blessed can no more be sublime and a chill matrimonial must strike through his rhyme  sapphic youre mistaken dear doctor  connubial delight will give a new zest to each poem i write and you will see such productions   morley it is true now and then polemics by marriage have quickened their pen a dutch critic i know by the aid of his wife made a book and a child every year of his life but total seclusion from venus and bacchus is you know to the bard recommended by flaccus a grand epic poem i hear you are writing it is a work that your country will take great delight in but consider my friend when youre deep in heroics as poets have not all the patience of stoics how you will grieve to be checked in the flow of your verse by a young squalling child and an old fcolding nurse even the qualms of your lady may drive from your brain fine thoughts that you never can recover again reflect how you will feel with such hopes of succeeding if your muse should miscarry because your wifes breeding  sapphic egad in that case i should think my fate hard  morley i myself have beheld an unfortunate bard who his nails for a rhyme unsuccessfully bit when family cares had extinguished his wit  with many who sing in the muses full choir it would do them no mischief to muffle their lyre but for you whom the nine with a tender presage are prepared to proclaim the first bard of our age for you who of taste are the favorite theme   sapphic yes i think i stand high in the publie esteem  morley for you i should grieve if domestic delight on your fair rising laurels should fall as a blight it is the pride of great minds whom the muses inflame to sacrifice joy on the altar of fame your passions renown  of this girl are you fonder  on this delicate point i must leave you to ponder consider it while i attend the old knight exit sapphic alone after a pause by jove i believe my friend morley is right thou fame art my mistress to win thee i sing this girl though she is handsome is but a dull thing it is clear whensoeer i a poem rehearse that she has no relish for elegant verse  her fortune indeed would be rather convenient but the glorious to me is before the expedient egad i would quit venus herself if i knew that the system of morley was certainly true i dont think the girl to decisive inclined but here comes her maid who may tell me her mind enter jenny my good little jenny youre trusty and true and your mistress i know tells her secrets to you what you know to a friend you may safely impart and give me a perfect account of her heart pray how do i stand in your ladys regard  jenny now is my time to be even with this saucy bard  aside to be sure sir the taste of my lady is odd but poetry moves her no more than a clod  sapphic what no relish for rhyme  does she never repeat the soft little sonnets i have laid at her feet  jenny ah sir would my mistress were once of my mind for i read all the verses of yours that i find but my ladys so cruel she thwarts my desire and to hide them from me throws them into the fire  sapphic she is a fool  she is a fool aside  i should have a fine life with such a prosaic dull jade of a wife  jenny but my good sir i hope you will not be dejected i could tell you by whom all your wit is respected there is a heart upon which you have made such impression  but i must not betray her by my indiscretion  sapphic whom do you mean my good jenny come tell me my dear  jenny you would make a bad use of the secret i fear  now i hope i shall lead the bard into a scrape aside for he bites like a gudgeon and cannot escape  sapphic come say who is in love with me  if she is fair i will not leave the dear creature i vow to despair  jenny o lud i protest she is coming this way but i did not intend her regard to betray i must fly  but i beg that you will not be too free exit sapphic madam felix  i thought she was partial to me  enter mrs felix mrs felix may i enter without incommoding the muse  sapphic by a question like this your own charms you abuse those eyes my dear madam were formed i profess to inspirit a poet and not to depress from your presence he surely must catch inspiration  mrs felix a very poetical fine salutation but i seriously beg if youre busy with rhyme that you will not allow me to take up your time as i am not selina youre free from restriction and may tell me plain truths unembellishd with fiction  sapphic then i swear my dear creature i swear by this hand that i feel as i touch it my genius expand that your lips  o by jove he is a madman or booby who roves to the indies for diamond or ruby and each vein in my heart his strange folly condemns who leaves these more bright and more exquisite gems sweet fair let me keep while their richness i praise the cold damp of neglect from oerclouding their rays  while mr sapphic kisses mrs felix with great vehemence jenny enters unperceived jenny o ho  have i caught you impertinent poet this is more than i hoped for  my master shall know it exit mrs felix good god mr sapphic what frantic illusion has produced this ridiculous scene of confusion all poets are quixotes in love i am told and the truth of the adage in you i behold as the knight once mistook an old mill for a giant your sense as disordered your fancy as pliant takes me for my cousin  your loves ebullition i only can pardon on this supposition i fain would suppose that no insult was meant nor believe you could think what i ought to resent  sapphic o talk not of anger with lips that inspire the strongest sensation of rapturous fire that with loves sweet convulsions shake every nerve o think not that i your resentment deserve because my warm heart thus engrossed by your charms is ambitious of filling these dear empty arms no let me while basking beneath your bright eye the place of a thankless deserter supply and in this melting breast kindle ecstacys flame which nature designed for so glowing a frame  mrs felix away sir  and since in your

frolics as yours have old england disgraced in high life let them flourish as fashion and taste to those wanton young fellows i am not severe who attack the loose wife of a vain gambling peer my lady whose lord wastes at hazard the night may plead to more generous pleasures some right i care not how each keeps their conjugal oath since honor and peace must be strangers to both but when a brave soldier pure glorys true son ennobled with laurels laboriously won when risking in far distant climates his life to his country he leaves a fair innocent wife accursed be the man who to friendship unjust fails to guard as his soul this most delicate trust or to punish those fops who insult her chaste beauty and invite her to swerve from her honor and duty of the doom that i think to such

such he dont wish his wife to be talked of too much his honor and quiet let us make our care and bury in silence this foolish affair perhaps in my manners too easy and gay my levity led the young poet astray  sir nicholas no no i my good creature you must not arraign your innocent self in a business so plain besides his offense by this plea cannot sink for they are the worst of all puppies that think each womans a wanton who is not precise and that cheerfulness must be the herald of vice  mrs felix however this may be  as he is now all repentance i earnestly beg a repeal of your sentence  sapphic dear maam i adore you for this intercession and i trust the good knight will forgive my transgression  sir nicholas well sir as beyond your desert youre befriended by that virtue which you have so grossly offended you are free to depart but remember young swain that you never touch the wife of a soldier again  sapphic if i do may i die by the wind of a ball heaven bless you good folks and this sociable hall since my amorous folly your friendship thus loses my amors shall henceforth be confined to the muses exit mrs felix i thank you dear sir and rejoice in my heart that in safety you have suffered this youth to depart  sir nicholas by jupiter coz i had cooled your warm poet had i not been afraid all our neighbors might know it and make you the subject of such conversation as i think your nice colonel would hear with vexation then since for your sake i have let the bard go come and aid me to settle all matters below that my anxious cares in her comfort may cease i am resolved young decisive shall marry my niece  end of act ii act iii scene i enter mrs felix and selina mrs felix well my dear what do you think of our medical friend whom the letters of felix so highly commend if my gratitude does not my judgment mislead he is the man in the world who with you might succeed though gentle yet manly though bashful polite are you not half in love   selina yes indeed at first sight  his service to you on my heart is engraved and i love him i own for the life he has saved to win me perhaps he might not find it hard so esteemed as he is by the friends i regard but i fancy such thoughts will not enter his brain and for my part instead of attracting a swain i only shall think as they heartily vex me of escaping from those who already perplex me  mrs felix o make yourself easy i pray on that head in the deepest disgrace the poor poet is fled and i trust that the critic will soon share his fate come with me  i have a most curious tale to relate let us haste  i perceive that decisive is near in whose present discourse i would not interfere exeunt enter decisive and morley decisive so while in the grove i was cooly projecting new plans for the temple the knight is erecting our poet addicted to amorous sin grew a little too fond of the ladies within but discovery happened his passion to damp and this is the cause of his haste to decamp  morley the old knight i believe such resentment expressed as quickened the speed of his fugitive guest on terrors swift wing he is certainly flown and as he has retreated the field is your own  decisive as a rival i had not much fear of poor sapphic bad rhymes current coin in most amorous traffic but would not pass here  morley i think not in your view as it finds such a critical touchstone in you the poets dismission your triumph ensures and the prize my good friend is now certainly yours a prize that we justly may call very great a lovely sweet girl with a noble estate  decisive the girls very well but knows nothing of life it will cost me some pains to new model my wife but i think she will gladly receive my correction and my wealthy old kinsman approves the connection coughs  morley you have a cough my good friend  decisive yes a trifling one hem have you got any indian prescription for phlegm  morley believe me that cough is no trifling affair it calls i assure you for caution and care with regret i point out so unpleasant a truth but your constitution i have known from your youth your hectic appearance i see with concern as i know with your frame if health takes such a turn the least indiscretion your life may destroy the slightest excess in diversion and joy even those tender cares which on lifes purest plan must belong to the state of a family man may lead to disease from which art cannot save and rapidly hurry you into the grave twere better this courtship of yours should miscarry for you will certainly die in six months if you marry  decisive are you serious dear doctor  morley by such a sad end i lately have lost a poor goodhumored friend you remember jack dangle at college no doubt he was just of your age and a little more stout he with other young sages left westminster hall to teach english law to the slaves of bengal but jack in his new chamberpractice at least too eagerly followed the rules of the east a bad cough ensued much like yours in its sound  decisive coughs good god i could swear twas poor jack under ground it is his tone so exactly sepulchral and hollow the system he slighted i hope you will follow with pains in his breast he was sharply tormented but as he at first to my guidance consented some time my strict regimen kept him alive poor dangle once more was beginning to thrive and had he some months in my plan perseverd on the earth at this moment he might have appeared but chance threw a pretty white girl in his way and eager for marriage fond jack would not stay in vain i conjured him to wait half a year and showed him the danger he ran very clear he thought the remains of his cough but a trifle and being unable his passion to stifle he took his fair wife  but alas the vile cough increased every day till it carried him off  decisive i dont recollect any pain in my breast but i feel a strange tightness just now in my chest  morley how is your stomach  decisive i have nothing to fear on that score  morley do you eat as you did  decisive yes i think rather more  morley that ravenous hungers the thing that i dread how do you sleep  decisive all the time that i pass in my bed  morley indeed  i dont like so lethargic a slumber  decisive why my friend of good symptoms these rank in the number  morley alas you may call them all good if you please by that title you only confirm your disease in which though the patient declines very fast he for ever will flatter himself to the last believe me your symptoms are rather alarming yet your present disorder there is not much harm in if you can but abstain with a spirit resigned from all that may harrass your body or mind to a different climate i wish you would repair and for one winter breathe a less changeable air spend a christmas at naples and when you return you may marry without any anxious concern but youre now at that critical period of life when in such frames as yours nature feels an odd strife and if quiet does not all her functions befriend the short earthly scene on a sudden will end on a point so important you will pardon my freedom  decisive your cautions oblige me i feel that i need em for in truth i am growing as thin as a rabbit and there is something consumptive i know in my habit my father died soon after taking a wife and coughd out his soul when i jumped into life i suppose i am going  morley take courage my friend on your own prudent conduct your life will depend if you take but due care for two years i will engage you will stand a fair chance for a healthy old age nor would i advise you this girl to refuse a distant attachment your mind will amuse and no doubt for a man of your fortune and figure she will wait till your health has recovered its vigor  decisive i can part with the girl without feeling a chasm in my heart that will shake with no amorous spasm for to tell you the truth my old rich uncle cob is more eager than i for this marrying job by this scheme the old blade is supremely delighted because two large manors may thus be united but when of his park i have extended the bound it will do me small good if i sink under ground and i am not such a fool in these projects of pelf to humor my friends and endanger myself  morley indeed i would not wed for an old uncles whim  but here comes our knight i shall leave you with him as i think you have some delicate points to adjust exit decisive alone i am in no haste to sleep with my ancestors dust it is wiser my weak constitution to save than to marry and so travel post to the grave  enter sir nicholas sir nicholas come give me your hand and rejoice my young neighbor youre the man that is to order the pipe and the tabor and by jove well all dance on so joyous a day your wedding dear dick shall be speedy and gay for your rival is gone with our serious displeasure and i give to your wishes my young lovely treasure a treasure she is though the girl is my niece heaven grant ye long years of affection and peace and a fine chopping boy ere the end of the first  remember that i am to see the rogue nursed go you happy young dog go and seal with a kiss and teach the old hall to reechoe your bliss as i know on this match what sir jacob intends and we can so well trust each other as friends short contracts will answer as well as the best our lawyers at leisure may finish the rest i know all suspense in such cases is hard and you shall not i swear from your bliss be debarred while over acres of parchment they are crawling like snails  decisive dear sir upon weighing in reasons just scales your very great favors and my weak pretension i find i am unworthy of such condescension and must with regret the high honor resign which i once vainly thought might with justice be mine  sir nicholas heyday what does all this formality mean why dick has the devil possessed you with spleen or has love made your mind thus with diffidence sore false modesty never was your foible before you think youre unworthy  the thought is so new that i hardly can tell what to say or to do if you love the good girl full as much as you said i think you have very just claims to her bed but if your minds changed and you feel your love lighter it is better to say so than marry and slight her and if this be the case sir you have your release for although i am eager to marry my niece though i am partial to you yet i beg you to note that i dont want to cram her down any mans throat  decisive i am truly convinced of the ladys perfection and twould please me dear sir to preserve the connection though now by particular reasons i am led to revisit the continent once ere i wed in the time of my absence i cannot be exact but in what form you please i will freely contract in the course of two years to receive as my wife   sir nicholas do you mean to insult me you puppy odslife ere i would tie my dear girl to so silly a fop for life i would condemn her to trundle a mop and let me advise you young man for the future to know your own mind ere you go as a suitor  decisive i perceive sir my presence grows irksome to you and you will therefore allow me to bid you adieu  sir nicholas your departure indeed i dont wish to restrain and have little concern when i see you again  exit decisive sir nicholas alone what can make this pert puppy recede from his suit my fair cousin and he have scarce had a dispute she would hardly affront him on purpose to vex me  here she comes to explain all the points that perplex me enter mrs felix well cousin my scheme for a weddings suspended the beaux are both gone and their courtship is ended with an air so mysterious decisive withdraws i a little suspect youre concerned as the cause confess have you had any words with this youth  mrs felix not i my dear sir on my honor and truth but i am ready to own that the news you impart with surprise and with pleasure enlivens my heart i think your sweet niece has a lucky escape i would almost as soon see her marry an ape as her union with one of these coxcombs behold the bard is too warm and the critic too cold  sir nicholas i find that they are not such lads as i thought em the world all the worst of its fashions has taught em and the world is indeed at a very fine pass when such puppies insult so attractive a lass young fellows of fortune now think it hard duty to pay a chaste homage to virtue and beauty but i will leave these pert sops to their own vile caprice and soon find a much fitter match for my niece other orders of men for a husband i will search and i think i can settle my girl in the church  mrs felix lord cousin i thought you detested the cloth  sir nicholas our rector i own often kindles my wrath but all parsons are not like my neighbor old squabble who has learnt from his geese both to hiss and to gobble we have in our neighborhood three young divines and each i believe to selina inclines our bishops smart nephew deserves a sweet wench he himself in due time may be raised to the bench with him i should like very well to unite her and if he hereafter should rise to the mitre then perhaps we together may bring to perfection a muchwanted plan for the churchs correction  mrs felix a very fine scheme which you will manage no doubt  sir nicholas more wonderful things i have known brought about and though my first plan as you see has miscarried i am resolved that my niece shall be speedily married i will unite the good girl to a priest if i am able for the young olive branch never fails at his table there is one i prefer  but to leave the girl free i allow her to make a fair choice of the three i shall therefore invite the whole group to the hall and i will now go and make her write cards to them all exit mrs felix alone what a wonderful creature is this worthy knight to make others happy is all his delight yet misled by some wild philanthropic illusion he is for ever involved in odd scenes of confusion it is well that our critic has made his last bow i rejoice he is removed and i long to know how  enter morley morley thank my stars my dear maam i have dispatched your commission your sweet friend is i hope in a tranquil condition from her two irksome lovers she now is relieved  mrs felix and i am dying to know how all this was achieved come tell me good creature how could you effect it  morley by a project so simple you would never suspect it i have banished both swains by declaring a wife would rob one of glory and the other of life i persuaded the bard his poetical fame could never exist with a conjugal flame hence he grew with your charms so licentiously free but forgive me this ill which i could not foresee decisive more wisely abandons the fair to make his own lungs his particular care  mrs felix what on such points as these have they taken your word  morley dear madam mankind credit things most absurd when they come from the mouth of a medical man hence mountebanks never want skill to trepan the extent of our empire indeed there is no seeing when we act on the fears of a true selfish being  mrs felix how simple soever the means you have employed you have remedied ills by which we were annoyed having thus cleared the scene from each troublesome lover can you not for the nymph a fit husband discover you see how she is pressed by her uncle to wed who never quits a scheme he once takes in his head  suppose her kind fancy should lean toward you is your heart quite as free as i am sure twould be true is it not preengagd  morley as in mirths sportive sally it pleases you thus a poor pilgrim to rally your goodnature i know will forgive me if i to your pleasantry make a too serious reply it is my maxim to speak whatsoever be the theme with a heart undisguisd to the friends i esteem had i all indias wealth twould be my inclination to offer it all to your lovely relation but supposing it possible you could be willing to unite her with one who is scarce worth a shilling believe me dear madam my pride is too great to wish her to stoop to my humble estate  mrs felix such pride though it rests upon no strong foundation is noble i own and deserves admiration i call it illfounded because in my mind if there is fortune enough for a couple when joined if talents and worth are by each duly shared if in all other points they are equally paired and mutual regard mutual merit enhances it signifies not which supplied their finances  morley your pardon  how often when fortunes unequal gay weddings produce a most turbulent sequel but could i once hope your sweet cousin to gain how many things are there such hopes to restrain suppose your dear colonel my most noble friend whom success to your arms may more speedily send suppose having closed the bright work he has pland his return from the east he should hasten by land suppose him arrived with what face could i meet the man whom my heart should exultingly greet if he found me attempting in spite of my station to wed though a beggar your wealthy relation  mrs felix from these words my dear friend which i almost adore and a few slighter hints that escaped you before i have caught a quick hope which is fraught with delight that i soon shall be blessed with my felixs sight i begin to suspect he is in england already i perceive that you cannot keep your countenance steady with his usual attention his love has reflected how my poor foolish nerves by surprise are affected and lest they should fail me beyond all revival has sent you to prepare for his wished for arrival am i right in my guess is he not very near could i trust my own heart i should think felix here  colonel felix entering sweet foreboder behold him restored to your arms  mrs felix o my felix this transport oerpays all alarms thus to see thee restored and ennobled with fame in what words shall affection thy welcome proclaim  colonel my love my best treasure than glory more dear the bliss of this meeting which shines in thy tear that we owe to this friend let us never forget  morley my share in your transport oerpays all the debt  but colonel your fondness has traveled full speed and has not allowed me the time you agreed  colonel i meant not indeed to have joined you today but i found love forbade my intended delay  morley well my duty is done now you happily meet heaven bless you together   mrs felix stay stay i entreat you must not go yet and before you depart i will open to felix the scheme of my heart  selina behind the scene indeed sir i never can write such a card  sir nicholas behind the scene then you will forfeit at once my paternal regard  colonel heyday in the house i much fear somethings wrong as sir nicholas talks in a language so strong  mrs felix does he know you are here  colonel no my dear i think not unless he the tidings from jenny has got she alone saw me come and without much ado most kindly directed me where to find you  mrs felix they are coming this way  let us withdraw all together and contrive how to turn this loud storm to fair weather exeunt enter sir nicholas and selina sir nicholas i insist on your writing such cards to them all  selina dear uncle i beg you will this order recall you know your commands i much wish to obey but reflect on this matter what people will say youre so eager to marry your niece they will swear that you hawk her about just like goods at a fair  sir nicholas well my dear let em say so and i will say so too for your simile proves what a guardian should do he who wants to dispose of a tender young maid may take a good hint from the gingerbread trade if he has any sense twill be ever his plan to part with soft pastry as soon as he can for egad an old maid is like old hardened paste you may cry it about but nobody will taste come do as i bid you and take up your pen  selina lord sir it will seem very odd to these men you will make me appear in a horrible light i vow my hand shakes so i never can write excuse me dear sir from this business pray do and let me live single for ever with you  sir nicholas all business where womans concerned i believe must partake of the curse from our grandmother eve all her daughters the steps of their parent have followed contradiction the core of the apple she swallowed in their veins still fermenting new ills can produce and all their blood seems coloquintida juice  you froward cross baggage your word should i take and bid you live single five years for my sake of the barbarous uncle you would quickly complain who from natures just right a young girl would restrain  selina indeed sir i should not  sir nicholas i tell you you would from perverseness alone you oppose your own good it is only to thwart me because i desire to see you well settled before i expire that you now with your soft hypocritical carriage affect to have no inclination to marriage but you will never contrive though your tongue may be nimble to convince me your heart is as cold as your thimble i know of what stuff froward damsels are made the guardian must force you who cannot persuade that you will like a good husband i never can doubt and married you shall be before the months out or at least your kind uncle no more you shall teaze but may even go to rome and turn nun if you please  selina aside i have lost all the love he has shown me for years if i strive to reply i shall burst into tears  sir nicholas come answer me miss will you scribble or not  enter the colonel mrs felix and morley colonel my worthy old friend what can make you so hot  sir nicholas ha colonel  you find me a little concerned  but i am heartily glad you are safely returned your arrival indeed is a welcome surprise though before you your fame a bright harbinger flies we have heard your success and we all triumph in it  colonel i trust i am come in a fortunate minute to make all your present embarrassment cease for i bring a young husband my friend for your niece  sir nicholas egad that is well said and i am sure it is well meant and if he is like you he shall have my consent  colonel he has many more virtues and just as much wealth and from india brings home both his morals and health here my friend is the man  as i owe him my life i wish to present him so lovely a wife half my fortune is his  here i freely declare it and have only to hope that selina my share it i have regarded her long as a child of my own nor can my affection more truly be shown than by wishing to place the dear girl in the arms of the friend whose rare virtues are worthy her charms  morley dear generous felix i am quite overcome thy bounty is such it strikes gratitude dumb  colonel this was ever my friend my most settled intention though my very just purpose i chose not to mention from the hope i should find what i gladly embrace a moment from which it may borrow some grace when my gift its plain value may rise far above by the aid it affords to the wishes of love and i own as a prophet i am proud of my art now i see the effects of her charms on your heart  morley o felix can i thus deprive thy free spirit of wealth the reward of heroical merit can i the victorious commander despoil of what he has purchased with danger and toil should love and delight on thy present attend i could never be happy in robbing a friend no i still must decline   sir nicholas my dear boy say no more youre the match that i never could meet with before i have long sought in vain for an heir to my mind but all my soul wished in your spirit i find you shall not rob your friend of a single an indian coin gold moor he can raise heirs enough to inherit his store to such men as himself let him haste to give birth and with twenty young felixs garnish the earth how trifling soever your fortune may be from the colonels esteem and the virtues i see i think you as noble a match for my niece as i could had you brought home a new golden fleece i have money enough if youre rich in affection  as i always have talked of an equal connection my neighbors perhaps may suppose my sight dim or mock my wise choice as a generous whim let them study with zeal which i hope may succeed of their horses and dogs to improve the best breed a study more noble engrosses my mind to preserve the first points in the breed of mankind on the heart and the soul as the first points i dwell in these my dear children you match mighty well and i think human nature in debt to my care for uniting two mortals who happily pair  colonel your hand my dear knight it is gloriously said  sir nicholas by juno well put the young couple to bed well have no dull delays   mrs felix now what say you my dear are these orders for marriage too quick and severe  morley my amazement and gratitude both are extreme but my voice seems oppressed in a heavenly dream though your kindness is greater than language can paint i beg this fair hand may be free from constraint  sir nicholas from constraint  gad if now she affects to demur i can tell her my wrath she will so far incur she shall go to a convent for life or at least be sent as a venture herself to the east  selina my uncle i long have obeyed and at present i cannot complain his commands are unpleasant nay more could he place all mankind in my view and bid me choose from them my choice would be you  morley to this dear declaration my life must reply all words are too weak   sir nicholas the whole earth i defy to show me a scene more delightful than this dear honest frank girl come and give me a kiss you are the creature of nature much more than of art and i own thee again as the child of my heart  jonathan entering and speaking to the colonel there are two chests for you sir just come to the hall  colonel a few indian things for the ladies  that is all pray jonathan pay those who brought them
