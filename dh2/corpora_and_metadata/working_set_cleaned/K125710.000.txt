the school for scandal a comedy as it is performed at the theatresroyal in london and dublin  london printed for j bew in paternoster row mdcclxxxi  dramatis personae men sir peter teazle sir oliver surface joseph surface charles rowley sir benjamin backbite crabtree moses snake trip sir toby bumper gentlemen servant to joseph surface servant to lady sneerwell women lady teazle maria lady sneer well mrs candor maid to lady teazle the school for scandal act i scene lady sneerwells house lady sneerwell and snake discovered at a teatable lady sneerwell the paragraphs you say mr snake were all inserted   snake they were madam and as i copied them myself in a seigned hand there can be no suspicion from whence they came   l sneerwell did you circulate the report of lady brittles intrigue with captain boastall   snake that is in as fine a train as your ladyship could wish in the common course of things i think it must reach mrs clackets ears within twentyfour hours and then the business you know is as good as done   l sneerwell why yes mrs clacket has talents and a great deal of industry   snake true madam and has been tolerably successful in her day to my knowledge she has been the cause of six matches being broken off and three sons disinherited of four forced elopments as many close confinements nine separate maintenances and two divorces  nay i have more than once traced her causing a tete a tete in the town and country magazine when the parties never saw one another before in the whole course of their lives   l sneerwell why yes she has genius but her manner is too gross   snake true madam she has a fine tongue and a bold invention but then her coloring is too dark and the outlines rather too extravagant she wants that delicacy of hint and mellowness of sneer which distinguishes your ladyships scandal   l sneerwell you are partial snake   snake not in the least every body will allow that lady sneerwell can do more with a word or look than many others with the most labored detail even though they accidentally happen to have a little truth on their side to support it   l sneerwell yes my dear snake and i will not deny the pleasure i feel at the success of my schemes  both rise wounded myself in the early part of my life by the envenomed tongue of slander i confess nothing can give me greater satisfaction than reducing others to the level of my own injured reputation   snake true madam but there is one affair in which you have lately employed me wherein i confess i am at a loss to guess at your motives   l sneerwell i presume you mean with regard to my friend sir peter teazle and his family   snake i do here are two young men to whom sir peter has acted as guardian since their fathers death the eldest possessing the most amiable character and universally well spoken of the youngest the most dissipated wild extravagant young fellow in the world the former an avowed admirer of your ladyship and apparently your favorite the latter attached to maria sir peters ward and confessedly admired by her now on the face of these circumstances it is utterly unaccountable to me why you the widow of a city knight with a large fortune should not immediately close with the passion of a man of such character and expectation as mr surface and more so why you are so uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual attachment subsisting between his brother charles and maria   l sneerwell then at once to unravel this mystery i must inform you that love has no share whatever in the intercourse between mr surface and me   snake no    l sneerwell no his real views are to maria or her fortune while in his brother he finds a favored rival he is therefore obliged to mask his real intentions and profit by my assistance   snake yet still i am more puzzled why you should interest yourself for his success   l sneerwell heavens how dull you are cannot you surmise a weakness i have hitherto through shame concealed even from you must i confess it that charles that profligate that libertine that bankrupt in fortune and reputation that he it is for whom i am thus anxious and malicious and to gain whom i would sacrifice every thing   snake now indeed your conduct appears consistent but pray how came you and mr surface so confidential   l sneerwell for our mutual interest he pretends to and recommends sentiment and liberality but i know him to be artful close and malicious in short a sentimental knave while with sir peter and indeed with most of his acquaintances he passes for a youthful miracle of virtue good sense and benevolence   snake yes i know sir peter vows he has not his fellow in england and has praised him as a man of character and sentiment   l sneerwell yes and with the appearance of being sentimental he has brought sir peter to favor his addresses to maria while poor charles has no friend in the house though i fear he has a powerful one in marias heart against whom we must direct our schemes   enter servant servant mr surface madam   l sneerwell show him up  exit servant he generally calls about this hour  i dont wonder at peoples giving him to me for a lover   enter joseph surface joseph lady sneerwell good morning to you  mr snake your most obedient   l sneerwell snake has just been rallying me upon our attachment but i have told him our real views i need not tell you how useful he has been to us and believe me our confidence has not been ill placed   joseph oh madam it is impossible for me to suspect a man of mr snakes merit and accomplishments   l sneerwell oh no compliments but tell me when you saw maria or what is more material to us your brother   joseph i have not seen either since i left you but i can tell you they never met some of your stories have had a good effect in that quarter   l sneerwell the merit of this my dear snake belongs to you but do your brothers distresses increase   joseph every hour i am told he had another execution in his house yesterday  in short his dissipation and extravagance exceeds any thing i ever heard   l sneerwell poor charles   joseph aye poor charles indeed notwithstanding his extravagance one cannot help pitying him i wish it was in my power to be of any essential service to him for the man who does not feel for the distresses of a brother even though merited by his own misconduct deserves to be    l sneerwell now you are going to be moral and forget you are among friends   joseph gad so i was ha ha  i will keep that sentiment till i see sir peter ha ha however it would certainly be a generous act in you to rescue maria from such a libertine who if he is to be reclaimed at all can only be so by a person of your superior accomplishments and understanding   snake i believe lady sneerwell here is company coming i will go and copy the letter i mentioned to your ladyship mr surface your most obedient   exit snake joseph mr snake your most obedient i wonder lady sneerwell you would put any confidence in that fellow   l sneerwell why so   joseph i have discovered he has of late had several conferences with old rowley who was formerly my fathers steward he has never you know been a friend of mine   l sneerwell and do you think he would betray us   joseph not unlikely and take my word for it lady sneerwell that fellow has not virtue enough to be faithful to his own villainies   enter maria l sneerwell ah maria my dear how do you do what is the matter   maria nothing madam only this odious lover of mine sir benjamin backbite and his uncle crabtree just called in at my guardians but i took the first opportunity to slip out and run away to your ladyship   l sneerwell is that all   joseph had my brother charles been of the party you would not have been so much alarmed   l sneerwell nay now you are too severe for i dare say the truth of the matter is maria heard you was here and therefore came but pray maria what particular objection have you to sir benjamin that you avoid him so   maria oh madam he has done nothing but his whole conversation is a perpetual libel upon all his acquaintance   joseph yes and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing him for he would abuse a stranger as soon as his best friend and his uncle is as bad   maria for my part i own wit looses its respect with me when i see it in company with malice  what think you mr surface   joseph to be sure madam  to smile at a jest that plants a thorn in the breast of another is to become a principal in the mischief   l sneerwell pash  there is no possibility of being witty without a little ill nature the malice in a good thing is the barb that makes it stick  what is your real opinion mr surface   joseph why my opinion is that where the spirit of railery is suppressed the conversation must be naturally insipid   maria well i will not answer how far slander may be allowed but in a man i am sure it is despicable  we have pride envy rivalship and a thousand motives to depreciate each other but the male slanderer must have the cowardice of a woman before he can traduce one   enter servant servant mrs candor madam if you are at leisure will leave her carriage   l sneerwell desire her to walk up  exit servant now maria here is a character to your taste though mrs candor is a little talkative yet every body allows she is the best natured sort of woman in the world   maria yes  with the very gross affectation of good nature she does more mischief than the direct malice of old crabtree   joseph faith it is very true and whenever i hear the current of abuse running hard against the characters of my best friends i never think them in such danger as when candor undertakes their defense   l sneerwell hush hush here she is   enter mrs candor mrs candor oh my dear lady sneerwell well how do you do mr surface your most obedient  is there any news abroad no nothing good i suppose  no nothing but scandal  nothing but scandal   joseph just so indeed madam   mrs candor nothing but scandal  ah maria how do you do child what is every thing at an end between you and charles what he is too extravagant  aye the town talks of nothing else   maria i am sorry madam the town is so ill employed   mrs candor aye so am i child  but what can one do we cannot stop peoples tongues  they hint too that your guardian and his lady dont live so agreeably together as they did   maria i am sure such reports are without foundation   mrs candor aye so these things generally are  it is like mr fashions affair with colonel goterie though indeed that affair was never rightly cleared up and it was but yesterday miss prim assured me that mr and mrs honeymoon were now become mere man and wife like the rest of their acquaintance she likewise hinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her dropsy and recovered her shape in a most surprising manner   joseph the license of invention some people give themselves is astonishing   mrs candor it is so  but how will you stop peoples tongues twas but yesterday mrs clacket informed me that our old friend miss prudely was going to elope and that her guardian caught her just stepping into the york diligence with her dancingmaster i was informed too that lord flimsey caught his wife at a house of no extraordinary fame and that tom saunter and sir harry idle were to measure swords on a similar occasion  but i dare say there is no truth in the story and i would not circulate such a report for the world   joseph you report  no no no   mrs candor no no  talebearers are just as bad as the talemakers   enter servant servant sir benjamin backbite and mr crabtree   exit servant enter sir benjamin and crabtree crabtree lady sneerwell your most obedient humble servant mrs candor i believe you dont know my nephew sir benjamin backbite he has a very pretty taste for poetry and shall make a rebus or a cherard with any one   sir benjamin oh fie uncle   crabtree in faith he will did you ever hear the lines he made at lady pontos route on miss frizzles feathers catching fire and the rebuses  his first is the name of a fish the next a great naval commander and    sir benjamin uncle now prithee   l sneerwell i wonder sir benjamin you never publish any thing   sir benjamin why to say the truth it is very vulgar to print  and as my little productions are chiefly satyrs and lampoons on particular persons i find they circulate better by giving copies in confidence to the friends of the parties  however i have some love elegies which when favored by this ladys smiles  to maria i mean to give to the public   crabtree foregad madam they will immortalize you  to maria you will be handed down to posterity like petrarchs laura or wallers sacharissa   sir benjamin yes madam i think you will like them  to maria when you shall see them on a beautiful quarto type where a neat rivulet of text shall murmur through a meadow of margin  foregad they will be the most elegant things of their kind   crabtree but odso ladies did you hear the news   mrs candor what  do you mean the report of    crabtree no madam that is not it  miss nicely going to be married to her footman   mrs candor impossible   sir benjamin it is very true indeed madam every thing is fixed and the wedding liveries bespoke   crabtree yes and they do say there were very pressing reasons for it   mrs candor i heard something of this before   l sneerwell oh it cannot be and i wonder they would report such a thing of so prudent a lady   sir benjamin oh but madam that is the very reason that it was believed at once for she has always been so very cautious and reserved that every body was sure there was some reason for it at bottom   mrs candor it is true there is a sort of puny sickly reputation that would outlive the robuster character of an hundred prudes   sir benjamin true madam there are valetudinarians in reputation as well as constitution who being conscious of their weak part avoid the least breath of air and supply their want of stamina by care and circumspection   mr candor i believe this may be some mistake you know sir benjamin very trifling circumstances have often given rise to the most ingenious tales   crabtree very true  but odso ladies did you hear of miss letitia pipers losing her lover and her character at scarborough  sir benjamin you remember it   sir benjamin oh to be sure the most whimsical circumstance   l sneerwell pray let us hear it   crabtree why one evening at lady spadilles assembly the conversation happened to turn upon the difficulty of breeding nova scotia sheep in this country no says a lady present i have seen an instance of it for a cousin of mine miss letitia piper had one that produced twins what what says old lady dundizzy whom we all know is as deaf as a post has miss letitia piper had twins  this you may easily imagine set the company in a loud laugh and the next morning it was every where reported and believed that miss letitia piper had actually been brought to bed of a fine boy and girl   omnes ha ha ha ha   crabtree it is true upon my honor  oh mr surface how do you do i hear your uncle sir oliver is expected in town sad news upon his arrival to hear how your brother has gone on   joseph i hope no busy people have already prejudiced his uncle against him  he may reform   sir benjamin true he may for my part i never thought him so utterly void of principle as people say  and though he has lost all his friends i am told nobody is better spoken of amongst the jews   crabtree foregad if the old jewry was a ward charles would be an alderman for he pays as many annuities as the ish tontine and when he is sick they have prayers for his recovery in all their synagogues   sir benjamin yet no man lives in greater splendour they tell me when he entertains his friends he can sit down to dinner with a dozen of his own securities have a score of tradesmen waiting in the antichamber and an officer behind every guests chair   joseph this may be entertaining to you gentlemen  but you pay very little regard to the feelings of a brother   maria their malice is intolerable  aside lady sneerwell i must wish you a good morning i am not very well   exit maria mrs candor she changes color   l sneerwell do mrs candor follow her   mrs candor to be sure i will  poor dear girl who knows what her situation may he   mrs candor follows her l sneerwell twas nothing but that she could not bear to hear charles reflected on notwithstanding their difference   sir benjamin the young ladys penchant is obvious   crabtree come dont let this dishearten you  follow her and repeat some of your odes to her and i will assist you   sir benjamin mr surface i did not come to hurt you but depend on it your brother is utterly undone   crabtree oh undone as ever man was  cannot raise a guinea   sir benjamin every thing is sold i am told that was moveable   crabtree not a moveable left except some old bottles and some pictures and they seem to be framed in the wainscot egad   sir benjamin i am sorry to hear also some bad stories of him   crabtree oh he has done many mean things that is certain   sir benjamin but however he is your brother   crabtree aye as he is your brother  well tell you more another opportunity   sir benjamin yes as he is your brother  well tell you more another opportunity   exeunt crabtree and sir benjamin l sneerwell it is very hard for them indeed to leave a subject they have not quite run down   joseph and i fancy their abuse was no more acceptable to your ladyship than to maria   l sneerwell i doubt her affections are further engaged than we imagine  but the family are to be here this afternoon so you may as well dine where you are we shall have an opportunity of observing her further  in the mean time i will go and and plot mischief and you shall study   exeunt scene sir peter teazles house sir peter when an old bachelor marries a young wise what is he to expect  it is now about six months since my lady teazle made me the happiest of men  and i have been the most miserable dog ever since  we tifted a little going to church and fairly quarrelled before the bells were done ringing i was more than once nearly choked with gall during the honey moon and had lost every satisfaction in life before my friends had done wishing me joy  and yet i chose with caution a girl bred wholly in the country who had never known luxury beyond one silk gown or dissipation beyond the annual gala of a race ball  yet now she plays her part in all the extravagant fopperies of the town with as good a grace is if she had never seen a bush or a grass plot out of grosvenorsquare  i am sneered at by all my acquaintance  paragraphed in the newspapers  she dissipates my fortune and contradicts all my humors  and yet the worst of it is i doubt i love her or i should never bear all this  but i am determined never to be weak enough to let her know it  no no no   enter rowley rowley sir peter your servant how do you find yourself today   sir peter very bad master rowley very bad indeed   rowley i am sorry to hear that  what has happened to make you uneasy since yesterday   sir peter a pretty question truly to a married man   rowley sure my lady is not the cause   sir peter why has any one told you she was dead   rowley come come sir peter notwithstanding you sometimes dispute and disagree i am sure you love her   sir peter aye master rowley but the worst of it is that in all our disputes and quarrels she is ever in the wrong and continues to thwart and vex me  i am myself the sweetest tempered man in the world and so i tell her an hundred times a day   rowley indeed sir peter   sir peter yes  and then there is lady sneerwell and the set she meets at her house encourage her to disobedience and maria my ward she too presumes to have a will of her own and refuses the man i propose for her designing i suppose to bestow herself and fortune upon that profligate his brother   rowley you know sir peter i have often taken the liberty to differ in opinion with you in regard to these two young men for charles my life on it will retrieve all one day or other  their worthy father my once honored master at his years was full as wild and extravagant as charles now is but at his death he did not leave a more benevolent heart to lament his loss   sir peter you are wrong mr rowley you are very wrong  by their fathers will you know i became guardian to these young men which gave me an opportunity of knowing their different dispositions but their uncles eastern liberality soon took them out of my power by giving them an early independence  but for charles whatever good qualities he might have inherited they are long since squandered away with the rest of his fortune  joseph indeed is a pattern for the young men of the age  a youth of the noblest sentiments and acts up to the sentiments he professes   rowley well well sir peter i shall not oppose your opinion at present though i am sorry you are prejudiced against charles as this may probably be the most critical period of his life for his uncle sir oliver is arrived and now in town   sir peter what my old friend sir oliver is he arrived i thought you had not expected him this month   rowley no more we did sir but his passage has been remarkably quick   sir peter i shall be heartily glad to see him  it is sixteen years since old noll and i met  but does he still enjoin us to keep his arrival a secret from his nephews   rowley he does sir and is determined under a feigned character to make trial of their different dispositions   sir peter ah there is no need of it for joseph i am sure is the man  but harkye rowley does sir oliver know that i am married   rowley he does sir and intends shortly to wish you joy   sir peter what as we wish health to a friend in a consumption  but i must have him at my house  do you conduct him rowley i will go and give orders for his reception  going we used to rail at matrimony together  he has stood firm to his text  but rowley dont give him the least hint that my wife and i disagree for i would have him think  heaven forgive me that we are a happy couple   rowley then you must be careful not to quarrel whilst he is here   sir peter and so we must  but that will be impossible  zounds rowley when an old bachelor marries a young wife he deserves  aye he deserves  no  the crime carries the punishment along with it   end of the first act act ii scene sir peter teazles house sir peter lady teazle lady teazle i will not bear it   l teazle very well sir peter you may bear it or not just as you please but i know i ought to have my own way in every thing and what is more i will   sir peter what madam is there no respect due to the authority of a husband   l teazle why dont i know that no woman of fashion does as she is bid after her marriage  though i was bred in the country i am no stranger to that if you wanted me to be obedient you should have adopted me and not married me  i am sure you were old enough   sir peter aye there it is  oons madam what right have you to run me into all this extravagance   l teazle i am sure i am not more extravagant than a woman of quality ought to be   sir peter slife madam i will have no more sums squandered away upon such unmeaning luxuries you have as many flowers in your dressing room as would turn the pantheon into a greenhouse or make a fete champetre at a mas    l teazle lord sir peter am i to blame that flowers dont blow in cold weather you must blame the climate and not me  i am sure for my part i wish it was spring all the year round and that roses grew under our feet   sir peter zounds madam i should not wonder at your extravagance if you had been bred to it  had you any of these things before you married me   l teazle lord sir peter how can you be angry at those little elegant expenses   sir peter had you any of those little elegant expenses when you married me   l teazle for my part i think you ought to be pleased your wife should be thought a woman of taste   sir peter zounds madam you had no taste when you married me   l teazle very true indeed and after having married you i never should pretend to taste again   sir peter very well very well madam you have entirely forgot what your situation was when i first saw you   l teazle no no i have not a very disagreeable situation it was or i am sure i never should have married you   sir peter you forget the humble state i took you from  the daughter of a poor country squire  when i came to your fathers i found you sitting at your tambour in a linen gown a bunch of keys to your side and your hair combed smoothly over a roll   l teazle yes i remember very well  my daily occupations were to overlook the dairy superintend the poultry make extracts from the family receipt book and combany aunt deborahs lap dog   sir peter oh i am glad to find you have so good a recollection   l teazle my evening employments were to draw patterns for ruffles which i had not materials to make up play at pope joan with the curate read a sermon to my aunt deborah or perhaps be stuck up at an old spinnet to trum my father to sleep after a foxchace   sir peter then you was glad to take a ride out behind the buttler upon the old dockd coachhorse   l teazle no no i deny the butler and the coachhorse   sir peter i say you did this was your situation  now madam you must have your coach vizaviz and three powdered coachmen to walk before your chair and in summer two white cats to draw you to kensingtongardens and instead of your living in that hole in the country i have brought you home here made a woman of fortune of you a woman of quality  in short madam i have made you my wife   l teazle well and there is but one thing more you can now do to add to the obligation and that is    sir peter to make you my widow i suppose   l teazle hem    sir peter very well madam very well i am much obliged to you for the hint   l teazle why then will you force me to say shocking things to you but now we have finished our morning conversation i presume i may go to my engagements at lady sneerwells   sir peter lady sneerwell  a precious acquaintance you have made with her too and the set that frequent her house  such a set mercy on us  many a wretch who has been drawn upon a hurdle has done less mischief than those barterers of forged lies coiners of scandal and clippers of reputation   l teazle how can you be so severe i am sure they are all people of fashion and very tenacious of reputation   sir peter yes so tenacious of it they will not allow it to any but themselves   l teazle i vow sir peter when i say an illnatured thing i mean no harm by it for i take it for granted they would do the same by me   sir peter they have made you as bad as any of them   l teazle yes  i think i bear my part with a tolerable grace    sir peter grace indeed    l teazle well but sir peter you know you promised to come   sir peter well i shall just call in to look after my own character   l teazle then upon my word you must make haste after me or you will be too late   exit l teazle sir peter i have got much by my intended expostulation  what a charming air she has  what a neck and how pleasingly she shows her contempt of my authority  well though i cannot make her love me it is some pleasure to teaze her a little and i think she never appears to such advantage as when she is doing every thing to vex and plague me   scene lady sneerwells house enter lady sneerwell crabtree sir benjamin joseph mrs candor and maria lady sneerwell nay positively well have it   joseph aye aye the epigram by all means   sir benjamin oh plague on it it is mere nonsense   crabtree faith ladies twas excellent for an extempore   sir benjamin but ladies you should be acquainted with the circumstances  you must know that one day last week as lady bab curricle was taking the dust in hyde park in a sort of duodecimo phaeton she desires me to write some verses on her ponies upon which i took out my pocket book and in a moment produced the following    sure never were seen two such beautiful ponies  other horses are clowns and these macaronies  to give them this title i am sure cannot be wrong  their legs are so slim and their tails are so long  crabtree there ladies  done in the crack of a whip  and on horseback too   joseph oh a very phoebus mounted    mrs candor i must have a copy   enter lady teazle l sneerwell lady teazle how do you do  i hope we shall see sir peter   l teazle i believe he will wait on your ladyship presently   l sneerwell maria my love you look grave come you shall sit down to picquet with mr surface   maria i take very little pleasure in cards  but i will do as your ladyship pleases   l teazle i wonder he should sit down to cards with maria  i thought he would have taken an opportunity of speaking to me before sir peter came  aside mrs candor well now i will forswear his society  aside l teazle what is the matter mrs candor   mrs candor why they are so censorious they will not allow our friend miss vermilion to be handsome   l sneerwell oh surely she is a pretty woman   crabtree i am glad you think so   mrs candor she has a charming fresh color   l teazle yes when it is fresh put on   mrs candor well i will swear it is natural for i have seen it come and go   l teazle yes it comes at night and goes again in the morning   sir benjamin true madam it not only goes and comes but what is more egad her maid can fetch and carry it   mrs candor well  and what do you think of her sister   crabtree what mrs evergreen  foregad she is six and fifty if she is a day   mrs candor nay i will swear two or three and sixty is the outside  i dont think she looks more   sir benjamin oh there is no judging by her looks unless we could see her face   l sneerwell well if mrs evergreen does take some pains to repair the ravages of time she certainly effects it with great ingenuity and surely that is better than the careless manner in which the widow oaker chalks her wrinkles   sir benjamin nay now my lady sneerwell you are too severe upon the widow  come it is not that she paints so ill but when she has finished her face she joins it so badly to her neck that she looks like a mended statue in which the connisseur may see at once that the head is modern though the trunks antique   crabtree what do you think of miss simper   sir benjamin why she has pretty teeth   l teazle yes and upon that account never shuts her mouth but keeps it always ajar as it were thus  shows her teeth   omnes ha ha ha   l teazle and yet i vow that is better than the pains mrs prim takes to conceal her losses in front  she draws her mouth till it resembles the apperture of a poor box and all her words appear to slide out edgeways as it were thus   how do you do madam  yes madam   l sneerwell ha ha ha very well lady teazle i vow you appear to be a little severe   l teazle in defense of a friend you know it is but just  but here comes sir peter to spoil our pleasantry   enter sir peter sir peter ladies your servant  mercy upon me  the whole set  a character dead at every sentence   mrs candor they will not allow good qualities to any one  not even good nature to our friend mrs pursey   crabtree what the old fat dowager that was at mrs quadrilles last night   mrs candor her bulk is her misfortune and when she takes such pains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her   l sneerwell that is very true indeed   l teazle yes  i am told she absolutely lives upon acids and small whey laces herself with pullies  often in the hottest day in summer you shall see her on a little squat poney with her hair platted and turned up like a drummer and away she goes puffing round the ring in a full trot   sir peter mercy on me this is her own relation a person they dine with twice a week aside   mrs candor i vow you shall not be so severe upon the dowager for let me tell you great allowances are to be made for a woman who strives to pass for a flirt at six and thirty   l sneerwell though surely she is handsome still and for the weakness in her eyes considering how much she reads by candlelight it is not to be wondered at   mrs candor very true and for her manner i think it very graceful considering she never had any education for her mother you know was a welsh milliner and her father a sugarbaker at bristol   sir benjamin aye ye are both of ye too good natured   mrs candor well i never will join in the ridicule of a friend so i tell my cousin ogle and ye all know what pretensions she has  beauty   crabtree she has the oddest countenance  a collection of features from all corners of the globe   sir benjamin she has indeed an irish front   crabtree caledonian locks   sir benjamin dutch nose   crabtree austrian lips   sir benjamin the complexion of a spaniard   crabtree and teeth a la chinoise   sir benjamin in short her face resembles a table drote at spa where no two guests are of a nation   crabtree or a congress at the close of a general war where every member seems to have a different interest and the nose and chin are the only parties likely to join issue   sir benjamin ha ha ha   l sneerwell ha ha  well i vow you are a couple of provoking toads   mrs candor well i vow you shall not carry the laugh so  let me tell you that mrs ogle   sir peter madam madam it is impossible to stop those good gentlemens tongues but when i tell you mrs candor that the lady they are speaking of is a particular friend of mine i hope you will be so good as not to undertake her defense   l sneerwell well said sir peter but you are a cruel creature too phlegmatic yourself for a with and too peevish to allow it to others   sir peter true wit madam is more nearly allied to good nature than you are aware of   l teazle true sir peter i believe they are so near akin that they can never be united   sir benjamin or rather madam suppose them to be man and wife one so seldom sees them together   l teazle but sir peter is such an enemy to scandal i believe he would have it put down by parliament   sir peter foregad madam if they considered the sporting with reputations of as much consequence as poaching on manors and passed an act for the preservation of fame they would find many would thank them for the bill   l sneerwell oh lud  sir peter would deprive us of our privileges   sir peter yes madam and none should then have the liberty to kill characters and run down reputations but privileged old maids and disappointed widows   l sneerwell go you monster   mrs candor but surely you would not be so severe on those who only report what they hear   sir peter yes madam i would have law for them too and wherever the drawer of the lie was not to be found the injured party should have a right to come on any of the endorsers   crabtree well i verily believe there never was a scandalous story without some foundation   sir peter nine out of ten are formed on some malicious invention or idle representation   l sneerwell come ladies shall we sit down to cards in the next room   enter a servant who whispers sir peter sir peter i will come directly  i will steal away unperceived aside   l sneerwell sir peter youre not leaving us   sir peter i beg pardon ladies it is particular business and i must  but i leave my character behind me   exit sir peter sir benjamin well certainly lady teazle that lord of yours is a strange being i could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh heartily if he was not your husband   l teazle oh never mind that  this way   they walk up and exeunt joseph you take no pleasure in this society   maria how can i if to raise a malicious smile at the misfortunes and infirmities of those who are unhappy be a proof of wit and humor heaven grant me a double portion of dullness   joseph and yet they have no malice in their hearts   maria then it is the more inexcusable since nothing but an ungovernable depravity of heart could tempt them to such a practice   joseph and is it possible maria that you can thus feel for others and yet be cruel to me alone  is hope to be denied the tenderest passion   maria why will you persist to persecute me on a subject on which you have long since known my sentiments   joseph oh maria you would not be thus deaf to me but that charles that libertine is still a favored rival   maria ungenerously urged but whatever my sentiments are with regard to that unfortunate young man be assured i shall not consider myself more bound to give him up because his misfortunes have lost him the regards  even of a brother   going out   joseph nay maria you shall not leave me with a srown by all that is honest i swear   kneels and sees lady teazle entering behind ah lady teazle ah you shall not stir   to maria i have the greatest regard in the world for lady teazle but if sir peter was once to suspect    maria lady teazle    l teazle what is all this child you are wanting in the next room  exit maria  what is the meaning of all this  what did you take her for me   joseph why you must know  maria  by some means suspecting  the  great regard i entertain for your ladyship  was  was  threatening  if i did not desist to acquaint sir peter  and i  i  was just reasoning with her    l teazle you seem to have adopted a very tender method of reasoning  pray do you usually argue on your knees   joseph why you know she is but a child and i thought a little bombast might be useful to keep her silent  but my dear lady teazle when will you come and give me your opinion of my library   l teazle why really i begin to think it not so proper and you know i admit you as a lover no farther than fashion dictates   joseph oh no more  a mere platonic cicisbeo that every lady is entitled to   l teazle no further  and though sir peters treatment may make me uneasy it shall never provoke me    joseph to the only revenge in your power   l teazle go you insinuating wretch  but we shall be missed let us join the company   joseph i will follow your ladyship   l teazle dont stay long for i promise you maria shall not come to hear any more of your reasoning   exit lady teazle joseph a pretty situation i am in  by gaining the wife i shall lose the heiress  i at first intended to make her ladyship only the instrument in my designs on maria but  i dont know how it is  i am become her serious admirer i begin now to wish i had not made a point of gaining so very good a character for it has brought me into so many confounded rogueries that i fear i shall be exposed at last   exit joseph scene sir peter teazles house enter sir oliver and rowley sir oliver ha ha and so my old friend is married at last eh rowley  and to a young wife out of the country ha ha ha that he should buff to old batchelors so long and sink into a husband at last   rowley but let me beg of you sir not to rally him upon the subject for he cannot bear it though he has been married these seven months   sir oliver then he has been just half a year on the stool of repentance poor sir peter  but you say he has entirely given up charles  never sees him eh   rowley his prejudice against him is astonishing and i believe is greatly aggravated by a suspicion of a connection between charles and lady teazle and such a report i know has been circulated and kept up by means of lady sneerwell and a scandalous party who associate at her house where as i am convinced if there is any partiality in the case that joseph is the favorite   sir oliver ay ay i know there are a set of mischievous prating gossips both male and female who murder characters to kill him and rob a young fellow of his good name before he has sense enough to know the value of it  but i am not to be prejudic against my nephew by any such i promise you  no no if charles has done nothing false or mean i shall compound for his extravagance   rowley i rejoice sir to hear you say so and am happy to find the son of my old master has one friend left however   sir oliver what shall i forget mr rowley when i was at his years myself  egad neither my brother or i were very prudent youths and yet i believe you have not seen many better men than your old master was   rowley it is that reflection i build my hopes on  and my life on it charles will prove deserving of your kindness  but here comes sir peter   enter sir peter sir peter where is he where is sir oliver  ah my dear friend i rejoice to see you  you are welcome indeed you are welcome  you are welcome to england a thousand  and a thousand times    sir oliver thank you thank sir peter  and am glad to find you so well believe me   sir peter ah sir oliver  it is sixteen years since last we saw each other  many a bout we have had together in our time   sir oliver aye i have had my share  but what i find you are married  hey old boy  well well it cannot be helped and so i wish you joy with all my heart   sir peter thank you thank you  yes sir oliver i have entered into that happy state  but we will not talk of that now   sir oliver that is true sir peter old friends should not begin upon grievances at their first meeting no no no   rowley  aside to sir oliver have a care sir  dont touch upon that subject   sir oliver well  so one of my nephews i find is a wild young rogue   sir peter oh my dear friend i grieve at your disappointment there  charles is indeed a sad libertine  but no matter joseph will make you ample amends  every body speaks well of him   sir oliver i am very sorry to hear it he has too good a character to be an honest fellow  every body speaks well of him  pshaw  then he has bowed as low to knaves and fools as to the honest dignity of genius and virtue   sir peter what the plague are you angry with joseph for not making enemies   sir oliver why not if he has merit enough to deserve them   sir peter well well see him and you will be convinced how worthy he is  he is a pattern for all the young men of the age  he is a man of the noblest sentiments   sir oliver oh plague of his sentiments  if he salutes me with a scrap of morality in his mouth i shall be sick directly  but dont however mistake me sir peter i dont mean to defend charless errors but before i form my judgment of either of them i intend to make a trial of their hearts and my friend rowley and i have planned something for that purpose   sir peter my life on josephs honor   sir oliver well well give us a bottle of good wine and well drink your ladys health and tell you all our schemes   sir peter alons  done   sir oliver and dont sir peter be too severe against your old friends son  odds my life i am not sorry he has run a little out of the course  for my part i hate to see prudence clinging to the green suckers of youth it is like ivy round the saplin and spoils the growth of the tree   exeunt omnes end of the second act act iii scene sir peters house enter sir peter sir oliver and rowley sir peter well well well see this man first and then have our wine afterward  but rowley i dont see the jest of your scheme   rowley why sir this mr stanley was a near relation of their mothers and formerly an eminent merchant in dublin  he failed in trade and is greatly reduced he has applied by letter to mr surface and charles for assistance  from the former of whom he has received nothing but fair promises while charles in the midst of his own distresses is at present endeavoring to raise a sum of money part of which i know he intends for the use of mr stanley   sir oliver aye  he is my brothers son   rowley now sir we propose that sir oliver shall visit them both in the character of mr stanley as i have informed them he has obtained leave of his creditors to wait on his friends in person  and in the younger believe me you will find one who in the midst of dissipation and extravagance has still as our immortal bard expresses it a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity   sir peter what signifies his open hand and purse if he has nothing to give but where is this person you were speaking of   rowley below sir waiting your commands  you must know sir oliver this is a friendly jew one who to do him justice has done every thing in his power to assist charles  who waits   enter a servant desire mr moses to walk up   exit servant sir peter but how are you sure he will speak truth   rowley why sir i have persuaded him there is no prospect of his being paid several sums of money he has advanced for charles but through the bounty of sir oliver who he knows is in town therefore you may depend on his being faithful to his interest  oh here comes the honest israelite   enter moses sir oliver this is mr moses  mr moses this is sir oliver   sir oliver i understand you have lately had great dealings with my nephew charles   moses yes sir oliver i have done all i could for him  but he was ruined before he came to me for assistance   sir oliver that was unlucky truly for you had no opportunity of showing your talent   moses none at all i had not the pleasure of knowing his distresses till he was some thousands worse than nothing   sir oliver unfortunate indeed but i suppose you have done all in your power for him   moses yes he knows that  this very evening i was to have brought him a gentleman from the city who does not know him and will advance him some moneys   sir peter what a person that charles has never borrowed money of before lend him any in his present circumstances   moses yes    sir oliver what is the gentlemans name   moses mr premium of crutched friars formerly a broker   sir peter does he know mr premium   moses not at all   sir peter a thought strikes me  suppose sir oliver you was to visit him in that character twill be much better than the romantic one of an old relation you will then have an opportunity of sing charles in all his glory   sir oliver egad i like that idea better than the other and then i may visit joseph afterward as old stanley   rowley gentlemen this is taking charles rather unawares but moses you understand sir oliver and i dare say will be faithful   moses you may depend upon me  this is very near the time i was to have gone   sir oliver i will accompany you as soon as you please moses but hold  i had forgot one thing  how the plague shall i be able to pass for a jew   moses there is no need  the principal is a christian   sir oliver is he i am very sorry for it  but then again am i not too smartly dressed to look like a moneylender   sir peter not at all  it would not be out of character if you went in your own chariot would it moses   moses not in the least   sir oliver well but how must i talk there is certainly some cant of usury or mode of treating that i ought to know   sir peter as i take it sir oliver the great point is to be exorbitant in your demands  eh moses   moses yes dat is very great point   sir oliver i will answer for it i will not be wanting in that eight or ten per cent on the loan at least   moses oh if you ask him no more as dat you will be ciscovered immediately   sir oliver hey what the plague  how much then   moses that depends upon the circumstances  if he appears not very anxious for the supply you should require only forty or fifty per cent but if you find him in great distress and he wants money very bad  you must ask double   sir peter upon my word sir oliver  mr premium i mean  it is a very pretty trade youre learning   sir oliver truly i think so and not unprofitable   moses then you know you have not the money yourself but are forced to borrow it of a friend   sir oliver oh i borrow it for him of a friend  do i   moses yes and your friends an unconscionable dog  but you cannot help dat   sir oliver oh my friends an unconscionable dog  is he   moses and then he himself has not the moneys by him but is forced to sell stock at a great loss   sir oliver he is forced to sell stock at a great loss  well really that is very kind of him   sir peter but harkye moses if sir oliver was to rail a little at the annuity bill dont you think it would have a good effect   moses very much   rowley and lament that a young man must now come to years of discretion before he has it in his power to ruin himself   moses aye a great pity   sir peter yes and abuse the public for allowing merit to a bill whose only object was to rescue youth and inexperience from the rapacious gripe of usury and to give the young heir an opportunity of enjoying his fortune without being ruined by coming into possession   sir oliver so  so  moses shall give me further instructions as we go together   sir peter you will scarce have time to learn your trade for charles lives but hard by   sir oliver oh never fear  my tutor appears so able that tho charles lived in the next street it must be my own fault if i am not a complete rogue before i have turned the corner   exeunt sir oliver and moses sir peter so rowley you would have been partial and given charles notice of our plot   rowley no indeed sir peter   sir peter well i see maria coming i want to have some talk with her  exit rowley enter maria so maria what is mr surface come home with you   maria no sir he was engaged   sir peter maria i wish you were more sensible to his excellent qualities  does not every time you are in his company convince you of the merit of that amiable young man   maria you know sir peter i have often told you that of all the men who have paid me a particular attention there is not one i would not sooner prefer than mr surface   sir peter aye aye this blindness to his merit proceeds from your attachment to that profligate brother of his   maria this is unkind you know at your request i have forborne to see or correspond with him as i have long been convinced he is unworthy my regard but while my reason condemns his vices my heart suggests some pity for his misfortunes   sir peter ah you had best resolve to think of him no more but give your heart and hand to a worthier object   maria never to his brother   sir peter have a care maria i have not yet made you know what the authority of a guardian is dont force me to exert it   maria i know that for a short time i am to obey you as my father  but must cease to think you so when you would compel me to be miserable  exit in tears sir peter sure never man was plagued

acquaintance and when my cousin sophy used to laugh at me for thinking of marrying a man old enough to be my father and call you an ugly stiff formal old bachelor i contradicted her and said i did not think you so ugly by any means and that i dared say you would make a good sort of a husband   sir peter that was very kind of you  well and you were not mistaken you have found it so have not you  but shall we always live thus happy   l teazle with all my heart  i am  i dont care how soon we leave off quarrelling  provided you will own you are tired first   sir peter with all my heart   l teazle

are a very great bear i am sure to abuse my relations   sir peter but i am well enough served for marrying you  a pert forward rural coquette who had refused half the honest squires in the country   l teazle i am sure i was a great fool for marrying you  a stiff crop dangling old bachelor who was unmarried at fifty because nobody would have him   sir peter you was very glad to have me  you never had such an offer before   l teazle oh yes i had  there was sir tivey terrier who every body said would be a better match for his estate was full as good as yours and  he has broke his neck since we were married   sir peter very  very well madam  youre an ungrateful woman and may plagues light on me if i ever try to be friends with you again  you shall have a separate maintenance   l teazle by all means a separate maintenance   sir peter very well madam  oh very well aye madam and i believe the stories of you and charles  of you and charles madam  were not without foundation   l teazle take

astonishing there are many of our acquaintance who are men of wit genius and spirit but then they will not drink   carless true charles they sink into the more substantial luxuries of the table and quite neglect the bottle   charles right  besides society suffers by it for instead of the mirth and humor that used to mantle over a bottle of burgundy their conversation is become as insipid as the spa water they drink which has all the pertness of champaigne without its spirit or flavor   sir toby but what will you say to those who prefer play to the bottle  there is harry dick and careless

are a prudent old fellow who has got money to lend  i am such a fool as to give fifty per cent rather than go without it and you i suppose are rogue enough to take an hundred if you can get it and now we understand one another and may proceed to business without further ceremony   sir oliver exceeding frank upon my word i see you are not a man of compliments   charles no sir   sir oliver sir i like you the better for it  however you are mistaken in one thing i have no money to lend but i believe i could procure you some from a friend but then he is a damned unconscionable dog is he not moses

charles none but live stock and they are only a few pointers and ponies  but pray sir are you acquainted with any of my connections   sir oliver to say the truth i am   charles then you must have heard that i had a rich old uncle in india sir oliver surface from whom i have the greatest expectations   sir oliver that you have a wealthy uncle i have heard but how your expectations will turn out is more i believe than you can tell   charles oh yes i am told i am a monstrous favorite and that he intends leaving me every thing   sir oliver indeed this is the first i have heard of it   charles yes yes he intends making me his heir  does he not moses   moses oh yes i will take my oath of that   sir oliver egad they will persuade me presently that i am in bengal  aside charles now what i propose mr premium is to give you a post obiit on my uncles life though indeed my uncle noll has been very kind to me and upon my soul i shall be sincerely sorry to hear any thing has happened to him   sir oliver not more than i should i assure you but the bond you mention happens to be the worst security you could offer me for i might live to be an hundred and never recover the principal   charles oh yes you would for the moment he dies you come upon me for the money   sir oliver then i believe i would be the most unwelcome dun you ever had in your life   charles what you are afraid my little premium that my uncle is too good a life   sir oliver no indeed i am not though i have heard he is as hale and as hearty as any man of his years in christendom   charles oh there you are misinformed

much altered of late that his relations would not know him ha ha ha that is droll egad   charles what you are pleased to hear he is on the decline my little premium   sir oliver no i am not  no no no   charles yes you are for it mends your chance   sir oliver but i am told sir oliver is coming over  nay some say he is actually arrived   charles oh there you are misinformed again  no  no such thing  he is this moment in bengal what i must certainly know better than you   sir oliver very true as you say you must know better than i though i have it from very good authority  have i not moses   moses most undoubtedly   sir oliver but sir as i understand you want a few hundreds immediately is there nothing that you would dispose of   charles how do you mean   sir oliver for instance now i have heard your father left behind him a great quantity of massy old plate   charles yes but that is gone long ago  moses can inform you how better than i can   sir oliver good lack all the family race cups and corporation bowls gone  aside it was also supposed that his library was one of the most valuable and complete   charles much too large and valuable for a private gentleman for my part i was always of a communicative disposition and thought it a pity to keep so much knowledge to myself   sir oliver mercy on me knowledge that has run in the family like a heirloom  aside and pray how may they have been disposed of   charles oh you must ask the auctioneer that  i dont believe even moses can direct you there   moses no  i never meddle with books   sir oliver the profligate  aside and is there nothing you can dispose of   charles nothing  unless you have a taste for old family pictures i have a whole room full of ancestors above stairs   sir oliver why sure you would not sell your relations   charles every soul of them to the best bidder   sir oliver not your great uncles and aunts   charles aye and my grandfathers and grandmothers   sir oliver i will never forgive him this  aside why  what  do you take me for shylock in the play to raise money from me on your own flesh and blood   charles nay dont be in a passion my little premium what is it to you if you have your moneys worth   sir oliver that is very true as you say  well well i believe i can dispose of the family canvass i will never forgive him this  aside enter careless careless come charles what the devil

agoing   charles bravo  and moses you shall be appraiser if we want one   moses yes i will be the appraiser   sir oliver oh the profligate  aside charles but what is the matter my little premium you dont seem to relish this business   sir oliver  affecting to laugh oh yes i do vastly ha ha ha i  oh the prodigal  aside charles very true for when a man wants money who the devil can he make free

that has a better right to it   rowley ah sir i wish you would remember the proverb    charles  be just before you are generous  why fool would if i could but justice is an old lame hobbling beldame and i cannot get her to keep pace with generosity for the soul of me   rowley do dear sir reflect   charles that is very true as you say  but rowley while i have by heavens i will give  so damn your morality and away to old stanley with the money   exeunt and enter sir oliver and moses moses well sir i think as sir peter said you have seen mr charles in all his glory  it is great pity he is so extravagant   sir oliver true but he would not sell my picture    moses and loves wine and women so much   sir oliver but he would not sell my picture    moses and games so deep   sir oliver but he would not sell my picture  oh here comes rowley   enter rowley rowley well sir i find you have made a purchase   sir oliver yes our young rake has parted with his ancestors like tapestry   rowley and he has commissioned me to return you an hundred pounds of the purchase money but under your fictitious character of old stanley i saw a tailor and two nosiers dancing attendance who i know will go unpaid and the two hundred pounds would just satisfy them   sir oliver well well i will pay his debts and his benevolence too  but now i am no more a broker and you shall introduce me to the elder brother as old stanley   enter trip trip gentlemen i am sorry i was not in the way to show you out harkye moses   exit with moses sir oliver there is a fellow now  will you believe it that puppy

were content with the follies of their masters when they were wore a little threadbare but now they have their vices like their birthday clothes with their gloss on   exeunt scene the apartments of joseph surface enter joseph and a servant joseph no letter from lady teazle   servant no sir   joseph i wonder she did not write if she could not come  i hope sir peter does not suspect me  but charless dissipation and extravagance are great points in my favor  knocking at the door  see if it is her   servant it is lady teazle sir but she always orders her chair to the milliners in the next street   joseph then draw that screen  my opposite neighbor is a maiden lady of so curious a temper  you need not wait  exit servant  my lady teazle i am afraid begins to suspect my attachment to maria but she must not be acquainted with that secret till i have her more in my power   enter lady teazle l teazle what sentiment in soliloquy  have you been very impatient now nay you look so grave  i assure you i came as soon as i could   joseph oh madam punctuallity is a species of constancy  a very unfashionable custom among ladies   l teazle nay now you wrong me i am sure you would pity me if you knew my situation   both sit  sir peter grows so peevish and so ill natured there is no enduring him and then to suspect me with charles    joseph i am glad my scandalous friends keep up that report  aside l teazle for my part i wish sir peter to let maria marry him  would not you mr surface   joseph  aside indeed i would not  oh to be sure and then my dear lady teazle would be convinced how groundless her suspicions were of my having any thoughts of the silly girl   l teazle then there is my friend lady sneerwell has propagated malicious stories about me  and what is very provoking all too without the least foundation   joseph ah there is the mischief for when a scandalous story is believed against me there is no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it   l teazle and to be continually censured and suspected when i know the integrity of my own heart  it would almost prompt me to give him some grounds for it   joseph certainly for when a husband grows suspicious and withdraws his confidence from his wife it then becomes a part of her duty to endeavor to out wit him  you owe it to the natural privilege of your sex   l teazle indeed   joseph oh yes for your husband should never be deceived in you and you ought to be frail in compliment to his discernment   l teazle this is the newest doctrine   joseph very wholesome believe me   l teazle so the only way to prevent his suspicions is to give him cause for them   joseph certainly   l teazle but then the consciousness of my innocence    joseph ah my dear lady teazle it is that consciousness of your innocence that ruins you  what is it that makes you imprudent in your conduct and careless of the censures of the world the consciousness of your innocence  what is it makes you regardless of forms and inattentive to your husbands peace why the consciousness of your innocence  now my dear lady teazel if you could only be prevailed upon to make a trifling faux pas you cant imagine how circumspect you would grow   l teazle do you think so   joseph depend upon it  your case at present my dear lady teazle resembles that of a person in a plethora  you are absolutely dying of too much health   l teazle why indeed if my understanding could be convinced   joseph your understanding  oh yes your understanding should be convinced heaven forbid that i should persuade you to any thing that is wrong no no i have too much honor for that   l teazle dont you think you may as well leave honor out of the question  both rise   joseph ah i see lady teazle the effects of country education still remain   l teazle they do indeed and i begin to find myself imprudent and if i should be brought to act wrong it would be sooner from sir peters ill treatment of me than from your honorable logic i assure you   joseph then by this hand which is unworthy   knowing a servant enters  what do you want you scoundrell   servant i beg pardon sir  i thought you would not choose sir peter should come up   joseph sir peter   l teazle sir peter oh i am undone  what shall i do hide me somewhere good mr logic   joseph here here behind this screen  she runs behind the screen and now reach me a book  sits down and reads   enter sir peter sir peter aye there he is ever improving himself  mr surface mr surface   joseph  affecting to gape oh sir peter  i rejoice to see you  i was got over a sleepy book here  i am vastly glad to see you  i thank you for this call  i believe you have not been here since i finished my library  books books you know are the only thing i am a coxcomb in   sir peter very pretty indeed  why even your screen is a source of knowledge  hung round with maps i see   joseph yes i find great use in that screen   sir peter yes yes so you must when you want to find any thing in a hurry   joseph yes or to hide any thing in a hurry  aside sir peter but my dear friend i want to have some private talk with you   joseph you need not wait   exit servant sir peter pray sit down   both sit  my dear friend i want to impart to you some of my distresses  in short lady teazles behavior of late has given me very great uneasiness she not only dissipates and destroys my fortune but i have strong reasons to believe she has formed an attachment elsewhere   joseph i am unhappy to hear it   sir peter yes and between you and me i believe i have discovered the person   joseph you alarm me exceedingly   sir peter i know you would sympathize with me   joseph believe me sir peter such a discovery would affect me  just as much as it does you   sir peter what a happiness to have a friend we can trust even with our family secrets  cannot you guess who it is   joseph i havnt the most distant idea  it cannot be sir benjamin backbite   sir peter no no  what do you think of charles   joseph my brother impossible  i cannot think he would be guilty of such baseness and ingratitude   sir peter ah the goodness of your own mind makes you slow to believe such villainy   joseph very true sir peter  the man who is conscious of his own integrity of heart is very slow to credit anothers baseness   sir peter and yet that the son of my old friend should practice against the honor of my family   joseph aye there is the case sir peter  when ingratitude barbs the dart of injury the wound feels double smart   sir peter what noble sentiments  he never used a sentiment ungrateful boy that i acted as guardian to and who was brought up under my eye and i never in my life refused him  my advice   joseph i dont know sir peter  he may be such a man  if it be so he is no longer a brother of mine i renounce him i disclaim him  for the man who can break through the laws of hospitality and seduce the wife or daughter of his friend deserves to be branded as a pest to society   sir peter and yet joseph if i was to make it public i should only be sneered and laughed at   joseph why that is very true  no no you must not make it public people would talk    sir peter talk  they would say it was all my own fault an old doting bachelor to marry a young giddy girl they would paragraph me in the newspapers and make ballads on me   joseph and yet sir peter i cannot think that my lady teazles honor    sir peter ah my good friend what is her honor opposed against the flattery of a handsome young fellow  but joseph she has been upbraiding me of late that i have not made her a settlement and i think in our last quarrel she told me she should not be very sorry if i was dead now i have drafts of two deeds for your perusal and she shall find if i was to die that i have not been inattentive to her welfare while living by the one she will enjoy eight hundred pounds a year during my life and by the other the bulk of my fortune after my death   joseph this conduct is truly generous  i wish it may not corrupt my pupil  aside sir peter but i would not have her as yet acquainted with the least mark of my affection   joseph nor i  if you could help it   sir peter and now i have unburthened myself to you let us talk over your affair with maria   joseph not a syllable upon the subject now  alarmed  some other time i am too much affected by your affairs to think of my own for the man who can think of his own happiness while his friend is in distress deserves to be hunted as a monster to society   sir peter i am sure of your affection for her   joseph let me entreat you sir peter    sir peter and though you are so averse to lady teazles knowing it i assure you she is not your enemy and i am sensibly chagrined you have made no furthur progress   joseph sir peter i must not hear you  the man who   enter servant what do you want sirrah   servant your brother sir is at the door talking to a gentleman he says he knows you are at home that sir peter is with you and he must see you   joseph i am not at home   sir peter yes yes you shall be at home   joseph  after some hesitation very well let him come up   exit servant sir peter now joseph i will hide myself and do you tax him about the affair with my lady teazle and so draw the secret from him   joseph o fie sir peter  what join in a plot to trepan my brother   sir peter oh aye to serve your friend  besides if he is innocent as you say he is it will give him an opportunity to clear himself and make me very happy hark i hear him coming  where shall i go behind this screen  what the devil here has been one listner already for i will swear i saw a petticoat   joseph  affecting to laugh it is very ridiculous ha ha ha  a ridiculous affair indeed  ha ha ha hark ye sir peter  pulling him aside though i hold a man of intrigue to be a most despicable character yet you know it does not follow that one is to be an absolute joseph either hark ye it is a little french milliner who calls upon me sometimes and hearing you were coming and having some character to loose she sliped behind the screen   sir peter a french milliner  smiling cunning rogue joseph  fly rogue  but zounds she has over heard every thing that has passed about my wife   joseph oh never fear  take my word it will never go farther for her   sir peter will not it   joseph no depend upon it   sir peter well well if it will go no farther  but  where shall i hide myself   joseph here here slip into this closet and you may over hear every word   l teazle can i steal away  peeping joseph hush hush dont stir   sir peter joseph tax him home  peeping joseph in my dear sir peter   l teazle cannot you lock the closet door   joseph not a word  you will be discovered   sir peter joseph dont spare him   joseph for heavens sake lie close  a pretty situation i am in to part man and wife in this manner  aside sir peter youre sure the little french milliner will not blab   enter charles charles why how now brother your fellow denied you they said you were not at home  what have you had a jew wench with you   joseph neither brother neither   charles but where is sir peter i thought he was with you   joseph he was brother but hearing you was coming he left the house   charles what was the old fellow afraid i wanted to borrow money of him   joseph borrow no brother but i am sorry to hear you have given that worthy man cause for great uneasiness   charles yes i am told i do that to a great many worthy men  but how do you mean brother   joseph why he thinks you have endavoured to alienate the affections of lady teazle   charles who i alienate the affections of lady teazle  upon my word he accuses me very unjustly what has the old gentleman found out that he has got a young wife or what is worse has the lady found out that she has got an old husband   joseph for shame brother   charles it is true i did once suspect her ladyship had a partiality for me but upon my soul i never gave her the least encouragement for you know my attachment was to maria   joseph this will make sir peter extremely happy  but if she had a partiality for you sure you would not have been base enough    charles why look ye joseph i hope i shall never deliberately do a dishonorable action but if a pretty woman should purposely throw herself in my way and as that pretty woman should happen to be married to a man old enough to be her father    joseph what then   charles why then i believe i should  have occasion to borrow a little of your morality brother   joseph oh fie brother  the man who can jest    charles oh that is very true as you were going to observe  but joseph do you know that i am surprised at your suspecting me with lady teazle i thought you was always the favorite there   joseph me    charles why yes i have seen you exchange such significant glances   joseph pshaw   charles yes i have and dont you remember when i came in here and caught her and you at    joseph i must stop him  aside  stops his mouth sir peter has overheard every word that you have said   charles sir peter where is he  what in the closet  foregad i will have him out   joseph no no  stopping him   charles i will  sir peter teazle come into court  enter sir peter what my old guardian turn inquisitor and take evidence incog   sir peter give me your hand  i own my dear boy i have suspected you wrongfully but you must not be angry at joseph it was all my plot and i shall think of you as long i live for what i overheard   charles then it is well you did not hear more is it not joseph   sir peter what you would have retorted on joseph would you   charles and yet you might as well have suspected him as me might not he joseph   enter servant servant  whispering joseph  lady sneerwell sir is just coming up and says she must see you   joseph gentlemen i must beg your pardon i have company waiting for me give me leave to conduct you down stairs   charles no no speak to em in another room i have not seen sir peter a great while and i want to talk with him   joseph well i will send away the person and return immediately sir peter not a word of the little french milliner   exit sir peter ah charles what a pity it is you dont associate more with your brother we might then have some hopes of your reformation he is a young man of such sentiments  ah there is nothing in the world so noble as a man of sentiment   charles oh he is too moral by half and so apprehensive of his good name that i dare say he would as soon let a priest into his house as a wench   sir peter no no you accuse him wrongfully  though joseph is not a rake he is no saint   charles oh a perfect anchorite  a young hermit   sir peter hush hush dont abuse him or he may chance to hear of it again   charles why you will not tell him will you   sir peter no no but  i have a great mind to tell him  aside  seems to hesitate  harkye charles have you a mind for a laugh at joseph   charles i should like it of all things  let us have it   sir peter gad i will tell him  i will be even with joseph for discovering me in the closet   aside  harkye charles he had a girl with him when i called   charles who joseph impossible   sir peter yes a little french milliner  takes him to the front and the best of the joke is she is now in the room   charles the devil she is  where   sir peter hush hush  behind the screen   charles i will have her out   sir peter no no no no   charles yes   sir peter no   charles by the lord i will  so now for it both run up to the screen  screen falls at the same time   joseph enters charles lady teazle by all that is wonderful   sir peter lady teazle by all that is horrible   charles sir peter this is the smartest french milliner i ever saw but pray what is the meaning of all this you seem to have been playing at hide and seek here and for my part i dont know who is in or who is out of the secret  madam will you please to explain  not a word  brother is it your pleasure to illustrate  morality dum too  well though i can make nothing of it i suppose you can perfectly understand one another good folks and so i will leave you brother i am sorry you have given that worthy man so much cause for uneasiness  sir peter there is nothing in the world so noble as a man of sentiment  ha ha ha   exit joseph sir peter notwithstanding appearances are against me  if  if you will give me leave  i will explain every thing to your satisfaction   sir peter if you please sir   joseph lady teazle knowing any  lady teazle  i say  knowing my pretensions  to your ward  maria  and  lady teazle  i say  knowing the jealousy of my  of your temper  she called in here  in order that she  that i  might explain  what these pretensions were  and  hearing you were coming  and  as i said before  knowing the jealousy of your temper  she  my lady teazle  i say  went behind the screen  and  this is a full and clear account of the whole affair   sir peter a very clear account truly and i dare say the lady will vouch for the truth of every word of it   l teazle  advancing for not one syllable sir peter   sir peter what the devil dont you think it worth your while to agree in the lie   l teazle there is not one word of truth in what that gentleman has been saying   joseph zounds madam you will not ruin me   l teazle stand out of the way mr hypocrite i will speak for myself   sir peter aye aye  let her alone  she will make a better story of it than you did   l teazle i came here with no intention of listening to his addresses to maria and even ignorant of his pretensions but seduced by his insidious arts at least to listen to his addresses if not to sacrifice his honor as well as my own to his unwarrantable desires   sir peter now i believe the truth is coming indeed   joseph what is the woman mad   l teazle no sir she has recovered her senses sir peter i cannot expect you will credit me but the tenderness you expressed for me when i am certain you did not know i was within hearing has penetrated so deep into my soul that could i have escaped the mortification of this discovery my future life should have convinced you of my sincere repentance as for that smooth tongued hypocrite who would have seduced the wife of his too credulous friend while he pretended an honorable passion for his ward i now view him in so despicable a light that i shall never again respect myself for having listened to his addresses   exit joseph sir peter  notwithstanding all this  heaven is my witness    sir peter that you are a villain  and so i will leave you to your meditations    joseph nay sir peter you must

this is he whom sir peter extols as a man of a most benevolent way of thinking   rowley yes he has as much speculative benevolence as any man in the kingdom though he is not so sensual as to indulge himself in the exercise of it   sir oliver yet he has a string of sentiments i suppose at his fingers ends   rowley and his favorite one is that charity begins at home   sir oliver and his i presume is of that domestic sort which never stirs abroad at all   rowley well sir i will leave you to introduce yourself as old stanley i must be here again to announce you in your real character   sir

sir peter you are a very ungrateful fellow   mrs candor aye that was charles   sir benjamin mr surface  and old as i am says he i demand immediate satisfaction upon this they both drew their swords

heard nothing of all this i must own ladies my uncles account is more circumstantial though mine is the true one   l sneerwell i am more interested in this affair than they imagine and must have better information  aside and exit sir benjamin lady sneerwells alarm is very easily accounted for   crabtree why yes they do say  but that is neither here nor there   mrs candor but pray where is sir peter now i hope his wound will not prove mortal   crabtree he was carried home immediately and has given positive orders to be denied to every body   sir benjamin and i believe lady teazle is attending him   mrs candor i do believe so too   crabtree certainly  i met one of the faculty as i came in   sir benjamin gad so and here he comes   crabtree yes yes that is the doctor   mrs candor

way of recovery   sir benjamin pray doctor was he not wounded by a thrust of a sword through the small guts   crabtree was it not by a bullet that lodged in the thorax   sir benjamin nay pray answer

nothing more sir   sir benjamin then i suppose as you are a friend you can be better able to give us some account of his wounds   sir oliver wounds   mrs candor what havnt you heard he was wounded  the saddest accident   sir benjamin a thrust with a sword through the small guts   crabtree a bullet in the thorax   sir oliver good people speak one at a time i beseech you  you both agree that sir peter is dangerously wounded   crabtree sir benjamin ay ay we both agree in that   sir oliver then i will be bold to say sir peter is one of the most imprudent men in the world for here he comes walking as if nothing had happened  enter sir peter my good friend you are certainly mad to walk about in this condition you should go to bed you that have had a sword through your small guts and a bullet lodged in your thorax   sir peter a sword through my small guts and a bullet lodged in my thorax   sir oliver yes these worthy people would have killed you without law or physic and wanted to dub me a doctor in order to make me an accomplice   sir peter what is all this   sir benjamin sir peter we are all very glad to find the story of the duel is not true   crabtree and exceedingly sorry for your other misfortunes   sir peter so so all over the town already  aside mrs candor though as sir peter was so good a husband i pity him sincerely   sir peter plague of your pity   crabtree as

you will meet on this occasion   crabtree it is no uncommon case that is one thing   sir peter i insist upon being master here in plain terms i desire you will leave my house immediately   mrs candor

benjamin crabtree and how patiently you bare it    exit crabtree sir peter leave my house i say  fiends furies there is no bearing it   enter rowley sir oliver well sir peter i have seen my nephews   rowley and sir oliver is convinced your judgment is right after all   sir oliver aye joseph is the man   rowley such sentiments   sir oliver and acts up to the sentiments he professes   rowley oh it is edification to hear him talk   sir oliver he is a pattern for the young men of the age  but how comes it sir peter that you dont join in his praises   sir peter sir oliver we live in a damned wicked world and the fewer we praise the better   sir oliver right right my old friend  but was you always so moderate in your judgment   rowley do you say so sir peter you never was mistaken in your life   sir peter oh plague of your jokes  i suppose you are acquainted with the whole affair   rowley i am indeed sir  i met lady teazle returning from mr surfaces so humbled that she deigned to beg even me to become here advocate   sir peter what does sir oliver know it too   sir oliver aye aye every circumstance   sir peter what about the closet and the screen   sir oliver yes and the little french milliner too i never laughed more in my life   sir peter and a very pleasant jest it was   sir oliver this is your man of sentiment sir peter   sir peter oh damn his sentiments   sir oliver you must have made a pretty appearance when charles dragged you out of the closet   sir peter yes yes that was very diverting   sir oliver and egad sir peter i should like to have seen your face when the screen was thrown down   sir peter my face when the screen was thrown down oh yes  there is no bearing this  aside   sir oliver come come my old friend dont be vexed for i cannot help laughing for the soul of me ha ha ha   sir peter oh laugh on  i am not vexed  no no it is the pleasantest thing in the world to be the standing jest of all ones acquaintance it is the happiest situation imaginable   rowley see sir yonder is my lady teazle coming this way and in tears let me beg of you to be reconciled   sir oliver well well i will leave rowley to mediate between you and take my leave but you must make haste after me to mr surfaces where i go if not to reclaim a libertine at least to expose hypocrisy   exit sir peter i will be with you at the discovery i should like to see it though it is a vile unlucky place for discoveries rowley  looking out she is not coming this way   rowley no sir but she has left the room door open and writs your coming   sir peter well certainly mortification is very becoming in a wife  dont you think i had better let her pine a little longer   rowley oh sir that is being too severe   sir peter i dont think so the letter i found from charles was evidently intended for her   rowley indeed sir peter you are much mistaken   sir peter if i was convinced of that  see master rowley she looks this way  what a remarkable elegant turn of the head she has  i have a good mind to go to her   rowley do dear sir   sir peter but when it is known that we are reconciled i shall be laughed at more than ever   rowley let them laugh on and retort their malice upon themselves by showing them you can be happy in spite of their slander   sir peter faith and so i will master rowley and my lady teazle and i may still be the happiest couple in the country   rowley oh fie sir peter he that lays aside suspicion    sir peter my dear rowley if you have any regard for me never let me hear you utter any thing like a sentiment again i have had enough of that to last me the remainder of my life   exeunt scene josephs library enter joseph and lady sneerwell l sneerwell impossible will not sir peter be immediately reconciled to charles and no longer oppose his union with maria   joseph can passion mend it   l sneerwell no nor cunning neither i was a fool to league with such a blunderer   joseph sure my lady sneerwell i am the greatest sufferer in this affair and yet you see i bear it with calmness   l sneerwell because the disappointment does not reach your heart your interest only was concerned had you felt for maria what i do for that unfortunate libertine your brother you would not be dissuaded from taking every revenge in your power   joseph why will you rail at me for the disappointment   l sneerwell are you not the cause had you not a sufficient field for your roguery in imposing upon sir peter and supplanting your brother but you must endeavor to seduce his wife i hate such an avarice of crimes it is an unfair monopoly and never prospers   joseph well i own i am to blame  i have deviated from the direct rule of wrong yet i cannot think circumstances are so bad as your ladyship apprehends   l sneerwell no   joseph you tell me you have made another trial of snake that he still proves steady to our interest and that he is ready if occasion requires to swear to a contract having passed between charles and your ladyship   l sneerwell and what then   joseph why the letters which have been so carefully circulated will corroborate his evidence and prove the truth of the assertion but i expect my uncle every moment and must beg your ladyship to retire into the next room   l sneerwell but if he should find you out   joseph i have no fear of that  sir peter will not tell for his own sake and i shall soon find out sir olivers weak side   l sneerwell nay i have no doubt of your abilities only be constant to one villainy at a time   joseph well i will i will   exit lady sneerwell  it is confounded hard though to be baited by ones confederate in wickedness   knocking  who have we got here my uncle oliver i suppose  oh old stanley again how came he here he must not stay   enter sir oliver i told you already mr stanley that it was not in my power to relieve you   sir oliver but i hear sir that sir oliver is arrived and perhaps he might   joseph well sir you cannot stay now sir but any other time sir you shall certainly be relieved   sir oliver h sir oliver and i must be acquainted   joseph i  upon your going indeed mr  you cannot stay   sir olive positively i must see sir oliver   joseph then positively you shall not stay  pushing him out enter charles charles hey day what is the matter why who the devil have we got here what my little premium oh brother you must not hurt my little broker but harkye joseph what have you been borrowing money too   joseph borrowing money no brother  we expect my uncle oliver here every minute and mr stanley insists upon seeing him   charles stanley why his name is premium   joseph no no i tell you his name is stanley   charles but i tell you again his name is premium   joseph it dont signify what his name is   charles no more it dont as you say brother for i suppose he goes by half a hundred names besides a b at the coffeehouses but old noll must not come and catch my little broker here neither   joseph mr stanley i beg    charles and i beg mr premium    joseph you must go indeed mr stanley   charles aye you must go mr premium  both pushing him enter sir peter lady teazle maria and rowley sir peter what my old friend sir oliver what is the matter  in the name of wonder were there ever two such ungracious nephews to assault their uncle at his first visit   l teazle on my word sir it was well we came to your rescue   joseph charles   charles joseph   joseph now our ruin is complete   charles very   sir peter you find sir oliver your necessitous character of old stanley could not protect you   sir oliver no nor premium neither the necessities of the former could not extract a shilling from that benevolent gentleman there and with the other i stood a worse chance than my ancestors and had like to have been knocked down without being bid for sir peter my friend and rowley look upon that elder nephew of mine you both know what i have done for him and how gladly i would have looked upon half my fortune as held only in trust for him judge then of my surprise and disappointment at finding him destitute of truth charity and gratitude   sir peter sir oliver i should be as much surprised as you if i did not already know him to be artful selfish and hypocritical   l teazle and if he pleads not guilty to all this let him call upon me to finish his character   sir peter then i believe we need not add more for if he knows himself it will be a sufficient punishment for him that he is known by the world   charles if they talk this way to honesty what will they say to me by and by  aside sir oliver as for that profligate there  pointing to charles   charles ay now comes my turn the damned family pictures will ruin me  aside joseph sir oliver will you honor me with a hearing   charles now if joseph would make one of his long speeches i should have time to recollect myself  aside sir peter i suppose you would undertake to justify yourself entirely   joseph i trust i could sir   sir oliver pshaw  turns away from him and i suppose you could justify yourself too  to charles charles not that i know of sir   sir oliver what my little premium was let too much into the secret   charles why yes sir but they were family secrets and should go no further   rowley come come sir oliver i am sure you cannot look upon charless follies with anger   sir oliver no nor with gravity neither  do you know sir peter the young rogue has been selling me his ancestors i have bought judges and staff officers by the foot and maiden aunts as cheap as old china  during this speech charles laughs behind his hat   charles why that i have made free with the family canvas is true my ancestors may rise in judgment against me there is no denying it but believe me when i tell you and upon my soul i would not say it if it was not so if i dont appear mortified at the exposure of my follies it is because i feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction at seeing you my liberal benefactor  embraces him   sir oliver charles i forgive you give me your hand again the little illlooking fellow over the settee has made your peace for you   charles then sir my gratitude to the original is still increased   l teazle sir oliver here is another with whom i dare say charles is no less anxious to be reconciled   sir oliver i have heard of that attachment before and with the ladys leave  if i construe right that blush    sir peter well child speak for yourself   maria i have little more to say than that i wish him happy and for any influence i might once have had over his affections i most willingly resign them to one who has a better claim to them   sir peter hey what is the matter now while he was a rake and a profligate you would hear of nobody else and now that he is likely to reform you will not have him what is the meaning of all this   maria his own heart and lady sneerwell can best inform you   charles lady sneerwell   joseph i am very sorry brother i am obliged to speak to this point but justice demands it from me and lady sneerwells wrongs can no longer be concealed   enter lady sneerwell sir peter another french milliner  i believe he has one in every room in the house   l sneerwell ungrateful charles well you may seem confounded and surprised at the indelicate situation to which your perfidy has reduced me   charles pray uncle is this another of your plots for as i live this is the first i ever heard of it   joseph there is but one witness i believe necessary to the business   sir peter and that witness is mr snake  you were perfectly in the right in bringing him with you    rowley desire mr snake to walk in  it is rather unlucky madam that he should be brought to confront and not support your ladyship   enter snake l sneerwell i am surprised what speak villain have you too conspired against me   snake i beg your ladyship ten thousand pardons i must own you paid me very liberally for the lying questions but i have unfortunately been offered double for speaking the truth   sir peter plot and counterplot  i give your ladyship much joy of your negotiation   l sneerwell may the torments of despair and disappointment light upon you all  going   l teazle hold lady sneerwell before you go give me leave to return you thanks or the trouble you and this gentleman took in writing letters in my name to charles and answering them yourself  and at the same time i must beg you will present my compliments to the scandalous college of which you are president and inform them that lady teazle licentiate returns the diploma they granted her as she leaves off practice and kills characters no longer   l sneerwell you too madam provoking insolent may your husband live these fifty years   exit l teazle oh lord  what a malicious creature it is   sir peter not for her last wish i hope   l teazle oh no no no   sir peter well sir  what have you to say for yourself  to joseph   joseph sir i am so confounded that lady sneerwell should impose upon us all by suborning mr snake that i know not what to say  but  lest her malice should prompt her to injure my brother  i had better follow her   exit sir peter moral to the last   sir oliver marry her joseph marry her if you can  oil and vinegar  you will do very well together   rowley mr snake i believe we have no further occasion for you   sir peter well  averse to sentiments as i am yet i cannot help observing that when a knave succeeds in his designs upon credulity he can boast of nothing more than having been a while mistaken for an honest man but it would be better for the continuance and completion of his happiness were he to become for life and in reality what he has only seemed to be   finis
