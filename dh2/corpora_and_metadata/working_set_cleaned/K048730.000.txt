gideon or the patriot an epic poem  gideon or the patriot an epic poem in twelve books upon a hebrew plan in honor of the two chief virtues of a people intrepidity in foreign war and spirit of domestic liberty  with miscellaneous notes and large reflections upon different subjects critical historical political geographic military and commercial  london printed for a millar opposite katharinestreet in the strand mdccxlix  introduction to the reader the author of this poem had begun one on the subject many years ago but doubting whether in the plan he was proceeding on he had enough expressed the sense of one who had the blessing to be born and educated in a land of liberty he had discretion to stop short and has postpond its publication for above three times the space prescribed by horace for impartial reexamination of a poets first conceptions  he now finds from the result of this deliberation that though his general purpose then was right as but preferring the monarchic to the popular forms of government yet had he at that time gone through his work he was in danger to have erred in one particular point of most essential consequence restraining monarchy to its too simple species  where it verges to and looks like tyranny  early prejudices are imbibed too deeply to be rooted out at once experience and reflection have since taught him to conjoin ideas which before seemed inconsistent and to know and own as he now does that monarchy is there most nobly constituted where crowns invest their wearers with the most extensive power to guard the public liberty without inducement to expect increase of happiness or glory from attempts to violate it  there is that difference and no other between the first and present purpose of the poem  the fabric is the same as formerly but it has firmer ground for its foundation  the hebrew system is and must be monarchy but it is such a monarchy as god may be supposed without affront to his best attributes to have established at the head of a free people whom he would not by a waste of useless miracles have brought up out of slavery to an egyptian tyrant to have left em slaves again in a worse country under tyrants of their own fraternity  the plan as it now stands is strictly consonant to this idea and so little difference could arise from the mistaken species where the genus was monarchical that almost every thing in the poetic view retains its place as in its first production with exception only to that nobler taste of freedom which the writer owed to a disinterested silent and sincere attachment never confessed till now to the unconscious object of it here first and much too late his touched heart called upon him to record the obligation  it has been thought advisable to publish only three books at a time and with the first the notes belonging to it partly by way of specimen but chiefly because relative to the design and general constitution of the epic species  the notes to all the books will last be published by themselves and may be bound distinct from the poetic part or be annexed to each book relatively making so two volumes at election of the reader who may also in this method choose to take or leave the notes at his own pleasure  the remaining three parts of the poem will be published in like manner as this first and at the shortest distances which can consist with care in the revisal and correction of so large a work and where variety of subjects claim the closest application of a writer not insensible with what a reverence men should appear before the public eye who dare aspire to being held in view beyond the dimness of a present prospect  he presumes to call his present prospect but a dim one without arrogance or satire being equally remote from dreaming too sublimely or too despicably of the age and nation he was doomed to take his fate in  he but too well knows em not the best disposed in any kind for giving fame to epic poetry yet must protest against so far misjudging his cotemporaries as to suspect it possible that many should not now be living as completely qualified as in whatever other time or country to know how far a poet has deserved their notice and refuse it only where it ought not to be granted  for the rest he casts his hopes upon futurity and having but a short reserve of personal claim to time transfers his expectation of survival to this child of leisure his poetic representative  he has nothing further here to add concerning it the notes being very circumstantial and explanatory only that the work which is of epic or heroic species had for object the chief virtues of a people intrepidity in foreign war  and spirit of domestic liberty  as for the notes they are not merely of poetical or critical intention but consist occasionally of enlarged discourses upon different subjects drawn from old and modern history to elucidate and give examples to political deductions which arise from incidents remarked upon they are also military geographic and commercial and include variety of other subjects as the reader will discover in their progress  among these reflections it may possibly give satisfaction to the learned and reverend body of our clergy in particular to see the following three points touched in the new lights here given them   st that the fine theocracy of the mosaic institution was destroyed in its progression but by natural consequence of one political defect that has not been enough adverted to by writers on that subject the military care disjoined from the imperial   dly that the hebrew form of government was never as it has by mr harrington and almost generally been supposed a popular republic but a plain hereditary monarchy the sovereign power whereof was vested in the highpriests person  and  dly that with exception only to this last peculiar circumstance there arise great probabilities toward finding in the first established hebrew model the original of all the manly celtic forms and in particular of that which constitutes the present system in great britain  not relaxing from its known sound principles  thus much seemed needful to premise what rests will follow with the notes conjunctively those on the first book being published previously because explanatory of the general purpose  gideon or the patriot book i i glowing pure

then gideon wise and generous leader rose and taught faint israel by his strange success that loss of freedom from corruption flows and virtues sense restored repels distress greatly determined and sublimely brave from a low fortune and a race obscure he who well the difference knew twixt being base and being poor dared noblest hopes with humblest means pursue showed the just prefrence of a balanced power where prince and senate pause over weighed debate to those blown clouds which over dominion lowre where headless hands disjointly rash perplex a struggling state when sons of faction born to miscompose dared proudly wanton bid rebellion reign unversd in rule while over their friends they rose to fall disgraceful at the feet of foes him did the god of nobler hopes ordain he when

first and surest foe thick as the locusts in some living wind a tide of death over all the land they flow force and famine with them go pangless they stain their front with blood and blot their rear with woe by god forsaken gods proud people fly valiant no longer than obedient found hopeless to live and yet afraid to die in caves and dark retreats they dwell on high thence prone look trembling with pale horror round while from the exposed inferior ground their heavy harvests load the plundring foe and for support of those they curse their grapes and olives grow dejected now their joshua they forget nor longer warlike others lands invade anxious now their own they quit poorly from reachless rocks to borrow aid and hid in safetys eyeless dusk their boasted glory shade viii westward from reverend jordans silvry stream where half the manasaean tribe their measured portion found ophra salutes the mornings opening beam from the east brow of an extended round of highraisd rugged and imperial ground within thextensive circle copious plain and safestretchd pastures highinclosd remain impregnably secure beneath thexterior mound far to the north below was jezreels valley spread jezreel by mighty victories renowned twas on this mountains broad and fertile head joash the destined heros father dwelt joash whom homeraisd harvests nobly fed who old in ease no blast of care had felt crowned with unenvied plenty and respect he held a power by no proud faction checked and sole and natural monarch of the place reigned in paternal majesty over all his happy race hard by his house a reverend oak there grew which there had flourished many a centry past long before israel god or moses knew or from egypts chain withdrew this tree a shade over half the mountain cast stretched on a bench beneath thexpansive gloom gideon whose struggling anguish longed for vent lay at the earliest dawn of doubtful light a far discerner unexposd to sight on mighty ends in contemplation bent ix the morning rising over israels spoils glowed with a burning blush to see her shame the wakeful bees began their searchful toils and hummd from flower to flower with tasteful aim high to the brightning skies the soaring lark rose warbling welcome to the opening day below with humbler melody hopping from bush to bush from tree to tree a thousand birds in mirthful concert play slow from the plain the melting dew to kiss the sunbeams climbing rose and bore sweet odours upward as it flew to guide their balmy influence from the foes still some fresh zephyr fanned the fragrant vale and still a thousand mingled sweets rose with the spicy gale along the mountains steep but blooming side the creeping vine and scentful myrtle spread over the rocks margin high with frightful pride the overhanging palm the winds defied and raised in dangerous state its branchy head at the hills foot with hoarse and murmuring sound a winding rivlet rolled its pebbly way and lingering through thenamelld vale delighting there to stray late it is loud passage into jordan found far on either side the brook a ripening harvest bent her golden head bowed to invite the expected reapinghook and waving wanton over its airy bed sadly at distance pleased their sight whose taste it should have fed x all this fair prospect with commanding eye the thoughtafflicted gideon saw from high happy enough had this been all his view but oh he saw the camp of midian too proudly spread in warlike awe deaths whole collected pomp at once he saw a mingled horror glittered from below tents green white sanguine azure distant seen varied the landschape with a threatening show whence gleamy swords and lances glowed between and filled with terrible delight the sightalarming scene here and there highmettled steeds bound loose in wanton exercise and neigh along the meads in other parts the scytharmd chariots driven wheel round each other with elusive skill formful of future schemes to kill swift every way they wind at signals given and open wide and close again at will their brazen wheels with din the valley fill and shoot their clattring echoes up the hill then all at once with yet more thundering noise the tortured drums and sprightly trumpets joined proudly proclaim the waking conqurors joys and swell their savage triumph up the wind xi light from his bench enraged young gideon leapt by doubt and shame and grief and anger pressed god who till now he cried his promise kept leaves us abandoned most when most distressed why thou immortal leader of our race why were thy blessings heaped upon this land the milk and honey of thy promised grace flowed evrywhere throughout each charmful space but oh they flowed to our destroyers hand and must it be and can no help be found said i no help  dishonest sound there can there must there shall  this galling yoke which haughty midian will not ease may  when god and israel please from off our necks at one determined stroke be shook in fury or by strength be broke but who alas what hand shall guide the blow heartless our tribes indulge their patient woe half with treachry aid the foe and false to heaven and us the nvader own the other half who hold their country dear doubting gods help because it is slowly shown wish well for conscience and submit for fear now were some single power a general bliss what wanted israel when possessed of this the kings about us with uncurbd command timely directing save their land we too once prosperd in a monarchs hand now misaspiring to be loosely great disjunctive freedom but enslaves our state in governments where all would rule  and none by choice obey not soon indeed the selfdisturbing storm yields to subside beneath a tyrant sway but power so parcelld melts in broils away and noisy contest weakning awe must general strength betray is there a man throughout all israels names who dares not hand to hand assault a foe singly all are free and brave together but one coward and one slave since allexcentric each the rest disclaims why look we wide thapparent cause to know we to defective rule our misries owe led by a lion sheep like lions dare and lions led by sheep like sheep despair he spoke and with a swift and manly stride approached the mountains steepy side sternly on midian downward bent his eyes glowed as he gazing felt new passions rise and rolled em sparkling to the upbraided skies high beat his warm and wishdisorderd heart and his hot bosom tingled with the smart xii while thus in busy silence fixed he gazed thunfolding heavens with streamy brightness blazed panting his tongueless terror would have spoke  but as he viewed theffulgent chasm amazed close at his ear a bursting thunder broke and a voice reached him from thabandond oak he turned and in his lateleft station saw calmly reclined a youth divinely fair sitting like some familiar friend some partner of his care pensive he leaned his head on his left hand his smiling eye shed sweetness mixed with awe his right hand with a milkwhite wand some figure seemed to draw a nameless grace was scattered through his air and over his shoulders loosely flowed his ambercolourd hair as gideon wondering towered the stranger drew the immortal visitor approached him too hail happy youth he cried  gods chosen hail thou light of israel her commissioned guide soon shall thy sword over yon gay power prevail hope boldly  god will war on gideons side xiii whoever thou art the hero sad replied who know so well the unhappy gideons name would thou could tell since god is on my side how comes it he permits my countrys shame where is the saving rod of moses now where the lost force of joshuas warlike hand where the flashed flame from nighthid sinais brow oh for that foepreventing cloud by day or by night that fiery ray which led our fathers to this happy land what need of all this waste of wonders done if here scarce seated we must fall at last why out of pharaohs grasp was israel won why the red sea miraculously past sure since our lots for ruin cast more nobly wretched twould appear to be in egypt slaves than here why now forsaking was he pleased to choose why call us his at first never to have been blessed were lightlier cursed hopes from false prospect cruelly amuse better never know a bliss than known to lose as for myself fain would i credit all long have i dared revolve proud midians fall but void of means to suit the ambitious aim the curb of fortune keeps my courage tame of all our tribe the poorest race is mine and of that poorest race the meanest i be it supposed i should incline wars dreadful weight to try where is my power my interest my fame will israels haughty tribes be led by one without a name xiv the angel interrupting here thus awfully replied israel bold hebrew has her god defied since from affronted heaven the ungrateful race hope lost assistance and would still prevail why have they broke gods laws renounced his grace and poorly bowed to ashtaroth and baal were these the gods who from the egyptian land freed your lost fathers with unhopd success twixt wavebuilt walls conducted em to idumaeas strand safe steered you through the pathless wilderness gave awful power to the mosaic wand all proud attempts from hostile earth to check and govern heaven by its commissioned beck with liquid rock to stream a springless land call mannad harvests from the unfruitful sand and save and bless you with a mighty hand since stubborn for an empty idols sake your articles with heaven you dared to break what vain presumption bids you judge it fit who slight the bond should reap the benefit butthou would say repentance dawns at last that sadly conscious of their error past groaning in anguish of their souls their eyes to heaven they cast how small thatonement and how great the sin yet it suffices that they late begin to quit the ungrateful paths they have wandered in unutterably gracious god disdains to feel a pleasure in his creatures pains men who slight heaven but their own bliss forsake i the great pardners minister am sent to arm thee gideon for thy brave intent boldly resolve and safely undertake hail heavens illustrious instrument thine be the ends on which thy thoughts were bent xv gideon sighed sad and graceful bowed his head heedful to question ere he yet believed so strange a message though from heaven received the deepdiscerning nuncio plainly read each scruple in his arguing fancy bred let me said he from yon forsaken seat share that small store thy grief neglects to eat gideon with joyful diligence obeyed and humbly at his feet the napkin spread and in neat order hospitably laid his little treat of wine and flesh and bread yet doubtful and amazed at what he did my lord said he who heavens high will reveals stoops not i fear to taste of mortal meals the food of angels is not flesh of kid xvi be taught replied the unbodyd guest from this consent to know men to heavens mystries faith implicit owe let the command suffice nor reasons eye with dangerous keenness seek the darkened why where god has said i will have it so all curious inquisition must be spared and nothing sought beyond what stands declared be not in human ignorance too scrupulously wise but mindful that obedient faith is mans best sacrifice he said and gently stretching out his hand touched the spread napkin with his snowy wand as from hot furnaces the vapry stream mounts thick and widens its evolving steam so when the angel his reproof had spoke at the watched summons of the wands soft stroke a springy flame from the dry surface broke and covered and consumed thuntasted store lovely the fire rose whirling mixed with smoke folding in glorious volumes over and over and upward on a curling cloud the mounted angel bore gideon looked after him and would have spoke while ravished with the fierce delight he saw him gently soar till forced to give the thoutlengthning prospect over his eyes in watery brightness wept for bliss they found no more xvii musing a while and dumb with deep suspense thus loud at last his wonder broke its way immortal god whose glorys high defense thy own almighty hand can best display thy hand beneath whose angry touch whole worlds would melt away can it be possible to one like me without desert of no degree it should be left to draw the sword for thee but dark and wondrous ever were thy ways all different means grow equal in thy hand and all things possible where man obeys his makers high command why weigh i thus decrees i must fulfill twas holy flame i find that did inspire my souls ungovernable fire and that was working providence which seemed but wild desire hence then with apprehensions and delays hence with all doubted want of human skill god if he meant me for his praise will mould me to his will xviii while he yet spoke from ophras neighboring walls a winding horn in short and sudden calls invades his ear with high and hoarse alarms and from the town a mingled tumult swarms of every rank all ages weak and strong flowing in tides of uproar thick along confusedly armed and more confusedly led they seemed with eager threatnings to pursue a party which along the mountains side in more disorder fled gideon in haste to his near house withdrew there with a spear his warlike hand supplied and joined thegressive crowd and followed too xix this was a party that from midians camp had in the covering dusk of night been sent to climb the mountain silent and unspyd and close concealed till dawn with dire intent twixt the craggs bushy clefts their cohort hide till at the opening portal rushing in surprise might force what siege would slowly win but joash early rising every day took pleasure to behold the morning break to watch the first faint shoots of twilight play and nights dissolving shades melt soft away he while his fragrant walk he meant to take round the known borders of his welltilld farm undreaming danger as unmeaning harm down the hills brow discerned the points of spears suspiciously in sloping covert bent and saw the sheltry bushes shake along the green descent his taught experience caught prophetic fears swift to the town conveyed this strong alarm and roused thunwary multitude to arm xx prevented the discovered ambush rose and fast retreated down the craggy hill gideon whose breast predestind honors fill doubly inspired in presence of his foes winged his swift feet with heavens remembered will and now nighreaching gained upon em still oreb a midian prince of warlike fame who led this party on their close design saw their retreat with mingled rage and shame and labored earnestly and long to stop their headlong flight but neither prayers nor blows could now incline his scattering files to bear the hebrews sight moved therefore by a brave and princely mind he let the rushing numbers pass him by then following marched securely slow behind often facing with a fierce and flameful eye himself an army while his people fly he when he found his rear too closely pressed turned sudden in a steep and winding way where scarce two meeting friends could pass abreast such threddy concave here deepnarrowing lay and jutting rocks and frightful steeps hung horrid over the rest since like a timorous herd said he yon cowards haste away nor blush in arms their sovereign to betray let em enjoy their safety as they may it is now their shame who dare their charge reject twere mine should i the negligent neglect it is a kings glorious business to protect xxi he said and over an angle of the path observed a tottering cliff which loosely hung broke by longdrenching rains and wintry wrath acutely pendent twixt two rocks raised ends ponderous it seems to arch the road and a roofd shadow lends high to one pointed prop the prince ascends long to the vast unweildy weight with struggling labor clung and down at last across the path the loady barrier flung gideon who just approached it as it fell strides back amazed and scarce believes his sight whoever thou art he cried thou timst it well and sure to do thy envied courage right he who so bravely flies would nobly fight xxii scarce had he spoke when with a threatening spear down on the bulwark rock prince oreb leapt hebrew he cried thou art not safe so near retire this pass will be too strongly kept speaking aloft he shook his deatharmd lance and to the shouting thousands turned his shield the slowdescending foes now scarce advance but from thoercrowded steep in spiral line awed and astonished at the fierce design stand gazing at the wonder they beheld dreadfully bright his gilded armor shone over his left thigh a crooked sword declined a feathry plume high from his helmet rose and loosely gay waved warlike in the wind crimson with sable mixed halfshaded flows severely charming to his distant foes of all the press gideon alone comes on the rest in safe defiance threat behind ignobly hurl their javlins down in vain which clattring on his shield rebound and tremble back again xxiii gideon awhile revolved the unequal war and blushed to see it basely waged from far then raised his arm in sign that he alone would make the general hazard all his own hushed was the storm and oreb smiling saw one threatening hebrew near him draw yet cautious to prevent too bold advance aimful he poised and hurled his beamy lance timely thapproacher bowed his watchful head and harmless let the pointed tempest fly but his reached station felt thinvader nigh deep in the cliffy path it entrance found and echoing its design with thundering sound jarrd upward as it stood erect and quiverd in the ground gideon sprung near and from beneath the rock rising at hand directs a speary blow the ringing target yielded to the shock and the broadentring steel broke thundering through half his bright sword the dreadful oreb drew when fortune  blind invertress of event thus checked the impatient speed his ardour lent gideon strongly from below dragged hard to disengage the entangled spear which while prince orebs shield retentive bound lightly thassaulter leaping from the ground helped by the staffs resistance firmly grasped reached the gained rock surpised the foe and his armed body clasped to heaven a thundering shout the hebrews raised struck and astonished and transported gazed far flies thincumberd shield wide hurled away laboring each strives the others weight to lift now curvy grapplings every bend assay now with a springy force in starts of rage from sinewy curb their joints they disengage soon closed again with stormy grasp they meet arms fettring arms and feet perplexing feet elusive long with new and wily drifts from side to side the evasive whirlwind shifts they heave they drag they twist bend lift and strain and tire each practiced nerve yet toil in vain fiercely at length provoked at arts delay born for plain conquest and the glare of day strengths utmost effort in one proof to make with feet firm fixed and stretchdout arms the rocks loose clefts they shake sudden they feel their props false fabric break timeworn the flaky pediments pressed slate splitting beneath the human tempests weight rolled one huge fragment down while one vast flake backward reclining now scarce choked the straight distant compelled thunclosing warriors fall and the freed path unbars her track to all xxiv gideon awhile long stunned above  oreb who downward fell rolled sevn steep paces ere his feet he gained but swift recovring with indignant swell looked back and saw surpised that this dire chance bursting the pass he had so long maintained had left it open to his foes advance then hopeful hard pursuit would now prove vain should the persisters press his flying train swift as a tiger bounds he leaps away light and regardless where best passage lay till near behind him came thoertaking shout then paused he calm looked heedfully about marked in the mountains side a dusky cave and enters there with slow suspense his future hope to save xxv as rapid currents choked by floatmixd mud checked for a moment smooth their troubled flood then sluicing on to clear the obstructed way with tenfold force renew their sweepy sway so when the hebrews saw the passage free in headlong catract down the steep they gushed and in rude flow fast by the cavern rushed nor dreamt that oreb could so near em be to the hills outmost verge at last they came where a broad terras formed by nature spread and round the mountain reared a pensile plain hither by vain pursuit the hebrews led beheld thescaping foe the valley gain and safely there in rallying line make head thence at more distance cross the forded stream squadrons from midians camp detached they viewed whose sunstruck weapons flashed a threatening gleam then gideon found it prudent to retreat and timely wise reclimbd the steep ascent but marching slowly with attentive feet examined every cavern as he went from that in which prince oreb lay sudden an entering file with eyes cast backward trembling outward flew close at their heels came dreadful oreb too by nature always eager to pursue but soon as gideon he beheld and knew he sheathed his sword and with a graceful smile now first said he this sword in vain i drew but forced to yield it is best i yield to you the generous hebrew bowing mild replied fortune not always favors the most brave had partial victory still sustained your side she would have robbed me of wished power to save and you had wronged a hebrew heart untried xxvi while they were speaking and the shouldring crowd morosely insolent and rudely loud was climbing round all gaping for a view as if the conquest claimed the insult too a second chance diverts the impatient throng for some who newly searched the cavern round noiseful returned and with em dragged along ten weeping slaves whom there concealed they found poor fugitives of ancient canaans race once happy owners of that promised land where forced to give thinvading hebrews place they now lived subject to their harsh command severely used and tired with length of woe the newfound ten had from their masters run drawn by the nearness of the general foe to meditate escape and slavery shun they might perhaps with midian joined be free worse than they were they knew they could not be and there is a kind of mournful ease in change of misery xxvii when to the town the noisy press returned with shouts their triumph to express shouts the voice of proud success the assembled elders over the city gate sat wisely busied in serene debate on questions which concerned the good of ophras little state sevn was their number and they chose to sit in a bowed crescents form whose points were filled by two of levis sacred sons  best skilled to judge of laws in reverend mystery writ sage in the center hoary joash sat renowned for virtue and revered for age the assisting four were men of years and skill famed themselves for shunning ill and therefore thought best qualified to govern others will to these the crowd their ten deserters bring and tell where found and on what errand bent to these they also show the captive king but loud in every listening ear they gideons praises ring paint how he dared act over thadmird event and mock prince orebs brave resolve to stop their fierce descent xxviii slow rose eliakim the towns high priest the ruling levite and the senates tongue a man who dared in zeal to heaven bewail religion lost and hebrew fame decreased he well remembered while he yet was young how god enabled israel to prevail and sighed to see the ungrateful people fail nor ever bowed the knee himself to ashtaroth or baal blessed be our fathers god said he this day to whom all owing we would nothing pay gideon methinks i feel thy fathers joy o may thy blooming glory never fade no envy sure will budding virtue shade soon does thy countrys love thy sword employ the prince thy captive by the right of war dispose of at thy safe discretions choice and since all ophras sons thy debtors are accept our thanks as from the general voice dare on fight prosper heaven shall bless thy aim this but the dawning of thy destined fame for you  and then he turned to canaans trembling sons known custom points us to your mournful lot since every slave who from his master runs dies  guilty of an added crime or not he spoke and bending toward the bordring seats asked if their judgment full concurrence lent and then distinctly his decree repeats and all the elders rose at once to testify consent xxix gideon whose fearless heart was formed to feel sharer in every woe he could not heal sighed pitying the poor slaves prevented flight and bowing graceful spoke in sorrows right who reverend fathers after this will pause in honors chase the prize so glorious and so short the race too much you pay me for too little won if but to act our duty claims such praise for what alas has gideon further done we live i fear in unperforming days but your too kind applause perhaps would raise a future worth by previous praise if wisely generous you incline to make that grateful lesson mine consenting will holds modest purpose dumb and humbly takes your present thanks for actions yet to come one cause mean while not mine i fain would plead i cannot wish to see the wretched bleed who knows what hardships in their friendless state had galled their patient hearts ere yet they fled but grant them guilty  law mistakes their fate death in the happy may create some dread but the cold grave is misrys restful bed there are oppressions of such monstrous weight that twere the happiest freedom to be dead such if their wrongs we lose our stern intent and give em ease from pain  for punishment judge not i pray you that i mispresume or pride myself to think you favors owe if loving mercy i deplore their doom bring home an alien danger then appeal make the case yours and sentence as you feel israel herself was once a slave grant heaven if ever she again be so she finds a moses or a god  to save if then our fathers found it hard the yoke to undergo and having once been unoppressd and free thought it

wandering wide he reached the grove of baal westward upon the mountains edge it stood where shaped by art a huge round hill in terrassd stages rose whose farseen pyramid five plains compose and every stage was a small separate wood the lowermost planted thick with baleful eugh could with brown horror quench the glare of noon but now from night a deeper dusk it drew the funeral cypress the next stage overspread the third which narrowing upward wanted room for trees of copious and untonsile head from deeptingd laurel caught umbrageous gloom round the fourth platform climbing ivy crept and

begins to groan the leafy limbs in general horror shake bending the forestgiant breaks and is at once overthrown down rolls the tumbling monster over the rocks and sweeps the grove before it with its sway from cliff to cliff rebounds with frightful shocks and gores the groaning mountain in its way broad over the plain below it loads the shadowed ground and grazing herds with stiffend ear start trembling from the sound notes and miscellaneous reflections on the first book before the reader enters on the notes in referential order he will probably forgive a short remark or two upon the nature of this kind of poem the age we live in so profusely overflowing in the practice without stopping to consider judgment that to common apprehensions poetry gives no idea but of words with musical cadences that is to say plain sense in rhyme and measure  it may seem surprising that pretenders to this faculty few of us having been thought guilty of too little sensibility should rest contented under the injustice of so mortifying a contraction  a poet when considered in this narrow light were so contemptible a creature that he must give place to a good piper who unquestionably has power of raising sounds much more melodious than adjusters of mere words are capable of equalling  the truth is numbers in their softest and most pleasing fluency make up but one part of the means mistaken for the end they were designed but as a vehicle that should insinuate the instructive bitter hid behind the promise of delight the music having gained the ear the matter thence found entrance to the heart and there prevailed against distempers which but for the fine disguise it came concealed in it had never reached with such advantage there being a reluctance in our nature apt to rise against a plain reproof as in our taste against such physic as is offered us too coarsely  all as far as this was well the worst was that this sweetness in the art exposed it by degrees to profanation by the ignorant prompt adventurers were so glad to find the pleasant the most easy that this handmaid of supplanted poetry like the treacherous mayors of the palace in france sat her down in and possessed the throne she was designed but as a servant to  the learned will favor me with their indulgence while i note for satisfaction of some readers of the sex that will be always surest to hold interest in a poets purposes that epic poems are so called from a greek term for speaking because here the verse runs narratively as stage poems on the contrary are called dramatic ones from the same tongue in reference to their being acted  but it will be still more necessary that some definition of this species should be also given by an attempter of it who has modesty and wishes to avoid a charge of high presumption critics having represented it in such a formidable light that they could possibly have done no more had they been joined in a confederacy to prevent attempts to write at all instead of furnishing instructions how to write discerningly  it will suffice to hear but one or two of these as witnesses the voice is all the same one note throughout the whole fraternity  it is says rapin the most bold and greatest work that human wit is capable of all the nobleness and all the elevation of the most perfect genius can hardly suffice to form one such as is requisite the difficulty of finding together fancy and judgment heat of imagination and sobriety of reason precipitation of spirit and solidity of mind causes the rarity of this characters happy temperament it requires great images and yet a greater wit to form them  finally there must be a judgment so solid a discernment so exquisite such perfect knowledge of the language in which he writes such obstinate study profound meditation and vast capacity that scarce whole ages can produce one genius fit for an epic poem and it is an enterprise so bold that it cannot fall into a wise mans thoughts but it must affright him  by this time it grows needful that i hasten to cry out and own that the most vain and empty wretch in nature would be such a poet as conceiving the tenth part of these prodigious difficulties in his way which the french critic had by overheating his imagination taught himself to think were really there should notwithstanding such belief have arrogance enough to undertake a work so terribly beyond his compass  under which necessary shield of honest truth i will dare venture yet a little farther  into what our own sir william temple has declared on the same subject  i am apt says he in his essay upon the art we are considering to believe so much of the genius of poetry and of its elevation in homers and virgils epic works that i know not whether of all the numbers of mankind who live within the compass of a thousand years for one man that is born capable of making such a poet there may not be a thousand born capable of making as great generals of armies or ministers of state as any the most renowned in story  caveats so highstrained as these have made it necessary for an epic undertaker to say something that may justify his modesty a definition of it therefore in the humbler light i see it by may hope to show it a less arduous adventure and demonstrate that the difficulty however certainly considerable is by no means so insuperable as these gentlemen appear to think it critical systems reconcile two contradictory extremes and are at once too vast and too restrictive the cause is they lean with a too partial biass toward a few great names to whose example they would chain down nature  many friends of fancy on the other side mistake for epic poems any story told in verse containing a wild series of romantic incidents related of some hero whom the piece takes name from but there are scarce two things in nature which more widely differ than these histories in verse from epic poetry  i wish i could have satisfied myself with bossus definition it had saved me the presumption of attempting one myself but his appearing to be neither full nor clear and having never seen a better i am forced on the necessity of hazarding a new one of my own which will i fear be still defective  i take an epic poem then to mean some noble lesson in morality delivered under color of one action which must be illustrious and important in itself and in its personages interest supernatural powers in its successes and be probably delightfully and surprisingly described in verse with ornamental episodic parts depending on and rising naturally out of the main tendency throughout all which the poet keeps no view before him but to strengthen by example that one moral lesson he proposes to imprint upon his readers admiration  to explain this definition by enlarging its particulars  a man who undertakes an epic poem is not to write a history but to propagate a moral homer for example had conceived such purpose  it was not his design to write the fall of troy that story was already known and could have brought no novelty but in the pleasure of the verses  pleasure was not his chief end he aimed to give advice his prospect was to teach the greeks split into little independent states that union could recover victory when discord had transferred it to an enemy the grecians triumph over troy was then discoursed of with much vanity through all their inconfederate divisions homer observed this sense of general glory and derived a story from it that would best enforce the moral he prepared to teach em borrowing names and incidents from that remembered and highboasted war but giving em a new and proper turn for the conveyance of his moral only  had homer not been born till alexander had made greece one monarchy the moral he would then have chosen had been the prosperous effect of power in one wise and brave mans hand and what sure benefits accrue from subjects loyalty as we see virgil living in a time when the republic of the romans had given place to monarchy made it the purpose of his poem to reconcile his countrymen to single sovereignty in the person of augustus under fiction of a prince brave wise and pious who being guided by the favoring gods established on the ruins of the old a new foundation for dominion of so much more potency that the whole empire of the world was by decree of heaven to be included in it  from that new empire then possessed by those he writ to all his readers had derived their glory so that it was easy to induce them to confide in and to look for the same blessings from their change of government which their great ancestors had gained by change of country  to impress the moral forcibly some action is to be related pointing out an instance in as strong a light as possible where this insinuated moral was proved good by an example  the action must be suitable that is of dignity adapted to the greatness of events wrought into it as steps toward the result last purposed it must be single that is unmixed with other actions of detached or independent tendency there may be incidents producing incidents the more variety the better but they must be such as serve but to bring forward and illustrate the one final action which intends example from the work neither is this restriction any nicety deduced from the particular opinion of this critic or of that it is a natural necessity and a law of reason because actions not producing one another as effects from causes raise unpointed and confused reflections and divert and weaken an attention which it is the business of this poem to bind down to one strong object an epic poet of the ariostine model is a traveller who if his road lay strait through crete would take the labyrinth in his journey  the action may be feigned or real if no story famed in history can be directly levelled to the poets purpose he may then invent one to his liking for the truth here necessary consists not in the reality of the events but in the natural veracity existing in the moral  it must be illustrious and important and the persons animating it great princes or distinguished leaders because every man submits to shrink at consciousness of dangers or misfortunes which he sees have power to punish error in these rulers of the world the weakness of our pride that looking down upon conceives itself secure in its superior situation from all abject misery not daring to exempt itself from menaces it must look up to but admitting in this case the apprehension of its own exposure  it must interest supernatural powers in its successes the influence of wellinvented circumstances of this kind carrying terror with it that excites a reverence and induces warmth from enthusiastic awefulness into the subject consonant to those impressions we are educated to religious sense of and which favor disposition to derive all good propensities from heaven and throw off upon the devil all instigations which propel to bad ones  it must be probably delightfully and surprisingly described in verse  probably because whatever we suppose impossible we find unworthy our attention delightfully because variety of wellmarkd characters surprising incidents smoothflowing numbers strength of imagery exalted thoughts and beautiful expression keep awake our expectation stimulate the fancy and detain us to the authors purpose  and surprisingly is added separately though a connected consequence and unavoidable result from such a wellmaintaind succession of unlooked for and still varying beauties  episodes are necessary members of extended action which without them would appear too short and general but all these episodic members must be limbs not wens they must unite with such connection that displacing any one will make the rest imperfect and that adding any would disgrace the symmetry  in general the note most capable of heightning our regard to and elucidating the asserted force of epic poetry is from a recollection that it comes down recommended to us by a choice and practice that to reason joins the best authority  and without a parable spoke he not to them being asked by his disciples why speak thou to them in parables his answer is because to you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given that is the obstinacy of these peoples minds misled by habitudes of evil makes it necessary that the doctrine i would teach them should be covered and approach attractively where else the pride that alienates their hearts would rise against conviction pressed too plainly and proposed without disguise as humble men like you are willing to receive it  it is probable the hebrews carried with em out of egypt this delightful way of teaching it is clear at least that they arrived to great perfection in it before greece grew civilized from rude barbarity so far is it from true that homer or some other poet of his country was inventer of the epic species all the books of the old testament abound with instances which prove the skill of hebrew poets and the six hundred thousand volumes in the ptolemaic library could hardly fail to have contained some of their poems of this kind in their due length and dignity  to show how little difference there is except in ornament and size between the epic poem as above defined and the short parables i have been speaking of i will select two only the first taken from the mouth of christ himself the other i will go so far more backward for as to the reign of david who was king of israel so soon after the trojan war that he must necessarily have lived before the time of homer to whom greece would partially ascribe the merit of poetically teaching moral truth by fable i shall give more instances than one of the unwarrantable presumption of those grecians vanity in arrogating to themselves a praise for arts they borrowed from the asiatic people and the hebrews in particular  the persecution of the prophets by the jewish priests was what christ purposed to reprove but knew their power was great and that the pride it had inspired em with would render a distasteful doctrine little fruit if not engagingly insinuated under this conviction the divine reprover thus addresses them there lived says he in a far country a powerful landowner who had planted vineyards raised enclosures and built habitable farms on a detached part of his territory he let out these to husbandmen and went himself to where his chief seat stood upon a very distant tract of his possessions  when the proper season came the lord sent servants to demand his rents grown due but those ungrateful tenants trusting to the distance for security from due revenge instead of payment murdered the demanders they destroyed in the same manner other servants sent with like commission at last resolved to try their boldness to the utmost his own son was sent to whom it was supposed they could not dare refuse their reverence but the tenants on the heirs appearance hoping by his death to make themselves a lasting title to the whole inheritance determined on that execrable deed and killed him also  the auditors inflamed to an impatient indignation interrupt the story in this part of it and cry out angrily  the lord should have destroyed those wicked wretches and let out his vineyard to honester husbandmen and there condemned by their own sentence and struck dumb by conscious shame they catch the application before christ proceeds to make it for as the text expresses it they considered his parable and perceived that he spoke of them  in the second instance nathan reproaches david who had robbed uriah of his wife and caused the husband to be murdered but the prophet understanding well the danger of the kings resentment casts about to take him by surprise and does it under this disguise of parable i am come says he to ask relief from royal justice in revenge of a poor sufferers distress against the cruelty of his oppressor two men lived together one rich the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one little ewelamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveller to the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him  what effect this little story presently produced the sequel tells us and david s anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord lives the man that has done this thing shall surely die because he had no pity and nathan said to david thou art the man he then proceeded safely and reproached him that he had tyrannically given way to an illegal impulse of desire forcing away the only wife of a most faithful subject notwithstanding the unlimited variety of women who were all his own had nathan spoke the truth thus plainly at its opening it had proved perhaps of dangerous consequence to his own life but the cloud of the invention shielded him and the kings passions having first been artfully secured in the reproachers interest the reproached who had confessed a generous sense of the dishonesty while not considered as his own became ashamed to disavow his virtue when the guilt laid claim to his confession so david said to nathan  i have sinned against the lord  it is impossible to produce a livelier or more pathetic proof both of the nature and the power of epic poetry for it is evident that these two parables differ in nothing but their want of names extent and paint of circumstance from the poems of that nomination  from their general nature i proceed to the particular consideration of this new attempt upon the plan of gideon  a poet in an age so factious as the last has been must have been blind not to discern the usefulness of recommending quiet to a stormy generation it were saying nothing to the purpose to object that we are now remote from israels case under no yoke of conquest and above all danger from a foreign enemy civil contest will be always the most likely means of calling in and aiding the attempts of such an enemy we have seen too recent proofs to doubt that certainty but not to dwell unnecessarily upon our present happy prospects our invaded ancestors too often felt the weight of such a situation as had made a gideon the most welcome public blessing  could they have found him and could all his miracles have served but to unite them in one wish and one endeavor far less lasting and less bloody had those various insults then been represented under the disgrace whereof our history blushes while it tells the triumphs of so many conquests over us  by romans saxons danes and normans  where therefore is the nation to be found that better ought to like than ours a strong example to so sound a moral as that though disunion should enslave a people joint attachment to the legal government could soon recover and protect lost liberty  to cloathe this moral in an action some such disunited people was to be made choice of suffering under foreign conquest from effect of their divisions and when every human hope had failed em raised at once from their despair by union of an inconsiderable number under a restorer of their laws and freedom  this being what the critics call the allegorical or general plan i never could have found a fitter action to illustrate it than the redemption of the hebrews under gideons conduct from the yoke of foreign conquest as imposed with infinite contempt and cruelty by a confederate body of arabian princes whom the sacred writ distinguishes by the joint name of midianites for the events of this great war are there so comprehensively related as to suit at once with the design they are selected for and leave sufficient scope for bold invention and embellishment in the particular deduction whereas the scripture history of david mr cowleys choice was a completed one as mr rymer has objected to it and is so circumstantially described as to restrain a poets fancy mr dryden for this reason could not have succeeded in that favorite design of his for forming a new epic poem from the story of our civil wars in the last century yet i remember he has somewhere told us that king charles the second whom he had acquainted with his purpose very much approved it notwithstanding which i take it to have been to the advantage of that great mans memory that his design was never executed the story was too recent to be treated as it ought and the sublimest beauties of invention would have lost their force on readers in whom sad and deep impressions from the misery of the real facts must needs have made all fiction seem too sportive and an unbecoming freedom taken with their solemn sorrow it was the very case of lucan and his subject barring out all aids of the poetic kind at least those warm ones which let loose imagination his pharsalia gained no rank but among histories and verse indeed is all the right of that great work to be considered as a poem  the mention here of mr rymer leads me to remember an objection which i think he has unjustly made to mr cowleys choice of subject merely as a foreign one as if it were a violation of that natural respect a poet owes his country to look out of it for a great character if mr rymer had no better reason for this censure than that since homer was a grecian and has writ of greeks and virgil being a roman writ of romans therefore mr cowley as an englishman should have approved no other than an english hero the argument appears to me to be a very narrow and meanspirited one  nature is nature everywhere and i should never look for any force of manly reasoning from a soul not large enough to comprehend mankind as one fraternity  however more is to be said in favor of a hebrew subject than of all or any of the rest whatever  the reverence we conceive from the old testament for those objects of gods more immediate care has made them every bodys countrymen besides the many miracles so terribly displayed among them are peculiar helps to a poetic fancy and adorn their history above that of any other nation their country was the scene too of our saviors life and sufferings a reflection which entitles it to veneration from all christians and to add one smaller circumstance that still gives strengthening to their claim they were inventers or at least improvers and great practisers of poetry the song of moses their first leader lists him early in the number  miriam deborah david solomon and innumerable other of their nation were fine poets and this ought methinks to recommend their memory to the respect of such who would be thought so after them  having said this the reader i believe will hardly be displeased to see a specimen of hebrew poetry we meet with many noble ones in the old testament but they have the misfortune to lie shadowed under obsolete translation  one of our critics has done justice to the noble images of these originals when he declares that there is nothing so soft so tender and pathetic and at the same time nothing so grand so majestic so terrible and so barmonious as the poetic part of the bible to which all the heathen verse is flat and low  i look upon the song of moses which josephus says was written in hexameter verse to have been a kind of lyric ode because it seems to have been sung to some stringmusic and to certain measured motions of the body this is plainly gathered from the text and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women followed her with timbrels and with dances  and when moses and the male singers had opened the ode miriam and the women answered as a chorus sing ye to the lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea  i leave out the first verse as conceiving it to have been but a general head and begin at the next following  song of thanksgiving by moses on the overthrow of pharaoh in the red sea from exodus chap xv the first part only i temples and altars let us raise ours and our fathers god provokes our praise god is our strength god is our theme where is egypts fallen esteem pharaoh wakes from his proud dream wakes to feel a warriors hand lord of a power more vast than his  that shakes his wondering land vainly the following foes our god defied their rapid wheels in vain tore up the strand in vain they mocked the waving wand not all their noise could the loud sea withstand the watery world flowed fearless over their pride a drowning army beat the involving tide on wavewashd chariots halfsustaind the trembling captains ride uplifted hoofs pawd loose the liquid way and round em blackning through the foam the floating legions lay down down the ungrounded footsteps go

while thy blast o base despair blew keen safety from heaven shot down between dreadful in wrath thy lifted arm but shone and all the unnumberd thousands melt away over stubbly fields so winddrivn fire

men and angels sound it will not be denied that here is the sublime among these images more glowing than in any greek or roman writer  when longinus seems to have been moved so strongly by that praised exaltedness of thought where moses to express gods power with energy describes creation not in its extended graduatory progress but as starting to existence at a word let there be light and there was light  i half suspect with the french critic he had heard of but not seen the hebrew bible he could never else have passed by the prodigious greatness in the paintings and conception of the ode foregoing and in many other tracts of scripture poetry would he have so profusely given his admiration to this passage out of homer at every step the immortal neptune took the mountains trembled and their forests shook and have said nothing upon that of david  hills felt their gods approach and veiled in night sunk through their trembling roots to scape his sight we may pity then the grecian vanity that would divide the honor of inventing poetry between their orpheus stesichorus alcman pindar and a number of their countrymen whereas in truth the oldest of all these who was orpheus was but a cotemporary with gideon in whose eleventh year he went a young man with the argonauts to colchos  now gideon was  00 years since moses and yet moses died not till the year of the world      fortyone years after writing the foregoing ode which must have been at his first landing in arabia after crossing the red sea in the worlds year       so that the hebrews had the practical perfection of the lyric species for at least  00 years before the birth of this assumer orpheus whom the greeks pretend to have been its original inventer  it is indeed the most unreasonable improbability that greece should have been skilled in so refined an art as poetry when she was little better than a savage so deficient in improvements of this ornamental quality that as st augustine has noted the more necessary use even of the grape was still unknown to the politest of those people the athenians till by dionysius in the time of moses and a greek poet wanting wine had missed a surer inspiration than his muses  ericthonius of athens was the first instructor of his countrymen to yoke their beasts for plowing and that not till joshuas days and it was then too that the use of letters was communicated to the greeks by cadmus from phoenicia a close borderer on the hebrews  before that time having no alphabet how could they make pretense to writing the same national vanity was manifest again in their asserting ida and dactylus who lived but after joshuas death during the government of othoniel to have discovered the first use of iron when it is plain from the old testament  genesis iv and    that tubal cain above a thousand years before had taught artificers the workmanship of iron and brass and nothing can be more demonstrable from the so oftenmentioned chariots weapons armor and vast magazines of warlike furniture of all kinds which we read of among kings of egypt and assyria than that the people of the east were exquisitely skilled in such mechanic knowledge at a time when greece had yet no name among the nations thucydides their own historian has confessed that in these early days wherein she would pretend to arrogate inventions never hers she was uncivilizd and wholly rude her lands uncultivated her towns few and mean and the employment of her heroes and high demigods to rove for robberies by sea and land steal horses and make bold with other peoples cattle without sense of shame or secrecy  but i forget the elegy which mr cowley justly calls a most poetical and excellent one  he purposed to have closed his davideis with it  it appears to me a masterpiece of the pathetic kind and i produce it as an instance that the hebrews were thus skilful in the simple species which the greeks too with their usual modesty put in for the invention of long after this fine piece had been composed by david  elegy by david for the death of saul and jonathan   kings chap i i o israel how does all thy beauty fade how are the mighty fallen the strong betrayed never may this

as i loved thee i have said enough i hope to justify my choice of foreign action and a hebrew one particularly  i come now to the new structure of my verse where i have used the liberty of varying everywhere the measure and of mixing in one poem all the different kinds that can be ranked among heroic  what i hoped from this extent of latitude was to derive increase of power as well as harmony but as this choice and application of such bold diversity of numbers will require and merit some defense i will begin it with a previous note or two in answer to a modern cry that has been raised against the use of rhyme in general  it has been attacked but since we learned to read and understand blank verse from mr miltons noble work which by the way lay half an age at lea unfelt unfriended and unnoticd in the country it now casts so bright a luster on the copy of it was with doubt and hesitation bought  for infamous ten pounds which not being made demandable but on condition of a new impression never was received at all its author having been in his neglected grave near thirty years before his matchless poem and then only by effect of one mans single penetration drew the least regard upon it from his countrymen to the eternal scandal be it noted of our highpresumd discernment and the miserable state of patronage among us  this was the hospitable welcome blank verse found in england and now so strangely can our currents turn our gentlemen of the new light are indisposed to see by any other they affect the reputation of a judgment too severe to be delighted by effect of sounds and would explode all consonance of termination as too trifling and effeminate for ears of understanding  what they have objected may i think be summed up in these few particulars rhyme was a goth and came in with the runic impoliteness rhyme is unnatural because it puts constraint upon expression rhyme is needless because blank verse has nobler harmony and gives complete delight without it  as to the first of these it is quite mistaken rhyme did not come in with those barbarities they charge it to and if it had done so what nobler parentage could it have been derived from than the same to which we owe our plans of liberty but in reality it had a far more ancient origin the hebrew poetry was writ with rhyme the persian and arabian so peculiarly depended on this ornament that they have a kind of poem in distinguished reverence among them and called cacideh derived from immemorial practice and devoted to the praise of god and godlike characters its frame contains from  0 to  00 ladies the two leading verses rhyme together and the rest alternatively keping throughout but two rhymes only so that these poems run the longst when they light upon such terminations as afford most consonances there are many such of giami hasis schemi enviri and others some of them appear to have been modernizd reductions as our chaucers works by dryden their old language being grown obscure in both of the countries abovementioned  so this argument of rhymes defect from want of due antiquity will carry little weight against it and might have an answer still more pointed and particular if it deserved to be allowed that anything in its own nature good could be the less so for its novelty  they call rhyme unnatural because it puts constraint upon expression which however is not true for poets have not only liberty of changing stubborn rhymes for ductile ones but are obliged to do it till they find such new ones as assist the sense instead of stiffening or obscuring it but were there all the force they would ascribe to it in this objection from constraint on the expression what a partial eye is theirs who censure such constraint as an unpardonable slavery where authorized by custom in a modern tongue yet see no consequence but that of a pretended beauty where it borrows sanction but from the same authority of custom in the ancient languages  for not to rest upon their hard and troublesome restraints to quantity what curb can possibly be more opposed to nature and her easy order of expression than their interweaving words and ranging them in so remote and dislocative a position as the patulae in virgils verse hereunder from the fagi it immediately related to for while the genuine construction is you tityrus reposing under the shade of a spreading beech the latin was constrained before it could arrange the line to harmony to force it into this distorted order  tityre tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi that is in english of the same position  tityrus you of a spreading reposing under the shade beech what strange perplexity is here by custom which we can indulge without a question thrown upon the sense to liquidate the sound and make the measure musical  let the reproachers of constrained expression show where rhyme has ever wrung an english verse into so cramped a posture  so again in martial  casta suo gladium cum traderet arria paeto what a charming figure in our language does this latin license make in the same literal arrangement  chaste her sword when had delivered arria to paetus it must not be pretended that these instances are chosen ones the very genius of the roman tongue made such disjointed shuffle of the words for ever necessary and yet which of our exploders of the infinitely lessconstraining use of rhyme would think it reasonable to condemn the not to be disputed elegance of latin verse in detestation of a practice which is visibly unnatural  even their celebrated horace notwithstanding his peculiar claim to the concinnitas and that curiosa felicitas so exquisitely fine in his expression could no more sail free from the oblique propulsion of this side wind that blew every roman poet wide of his true course than any weaker and more careless pilot witness his  me doctarum hederae praemia frontium diis miscent superis what would be thought of a writer in our tongue who when he was purposing to say clearly ivy garlands the rewards of learned brows rank me with the high gods should express it in this extraordinary manner  me of learned ivy garlands the rewards brows with the gods rank high  surely no man who knowing latin knows that such constraint as this is unavoidable in all their versification will pretend to argue against rhyme that it can possibly deserve explosion for a fault it is not half so guilty of as this allowed bad practice which is notwithstanding overlooked and held as nothing in comparison with the acknowlegd graces in the tongues it throws such intricacy on  rhyme then is neither newer in its practice nor less natural in its use than other licenses to verse which yet its enemies are very partially attached to  we will see in the last charge whether it ought to be held needless from superiority of harmony or any nobler or more masculine perfection in blank verse  or measure without consonance  lord roscommon one of the first fallers in with the applause of milton newly in his time beginning to attract consenters writes his essay on translated verse in the best rhyme he found himself at leisure to afford it but drawing near the end and growing out of humor with his choice breaks out at once into a rapturous declamation against rhyme and bondage in a specimen which he picks here and there and pieces artfully together out of some of the sublimest parts of paradise lost to recommend blank verse where he himself had just been disregarding it i think this manner of proceeding not a fair one the strong images which animate the glowing lines he there selected would have made prose poetry they shake the fancy and allow no leisure to the judgment to examine numbers  we are hurried on by the exaltedness of thought and rise above perception of the mechanism would he have tried the cause impartially he might have found a thousand lines in milton every one of which had turned it quite to the reverse of his intention  but now to let the reader see what kind of verse it is these gentlemen would substitute in place of rhyme i take the following pattern from the mentioned lords translation of the ars poetica  these are the likest copies which are drawn by the original of human life sometimes in rough and undigested plays we meet with such a lucky character as being humored right and well pursued succeeds much better than the shallow verse and chiming trifles of more studious pens we shall presently discern by only placing these lean lines in the prosaic order whether they have any title to their claim of poetry  verse in the literal sense we must allow it to be called because we but derive the word from turning back and these i own do that as often as they have stretched themselves to their due length of measure but observe how readily this prose may be unversified  these are the likest copies which are drawn by the original of human life sometimes in rough and undigested plays we meet with such a lucky character as being humored right and well pursued succeeds much better than the shallow verse and chiming trifles of more studious pens  if the enemies to rhyme had nothing better to produce in room of it than this it would not fail to live and prosper nor indeed is there an argument they use for the defense of their opinion but might better aid their enemies and serve as most deserters do with double violence against its masters meanwhile it is a pleasant kind of tyranny they are for exercising over reason first they warp to their own side the pretense of right to harmony and when they have applied all sorts of argument unjustly for their service and left none for ours but what they think they may refuse us as of counsel for the plaintiff they would run us down full cry as if we had no weapons to defend ourselves withal  it puts me in mind of an honest indian traveller who coming in hard weather to ask something at the house of a great man and being barked at by his mastives stooped for a flint but found it frozen to the surface deliver me said he from the unreasonable people of this country they let loose their dogs and fasten their stones  in tragedy blank verse may claim a preference as coming nearer to our natural mode of speech and yet retaining dignity enough by virtue of its measure to exalt it above prose but epic poets speak in person and describeing at full leisure are supposed to have due time for ornament and it will therefore be expected from them so that blank verse does not suit their use since where its flatness is not animated as in tragedy by restless agitation of the passions it must ever lean to one of these extremes either degenerating to plain prose as in the example before us or becoming harsh affected stiff and obsolete as but too many times it does in our great milton from a purpose to induce appearance of the venerable where the sweet was waning  the delightful mean is rhyme it keeps prose distant yet helps ease as well as energy for it was never meant to cramp expression but lend sound a liveliness and what is evidently and indeed peculiarly a benefit derived from this connective aid to recollection is that by retention of the rhyme the memory catching readily at the coherent matter it becomes much easier to hold ideas this way given us than in any other form of words whatever  mr dnnis who was one of a too numerous brotherhood who suffer pangs in mortifying lengths of labor at the birth of every rhyme and therefore naturally hate the child that cost em too much pain in its delivery was for turning his broad axe against our very root of argument and has denied that rhyme is musical because says he there is no harmony in unisons the face of this pretense is specious but it ought before it can have real weight to find some poem where all terminations close with the same rhyme repeated no one note indeed will make a tune but as we hear with pleasure the same note sounded sometimes twice or thrice in solemn compositions more especially and then give way to different ones the artful intermixture of all which is music so any tuneful note though sounded separately and more than once is harmony  no jarring note can stand in music discord there must be but that discordance is to rise from oppositions all harmonious in their proper and disjunctive particles and but differing not clashing into melody by joint concurrency of variations not of inconsistencies  neither will it be needful to confess that rhymes are unisons the question is of no importance or it would be easy to explain their difference  another reason in behalf of rhyme is that no language is so naturally formed as english for receiving and becoming it the latin verse tormented and constrained as i have shown it in pursuit of harmony could no way have admitted this which that it was not in its genius constituted for or capable of we need no plainer proofs than the sequestered muses of the monks have furnished us  if ever muse at all inspired a monastery   vir honoratus  jacet hic tumulatus qui prudens gratus  justus fuit et moderatus and again  hic vir pacificus shipley richardus humatur verus catholicus domus haec hoc testificatur which to english em just as well as they deserve would thus be rendered  here a brave man is thrust  down deep in the dust who was true to his trust  prudent moderate and just and for the other  poor peaceful dick shipleys here left in the lurch that he was a good catholic witness this church not even the greek tongue could have been capable of rhyme nor had it truly the least want of it  it was so musically ductile so sonorously significant that it was naturally a full tide of harmony it seemed to roll along like one of its own homers torrents down the side of a vast mountain sparkling rapid and sounding in all parts of its passage  yet fain would i with all the partial fondness of a lover set in balance some defects of this triumphant rival of the beauty i wish best to against that great advantage which it would be blindness to deny her claim to in the tuneful texture of her cadences i detest for instance those abominable aids called expletives a mean and lazy crutch which not the lamest poet of our nation now submits to heave himself along by they were the dull and insignificant stopgaps of greek enclosures a degree at least below the venerable from whences for tos untos and fine ekes and ayes of our old cleric compositions  but if sincerity refuses patience to a calm surveyor of this grecian license what would it not inspire contempt to say against the servile disposition of a race called commentators who would have the privilege their poets used of mixing in one piece their different dialects and altering accents at their pleasure pass for an advantage to their poetry as if people long habituated to a pronunciation the reverse of many of those motley rusticisms could in reverence of a worthless skill in weaving them together quit their natural partiality to their own mode of speaking  on the contrary rejected idioms must have been extremely irksome to a polished ear and left a kind of coarse provincial brogue upon the best performances  were an english poet for example to avail himself of this licentious practice of the greek ones in extending these five words to numbers and due length of meter  these people were learned writers and admit he should be told that in some counties of the north and west it was a custom to give drawling prolongation to their syllables and open all the diphthongs and that by assistance of this noble privilege he might spin out a verse thus elegantly  le  ar  ned writers these pe  o  ple were or because it would be pity to want choice of good examples let it be supposed that the three words  meet glorious occasion were to be stretched out on some of these greek tenters  me  et glo  ri  o  us oc  ca  si  on it is visible enough the verses are filled up by help of such a frightful anglograecism but from what force of custom could we reconcile such jargon to a london ear no matter what relief a lazy poet might draw from it it would never give his reader satisfaction yet allow it but to be supposed that english had been a dead language for about a thousand years and now but studied as a learned one for the sake of ancient stores of knowledge treasured up in its remains in that case even the manifest absurdity above as grossly as it seems to shock us in a living tongue had passed perhaps unnoticd in the dead one or but brushed us with a faint perception  but peace be to the manes of the greek and latin tongues their very faults are venerable from the early prejudice that roots a reverence in us for these first imprinters of our school ideas  the modern languages have no such right to preference and their defects may be observed more easily and censured with less danger  tassone noting a most obvious one in the italian poetry confesses with a candid freedom that he knows not whether to impute it most to the ill fortune of his countrys writers or a certain weakness in the language which says he wants energy and is unfit for high expression this defect in that so favorite tongue which stands acknowlegd by their own consent and testimony chiefly flows from a redundancy of vowels which though sweetning a soft sound enervates it  italian is the language wherein love would choose to sigh or laughter to be light and wanton it supplies with fullness and delight the uses of intrigue and conversation but wants weight and spring for passion and bends under the demand of comprehensiveness it is like the flowing of soft sand in hourglasses seeming liquid while confined to its close currency but flies dispersed and opens its loose quality as soon as shaken out and trusted to hard weather  not to insist in this place on the too offensive frequency of their elisions i make haste to note another where the rash condemners of our own excess in monosyllables will wonder i find cause to charge it but i take their poverty in that particular alone to be the reason why italian rhymes induce a kind of leaping levity upon the terminations of their verses they run generally in stanzas the rhymes double and the structure in this order   capitano  christo  mano  acquisto  vano  misto  santi  erranti but disyllable or trisyllable rhymes if i mistake not carry with em something of the burlesque air and suit more aptly with that grinning face of wit that loves to wear grimace upon good sense like hudibras than with the grave and serious majesty that ought to dignify the epic poetry  both these defects are french as visibly as they must be confessed italian but they find some remedy in france in that their accent frequently is placed on the last syllable of their long words and so their rhymes appear to terminate more gravely than italian ones which carry it upon their last excepting one take an example of this best kind of french accenting from boileau  amors discourse unifrme endorme ennuyer psalmodier lecteur achepteur here all the rhymes depend upon the terminating syllable but yet they are not careful to preserve this benefit too frequently degenerating into double rhymes like the italians as in this of the same boileau  de la foy dun chrestien les mysteres terribles dornemens egayez ne sont point susceptibles et de vos fictions le melange coupable meme a ses veritez done l air de la fable i will english these four lines as near as i can do it to the very trip of the french cadence that the reader may conceive a proper notion of their debonair heroics  of the faith of a christian the terrible mystries reject the gay dress of impertinent histries and the fictions when mixed though as well as youre able to the pure truth itself give the air of a fable i judge with a too partial ear or there is something so distastefully alert to use a phrase of their own furnishing in the pert skipping of this verse a kind of pausecheckd recoil of motion like the half whirl of a spinningwheel  like the unlacing of a muse as mr hobbes expresses it or to hit the image better in lord dorsets simile like the unvaried rumbling of a wheelbarrow that the numbers of their serious poems seem as illadapted to their subjects as jigg tunes to a church anthem  we may discover in their very verse the dapper genius of their nation a sort of spirited or animal vivacity that dances gaily through the fancy without stopping at the judgment i except their few examples which have been by nature too excepted of a fierce yet steady fire and a reflection both profound and volatile  concerning other modern tongues it will be needless to say much what has been hinted of italian will effectually include the spanish and the portuguese the german must be owned worth great regard for its antiquity and manliness but will content itself with that just praise and claim no merit from its harmony whatever roughness english may be thought to have retained is but of saxon origin and to acknowledge a too obvious truth poetry in high dutch is like the nile among its cataracts it may be rapid and deep but it is tumbling and terrible it has its course obstructed everywhere by mountains it must clamber over  to carry poetry still further north would be but dragging her to seek for friends among her enemies the goths and vandals  the english then of modern tongues is fitted best for poetry its copious choice of monosyllables which many have been rash enough to call a blemish make it strong significant and comprehensive its derivatives from greek and latin have adorned it with variety of cadences and intermixed its masculine excess of consonants with a melodious fluency from interposing vowels  it adorns and is adorned by rhyme yet takes it in but as a subject not obeys it as her tyrant it is grave slow stately soft swift wanton or majestic it has all the lentor of complaint and pity yet has all the transport of excursive energy it is an inexhaustibly full treasury supplied from the selected tributes of whatever was most excellent in other speeches but possesses them with so improved an aptitude as to have made that honey which was raw juice in the flowers it drew it from  but i digress too far from what i had begun to say upon the structure of my verse which differs little from a species mr cowley toward the close of the last century first reduced to practice and misnamd pindaric but if he conceived a greek name necessary dithyrambic had i think expressed his purpose better from the latitude of so diversified a numerosity there must arise a fuller harmony than can consist with common measure else a concert can be equaled by a single instrument our usual coupletwriting sooner satiates by too frequent and too limited returns of the same measure whereas in this perpetual change of cadence and new course of numbers the attention is beat up provoked and rendered lively the ear everywhere relieved and images of actions sounds or things how different soever they may be are clothed with words best suited to their nature  the compass and the freedom of this range of verse have recommended its attempt to many practisers in odes and such brief sallies but too generally with bad success they checked the gracefulness of stepping by too visible a fear to fall like children who first learn to go alone they took short tottering starts and hung upon and rested at all stopping places they could stretch their hands to they confined their muse too humbly to a lyric length of leadingstrings and gave the snug set roundhead crop to stanzas that should flow out cavalierly pindaric in short measure is a woman of quality in kneedeep petticoats she may have very wellshapd feet but they can never be so fine as to atone the indecorum lyric numbers carry songlike and familiar levity quite inconsistent with the epic gravity a few bold writers of pindaric odes have ventured nowandthen as far as the hexameter but hardly dared so much as dream of the heptametrical sevenfooted line of fourteen syllables indeed the shortest measure is too long unless that length is filled with meaning for nothing can be more ridiculous than a weak languishing extent of verse without proportioned vigor in the sentiment such verse plays loose like some vast main sail of a ship that flags and flutters heavily upon the prospect of a breeze but presently falls back against the mast for want of wind to swell it into energy it is in poems such as these where as was paintedly expressed by mr pope but might have been still more so by his lengthening out his second verse to the heptameter extent just mentioned and hereunder given it by an addition only of the two small words in roman characters  a needless alexandrine ends the song and like a weak and wounded snake drags its slow length along mr dryden who was willing enough to allow that praise to mr cowley justly due to him for having introduced a new and noble way of writing is however of opinion that much still was wanting to his practice of that wished perfection which this kind of verse seemed capable of he instances the roughness and the oftdeficient numbers the truth is mr cowleys judgment not his ear deceived him what his learned and reverend editor would represent as an effect of generous negligence in a too active race of fancy seeming to have been the cool and most deliberate result of wrong election we may plainly gather this from his own note to the first book of davideis where he speaks of this strange line  nor can the glory confine itself to the endless space it was in his intention to express the struggle of an overflowing luster laboring for room in the whole breadth of heaven  i am sorry says mr cowley that it is necessary to admonish the most part of readers that it is not by negligence that this verse is so loose long and as it were vast it is to paint the nature of the thing which it describes which i would have observed in diverse other places that else will pass for very careless verses and then he names these following  down a precipice deep down he casts them all and this  like some fair pine oerlooking all thignobler wood painting the image by the sound is questionless one of the liveliest beauties of which verse is capable but how far that is done by running out of measure and admitting plain prose as an ornament in poetry i leave to be determined by the judgment of the reader he will recollect that homer was and virgil in his imitation everywhere ambitious of this verbal coloring but they neither of em thought it necessary to that end to disarray and prosify their numbers on the contrary they raised and added to their harmony by a melodious latitude that circumscribed at once and dissipated by effect of this allcomprehending practice mr cowley needed not have started out of numerosity to reach effectually the view before him  for example   nor finds the struggling glory room closepressd over boundless space for the second  down over a cliffs steep precipice deep down he casts em all for the third  oerlooking like some towry pine the ignobler underwood and here are three successive instances of the great use and benefit an english poet has it in his power to make by sparingly and always aptly daring to launch out into the long heptameter extent of measure but there will be found too much obstructive void in this poetic readiness big armor if a dwarf in genius should attempt to wear it  mr cowleys ear indulged him in another equally untuneful practice which in reverence to the neverfailing strong characteristic of the tribe of imitators the implicites in his track have all with devious diligence been careful not to start a step from he too often placed his pauses in the wrong part of his verse they should in the long measures be found always posited exactly i subjoin an instance of the error  lo how the years to come a numerous and wellfitted quire here was nothing that resembled numbers no harmony at all unless the reader paused at nume in the word numerous and if he did so pause in that divided word he made a disagreeable hiatus in the sense and would have wounded a nice ear as harshly as an old greek expletive how infinitely more majestically flows the verse hereunder though the measure is the same and both are mr cowleys  for no other reason but because the pause is here placed rightly  the mountains shake and run about no less confused than they run about indeed may want a little of the purposed greatness from the too light vulgarity of the expression  strive to fly had been perhaps more aptly suited to both sound and image but i introduce the verse in this place only with a view to the right placing of its pause so wrongly judged in the preceding one  that noble writer seems to have been sensible of the perplexity this roughness of his numbers nowandthen must throw a reader into for he gives a most exact description of pindaric verse as he then practiced it in his ode upon the resurrection  it is an unruly and a hardmouthed horse fierce and unbroken yet impatient of the spur or bit now prances stately and anon flies over the place disdains the servile law of any settled pace conscious and proud of his own natural force twill no unskilful touch endure but flings writer and reader too that sits not sure this was the true condition under which he left it but if he had lived to give the needful hand to what he so successfully had introduced it is probable he would have so far changed his practice that it had been nearlier described in this from his fine ode on liberty  the plain heroic strain let others take mine the pindaric way i will make the matter shall be grave the numbers loose and free it shall not keep one settled pace of time in the same tune it shall not always chime nor shall each verse just to his neighbor rhyme a thousand liberties it shall dispense but yet shall manage all without offense or to the sweetness of the sound or greatness of the sense a species once i think was tried in tragic poetry not wholly differing from this new composite order aristotle notes it of a work of cheremon a scholar of socrates the piece was called the centaur and composed he says of all the different sorts of verse he should have added except long ones for he disapproves that practice in dramatic works because iambics and tetrameters and such short measures were too skipping and too light for serious poetry our language carries natural gravity and might allow short measures with less lightness yet they ought not to be often used in epic writings even of this new sort and never but in places where they help the harmony without detracting from the dignity  that this poem is divided into twelve books was a determination of so little consequence that twere impertinent to offer at a reason for it these are points indifferent and in which a poet will not need to strengthen his own practice by examples the extent of his design should be a guide in his division of it mr cowley professedly imitated virgil in his choice of twelve books to his davideis though i think he might as justly have rejected virgils number as he  virgil had rejected homers the number of whose books too the roman would methinks more gracefully have been a borrower of than of his episodes and incidents  sir william davenant springs quite aside from this old imitative road but into an extreme as wrong though opposite he is for neither books nor proposition invocation or machinery like some of those stiffhearted puritans who dirtied his own times and would hear sermons with their hats upon their heads in defiance of church ceremony he divides his gondibert into five acts as if it were a tragedy and each act into cantos which may hold he says the place of scenes  this method mr hobbes in a long prefatory tract thought worth his pains to justify but was i think himself the sole supporter of his argument in matters left indifferent the old way if not best is sure to be the modestest for my part if division into twelve books needs more reason than because the subject offered matter for that number i should think it fully justified from the division of that people whom it treats of into their twelve tribes if still a stronger reason should be asked for take it thus the action of an epic poem ought not to be stretched beyond one year and twelve months make up the division of the term so limited  and now i enter on the referential notes in every section marked progressively  sect i l    seek o soul some heavenly theme  it was the custom of greek poets to mix in one the proposition and the invocation the latins and the moderns mostly follow them proposed their subject first and then invoked assistance from the muses  it becomes a christian poet better to begin with invocation it is a way more solemn and proportioned to the weight of an address to our inspirer not alone to pray his aid in the performance but his previous guidance in the very choice of what we go upon  that invocation should by no means be omitted seems a point agreed for many different reasons a work that has its first foundation in a moral purpose owes a reader says bossu a good example for his piety and veneration add that many things must be described in course of these great poems which the poet not being thought in any reasonable likelihood of coming to so full a knowledge of by any common means of information he could never hope to give his testimony weight enough to merit faith but from impressing first his readers mind with a conceit that heaven infused it  sir william davenant then did ill to throw aside his prophets mantle what the robe is to the judge the poet owes to invocation  sect i l     redeem the use of longlost poetry  every body knows that the original of poetry was in the worship of the gods and celebration of their glory it is equally notorious how degenerate it is since become in its too beggarly flattery as mr cowley calls it of great men he adds in idolizing women which last observation to discredit gallantry he was so fitted for and so excusable for painting i would certainly have let alone had i been author of his mistress  to redeem the use of poetry then is to restore it to the praise of god to the advancement of true virtue and to animation of those noblest passions which lend wings to human ardour  sect ii l    wilful they started from protective grace  among the many arguments enforced by democratic writers against monarchy it seems the most immodest one and the least founded upon reason when they are for listing god himself into their party from what appearance they derived this claim it is not easy to discover since the unity of power ascribed to the almighty by themselves as well as their opponents does not seem at all to favor any preference of the remotest form of government on earth from that which heaven is ruled by yet there runs no principle more universally asserted through the writings of the warm enthusiasts of the last unquiet century than that god declared himself aloud for the republican system by his personal command to moses for prescribing that selected form to his own chosen race of people for they insist that the mosaic model was a popular one they hold it too a claim assigned them with so full a right to their political free will that god submitted laws and propositions to the peoples confirmation or refusal and became the civil magistrate of their theocracy that when accordingly they found it proper to depose him from his temporal authority i use the very word which oceana and many other of their treatises take boldness to make free with and to choose themselves a king who should reign with them in his stead god blamed but their ingratitude confessing and admitting their asserted right to samuel  it is not thee they have rejected but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them and that what is meant by giving them a king in wrath was a reproach that they inclined to choose a king at all and so but consequential menace that their monarch should enslave em into a corrected sense of that superior happiness they parted with in favor of him  this still continuing to be the light wherein they see that hebrew revolution twill be pulling down one prop of their political fabric to make plain in course of these reflections that the government of israel as assigned by god was not a commonwealth but an hereditary monarchy and that all the hebrews miseries in those successive slaveries they fell into for three hundred years together were a natural effect of factions and confusions which the princes of their tribes became divided by upon assuming to themselves in their provincial severalties a secular direction of the military power which in their first institution was the sovereigns prerogative exclusively together with a right of judicatory in the last appeal on civil causes only reserving to the popular assent or dissent the election or rejection of new laws originally to be brought before the congregation and enacted by and with the peoples approbation and the regal fiat of the sovereign authority  i propose to leave it undeniable that this sovereign power was vested in the high priest personally and that moses placed it not in his defective line but in his brothers who had many children down successively to whom descended the monarchic with the sacerdotal sole supremacy and formed that species of administration called theocracy not to be understood as if god in his own immediate person condescended to be king in israel but as assisting with his influential presence always virtually and sometimes openly and miraculously to inspire and actuate the high priests determinations i pretend to make this system clear in all its branches and to reconcile to it the whole gradation of events to that destructive period under saul at which time first the priestly power became subordinate to and dependent on the temporal royalty as in the other eastern nations that lay nearest to em  it may merit recollection that the papal claim to an infallibility in christian spirituals has sometimes made such near approach to take in temporal supremacy conjunctively as in no very wide degree to hold itself removed from prospect of a new theocracy and nearer still was that of the old caliphs claim in the mohammedan first outstart of enthusiasm  sect ii l  0  then gideon wise and generous leader rose  this line begins the proposition and the progress of the section specifies the action of the poem  in its opening it is general  to teach in the example of the leader named that the inspired by heaven are to apprehend no danger from the most unequal opposition all divided power becoming weaker on exertion while united moves direct and still grows stronger in that motion the proposition next descends to the particular declaring it to be the redemption of israel from her yoke of foreign conquest  it is a terrible dust the critics raise in their disputes concerning the best way of opening propositions every body agrees with them in recommending modesty but fullness too seems not at all unnecessary  i can be as unsatisfied with statius as bossu has been for his encumbring the proposition of his achilleid with declarations that his hero had frighted the thunderer as also with his personal boasts how nobly he the poet had exhausted inspiration insomuch that thebes so sung by him should reverence him as her second founder in a just dislike of this all men of common sense must join but from effect of the same sense they ought to quit his cause i mean bossus when undiscerningly attached to every casual choice of homer or of virgil he deduces an authority to state their practice as a not to be disputed standard for all epic plans to follow  there is a celebrated ipse dixit which has been too long consented to upon this very subject of the proposition and which it is now high time to weigh and find too light even after i confess it horaces if i have any notion what it is he means he either has meant evidently wrong or which twere bolder to suspect him guilty of has misexpressd his own true meaning  hear him in lord roscommon  do not begin as that old scribler did priams proud war and fate i mean to sing what worth such noise produced this bellowing bard how much more just spoke homer always wise muse paint the man who after troys great fall manners and men and numerous cities saw not smoke from fire but fire from smoke he draws and from this flat to dreadful wonders towers to barking scyllas cyclops and charybdis in the first place i can see no reason why because one man has undertaken to describe a war and proved not equal to his enterprise another therefore should be arrogant in but proposing the same subject and as to modesty of proposition for the want of which the writer is here treated ill by horace and accused of noise and ostentation i am frank enough to dare confess that the immodesty if there is any here lies too concealed for my discernment pray what could any author who designed that subject have contrived to say upon it less when he was entering on the proposition of it where is the too much fire in his beginning smoke in the progress can be nothing to our purpose why is there more of pomp expressed or why more expectation raised from a plain promise to describe the ruin of one town and death of one man than to show the manners of many men and treat on the affairs of many cities if we were not to expect accounts of not alone the things ulysses saw but also why he saw them to what end then did homer promise any thing about em in his proposition if we were to entertain that expectation certainly our hopes are higher raised by homer who assures us we shall hear of many cities and of many men than by the other who proposed to set before us but the ruin of one city and one mans destruction  there is a narrowness in these implicit reverencers they understand and follow in their authors rear with a too creeping and too blind servility who reads and is not horaces admirer and yet who shall be afraid of saying he would better have instructed us by some intelligible plain precept on this point of propositions than by two illunderstood and wide examples  to conclude with my own humble notion of the matter he certainly proposes well who comprehends within his proposition the extent of his whole meaning and adds nothing further and he errs as certainly who being scrupulously terrified by words without a reason is kept back by groundless fear of saying more than this or that man would have said upon the subject and says less than his own meaning calls for  sect iii l     not to prides transient phantoms poorly kneel  i would not be misunderstood in this place as renouncing reverence for the age i live in or for any great man who adorns it i except all such whose minds are no partakers in their greatness what i mean by my unfashionable and not overpolitic abjuration is no more than that i blush to find it is not thought below the condescension of a man of genius to confine his views to little hopes and transient interests from the powerful his business as i take it being rather to assert and vindicate neglected excellence than to be poorly prostituting his hosannah to the highest the poet and the priest antiquity so joined em ought to guide their ends not by the humors inclinations or immediate passions of the age they write in they should carry down their prospect through futurity and never rate their recompense at all the lower from their persons being doomed to die before it reaches em  sect vii l    had restless midian poured her swarthy hosts  what people these midianites were into what nations divided how governed and where seated as also who are now their descendents i shall have occasion to describe in the next book this race had wasted israel for seven years within the last of which about the time of harvest the poem takes beginning that so the unity of action might be properly maintained in comprehending only their redemption without retrospect to their invasion which had formed two different actions and destroyed the regularity required in epic poetry critics believe they see that for this reason only homer commenced his iliad in the tenth year of the siege and virgil his aeneid in the last year of the voyage no doubt they had been else encumbered by excess of matter  sect vii l    to these old amalek her standards joined  this numerous and mighty nation will have place at large among the notes of the succeeding book they were the hebrews first and surest enemies first because they first attacked em in their march when they were beaten under moses  and surest as the israelites received particular command from god never to make peace with the amalekites but pursue till they had quite eradicated them and this at last they very nearly had accomplished after many hundred years were past first what in this affair i find least comprehensible is gods remembering for a people who themselves had long forgot this right to vengeance they appear to have deserved it very little it being after their rejection of his care concerning them i am at some loss therefore to account for the surprising rigor of the curse denounced on saul by samuel three hundred and fifty years after the injury received in punishment of but a generous pity shown to agag when his prisoner as the compassion was a virtue and twere hard to think the prophets love of vengeance keener than the kings the anger could arise but from a recollection that such mercy shown to amalek was a contempt expressed of heaven there standing out an unrepeald decree for total extirpation of that people  sect vii l     their heavy harvests load the plundring foe  from the story of this war as in the book of judges it was predatory and incursive and the hebrews after their first contest had abandoned all the plains and open country and secured themselves among their fastnesses on rocky mountains while the enemy maintaining winter quarters in some cities which they held on purpose made excursions thence in summer to destroy the harvest burn the open towns and villages and carry off as plunder people cattle and whatever else fell into their possession  sect viii l    where half the manassaean tribe etc  jordan that rises in the northern part of palestine runs almost strait south through the whole length of the country nine tribes and a half of the twelve in the division made by joshua of the conquered lands had been allotted the possession of that tract between the western shore of jordan and the neck of the levant or syrian sea excepting only that the coast itself together with a breadth of some miles inward was possessed by the philistines and the rich and powerful trading states of tire and sidon the other two tribes and a half being those of reuben gad and one half of manassah held the country lying eastward along jordan which was conquered first of all by moses from the amorites and their allies but that half tribe of the manassans which is here alluded to had their allotment to the west of jordan it was a long but narrow slip of land which trended from the rivers brink twixt issachar and ephraim almost to the sea coast abovementioned on a mountain toward the east end of this slip of land in sight of jordan stood the city of ophra gideons birthplace safe from insults of an enemy by its impregnable situation at the foot of this high mountain opened a large beautiful and fruitful valley that of jezreel where the midian army is supposed to lie encamped at this time whence the poem takes beginning this valley of jezreel has been the scene of many bloody battles it was there our gideon overthrew the midianites saul the philistines achab the syrians and in more modern times the tartars the saracens  sect viii l     this tree a shade over half the mountain cast  that there was a tree and a bench under it before joashs house we have the testimony of the bible which informs us that an angel of god came and sat there but that it was so large and old a tree is a poetical discovery that it was remarkable however for its size and situation may be gathered from its being thought worth so particular a notice in the sacred story but because i have supposed it many ages old and yet in its full flourish it is necessary i say something in defense and honor of these venerable children of the earth  pliny tells us of oaks growing in his time supposed to have been coeval with the world itself their roots says he were united and raised into arches like the gates of cities and the earth was swelled about em into mountains  josephus has made mention of a turpentine tree that was thought as old as the creation mr maundrel in his journey to jerusalem affirms he measured one of the few yet remaining cedars of lebanon and found it above twelve yards round the body and that at almost one hundred foot high it spread out into five several limbs the least of which would have been singly a great tree  sir francis drake informs us that he measured a huge mastictree in one of his voyages that was four and thirty yards about it is easy to infer these vegetable giants must have borne the growth of no small number of ages  st jerome too relates that he had seen the very sycamore tree zacchaeus climbed into to look upon our savior when he rode in triumph to jerusalem  but the tree of trees at last is an old english dryad one that mr evelyn in his sylva mentions with becoming gravity and hands down to us the record of such a magna charta in its reverence as deserves to be remembered and maintained to an immortal length of triumph and no doubt it will be so by those bold sons of liberty who boast the honor of their birth within due distance of its shadow the abovenamd gentleman asserts from his own knowledge that there is this pleasant kind of privilege annexed to an old oak which has time out of memory been the glory of knoll wood near trely castle in staffordshire the shade of this trees boughs he says is very ample and in due respect to its antiquity whoever will make oath on birth of any child who must call nobody its father that this child was actually begotten within any part of its shadow the offense is free and stands exempted from all cognizance whether of civil or ecclesiastic magistrate  but to return to the longevity of trees undignified by so indulged a sanctuary mr lawson in his tract of orchards has brought reasonable arguments to prove a peartrees life may be a thousand years and truly if the age of man before the flood was from six hundred to nine hundred years it can be no great rashness to imagine that an oak so much more durable and solid in its substance and not subject to the dangers and diseases which disorder human bodies may be capable of living many thousand years the soil supposed adapted and no accident arising that might interrupt or stop its progress  and thus much i thought it not amiss to note in reference to the age i have assigned the oak of gideon  sect ix l    the morning rising over israel s spoils  the description which this verse begins i took some pains to make a pleasing one but would not have it thought i introduced it to make way for ornament  not but description is the life of epic poetry and it is there as boileau well observes the poet ought to lavish all his fancy and his rhetoric yet if it serves no other end than mere delight the poem will be found to languish for the race of action is too coldly stopped in favor of detached ideas bossu writes much to say a very little to the purpose in his chapter of descriptions mr dennis is more clear and hits the point directly in one short remark of his discourse against prince arthur descriptions says this gentleman ought never to be made in epic poems unless necessary which they never can be but in one of these two cases either where of use for giving us a reasonable account of some part of the action whereby to make it probable or when they serve to imprint strongly some important circumstance  it is in this last view that the description of the morning dawning over gideon shadowed by his oak was introduced in order to impress a strong conception not of the place and posture simply but of all the hostile prospect opening before him to convey a local image and transmit the sense of danger and of his reflections on it from the heros to the readers passions as we see in common life how forcibly regards of place assist imagination he who had seen edge hill or newberry or naseby would have found himself more strikingly attached in reading the accounts our history records of those three battles  sect x l     here and there highmettled steeds  the use i make of horse in the progression of this war being frequent and considerable i take occasion from their first being mentioned in this verse to assert the use of cavalry among the hebrews lest some hasty doubt perhaps might censure it as not in practice in that early period and the rather because homer writing of a war much later makes no mention in his work of horsemen but describes that noble creature in no other manner than as harnessed to the skirmishing little chariots of his greek or trojan captains  how this happened in the iliad i am not able to account for though that his countrymen were then unskilful to back horses i can easily enough believe because not long before they had mistaken the first horsemen they had ever seen for compound creatures halfman halfhorse and given em the name of centaurs from the business they seemed fondest of which was to steal their cattle but that such too should have been the case among the trojans must not be so readily admitted troy held the empire then of asia minor and drew powerful allies to her assistance from so many distant places that it is impossible to fancy they were all unskilled in riding when so many ages before that the wars all over asia had been dreadfully distinguishable for the number of their cavalry  ninus the founder of nineveh had entered bactria with two hundred thousand horse besides his chariots which were above a hundred thousand semiramis his wife who was the builder of babylon invaded india says suidas with a million of horsemen and of chariots armed with scyths at the end of their axle trees above a hundred thousand also  it may be surmisd that horsemen in such numbers in those early ages probably were overrated by the inaccuracy of historians let it be so it has no force against the use of horse in war so anciently  if therefore the assyrians thus abounded in their cavalry it must be past dispute that bordering nations also had the use of em and could not have come so far with purpose to invade the hebrews without bringing numbers in their armies  as for the hebrews themselves scripture is full of instances how early they were able horsemen and it had been strange indeed to find them otherwise when we remember they came out of egypt where the pharaohs were so generally powerful in arms and so particularly furnished with fine cavalry that one of em pursued the hebrew people in their march to the red sea with fifty thousand horse says josephus and two hundred thousand foot besides all the chariots of egypt  sect x l     in other parts the scytharmd chariots driven  concerning these chariots an ancient and terrible invention and of infinite effect in those vast open plains of asia the most proper place to speak at large will be in the remarks upon the second book and there a full description will be found not only of the chariots themselves but of the different ways of using and avoiding them and what effects they did produce and might have been made capable of producing  sect x l     the tortured drums and sprightly trumpets joined  the ancients made great use of drums though differing in shape and mode of beating from the ways in modern practice they were not struck upon by sticks but with strong pulsion of the hands alone and both at top and bottom being ornamented round their rims with thickset plates of jingling brass  and certainly such drums must have derived their use from the most early times having been found with the chinese when first discovered by the europaeans and for the trumpet there are such concurring proofs of its antiquity in holy writ that i was much surpised at mr popes assertion in his notes on homer that it was not yet invented in the trojan war that war was in the time of abdons judging israel and trumpets were so long before in use among the hebrews that the ark was never moved nor any congregation summoned but by the sound of this known instrument they had a festival too called the feast of trumpets the walls of jericho fell down at sound of joshuas trumpets gideon blew a trumpet and all abiezer was gathered after him moses in the very wilderness directs the making silver trumpets whose shape and dimensions suit exactly with those now among us  how has mr pope then formed this notion that they knew no use of trumpets in the trojan war was it because he found it not in homer possibly his greeks were yet too rude to have acquired the practice in their armies possibly they held it too inspiring and exciting as we read that some of their vain countrymen the lacedaemonians rejected it long after as a stirrer up of courage which it seems they had a mind to represent as naturally overactive in their constitution  therefore marched to battles with the soft appeasing sound of flutes and flagelets before em they would induce their enemies to think they rather found it needful to correct the overboiling of their ardour than propel and irritate it virgil however gives aeneas a trumpeter and says he had before belonged to hector virgil therefore thought the trumpet was of that antiquity and out of all dispute it was of older origin  sect xi l    light from his bench enraged young gideon leapt  from designed effect of those fine prospects which lay stretched before him for the natural and improved embellishments of such a fruitful valley when surveyed together with the enemy whose rapine held it from the famished owners must inflame the spirit of a suffering observer into aggravated sense of what he felt and apprehended for his country the natural consequence of such a flame in such a mind as gideons was the rousing all those passions which break out in his soliloquy  and serve to open his true character the reader being yet a stranger to it and it must have touched him in a fainter and less animateing manner had it been in a cool form of narrative anticipated to him  sect xi l     now were some single power a general bliss  the hebrews after joshua was dead concluded only a slight war of little consequence in the south parts of judah during the reign of phinehas and then with one concurrent lapse from any further application to their instituted modes of military practice under general attachment to dependent regulation threw that care in a divided trust to their provincial heads of tribes who now had their allotted severalties in territory and in civil and palatinate pretensions and fell in with the whole peoples disposition to improve and cultivate their lands drinking as the text expresses this desertion of the public duty for the private interest every man under his own vine and eating under his own fig tree  this universal spirit of defection met too little opposition from a want of due attention in their priestly sovereigns to the civil branch of their prerogative and of the military still more willingly as from their turn of education less adapted to its duties they depended on the awful influence of their divine preeminence and their possession of the ark of god whereto lay all appeals and to whose final sentence in the high priests voice the people were enjoined implicit and direct obedience under penalty of present death by stoning so they took no care to educate some martial genius such as joshuas had been and to attach him by his interest to sole dependence on the royal safety under whose delegated right to that supremacy in warlike exercise the tribes had been till then enured and disciplined and held unitedly together  the knot had long been loosening but love of ease and taste of luxury now all at once dissolved it  till this fatal lure in their detached divisions of the land the want of property among particulars sustained no other than the general interest hope of the future from the states prosperity kept every individual easy in his present indigency the joint distress of their collective body held it close compacted like a heap of pebbles in a watery soil froze hard together the new warmth of selfdependency dissolving the adhesion every offfalling pebble became a separate body and contributed no longer to the texture of the universal in this dispersed condition what before had been immovable by virtue of its weight lay liable thenceforth to be trod down by every hoof and only magnified its breadth to ruin its consistency  plenty in ease was the first step toward anarchy it drew on disregard of public happiness the next was wealth with luxury to which succeeded pride and that in natural consequence produced contempt of law soon followed by defiance of authority the sure result of all together was dissension and confusion  turbulent ambition set up every tribe to wish and act with views to independency and under this relaxed insensibility to national coherence the remainder of the canaanites whom avarice not mercy had too indiscretely spared took arms against so visible a weakness and succeeded frequently in their revolts till they not only brought this factious people to the lowest pitch of infamy but taught the nations that surrounded em to think of and to treat em with contempt than which no state can possibly be cursed with an unhappier or more dangerous condition  the progress of all this was natural  it helped em little that they still had strength enough to have repulsed their enemies the feet and arms like those in the old fable of menenius agrippa thought it hard that they should work to feed the stomach and destroyed themselves in not sustaining what they were sustained by  while those proud hebrews multiplied their claims into lean independencies exemptions and immunities they were plucked one by one away like the hairs of sertoriuss horsetail which if pulled at all together had been found irradicable  it is in bodies politic the same as in a body natural in the rapidity of some wild race a man perceives a gaping pit before him what a happiness in such a case to have the seat of counsel and of power the same he sees the ruin in the moment that he shuns it in for reason and authority concurring in the head put present stop to the retracted members and they stand secured upon the very verge of their precipitation but could we here suppose our limbs stuck over with fine mouths and eyes like virgils fame and the imaginary argus and that every mouth and eye because it looked a little like a face would set up for a head too and lay claim to privilege of contradiction what consequence could we expect to see from such a popular balance clamor more than enough there could not fail to be to give alarm to such a body but the monsters neck would run the hazard to be broke before each member could be asked his sentiment there could not well be fansied a more lively emblem than when reasoners for monarchy compare a commonwealth to that imaginary serpent some old writers dreamt of with seven heads and but one tail the turbulent reptile would in spite of its big hissing only hang itself in every hedge whereas with but one head it would draw all its seven tails through and find no danger or encumbrance  sect    l    how comes it he permits my countrys shame  the leading character in epic poetry must be distinguished not alone from other characters of the same poem but from other poems heroes he is to be marked by some peculiar of a noble kind by which he would be known in every company not only as a brave wise glorious man  but as that very individual brave wise glorious man  we are not satisfied by a too general description even of a fine woman but we listen with fullpointed approbation when besides the attributes she holds in common with the other beauties of her sex we are brought closer to her image by communication of some one peculiar grace that teaches and appropriates her separate manner of engaging then we form her to our fancy and become acquainted with her picture  thus in virgils hero the characteristic is benevolent piety in homers it is fierceness and in gideon patriotism  sect xiii l last  will israel s haughty tribes be led etc  no observation can be juster than is that of the political writers that authority is power and reputation is authority the nature of things and actions can be examined but by few their appearance reaches many machiavel had reason for his observation that the only difficulty in ascent to greatness will be found at its beginning never man says he attained considerable height from low condition without infinite fatigue and danger from opponents repose a millstone on the very border of a hill it there lies fixed for ever if it wants the impulse of some new first motion let that push be given and not a rock in its descent will have the strength to stop its progress all that envy which impels our opposition when we cross the way of some new riser from the natural stimulation of a vanity that makes comparison betwixt a consciousness of our own worth and his becomes extinguished in amazement when we contemplate the hazards of some terrible reputation the honors of a man so dangerously raised we can no longer look upon with malice we surrender em as but the perquisites of the adventurous post he won em in and while everybody admires applauds expects  resistance is discouraged and falls in with furtherance till now the man whom all believe most capable grows capable in consequence of that admission  however equal therefore gideon might in nature have been formed for prosecution of his purpose as to his unnoted and selfreapd advantages from meditation study virtue observation courage or experience it had been to disregard the common course of things had i made slight of those restraints which heap up mountains upon mountains to raise bars against unaided merit i durst not under this conviction dream his virtue rash enough to have presumed a glory so unlikely and remote from his supposed pretensions wanting power authority and reputation till the god who had inspired him with adapted qualities impelled em also into action by impression supernatural or to take the story in its literal sense by the apppearance of an angel to encourage him  sect xvi l    be taught replied the unbodyd guest etc  gideon distrusted the reality of so improbable a charge though seemingly derived from heaven because the vastness of its depth was more than he could sound by the short line of human reason the celestial missionary discerned this natural struggle betwixt faith and foresight and removes it by a document included in and made impressive by a miracle  reach me said the angel yon neglected little store of your last nights provision gideon in mere respect to the command complies with it in doubt and wonder at its meaning and that doubt and wonder gave occasion to the angel to enforce the credit of his errand and exact the like implicit reverence to it without bold examinations of its human probability i take the liberty to look on this as the true meaning of the passage in the text for certainly it could not be consistent with the dignity of an ambassador from god to order meat and broth to be poured out upon the rock with that too trivial purpose merely to blow it up that he might vanish in the fire and leave gideon in the smoke  whereas ascending in the flame after delivery of so solemn and authoritative an injunction must have answered fully the majestic view with which it seems to have been done and left the doubter animated into a becoming faith and resolution  sect xx l    oreb a midian prince of warlike fame  too limited a knowledge in things military founded on a superficial observation of the pride and formulary petulancies of disputed rank and querulous exceptions to or emulations of detached commands in modern war will probably object against this place that oreb was a person of too high a quality to lead a party out to lie in ambush for surprise of a small city but i recur to ancient practice and protest against defective testimony  actions of most renown were these surprisals and light ambushes ulysses thus and diomede go out disguised by night as but discoverers of the enemys camp  achilles reproaches agamemnon with his backwardness upon occasions of this nature and we must not bring down gideons days to ours and buckle reason to perversity of will in faulty adulation of mens pride and meaner passions but to make a large step from antiquity which everywhere is crowded with examples modern times have had their proofs that noblest spirits fly above these petty loftinesses marshal montluc in his commentaries prides himself upon appearing personally at the head of all such enterprises and ascribes his whole good fortune which was certainly the longest lasting and the happiest nay indeed the most unmatched and wonderful that ever was recorded to his resolute persisting in this single practice the duke of rohan too in his military work maintains with some degree of anger that it should be questioned that no general who is not prompt by his own presence to promote the execution of these little services can ever bring his soldiers either to that vigilance or that opinion of his valor which are necessary to authority and now of late in our own times we saw good proof of the validity of that french generals remark in the successes of the earl of peterborow overrunning some of the best provinces in spain against the opposition of an army in comparison with which his own might have been well mistaken for his traveling retinue this illustrious kind of victory which men obtain by inbred energy of genius is what properly deserves the name of conquest a power of beating down one force by an opposing equal one can claim no other title but of overthrow  sect xxi l    observed a tottering cliff that loosely hung  aristotle is for the wonderful in poetry by which however i suppose he could not mean that we should disregard the probable in search of the miraculous but if it must be looked upon as reasonable that hector in the twelfth book of homers iliad could throw a stone of weight enough to burst the gate of the greeks fortification before their ships and throw it with such force too as to break the bars in pieces and snap all the iron hinges which thundering stroke had the good fortune to please tasso so surprisingly that he made bold to borrow it for the use of his rinaldo against the temple of jerusalem  if this i say can reasonably be believed it will be no great difficulty for the reader to allow it likelier that oreb should push down a cliff that hung half loose already men who travel on the alps the mountains of switzerland or cross the pyrenees or even among our own scotch alps or welsh ones meet with nothing commoner than such huge craggs broke off from upper rocks and stopped by some protuberating point half over which they hang so loosely and so tottering that a very little impulse from behind would serve to throw em downward though a team or two of oxen would have much ado to move em from a place they lay on horizontally  sect xxii l     ignobly hurl their javlins down in vain  this weapon was a very ancient one in use among most nations though it is now scarce known in europe except only in the turkish part of it they call it there jeritt and are extremely dextrous in its exercise the moors too all through africa retain the use of it and so do the arabians and some nations of east india where it has the name of zagai the hebrew soldiers and great leaders kept em in their hands by way of ornament in time of peace saul threw one of these javelins at jonathan while he sat at table with him it was one of these that joab thrust through absalom they were brought early out of asia into use among the greeks for we find few in homer killed by any other weapon mr pope translated unreflectingly in calling it a spear what graceful image can we form of hector brandishing two spears by spear we are to understand a pike whereas the javelin was but a short staff for casting at a distance the romans called it pilum and became so fond of it that they affected to be thought inventors of its use so much is certain that they met no enemy who used this weapon for what else can lucan mean when in describing the pharsalian war he tells us that piles threatened piles had other nations been so armed this might have been the case in any of their wars but since the use was proper to the romans to say javelins against javelins served as strongly to express a civil war as if he had said romans against romans  the people of rome could not have borrowed it from greece because we find in livy that they used it before any intercourse had yet been opened with that nation and beside the greeks themselves had then disused the javelin and been trained to the egyptian practice of long pikes of four and twenty foot in bodies which consisted of a thousand in the front and sixteen men in file sometimes reduced to only eight in depth the ranks thereby extending to a double length when they would shun the danger of being charged in rear by enemies who might outwing them in this order they composed a firm impenetrable and on plain ground scarce resistible oblong figure called a phalanx where the soldiers armed defensively with helmets tassets corslets brassboots and targets closing ranks and propping and sustaining one another with their pikes presented over the preceding shoulders like the quills of porcupines it is easy to imagine what impression such a wellcompacted weight was capable of making and how firmly it supported charges from an enemy unless where ditches hills or other inequalities of ground disturbed and broke their order into little gaps or intervals at which as in the example of aemilius against perses at the battle of pydna the roman legionary maniples forced entrance and assaulting them in flank with their short swords gained frequent and considerable victories  as to the pilum it is most probable the romans had it with their trojan founders who no doubt brought into italy all weapons they had been accustomed to before their emigration vegetius and polybius both describe this pilum but a little differently as far as can be gathered out of roman tactics it was a staff of weighty wood of four foot long exclusive of the steel one end of it was fastened into this steel head was triangular in length two foot and very sharply edged and pointed so that the whole length of the javelin was about six foot it was largest where remotest from the iron though sometimes they are described as doubleheaded the poizing place for grasp was commonly about an inch and a quarter in diameter  the legionary foot all carried this peculiar missile weapon and could hurl it with surprising aim and force against an enemy the manner of their casting it was thus  when the first rank observed the distance within reach they threw their javelins point blank and sunk immediately upon one knee to give the second rank uninterrupted sight who then threw also and knelt down to give the same advantage to the third and thus when ten whole ranks had thrown successively which was dispatched with an unceasing swiftness and agility they started up together with a general shout drew all their swords at once and so rushed in upon the enemy  what terrible effects have been produced by javelins we have innumerable instances in history but none more worthy notice than that great one at pharsalia where caesar with his usual skill foreseeing that pompeys horse composed of the most warm and fiery spirits of the roman youth of the patrician houses would be endeavoring to fall in upon his rear on that wing where his own few horsemen were exceedingly outreachd by pompeys he placed in oblique line extending from behind the soexposd and threatened flank of cavalry six chosen cohorts of his veteran foot which made about three thousand men and ordered these when they received the squadrons in their coming round upon em to aim all their javelins at the faces only of those gay young chargers it succeeded to his wish the horse came furiously about but starting unexpectedly on this reserve of such experienced wounders were received with so successive showers of javelins in their eyes cheeks necks and foreheads that unable to support the horror of such maimed and miserable faces for the horse had no vantbraces to their helmets they all turned their backs precipitately and disordering their own foot lost pompey that important day and gave the world to caesar  sect    l    then gideon found it prudent to retreat  there is no chance and most especially in war which so effectually and suddenly destroys the interests of men as want of due discernment where to stop in the smooth race of fortune they see nothing but plain bowling way before em and if they ever look behind it is not till their rear is broken in upon there is an eye on every side of prudence and she sees all round her gideon who had so lately gained the outset of his influence by the valor he had shown in the dispute with oreb was to make advantage of the favorable opportunity as he was leader in this hot pursuit and saw that he was followed by his countrymen without regard to consequence he might have pushed the enemy beyond the hill and made considerable slaughter as they passed the river but how there should so disorderly a body have resisted on plain ground the reinforcements coming up to the assistance of the flying enemy in calm debate within himself he found the hope of added glory from the conquest overbalancd by a certainty of losing that already his in case of disappointment and defeat in hazard for it he determines therefore to retreat and guard the safety of the people with him on whose favor he was now to build for all the promise of his future fortune  sect xxvii l    the assembled elders over the city gate  the frequent devastations brought upon the jews first by the princes of the east then by the roman emperors and in all ages since by the resentment and revenge of christian zeal for ever warm against them have so irrecoverably destroyed their records that excepting their remains of law and history preserved in the old testament there can be nothing more obscure than the formalities in civil government observed by this unhappy people their priests who were the sole repositories of their learning faith and ceremonies have been cut off almost to a man in general and commissioned massacres and opportunities which this produced gave room for forgeries and infinite impertinence and superstitious dreamings to their rabbis and their talmudists nor have the christian writers to say truth cleared more from the confusion than appears to have been added to it josephus lived at the same time with christs apostles and is one of our best guides in searches of this nature but besides that he is often not so full as might be wished his countrymen had undergone so many changes before then that ten tribes of the twelve were utterly extirpated and the government and customs of the other two so different in many of their most considerable circumstances from the institutions left by moses that for matters of remote antiquity we cannot safely rest on his authority thus much however may be gathered from his testimony and the hebrew model as remaining in the bible that each city had a senate of her elders that these were generally seven with a levite on each hand for exposition of their law and to record as well as regulate proceedings they sat exactly in the form described the place above the city gate to signify that justice was to guard and circumscribe their habitations these senates of their cities judged all points of right within their districts but were under check of an appeal to capitals of tribes the cause might there be heard again before the prince of that particular tribe who had election also of his city senates lastly from these provincial princes lay appeal in final termination to the sanhedrim but till the general defection altered the mosaic order appeal lay from the sanhedrim to the high priest and his decision was the last and under penalty of death to be submitted to  all which shall be progressively made evident in notes upon the books to follow  sect xxx l  0  were sure designed by heaven for wide control  the accident that had so lately given occasion of applause on gideons bravery returning with a royal prisoner and which had opened to his countrymen an unexpected promise from his virtues is the point of sight in his particular case some one of which men often are placed in by fortune but whence if they have fit discernment to make use of the advantage they find all their future way more easy they dazzle by their sudden splendour and prevent inspection by excess of luster like men who hold darklanterns up before em they present a strong but undistinguishable glare behind which they themselves discern things clearly through the light which makes those blind who look against them  such a light enlarged the influence of gideons virtues it is not from the merit of the truths he has been recommending that the senators derive their warmth of admiration a man to whom such sentiments were natural would doubtless have expressed em many times before when yet they had produced no such effect in favor of the speaker but the case is now grown different it is not to gideon the son of joash their fellow citizen and old acquaintance they have all this while been listening it is to gideon made illustrious by applause and wonder of the people what had been common in the man was grown prodigious in the conqueror and words which were before thought only worth neglect are found by this new light to merit more than admiration  every thing we have heard of every thing we admire will be found upon reflection to have been the gift of opportunity had not lucretias death succeeded to her rape or some equivalent excitement roused the tillthen latent indignation of the roman people into transport brutus would still have been constrained to have kept on his cloak of unexampled dissimulation and the history of his times had wanted one ferocious instance that disguise of passions can consist with the most stern inflexibility  in the same city the same senate and same people who while under hope or fear from pompeys fortune gave consent to all indignities his jealousy could heap on caesar and who with a malignant laziness supposed him in his absence of no longer consequence changed disposition in a moment and had now no ear for any thing but caesar  caesars valor caesars goodness caesars fortune  for they saw all this by the new light his unexpected march to rome had lent em the terrible success of so astonishing a boldness taught em to consider as invincible a courage that could meet such danger with a steady eye and that first daring step drew half the nation from his rivals interest  sect xxxi l     so wandering wide he reached the grove of baal  baal was the sun and ashtaroth the moon at least they were most generally so reputed but concerning these great eastern idols and the different accounts in writers of their forms and modes of worship much more might be noted than could be of use or pleasure here  it will be all the subject calls for to observe that they were generally placed on hills with gloomy groves surrounding them for they were worshipped in the open air because it was supposed presumptuous to confine their gods to temples who were omnipresent and illimitable  therefore when the hebrews as they often did fell off to the idolatry of their nextbordring nations they made them images says scripture and planted groves about em and set up an idol upon every high hill and under every green tree after the abominations of the kingdoms which were round about them  the description of the grove of baal and of the image was to be as full and circumstantial as it could be made first as it was a matter of importance in the story there having really been at ophra such a grove and idol most of the inhabitants and even gideons father seeming to have been its worshipers and secondly as there arose poetical occasion for an ornament from the position figure grove and solemn picture of the hill which commonly was artificial many still remaining in some parts of palestine  sect xxxii l     where can we better virtues race begin  it is with a prophetic spirit gideons zeal transports him in this place the sacred text discovering that the consequences of his cutting down the grove of baal became the means of raising him to a capacity of gathering into one collective body that first military strength to which he owed his own succeeding triumphs and his countrys double rescue from the arms and idols of their enemy  sect xxxiii l     enough for them that it is by gideon meant  from the aid he here receives from the ten slaves whom he had taken in the cave and saved their lives when sentenced by the senate there arises seasonable opportunity to speak a word or two concerning episodes in general they never must deserve the name which horace gives the independent parts of some of his cotemporarys pieces they are instead of the disjecti membra poetae to be found attached as well as beautiful to heap together a wild store of incidents unlooked for and surprising will require but the assistance of a lively fancy to choose which is fit which not this is a business for the judgment there was some time since a sheep with a fine topknot on its head there was a little after an hungarian girl who had a sister growing to her back both these were objects unexpected and surprising but they were however monsters and offensively unnatural they were like the poems of ariosto and i wish i could not add some passages in our great spencers into which a fairy dance of incoherent light adventures of the most romantic model possible  if we except the tales in the arabian nights unmatchable extravagancies  crowded on and wedged themselves without connection cause or consequence all loose and separate in their natures and yet rammd together by the impulse of the poets spirit in reading such a poem i imagine it like looking down upon a sea where long successions of huge surges after surges foaming from all quarters without point of view to rest upon move horror though at the same time they strike with a wild kind of wonder something like delight the whole amuses the attention nothing leads it in particular a regular epic poet draws along the mind as rivers do the sight however strong the current and the course though vast and winding yet the flow itself is orderly the force confined within its banks and if it takes in episodical brooks it is to deepen not divide its chanel  should therefore this deliverance of the slaves have purposed nothing further than to set off gideon and display his generosity the contrivance had been flat and wanted the characteristic of an epic episode for while it could not be discerned that it had any influence toward advance of the main action the reader would have thought their history too inconsiderable to atone for the digression they misled him into but the interest of these honest men becomes entitled to our whole attention and concern as soon as we observe that from their gratitude an action is derived that gives foundation to the great one purposed by the poem and reflect that no men less obliged could have been drawn to a participation in so menacing a danger  it is probable in actual truth that these ten servants who the text says aided gideon in the night for fear of the inhabitants of ophra and the rest of their own family were persons whom he had engaged to his particular interest by effect of some uncommon obligation it being impossible they should not have foreseen the uproar and resentment which attended their presumption and no ordinary temptation had prevailed on men of their exposed condition to provoke so visible a hazard  it is the same again in that next episode where the defeat of orebs party and his being made a prisoner was not introduced to give a proof of gideons bravery but from effect of its exertion to possess him of the public admiration i repeat the observation though already noted to imprint remembrance of this not to be dispensed with requisite in episodes that they produce and make each other necessary and contribute all to the completion of the epic action  sect xxxv l   and    on the hissing flame poured the warm blood i purposely abridge the ceremonial rites of sacrifice not only as the formal apparatus for and practice in em all  burntofferings peace offerings sin offerings and the rest may be particularly found in the mosaic writings but as gideon in so unforeseen a call to the occasion could not be expected to have come prepared for the formalities nor was he vested for it with the right of priesthood and he knew sufficiently by the direction he proceeded under that his offering could need no punctuality to render it acceptable  but over and above all this there cannot be denied to rise offensive images from a too long detail of cutting up of beasts washing their bowels broiling the fat and such carnific circumstances i consent with all my heart to lord roscommons notion of this matter  for who without a qualm has ever looked on holy garbage though by homer cooked take foul descriptions in which light you will if like they nauseate if unlike they are ill sect xxxvii l    from the tough trunks big bulk backbounding blows recoil i hope i need not apprehend this line in danger to be looked upon as guilty of more roughness than it very well can justify from what was touched in a preceding note concerning the assimilation of the sound to the described idea but as the hard rebound is owing here to the selected monosyllables i ought to add in their defense that used with any choice or care they are a beauty and advantage and both tune our language and enrich it i will wish no plainer proof in favor of than mr pope has brought against them  and ten low words often creep in one dull line by the way creep through had better answered his intention than creep in but if it had not been for our abundant choice of monosyllable words how then could mr pope have imitated with so beautiful a force the very fault he was exposing the truth is it is not a long string of such short words that makes verse jar upon the ear  short syllables when they are words may by judicious intermixture of the vowels with the consonants succeed each other with as smooth a cadence as can syllables which are but parts of words  the studied roughness in this verse of mr popes arises only from a refluent reluctance of its accents to concur in that insertion into one another which is necessary to make words harmonious i could show a thousand monosyllable lines in mr drydens and great numbers too in mr popes own poems than which nothing can be capable of a more exquisite smoothness  it is easy to derive the same proof even from blank verse and milton where it seems least reasonable to suppose too nice a care of softness from selection of his syllables  in eves reproach of adam for example paradise lost the ninth book  why should be mean me ill or seek to harm she speaks it of the devil and the author therefore will be scarce conceived to have endeavored this sweet flow of monosyllables verse composed so never carries roughness where due care is taken that the syllables are heavily or lightly accented in just proportion to the sense they move with but in mr popes the words are purposely so chosen that each syllable requires emphatical expansion and in that case there can be no music for the very reason that makes difference betwixt the tolling out one bell and ringing a whole belfry  i have omitted a short note which ought to have been placed in the beginning the reader will observe i commonly make choice of the appellative hebrews  the word israelite is no more fit for poetry than children of israel to have called em jews had been a visible absurdity since that was a posterior name on their reduction to two tribes and the exclusive kingdom of judah only the other ten tribes till their final extirpation owned no name but their original one of israel their general appellative among the bordering aliens seems to have been hebrews which effectually includes em all and was derived to em from heber sixth in ascent from abraham and second from arphaxad noahs grandson  gideon or the patriot book ii i twas morning and over ophras towers the sun rose lovely with unusual luster bright for pleased to find the longwishd task begun his fires glowed sparkling with intense delight but gideon well reflecting what was done restless had mused away the tedious night and from a gardens silent shade looked longing for the light there joash risen from interrupted rest found and breathed blessings over his pensive son and now by wonder now by fear oppressed heard all distinctly from the angels hail to the groves ruin and the fall of baal ii gideon said he prop of my failing years if what thy fathers doubtful love shall speak should seem too coldly weighed too kindly weak think in excuse of what may harsh appear youth is too full of hope and age of fear he paused and turned and dried a starting tear it is great continued he this thirst of fame bright though dangerous is the flame that warms thy manly breast with this extensive aim but art thou not deceived by some fair dream things strongly wished men often believe they see for vigorous fancy can so subtly seem that nonexistence may be thought to be if twas in truth an angel thou have

from the tower led winding down the hill gideon descending with eductive skill steers his companion twixt the mazy rocks and the deep cleavings of the hill unlocks darkning and cool beneath thincumbent shade of goatbrowzd bushes which in sylvan state bowed by their own declining weight hung deepning over the ragged cliffs and in the breezes played a short unpeopled path their feet

the waystopd vessel rides and scarce with all her bellying sails thencircling roar divides xi safe to thexpecting camp at last they come where waiting all thassembled chiefs they found there did joys liveliest ecstasies abound and false congratulation too bowed formal to the ground from every side at once the thundering drum beat his hoarse welcome while in shriller sound the trumpets soft and trembling note flowed undulating round white on a smooth and gently rising hill full in the center of the camp was pitched one crowned pavilion of unmatched extent lined with an azure field of silk by crimson groves enriched whence gold and purple fruits in clusters bent fed the charmed eye with feastful ornament three walls of circly green the imperial tent guarded at equal distances invest wide

conscious glow his manly breast girt by a purple silverstudded belt in which his fated sword at freedom hung while at each step his arm was gently swung the lowpoizd spear majestic seemed to nod and

his silver chariot rides shining far and seated high four milkwhite coursers with hotpanting sides vexed to be curbed and struggling with the rein draw him disdainful over the smoking plain this

spread behind close the gay march and with elated mind lift their high standards to the following wind happy arabias aromatic plains stretch their sweet bosoms where this monarch reigns there the rich hills a gummy harvest shed and myrrh and frankincense the groves overspread even from their beasts a musky vapor flows and the spicebreathing wind with amorous softness blows from their broad heaths wild thyme and camomil their coarsest air with breezy fragrance fill physics wide want this druggy tract supplies let the sick elephant lie down to roll from the crushed couch balsamic odours rise and the snuffd scent revives his savage soul xxix as when some sudden news alarms a state of threatening consequence and full of fear all meaner cares and themes suspended wait while this alone does worth regard appear but when by slow degrees the rumor dies and thoughtrecovring crowds expect no more each to his proper task his care applies and all is hushed and languid as before so while the prince and gideon heard the noise and saw the swarmy legions passing by no other sound their hurried ear employs no other object fills their busy eye but now the army past the sound scarce heard and each changed prospect rolled in dust away pleased they observe the plains about em cleared the cheerful birds above their chariot play and nature smiling round em stilly gay then oreb rising from his chariotseat beckning gave sign to a wellmounted band which shadowed by a groves serene retreat at distance waited their loved chiefs command sudden they move and closing in behind the prince reseated shakes the loosened rein fleet his horses as the wind with sounding hoofs fly rapid over the plain xxx while to the guarded mountains barred ascent their eyedirected way they bent to gideon thus the generous oreb spoke since my illustrious friend declines to take such due returns as grateful sense would make and merits honor but for virtues sake what shall i do to show him my regard of greatness i confess above reward it must be left to time and chance to find some vast occasion for my thanks designed till when the debt must rest unpaid to load my struggling mind mean while and there he from his finger drew a ring that glittered with a dazzling ray from the most radiant gem that ere in orient quarries grew wear this  in memory but of what i owe and that i mean to pay xxxi gideon longpressd at last averse gave way and smiled with thankful grace when hid below on the hills side appeared a hebrew band which by the late attempt instructed well under a wary chiefs command took place the night before to watch what passed and future mischief in thadvance repel these gideon saw and from the chariot stepped swift after him prince oreb leapt and with a zealous warmth of heart embraced then courteous took his leave and all in haste remounting turned his horses towered the host and reached it soon and foremost shone conspicuous in his post gideon or the patriot book iii i while to the host his way prince oreb bent and urged his flying coursers over the plain gideon climbed slow the mountains steep ascent oppressed with thought and anxious for the event deep he revolved with soulafflicting pain what strange success had crowned his first intent crowned with success in vain should the chief labor of his hope imperfect still remain the foe removed might soon receive alarm and doubly fierce return should israel arm well had he marked and weighed their dreadful skill their countless numbers their rapacious will and all their fine and varied arts to kill how should dejected israel then make head who should effectual summons spread or did they meet how hopeless still they would by him be led much he reflected on the generous aid of orebs friendship mixing hope with pain for while zalmunnas barbarous pride he weighed zebs avarice agags caution zebahs rage wisdoms cool doubt awakened sad presage that one mans truth might leave dependence vain where fraudful numbers joined averse its influence to restrain distracted thus amid the hurried sway of crosscoursd passions clashingly combined deeply perplexed he climbed his pensive way and now despairing human schemes resigned now thought of heaven and left all doubt behind ii but while in midians camp his active thought had wisely laboring traced his countrys good his countrys sons by no such virtue taught with equal ardour their own bliss withstood for mid thoermantling stillness of the night while gideon late had hewed the groves vast oak the priest of baal who on the mountains side cavernd in solitary silence dwelt heard the loud echoes bound from each bold stroke which the trunk repugnant felt saw the fierce flame revolve its blazy light whirled through the gloom and trembling to his sight scarce his astonished soul believed thalarming witness which his senses bore fearing yet longing to be undeceived thapparent truth still nearer to explore cautious he climbed the hill with quivering knees there safe behind the shade of sheltry trees chilled with amazement he had stood and watched while gideon and his faithful ten their daring task dispatched iii but when the pious hebrew left the place and silent horror over the ruin reigned soft the priest with timorous pace crept from his covert now no more restrained and ghastly gazing over the naked ground on which the dying embers faintly shined viewed the accomplished desolation round there when no remnant of his god he found soulfreezing horror icd his coward mind bathed in the dewdrenchd darkness of the night trembling he stood unmand with inward dread if an owl screamd he started into fright and shrunk from every sighing wind that skimmd his palsyd head slow the pressed ground beneath him seemed to rise gradual a groan broke mournful from below outrolld a dusky form that brushed his eyes and gliding upward ceased not still to grow huge as the oak it rose from it appeared and its vast reach unmeasurably reared deathlike it raised an arm but half revealed for ambient clouds the shadowy dart concealed two ghastly meteors lost within its head with embry glare pald over its spectry eyes sicklying the sable with a bloodshot red whose glimmry semblance in appearing dies nothing distinct was seen yet each dark part moved in convul sive writhe and seemed to smart iv this was the guardian demon of the grove who against superior power too weakly strove forced from his charge in tortured shame withdrew but now reproachful vaunted over the view  wretch too unmindful of my shrine and me why have thou suffered this atrocious deed trusting thy vigilance and piety thee my groves sacred guardian i decreed myself from care of my own altar freed but by thy absence or neglect betrayed rising i find my holy hill profaned days influent range supplants my favorite shade burnt is my image and my honor stained but one way now can thou perdition shun and scape the eternal anguish of my hate detested gideon this bold act has done go while he dares new mischiefs meditate go rouse the faithful ministers of fate drag him expelled from the cursed citys gate headlong go hurl him over the mountains brow so expiate ophras guilt and save the state from highdoomd vengeance that oerhangs it now this not performed presume no more to raise altars or groves to my insulted praise unexpiated sins move heaven in vain go act my sentence  or my rage sustain v so threatening mounted on a flash he rose and in a peal of thunder towrd away kindling behind an arch of sulphur flows and streaks his passage with a trail of day far from the mount with gradual slope he fell and lightning downward sought his native hell thus when in war the deathembowelld ball slants upward over some hostile mark to fall in fiery curve thexploded mischief flies and sweeps thicksparkling through the measured skies till on the destined point its weight declines and bursting broad with flashful force for circly ruin shines who can describe the pangs which now oppressed the panting heathens superstitious breast awed and unsould beneath the unruly fright still his ears echoed to the groans of night still the thin phantom skimmd before his sight wildly devout and stung by frantic zeal swift to the remnant of the hallowed oak fearful with wideextended arms he ran in pious pity the mourned trunk to clasp weep its dry wounds and warm em with his grasp so tired with ecstasy and toiled with dread while his agewasted spirits flowed away down sunk the sleepattracted sages head and senseless as his oak supine he lay vi there while he slept unconscious what was done high over his weakness rose the smiling sun when joash mindful of the grove overthrown entering the town with wise and early care anxious to make its motive timely known found the sought senate close assembled there of these eliakim with fruitless pain had long regretted israel left by god long had he viewed her rashness with disdain and traced destruction in the paths she trod yet taught by pity to attemper zeal patient he waited some adaptive chance that might contribute balm her wounds to heal and her true interest to his hopes advance he lately busying many a trusty scribe in secret correspondence practiced well had one charged levite drawn from every tribe safely such schemes to ponder and prescribe as dangerous distance made it rash to tell chiefly he wished more weight in levis scale conscious that freedom must with faith prevail but little guessed he midst his cool design how god on gideon had vouchsafed to shine less dreamt he of the idol grove destroyed or what new wonders his vast views employed even now deputed from the sacred race twelve aweful delegates commissioned came men of high wisdom and distinguished grace propelld by pulsive heaven beyond their aim now first in ophras senate taking place they learnt from joash what that night was done learnt how an angel had inspired his son baals consecrated altar to destroy learnt with astonishment too strong for joy that with commissioned flame his shining hand would rise his countrys blazing soul and free thillumind land vii while they yet listening weighed thalarming tale the awakened priest with loud complaint rushed in roared the hot wrath of violated baal and urged due vengeance on the alldamning sin the wise assembly heard in dumb disdain yet scarce contained the warmth with which they glowed but now cool caution they to prudence owed the peoples zeal they knew was fierce and blind hence outward marks of purer fire restrain till faiths raised torch might apt effulgence find grave joash slowly rising from his seat soft to the impatient priest this answer made no more thus loud thy boisterous prayer repeat heard were thy words and shall be duly weighed no son of mine i think has yet been known actor of any deed he dared not own gideon returning charge him to his face we but for justice hold this aweful place viii it is as i feared thoutrageous voice replied guilt has its judges on its side and by thabettors of his crime the offender must be tried o baal dread power distinguish in thy rage thou should not can not thus provoked thy purchased wrath assuage let it but on thy foes these foes be bent nor with the guilty strike the innocent speaking he beats his quivering breast his priestly vestments rends and madly frantic to the streets with outstretchd arms descends there on his head the gathered dust he threw and round him wide thinquiring rabble drew to every listner he repeats his tale tells the gods wrath and aggravates the deed dwells on the dreadful apparition seen varies his accents and his looks and trembles often between the frighted multitude their fate bewail howl to the priest with baal to intercede and from his vengeance them and theirs to screen loud and more loud the rising tumult grew at length all ranks into itself it drew and roaring wild outswelld control and order overthrew so into towns besieged some stormy night a mischiefguided fireball secret falls it kindles first some roof remote from sight thence breaks augmented over the bordring walls contiguous houses catch the infectious flame which towering upward meets the wafting wind then driven from street to street with hungry aim over the whole range in blazing sheets inclined broad wasters unresisted passage find loud into gathered rage the mingled fires combining curl to heaven with twisted spires united help to quench now vainly aims and crackling ruin the wide woe proclaims ix alarmed by frequent and increasing shouts and terrified by dread of vulgar rage the shocked assembly sat involved in doubts measuring slow means the tumult to assuage till wise eliakim reflecting well that popular distaste to soothing arts remits thintemprance of transported hearts chose rather to prevent than to repel down to the noisedistracted streets he ran where by the generous love of peace inspired feebly with faint advance the good old man whelmed in the torrent of the press began to cool those passions which the priest had fired often in vain he strove to speak thunlistning rabble drowned his voice in roar tottering and pushed by age and anguish weak with staggring steps and arms upraisd he labored to implore sometimes the dumbly sullen multitude awed by his presence their wild shouts forbore then suddenly again grew loud and rude and swelled to stormier madness than before so on the angry orients raised degrees some bark untimely trusts repugnant seas to the black whirlwind shifts her heedful helm careful to rise with every climbing sweep which met transversely would her side overwhelm and plunge her foundring in the foamy deep now shocks her surgestruck stern now shakes her head there while she stays checked motionless and dead loud over her quarter roars with deafning sound some sidelong blast that whirls her dreadful round now for awhile the slackning wind gives way and murmuring seas her answered helm obey then all at once newwakd again the madning tempests roar deluge aloft her covered decks and wash her topmasts over so fared eliakim on every side oppressed and floated with the shouldring tide now shortlived silence listened to his prayer now thickning clamor stormed his ear and stunned him to despair x joash who weighed his interest in the event marks and adopts eliakims distress following he seconds the good seers intent fast after him the reverend elders press and the twelve levites all descend to try their joint address awed by such strongcombind authority the crowd whom one mans influence failed to sway give back when they the united congress see and falling off by slow degrees melt murmuring away but restless in his idols cause to fail all day from house to house the priest of baal with laboring malice urged the menaced fate that lourd incumbent over the guilty state paintive he shaped a thousand fansyd woes woes by their angry deity resolved should they relaxed his known command oppose and in the offense unpunished fall involved xi night came and with a strong and sudden blaze the smothered embers into contact fanned furious broke out and shot rekindling rays that flashed destruction round on every hand gathering with swords and clubs and spears and staves hoarse as a sea the rising rabble meets with all its tongues at once the monster raves and with the roar of rapine shakes the streets like some new breach too slightly stopped in haste and pild and turfd to bar the watery waste at first effective the short hope is tried the bank triumphant checks thassaulting tide but while with dimply smile the current glides and edging on with treacherous smoothness slides the sapping moisture mines the work below and trickling gradual eats and pierces slow then gathering strength it flotes the soaky mound loosens the piles and heaves em from the ground and all the bank gives way at once  and all the fields are drowned xii eliakim who judged the peoples rage would to the house of joash drive their aim found his precautious hint no vain presage thither baals priest directs the kindled flame but near each portal and the hall of state a faithful guard in martial order placed often as the rabble pressed withstood their weight broke and repulsed em and vindictive chased often thus dispersed often making head again in ebbs and flows of noise the night was spent varying from hopes to fears with pensive pain the senate listening watched the unsure event as men wellhousd in wintry storms of rain hear from without the showry tempest rise now in calm interval the wind blows low and soft and short suspensions hush the skies then the big blasts and sluicy drifts hoarse and impetuous grow and the strained beams in swelling gales groan conscious from below the morning came and crossed the senates hope which promised peace with the returning light but day restored restored the rebel scope of headstrong range that had been curbed by night for now grown bolder by their number seen fierce on the guarded hall thassaulters press the deeprangd soldiers firmly stretched between in warlike posture each tried pass possess here had contention drawn a crimson flood and civil fury stained her face with blood but mild eliakim who coolly dared whose heart at once was cautious and prepared from a high gallry faced the raging crowd taught em by speechless signs how madness erred then gathering distant round they grew less loud while the loved sage thus charmed the gaping herd xiii alas  what frenzy my misguided sons transports your honest but impatient minds mistaking zeal when it thus blindly runs never the path to reason finds furious revenge toils hard for fruitless ends he must not cannot fall whom god defends oh be advised fear heaven not baal my friends cursed as we are but for this idol baal let not the idols priest prevail now ere redemptions opening path is trod twere an ill time to offend a pardning god gideon  if him these rash resolves pursue not uncommissiond sins black grove destroyed great are the wonders he was born to do your faiths redeemer and your freedoms too blast not the promised blessing unenjoyd nor doubt his triumph since by heaven employed pensive of late beneath his fathers oak a shining angel from the opening sky descending near him gods great purpose spoke god spoke  hear heavens decree proclaimed from high israel requires him and he shall not die xiv he ceased to speak and the awesilencd throng gaze on each other with repentant air some bow their heads in conscious shame some gape with stupid stare some weep some pray but all for peace declare baals priest observed it disconcerted long at last determined crafts whole force to try loud he broke out with a reproachful eye  is baal grown powrless since his grove was felled or by their formless fansyd god expelled that ye thus lightly lose your generous aim and start and tremble at an empty name were only israels natives blessed with eyes are all the mightier nations round us blind where dwells this sad sole sovereign of the skies whose house no people but the hebrews find greater than baal since he pretends to be why fled we from their arms who worship baal sure such a proud unpartnerd power as he might lend his votries victory if to inferior gods you must not bow let this supreme one save you now if boastful gideon has an angel seen never let his party baals resentment fear since gods arm stays him who can step between why flies he tumults if his call was clear follow me bravely well the truth explore if by our hands he falls we cut short sin and baal shall frown no more but if his gods protection walls him in and from doomed vengeance his cursed head secures perish even baal and gideons god be yours xv he paused and the willwavring multitude awed and hushed but just before found their first purpose suddenly renewed and burst assentive into savage roar thus over the blasted heath where storms have blown the light thin thistly breathobeying down hangs on the air a plaything for the wind moves to each breeze and can no balance find now softsustaind sinks indolently slow now rises rapid on the gale and leaves the birds below aptly the priest in choice of season learned the smiling moments opening dawn discerned from the next hand he snatched a glittering spear haste to the contest each brave soul said he gideon and baal dispute for israels fear whose power is greatest come resolved to see let his god fight for him and mine for me xvi so threatening to a posterngate with speed he led the way and after rushed the throng that gate he knew was watched with slackened heed for when of late the crowd swept thence along with vowed resolve the senates wall to force its guard offcalld to stem distractions course swiftquitting that outpost had marched away prompt for defense where likeliest danger lay by this new chance surprised the gate gave way through the wide arch with thronged and boisterous sway pours the mad multitude in shouting swarms with horrid faces wildly mixed and ragecollected arms fierce over the mountain raves the impatient throng and with the rush of ruin roars along sicilian aetna thus eruption makes when melted sulphur swells her smoaky lakes through the broad mouth out burst the flaming tides and roll their blazy torrents down her sides rampant the fiery streams unchaneld flow and scorching dreadful burn up woods and ride the plains below xvii joash who heard his house designed for prey thither protective winged his timely way there while with vows and prayers bestowed in vain he urged his friends th approaches to maintain gideon appeared returning from the plain to meet him trembling at his sight the tender father flies tells the near danger  and with watery eyes thus the safe counsel of his love applies go fated youth return thy ruin shun never till now did i thy presence hate pity thy fathers fears too daring son nor to his load of woes add thou the weight to make him witness of thy dreadful fate while he yet spoke the noise grew near and loud and rising dust proclaimed tharriving crowd gideon observed it and with pious care thus generous interrupts his fathers prayer reverend and wise whose wishes give me laws fear were dishonest in a freemans cause god though a weak and worthless hand he chose forbids his soldier to avoid his foes let em come on they who in numbers trust raise towry models  but they build with dust he ceased  but joash hopeless of relief hung on his neck with speechless tears and looked persuasive grief xviii gideon who held the multitude in view closed his sad fathers pale and trembling hand in his brave brothers who so charged withdrew housed in safe post to make defensive stand then faced the crowd chose a conspicuous place and stood the great protector of his race as when arabian hunters in full cry run down the timorous stag with preyful eye if turning short amid some winding way they start a lion grimly couched for prey sudden the dogs shoot wide and cowring low creep trembling backward and their chase forego so the transported and tumultuous throng hot in their rage and rushing wild along when unexpectedly they gideon saw fell off confounded and oppressed with awe god had impressed him with a stamp divine and over his features beamed an aweful shine backning they gazed at distance on his face admired his posture and confessed his grace his right hand grasped his planted spear with nervd and manly pride his left bent careless rested on his side halffrownd his brow resentive wrath to feign but his keen eye smiled cold with sharp disdain sudden the priest of baal who stood most near felt his joints loosen with resistless fear and dropped insensibly his useless spear the pitying hero marked the crouds surprise and slow disarmed the rigor of his eyes yet with reproachful air the silence broke  and with high voice and aweful mien to the mixed people spoke xix bloodthirsty wasters of your fathers fame haughty midst woes and wanton even in shame why stop you short why cools your threatening flame your souls are worthy of your aim baseness by nature must all danger hate well add you therefore your whole coward weight to crush a worth you dare not imitate yet whence could all this waste of anger flow did it to baal profaned such transport owe weak is his godhead if sustained by you why does not baal the foes of baal subdue omniscience sure like his the offender knew why did he not prevent him too rash fools  by blind and feeble zeal betrayed are men their gods protectors made shall baal who could not save himself find power to give you aid oh what a different god your fathers knew no help from earth our great jehovah drew from his own hand his blastful lightnings flew the dreadful truth when impiously denied proud corah dathan and abiram tried leagued against moses  and misled like you while they in him his god and theirs defied deep in the swallowing earths wide yawn overwhelmed with fire they died no passive baal unprompt in his own cause stood the dread founder of your laws when warranting success to joshuas arms even at the horns unfeard alarms strong jericho in trembling horror falls and israel entered her at ease led over her prostrate walls was it baals hand that baneful to your foes to timestretchd slaughter doomed collected force held back twelve hours the impatient steeds of night and on the suns declining track poured floods of lengthening light ungrateful stubborn illdiscerning men why are you now less blessed than were your fathers then reigns amalek more powerful in your land than when you chased him over his native sand but four of midians kings remain our foes five against meek and ageworn moses rose twelve thousand hebrews those five kings oerthrew these four base difference twelve whole tribes pursue dream you that moabs present chiefs excel that eglon who by ehuds poniard fell or will your unmanned race in bondage wait till some brave woman rise to save the state some second debrah skilful to inspire and warm our heartless sex with female fire go  since you burn with such resistless rage go in this bravry and your foes engage late when at hand their shadowy legions lay when on yon plain with your best plunder gay full in your sight they shared your flocks in prey and led your wives and infants slaves away then was a time this fury to display but you for warier charge reserved your fire to no such dangerous victries you aspire basely secure from the proud foe you fly and those who would efface your shame ingloriously defy xx he paused  for conscious guilt with terror mixed oppressed the awed and speechless multitude in murmuring wonder they had first been fixed but silent expectation now ensued when panting breathless twixt their haste and fear the reverend elders who pursued the crowd brought up the sacred twelve  these now drawn near thimpressive voice of gideon sweetly loud wafted his charmful music to their ear then with impatient rapture fired through the moved throng they pressed on the young hero laid their hands and his great purpose blessed loud prayers and praise to favoring heaven addressed  to heaven that reassumd lost israels care and shot bright prospect through her dark despair xxi baals priest by slow degrees with straining eyes waked into reason and repelled surprise much his recovring thought revolved the fright that over his soul rose cold at gideons sight fain would he still conclude his vision true yet wondered then whence his confusion grew and why if baal inspired his breast he had not armed it too dim burnt his zeal while checked by conscious awe the reverend levites purer flame he saw his taper formed for gross and gloomy night absorbed in days more powerful shine lost half its trembling light at length exerting force to speak his doubt thus his faint diffidence was murmured out much i applaud brave youth your generous aim yet ah beware lest ardent thirst of fame disguise ambition with religions name great was this god if what we hear from you and what was heard by our dead fathers too be not far more traditional than true these wonders ages past pretend so known why are they not to us poor suffrers shown ask baals believers they of baal unfold potent past trophies pompously enrolled but one new proof would more convince than all the uncertain old he said and pleased concurrence caught his voice the crowd the impression of his doubt receive let gideons god they cried now own his choice give us one miracle and we believe xxii thindignant hero marked thunfaithful cry but all unable to comply pausingly thoughtful rolled his angry eye strait  from a bushy covert near behind rushed a grim lion furious after prey to rend some sheep the hungry beast designed from a fair flock which there at pasture lay high over his back his tail turned upward waved rough and thorntangled hung his shaggy main his lank sides pining missed the food he craved red were his eyes and sparkled on the plain he saw the press and with discovring stare stood fixed awhile in savage glare then with a roar that shook the mountain round sprung on and like a tempest swept the ground this was a lion that for many a year had in the craggy hills dark borders lain and filling all the neighboring towns with fear was hunted often in vain by the swift horsemen late encamped on jezreels grassy plain by frequent danger taught to shun the vale where in times past his hunger had been fed hardpinching heavnsent want did now prevail and led him searchful to the mountains head xxiii the frighted flock alarmed together rise and bleating helpless skip in crowds away fierce in pursuit the greedy savage flies and while amid the multitude they for protection stray the crowd as much alarmed as they roll over each other a promiscuous prey close before gideons feet with joyful roar the leaping lion stretched his paws and one poor bleater tore back stepped the hero and grasped hard his lance and watched with lifted arm his next advance thou shall not safe return said he that dare presume thus near in spoil of innocence to shake off fear sudden he saw the beast in act to rise and swift as thunder downward aimed a wound deep through the monsters gaping throat the buried weapon flies vindictive fires flashed lightning from his eyes half an imperfect roar its passage found and the nailed monster quivering beat the ground xxiv the ravished people their applauses shout and every busy tongue its wonder told to the dead lion gathering wide about thextended monster they with joy behold astonished at an act so timely bold gideon just then with glowing foresight fired stooped by directive heaven inspired and round him from the deathdisorderd ground gathered a snowwhite woolly fleece the lions paws had spread then freed his spear from the retentive wound and wiping off the ensanguind red wreathed in a soft and milky roll the lances shining head approach ye stubborn infidels said he ye who are lions where but sheep you see and timorous sheep where ye should lions be once more that god who set your fathers free unworthy as you are will let yoa know that israel penitent may prosperous grow xxv this said in his left hand he took the lance and held it with its woolly crown erect then raised his aweful right with slow advance and bowed his rnee to heaven with deep respect dumb the still multitude attentive gazed hushed expectant and amazed while gideon thus invoked that god who his new hope had raised thou sacred high unutterable name to whom lost israel owed her ancient fame from whose just anger flows her present shame pity thy devious peoples hardened hearts grossly deceived by hells too busy arts let some strong influence force em to believe what their soul sees not let their sense conceive if by thy servants weak and worthless hand thou will save israel and her power increase let showry rains descend at thy command and nothing dry remain but this soft fleece xxvi scarce the powerful prayer was spoke when from the west a startling thunder broke continuous and advancing still more strong gradual it rolled its lengthening burst along fast after it black gathering clouds arise and circling dusky sadden all the skies first a weak wind with hollow faintness sings and shakes soft moisture from its sleepy wings now the wet breeze with more collected force thickens its breath and blows direct and hoarse then the big drops in drowning fierceness fall and rushing rains come driving over all rebounding torrents the hard surface dash and smoking floods the darkened mountain wash the people turn their faces from the shower and on their backs feel the broad catract pour gideon mean while upon the rising ground in a bright ring the heavntaught floods surround on him no straggling drop presumes to fall for over his fleece a sunresembling ball rolls guardful round to slope the shower away and shows him glittering in abstracted day behold ye unbelieving souls he cried see what a god you have defied and learn from this who fights henceforth on happy israels side the people shout to heaven their raging joys and baals priest trembling sickens at the noise xxvii once more my god cried gideon yet once more indulge the varied sign their doubts implore call off these rains unflote the deluged ground  and when all else is round me dry wet let the fleece be found the almighty heard and swift as rapid thought reverted showers to heaven are caught the beamy sun again shoots down his rays and burns restored with a triumphant blaze the flaming air ejects irradiate heat and crossflashd lightnings in descending meet as when some sudden whirlwinds circly sweep drives the light straws and lifts each scattering heap smoothing the surface in its winding way so the keen radiance curvd and quivering round mazy and wanton in its varied play curls its flashed progress over the hissing ground and closeadhering to the steamy soil with its blue tongues licks up the flood and works with fiery toil the fleece mean while which swelling moisture fills the raptured crowd behold with glowing souls from its soft sides a trickling stream distills and down the hill in a thin current rolls this when they saw they on their faces fell struck with an awe which hope could scarce repel they felt a painmixd joy they could not tell but in joint voice with general ardor fired lead us they cried thou chief by heaven inspired govern our state for under thy command ophra first blessed shall bless thawakning land thus was the peoples voice the voice of god gideon smiled graceful with assentive nod on to the town said he assembled there these reverend sages shall my purpose share aid my endeavors and divide my care xxviii opening they move mid triumphs wildest noise ungovernably wanton in their joys baals priest still foremost leads the shouting throng converted to the other best extreme leaping and turning as he passed along the praise of israels god was now his theme next came the mixed and swarming multitude with all their tongues and all their hands employed long trains of dust their peopled path pursued then was a short respectful space left void for the charmed elders two preceding two amongst these the good eliakim oerjoyd often turned the following heros face with new delight to view armed with his fleecy spear distinguished far gideon adorned his happy fathers side now burst oerjoyd from his domestic bar and filled with all a parents virtuous pride near after gideon the twelve levites came their eyes on heaven in reverend wonder bent their souls contemplatively fired with gods decreed intent last marched the soldiers ranged in lengthening band these from the city had pursued the throng hastening their menaced fury to withstand but charmed now hail the event of purposed wrong guard back their loudacknowlegd lord and martial moved along xxix ophra regained to council they ascend senate and legates share divided place moony they round their great delivrer bend who fills the center with majestic grace mild from his eyes the radiant fire to chase a smile of soft humanity unbends his placid face as when by night through some still forests walks a swain from whom his favorite child has strayed twixt the dark shrubs in listening silence stalks and joyful starts at every rustling shade breathless turns short attentive to the wind and hopes in every whistling breeze an infants cry to find so tender and so still when gideon spoke thexpecting audience swallowed every word no breathing sigh the solemn silence broke and scarce an airsuspended atom stirred xxx fathers of israel we
