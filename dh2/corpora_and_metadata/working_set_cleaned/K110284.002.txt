the gentle throng with liquid lay and melting song the listening herd around him strayed in wanton frisk the lambkins played and every naiad ceased to lave her azure limbs amid the wave the graces danced the rosy band of smiles and loves went hand in hand and purple pleasures strewn the way with sweetest flowers and every ray of each fond muse with rapture fired to glowing thoughts his breast inspired the hills rejoiced the valleys rung all nature smiled while shenstone sung verses by  vol ii  edinburg at the apollo press by the martins anno       the poetical works of william shenstone

art flown it vails not whether muse or grace with tempting smile frequent the place i sigh for thee alone age not forbids thy stay thou yet might act the friendly part thou yet might raise this languid heart why speed so swift away thou scornst the cityair i breathe fresh gales over furrowed ground yet have not thou my wishes crowned o false o partial fair i plunge into the wave and though with purest hands i raise a rural altar to thy praise thou will not deign to save amid my wellknown grove where mineral fountains vainly bear thy boasted name and titles fair why scorns thy foot to rove thou hearst the sportsmans claim enabling him with idle noise to drown the muses melting voice and fright the timorous game is thought thy foe adieu ye midnight lamps ye curious tomes mine eye over hills and valleys roams and deals no more with you is it the clime you flee yet midst his unremitting snows the poor laponians bosom glows and shares bright rays from thee there was there was a time when though i scorned thy guardian care nor made a vow nor said a prayer i did not rue the crime who then more blessed than i when the glad schoolboys task was done and forth with jocund sprite i run to freedom and to joy how jovial then the day what since have all my labors found thus climbing life to gaze around that can thy loss repay were thou alas but kind methinks no frown that fortune wears nor lessened hopes nor growing cares could sink my cheerful mind whatever my stars include what other breasts convert to pain my towering mind should soon disdain should scorn  ingratitude repair this mouldering cell and blessed with objects found at home and envying none their fairer dome how pleased my soul should dwell temperance should guard the doors from room to room should memory stray and ranging all in neat array enjoy her pleasing stores  there let them rest unknown the types of many a pleasing scene but to preserve them bright or clean is thine fair queen alone to a lady of quality fitting up her library      ah what is science what is art or what the pleasure these impart ye trophies which the learned pursue through endless fruitless toils adieu what can the tedious tomes bestow to sooth the miseries they show what like the bliss for him decreed who tends his flock and tunes his reed say wretched fancy thus refined from all that glads the simplest hind how rare that object which supplies a charm for too discerning eyes the polished bard of genius vain endures a deeper sense of pain as each invading blast devours the richest fruits the fairest flowers sages

nigh why then does reason seem so fair why learning then deserve our care who can unpleasd your shelves behold while you so fair a proof unfold what force the brightest genius draws from polished wisdoms written laws where are our humbler tenets flown what strange perfection bids us own that bliss with toilsome science dwells and happiest he who most excels anacreontic      twas in a cool aonian glade the wanton cupid spent with toil had sought refreshment from the shade and stretched him on the mossy soil a vagrant muse drew nigh and found the subtle traitor fast asleep and is it thine to snore profound she said yet leave the world to weep but hush  from this auspicious hour the world i ween may rest in peace and robbed of darts and stripped of power thy peevish petulance decrease sleep on poor child whilst i withdraw and this thy vile artillry hide  when the castalian fount she saw and plunged his arrows in the tide that magic fount  illjudging maid shall cause you soon to curse the day you dared the shafts of love invade and gave his arms redoubled sway for in a stream so wondrous clear when angry cupid searches round will not the radiant points appear will not the furtive spoils be found too soon they were and every dart dipped in the muses mystic spring acquired new force to wound the heart and taught at once to love and sing then farewell ye pierian quire for who will now your altars throng from love we learn to swell the lyre and echo asks no sweeter song ode written      urit spes animi credula mutui hor imitation fond hope of a reciprocal desire inflames the breast   twas not by beautys aid alone that love usurped his airy throne his boasted power displayed it is kindness that secures his aim it is hope that feeds the kindling flame which beauty first conveyed in claras eyes the lightnings view her lips with all the roses hue have all its sweets combined yet vain the blush and faint the fire till lips at once and eyes conspire to prove the charmer kind  though wit might gild the tempting snare with softest accent sweetest air by envys self admired if lesbias wit betrayed her scorn in vain might every grace adorn what every muse inspired thus airy strephon tuned his lyre  he scorned the pangs of wild desire which lovesick swains endure resolved to brave the keenest dart since frowns could never wound his heart and smiles  must ever cure but ah how false these maxims prove how frail security from love experience hourly shows love can imagined smiles supply on every charming lip and eye eternal sweets bestows in vain we trust the fair ones eyes in vain the sage explores the skies to learn from stars his fate till led by fancy wide astray he finds no planet mark his way convinced and wise  too late as partial to their words we prove then boldly join the lists of love with towering hopes supplied so heroes taught by doubtful shrines mistook their deitys designs then took the field  and died upon a visit to a lady of quality in winter      on fair asterias blissful plains where everblooming fancy reigns how pleased we pass the winters day and charm the dulleyd spleen away no linnet from the leafless bough pours forth her note melodious now but all admire asterias tongue nor wish the linnets vernal song no flowers emit their transient rays yet sure asterias wit displays more various tints more glowing lines and with perennial beauty shines though rifled groves and fettered streams but ill befriend a poets dreams asterias presence wakes the lyre and well supplies poetic fire the fields have lost their lovely dye no cheerful azure decks the sky yet still we bless the louring day asteria smiles  and all is gay hence let the muse no more presume to blame the winters dreary gloom accuse his loitring hours no more but ah their envious haste deplore for soon from wit and friendships reign the social hearth the sprightly vein i go  to meet the coming year on savage plains and deserts drear i go  to feed on pleasures flown nor find the spring my loss atone but mid the flowery sweets of may with pride recall this winters day ode to memory      o memory celestial maid who gleanst the flowerets cropped by time and suffering not a leaf to fade preservst the blossoms of our prime bring bring those moments to my mind when life was new and lesbia kind and bring that garland to my sight with which my favored crook she bound and bring that wreath of roses bright which then my festive temples crowned and to my raptured ear convey the gentle things she deigned to say and sketch with care the muses bower where isis rolls her silver tide nor yet omit one reed or flower that shines on cherwells verdant side if so thou may those hours prolong when polished lycon joined my song the song it vails not to recite  but sure to sooth our youthful dreams those banks and streams appeared more bright than other banks than other streams or by thy softening pencil shown assume they beauties not their own and paint that sweetlyvacant scene when all beneath the poplar bough my spirits light my soul serene i breathed in verse one cordial vow that nothing should my soul inspire but friendship warm and love entire dull to the sense of new delight on thee the drooping muse attends as some fond lover robbed of sight on thy expressive power depends nor would exchange thy glowing lines to live the lord of all that shines but let me chase those vows away which at ambitions shrine i made nor ever let thy skill display those anxious moments ill repaid oh from my breast that season raze and bring my childhood in its place bring me the bells the rattle bring and bring the hobby i bestrode when pleased in many a sportive ring around the room i jovial rode even let me bid my lyre adieu and bring the whistle that i blew then will i muse and pensive say why did not these enjoyments last how sweetly wasted i the day while innocence allowed to waste ambitions toils alike are vain but ah for pleasure yield us pain verses written toward the close of the year      to william lyttleton esquire how blithly passed the summers day how bright was every flower while friends arrived in circles gay to visit damons bower but now with silent step i range along some lonely shore and damons bower alas the change is gay with friends no more away to crowds and cities borne in quest of joy they steer whilst i alas am left forlorn to weep the parting year o pensive autumn how i grieve thy sorrowing face to see when languid suns are taking leave of every drooping tree ah let me not with heavy eye this dying scene survey haste winter haste usurp the sky complete my bowrs decay ill can i bear the motley cast yon sickening leaves retain that speak at once of pleasure past and bode approaching pain at home unblessed i gaze around my distant scenes require where all in murky vapors drowned are hamlet hill and spire though thomson sweet descriptive bard inspiring autumn sung yet how should we the months regard that stopped his flowing tongue ah luckless months of all the rest to whose hard share it fell for sure he was the gentlest breast that ever sung so well and see the swallows now disown the roofs they loved before each like his tuneful genius flown to glad some happier shore the woodnymph eyes with pale affright the sportsmans frantic deed while hounds and horns and yells unite to drown the muses reed ye fields with blighted herbage brown ye skies no longer blue too much we feel from fortunes frown to bear these frowns from you where is the meads unsullied green the zephyrs balmy gale and where sweet friendships cordial mien that brightened every vale what though the vine disclose her dies and boast her purple store not all the vineyards rich supplies can sooth our sorrows more he he is gone whose moral strain could wit and mirth refine he he is gone whose social vein surpassed the power of wine fast by the streams he deigned to praise in yon sequestered grove to him a votive urn i raise to him and friendly love yes there my friend forlorn and sad i grave your thomsons name and there his lyre which fate forbade to sound your growing fame there shall my plaintive song recount dark themes of hopeless woe and faster than the dropping fount i will teach mine eyes to flow there leaves in spite of autumn green shall shade the hallowed ground and spring will there again be seen to call forth flowers around but no kind suns will bid me share once more his social hour ah spring thou never can repair this loss to damons bower an irregular ode after sickness       melius cum venerit ipsa canemus  imitation his wished for presence will improve the song   too long a stranger to repose at length from pains abhorred couch i rose and wandered forth alone to court once more the balmy breeze and catch the verdure of the trees ere yet their charms were flown twas from a bank with pansies gay i hailed once more the cheerful day the suns forgotten beams o sun how pleasing were thy rays reflected from the polished face of yon refulgent streams raised by the scene my feeble tongue essayed again the sweets of song and thus in feeble strains and slow the loitring numbers gan to flow  come gentle air my languid limbs restore  and bid me welcome from the stygian shore  for sure i heard the tender sighs  i seemed to join the plaintive cries  of hapless youths who through the myrtle grove  bewail for ever their unfinished love  to that unjoyous clime  torn from the sight of these ethereal skies  debarred the luster of their delias eyes  and banished in their prime  come gentle air and while the thickets bloom  convey the jasmines breath divine  convey the woodbines rich perfume  nor spare the sweetleafd eglantine  and may thou shun the rugged storm  till health her wonted charms explain  with rural pleasure in her train  to greet me in her fairest form  while from this lofty mount i view  the sons of earth the vulgar crew  anxious for futile gains beneath me stray  and seek with erring step contentments obvious way  come gentle air and thou celestial muse  thy genial flame infuse  enough to lend a pensive bosom aid  and gild retirements gloomy shade  enough to rear such rustic lays  as foes may slight but partial friends will praise the gentle air allowed my claim and more to cheer my drooping frame she mixed the balm of opening flowers such as the be with chymic powers from hyblas fragrant hills inhales or scents sabeas blooming vales but ah the nymphs that heal the pensive mind by prescripts more refined neglect their votrys anxious moan oh how should they relieve  the muses all were flown by flowery plain or woodland shades i fondly sought the charming maids by woodland shades or flowery plain i sought them faithless maids in vain when lo in happier hour i leave behind my native mead to range where zeal and friendship lead to visit ls honored bower ah foolish man to seek the tuneful maids on other plains or near less verdant shades scarce have my footsteps pressed the favored ground when sounds ethereal strike my ear at once celestial forms appear my fugitives are found the muses here attune their lyres ah partial with unwonted fires here hand in hand with careless mien the sportive graces trip the green but whilst i wandered over a scene so fair too well at one survey i trace how every muse and every grace had long employed their care lurks not a stone enriched with lively stain blooms not a flower amid the vernal store falls not a plume on indias distant plain glows not a shell on adrias rocky shore but torn methought from native lands or seas from their arrangement gain fresh power to please and some had bent the wildring maze bedecked with every shrub that blows and some entwined the willing sprays to shield the illustrious dames repose others had graced the sprightly dome and taught the portrait where to glow others arrangd the curious tome or mid the decorated space assigned the laurelld bust a place and given to learning all the pomp of show and now from every task withdrawn they met and friskd it over the lawn ah woe is me said i and s hilly circuit heard my cry have i for this with labor strove and lavished all my little store to fence for you my shady grove and scollop every winding shore and fringe with every purple rose the sapphire stream that down my valley flows ah lovely treacherous maids to quit unseen my votive shades when pale disease and torturing pain had torn me from the breezy plain and to a restless couch confined who never your wonted tasks declined she needs not your officious aid to swell the song or plan the shade by genuine fancy fired her native genius guides her hand and while she marks the sage command more lovely scenes her skill shall raise her lyre resound with nobler rays than ever you inspired thus i my rage and grief display but vainly blame and vainly mourn nor will a grace or muse return till luxborough lead the way rural elegance an ode to the late duchess of somerset written    0 while orient skies restore the day and dewdrops catch the lucid ray amid the sprightly scenes of morn will aught the muse inspire oh peace to yonder clamorous horn that drowns the sacred lyre ye rural thanes that over the mossy down some panting timorous hare pursue does nature mean your joys alone to crown say does she smooth her lawns for you for you does echo bid the rocks reply and urged by rude constraint resound the jovial cry see from the neighboring hill forlorn the wretched swain your sport survey he finds his faithful fences torn he finds his labored crops a prey he sees his flock  no more in circles feed happily beneath your ravage bleed and with no random curses lwads the deed nor yet ye swains conclude that nature smiles for you alone your bounded souls and your conceptions crude the proud the selfish boast disown yours be the produce of the soil o may it still reward your toil nor ever the defenseless train of clinging infants ask support in vain but though the various harvest gild your plains does the mere landscape feast your eye or the warm hope of distant gains far other cause of glee supply is not the redstreaks future juice the source of your delight profound where ariconium pours her gems profuse purpling a whole horizon round athirst ye praise the limpid stream it is true but though the pebbled shores among it mimic no unpleasing song the limpid fountain murmurs not for you unpleasd ye see the thickets bloom unpleasd the spring her flowery robe resume unmoved the mountains airy pile the dappled mead without a smile o let a rural conscious muse for well she knows your froward sense accuse forth to the solemn oak you bring the square and span the massy trunk before you cry it is fair nor yet ye learned nor yet ye courtly train if happily from your haunts ye stray to waste with us a summers day exclude the taste of every swain nor our untutored sense disdain it is nature only gives exclusive right to relish her supreme delight she where she pleases kind or coy who furnishes the scene and forms us to enjoy then hither bring the fair ingenuous mind by her auspicious aid refined lo not an hedgerow hawthorn blows or humble harebell paints the plain or valley winds or fountain flows or purple heath is tinged in vain for such the rivers dash the foaming tides the mountain swells the dale subsides even thriftless furze detains their wandering sight and the rough barren rock grows pregnant with delight with what suspicious fearful care the sordid wretch secures his claim if happily some luxurious heir should alienate the fields that wear his name what scruples lest some future birth should litigate a span of earth bonds contracts feoffments names unmeet for prose the towering muse endures not to disclose alas her unreversd decree more comprehensive and more free her lavish charter taste appropriates all we see let gondolas their painted flags unfold and be the solemn day enrolled when to confirm his lofty plea in nuptial sort with bridal gold the grave venetian weds the sea each laughing muse derides the vow even adria scorns the mock embrace to some lone hermit on the mountains brow allotted from his natal hour with all her myrtle shores in dower his breast to admiration prone enjoys the smile upon her face enjoys triumphant every grace and finds her more his own fatigued with forms oppressive laws when somerset avoids the great when cloyed with merited applause she seeks the rural calm retreat does she not praise each mossy cell and feel the truth my numbers tell when deafend by the loud acclaim which genius graced with rank obtains could she not more delighted hear yon throstle chant the rising year could she not spurn the wreaths of fame to crop the primrose of the plains does she not sweets in each fair valley find lost to the sons of power unknown to half mankind ah can she covet there to see the splendid slaves the reptile race that oil the tongue and bow the knee that slight her merit but adore her place far happier if aright i deem when from gay throngs and gilded spires to where the lonely halcyons play her philosophic step retires while studious of the moral theme she to some smooth sequestered stream likens the swains inglorious day pleased from the flowery margin to survey how cool serene and clear the current glides away o blind to truth to virtue blind who slight the sweetly pensive mind on whose fair birth the graces mild and every muse prophetic smiled not that the poets boasted fire should fames wideechoing trumpet swell or on the music of his lyre each future age with rapture dwell the vaunted sweets of praise remove yet shall such bosoms claim a part in all that glads the human heart yet these the spirits formed to judge and prove all natures charms immense and heavens unbounded love and oh the transport most allied to song in some fair villas peaceful bound to catch soft hints from natures tongue and bid arcadia bloom around whether we fringe the sloping hill or smooth below the verdant mead whether we break the falling rill or through meandring mazes lead or in the horrid brambles room bid careless groups of roses bloom or let some sheltered lake serene reflect flowers woods and spires and brighten all the scene o sweet disposal of the rural hour o beauties never known to cloy while worth and genius haunt the favored bower and every gentle breast partakes the joy while charity at eve surveys the swain enabled by these toils to cheer a train of helpless infants dear speed whistling home across the plain see vagrant luxury her handmaid grown for half her graceless deeds atone and hails the bounteous work and ranks it with her own why brand these pleasures with the name of soft unsocial toils of indolence and shame search but the garden or the wood let yon admired carnation own not all was meant for raiment or for food not all for needful use alone there while the seeds of future blossoms dwell it is colored for the sight perfumed to please the smell why knows the nightingale to sing why flows the pines nectareous juice why shines with paint the linnets wing for sustenance alone for use for preservation every sphere shall bid fair pleasures rightful claim appear and sure there seem of human kind some born to shun the solemn strife some for amusive tasks designed to sooth the certain ills of life grace its lone vales with many a budding rose new founts of bliss disclose call forth refreshing shades and decorate repose from plains and woodlands from the view of rural natures blooming face smit with the glare of rank and place to courts the sons of fancy flew there long had art ordained a rival seat there had she lavished all her care to form a scene more dazzling fair and called them from their green retreat to share her proud control had given the robe with grace to flow had taught exotic gems to glow and emulous of natures power mimicd the plume the leaf the flower changed the complexions native hue molded each rustic limb anew and warped the very soul a while her magic strikes the novel eye a while the fairy forms delight and now aloof we seem to fly on purple pinions through a purer sky where all is wondrous all is bright now landed on some spangled shore a while each dazzled maniac roves by sapphire lakes through emrald groves paternal acres please no more adieu the simple the sincere delight  the habitual scene of hill and dale the rural herds the vernal gale the tangled vetchs purple bloom the fragrance of the beans perfume be theirs alone who cultivate the soil and drink the cup of thirst and eat the bread of toil but soon the pageant fades away it is nature only bears perpetual sway we pierce the counterfeit delight fatigued with splendours irksome beams fancy again demands the sight of native groves and wonted streams pants for the scenes that charmed her youthful eyes where truth maintains her court and banishes disguise then hither often ye senators retire with nature here high converse hold for who like stamford her delights admire like stamford shall with scorn behold the unequal bribes of pageantry and gold beneath the british oaks majestic shade shall see fair truth immortal maid friendship in artless guise arrayed honor and moral beauty shine with more attractive charms with radiance more divine yes here alone did highest heaven ordain the lasting magazine of charms whatever wins whatever warms whatever fancy seeks to share the great the various and the fair for ever should remain her impulse nothing may restrain  or whence the joy mid columns towers midst all the citys artful trim to rear some breathless vapid flowers or shrubs fuliginously grim from rooms of silken foliage vain to trace the dun far distant grove where smit with undissembled pain the woodlark mourns her absent love borne to the dusty town from native air to mimic rural life and sooth some vapourd fair but how must faithless art prevail should all who taste our joy sincere to virtue truth or science dear forego a courts alluring pale for dimpled brook and leafy grove for that rich luxury of thought they love ah no from these the public sphere requires example for its giddy bands from these impartial heaven demands to spread the flame itself inspires to sift opinions mingled mass impress a nations taste and bid the sterling pass happy thrice happy they whose graceful deeds have exemplary shone round the gay precincts of a throne with mild effective beams who bands of fair ideas bring by solemn grot or shady spring to join their pleasing dreams theirs is the rural bliss without alloy they only that deserve enjoy what though nor fabled dryad haunt their grove nor naiad near their fountains rove yet all embodied to the mental sight a train of smiling virtues bright shall there the wise retreat allow shall twine triumphant palms to deck the wandrers brow and though by faithless friends alarmed art have with nature waged presumptuous war by seymours winning influence charmed in whom their gifts united shine no longer shall their councils

design nature exalt the mound where art shall build art shape the gay alcove while nature paints the field begin ye songsters of the grove o warble forth your noblest lay where somerset vouchsafes to rove ye levrets freely sport and play  peace to the strepent horn let no harsh dissonance disturb the morn no sounds inelegant and rude her sacred solitudes profane unless her candor not exclude the lowly shepherds votive strain who tunes his reed amidst his rural cheer fearful yet not averse that somerset should hear ode to indolence    0 ah why for ever on the wing persists my wearied soul to roam why ever cheated strives to bring or pleasure or contentment home thus the poor bird that draws his name from paradises honored groves careless fatigues his little frame nor finds the resting place he loves lo on the rural mossy bed my limbs with careless ease reclined ah gentle sloth indulgent spread the same soft bandage over my mind for why should lingering thought invade yet every worldly prospect cloy lend me soft sloth thy friendly aid and give me peace debarred of joy love thou yon calm and silent flood that never ebbs that never flows protected by the circling wood from each tempestuous wind that blows an altar on its bank shall rise where often thy votry shall be sound what time pale autumn lulls the skies and sickening verdure fades around ye busy race ye factious train that haunt ambitions guilty shrine no more perplex the world in vain but offer here your vows with mine and thou puissant queen be kind if ever i shared thy balmy power if ever i swayed my active mind to weave for thee the rural bower dissolve in sleep each anxious care each unavailing sigh remove and only let me wake to share the sweets of friendship and of love ode to a young lady somewhat too solicitous about her manner of expression survey my fair that lucid stream adown the smiling valley stray would art attempt or fancy dream to regulate its winding way so pleased i view

so lone a dell  should form a nymph so sweet  or fortune to her secret cell  conduct my wandering feet  gay lordlings sought her for their bride  but she would never incline  prove to your equals true

study where books were in great plenty this rat would devour more sense in an hour than i could write  in twenty corporeal food it is granted serves vermin less refined sir but this a rat of taste all other rats surpassed and he preyed on the food of the mind sir his breakfast half the morning he constantly attended and when the bell rung for evening song his dinner scarce was ended he spared not even heroics on which we poets pride us and would make no more of king arthurs by blackmore by the score than  all the world beside does in books of geography he made the maps to flutter a river or a sea was to him a dish of tea and a kingdom bread and butter but if some mawkish potion might chance to overdose him to check its rage he took a page of logic  to compose him  a trap in haste and anger was bought you need not doubt on it and such was the gin were a lion once got in he could not i think get out on it with cheese not books twas bated the fact  i will not belie it  since none  i tell you that  whether scholar or rat minds books when he has other diet but more of trap and bait sir why should i sing or either since the rat who knew the slight came in the dead of night and dragged em away together both trap and bait were vanished through a fracture in the flooring which though so trim it now may seem had then  a dozen or more in then answer this ye sages nor deem i mean to wrong ye had the rat which thus did seize on the trap less claim to reason than many a scull among ye dan priors mice i own it were vermin of condition but this rat who merely learned what rats alone concerned was the greater politician that englands topsyturvy is clear from these mishaps sir since traps we may determine will no longer take our vermin but vermin written at the time of the spanish depredations take our traps sir let sophs by rats infested then trust in cats to catch em lest they grow as learned as we in our studies where do you see no mortal sits to watch em good luck betide our captains good luck betide our cats sir and grant that the one may quell the spanish don and the other destroy our rats sir jemmy dawson a ballad written about the time of his execution in the year      come listen to my mournful tale ye tender hearts and lovers dear nor will you scorn to heave a sigh nor need you blush to shed a tear and thou dear kitty peerless maid do thou a pensive ear incline for thou can weep at every woe and pity every plaint  but mine young dawson was a gallant boy a brighter never trod the plain and well he loved one charming maid and dearly was he loved again one tender maid she loved him dear of gentle blood the damsel came and faultless was her beauteous form and spotless was her virgin fame but curse on partys hateful strife that led the favored youth astray the day the rebel clans appeared o had he never seen that day their colors and their sash he wore and in the fatal dress was found and now he must that death endure which gives the brave the keenest wound how pale was then his trueloves cheek when jemmys sentence reached her ear for never yet did alpine snows so pale or yet so chill appear with faltring voice she weeping said  o dawson monarch of my heart  think not thy death shall end our loves  for thou and i will never part  yet might sweet mercy find a place  and bring relief to jemmys woes  o george without a prayer for thee  my orisons should never close  the gracious prince that gave him life  would crown a neverdying flame  and every tender babe i bore  should learn to lisp the givers name  but though he should be dragged in scorn  to yonder ignominious tree  he shall not want one constant friend  to share the cruel fates decree o then her mourning coach was called the sledge moved slowly on before though borne in a triumphal car she had not loved her favorite more she followed him prepared to view the terrible behests of law and the last scene of jemmys woes with calm and steadfast eye she saw distorted was that blooming face which she had fondly loved so long and stifled was that tuneful breath which in her praise had sweetly sung and severed was that beauteous neck round which her arms had fondly closed and mangled was that beauteous breast on which her lovesick head reposed and ravished was that constant heart she did to every heart prefer for though it could its king forget twas true and loyal still to her amid those unrelenting flames she bore this constant heart to see but when twas moulderd into dust  yet yet she cried i follow thee  my death my death alone can show  the pure the lasting love i bore  accept o heaven of woes like ours  and let us let us weep no more the dismal scene was over and past the lovers mournful hearse retired the maid drew back her languid head and sighing forth his name expired though justice ever must prevail the tear my kitty sheds is due for seldom shall she hear a tale so sad so tender yet so true a ballad trahit sua quemque voluptas hor proverbializd every one to his liking  from lincoln to london rode forth our young squire to bring down a wife whom the swains might admire but in spite of whatever the mortal could say the goddess objected the length of the way to give up the opra the park and the ball for to view the stags horns in an old country hall to have neither china nor india to see nor a laceman to plague in a morning  not she to forsake the dear playhouse quin garrick and clive who by dint of mere humor had kept her alive to forego the full box for his lonesome abode o heavens she should faint she should die on the road to forget the gay fashions and gestures of france and to leave dear auguste in the midst of the dance and harlequin too  twas in vain to require it and she wondered how folks had the face to desireit she might yield to resign the sweet singers of ruckholt where the citizen matron seduces her cuckold but ranelagh soon would her footsteps recall and the music the lamps and the glare of vauxhall to be sure she could breathe no where else than in town thus she talked like a wit and he looked like a clown but the while honest harry despaired to succeed a coach with a coronet traild her

flavia might not prove sincere of crops destroyed by vernal cold and vagrant sheep that left my fold of these she heard yet bore to hear and is not flavia then sincere how changed by fortunes fickle wind the friends i loved became unkind she heard and shed a generous tear and is not flavia then sincere how if she deigned my love to bless my flavia must not hope for dress this too she heard and smiled to hear and flavia sure must be sincere go shear your flocks ye jovial swains go reap the plenty of your plains despoiled of all which you revere i know my flavias love sincere song the landscape how pleased within my native bowers erewhile i passed the day was ever scene so decked with flowers were ever flowers so gay how sweetly smiled the hill the vale and all the landscape round the river gliding down the dale the hill with beeches crowned but now when urged by tender woes i speed to meet my dear that hill and stream my zeal oppose and check my fond career no more since daphne was my theme their wonted charms i see that verdant hill and silver stream divide my love and me song ye gentle nymphs and generous dames that rule over every british mind be sure ye sooth their amorous flames be sure your laws are not unkind for hard it is to wear their bloom in unremitting sighs away to mourn the nights oppressive gloom and faintly bless the rising day and cruel twere a freeborn swain a british youth should vainly moan who scornful of a tyrants chain submits to yours and yours alone nor pointed spear nor links of steel could ever those gallant minds subdue who beautys wounds with pleasure feel and boast the fetters wrought by you song the skylark go tuneful bird that gladdst the skies to daphnes window speed thy way and there on quivering pinions rise and there thy vocal art display and if she deign thy notes to hear and if she praise thy matin song tell her the sounds that sooth her ear to damons native plains belong tell her in livelier plumes arrayed the bird from indian groves may shine but ask the lovely partial maid what are his notes compared to thine then bid her treat yon witless beau and all his flaunting race with scorn and lend an ear to damons woe who sings her praise and sings forlorn song ah ego non aliter tristes evincere morbos optarem quam te sic quoque velle putem  imitation why should i wish to banish sore disease unless returning health my delia please   on every tree in every plain i trace the jovial spring in vain a sickly languor veils mine eyes and fast my waning vigor flies nor flowery plain nor budding tree that smile on others smile on me mine eyes from death shall court repose nor shed a tear before they close what bliss to me can seasons bring or what the needless pride of spring the cypress bough that suits the bier retains its verdure all the year it is true my vine so fresh and fair might claim a while my wonted care my rural store some pleasure yield so white a flock so green a field my friends that each in kindness vie might well expect one parting sigh might well demand one tender tear for when was damon unsincere but ere i ask once more to view yon setting sun his race renew inform me swains my friends declare will pitying delia join the prayer song the attribute of venus yes fulvia is like venus fair has all her bloom and shape and air but still to perfect every grace she wants  the smile upon her face the crown majestic juno wore and cynthias brow the crescent bore an helmet marked minervas mien but smiles distinguished beautys queen her train was formed of smiles and loves her chariot drawn by gentlest doves and from her zone the nymph may find it is beautys province to be kind then smile my fair and all whose aim aspires to paint the cyprian dame or bid her breathe in living stone shall take their forms from you alone song      when bright roxana treads the green in all the pride of dress and mien averse to freedom love and play the dazzling rival of the day none other beauty strikes mine eye the lilies droop the roses die but when disclaiming art the fair assumes a soft engaging air mild as the opening morn of may familiar friendly free and gay the scene improves wherever she goes more sweetly smile the pink and rose o lovely maid propitious hear nor deem thy shepherd insincere pity a wild illusive flame that varies objects still the same and let their very changes prove the nevervaryd force of love song valentines day      it is said that under distant skies nor you the fact deny what first attracts an indians eyes becomes his deity perhaps a lily or a rose that shares the mornings ray may to the waking swain disclose the regent of the day perhaps a plant in yonder grove enriched with fragrant power may tempt his vagrant eyes to rove where blooms the sovereign flower perched on the cedars topmost bough and gay with gilded wings perchance the patron of his vow some artless linnet sings the swain surveys her pleased afraid then low to earth he bends and owns upon her friendly aid his health his life depends vain futile idols bird or flower to tempt a votrys prayer  how would his humble homage tower should he behold my fair yes  might the pagans waking eyes over flavias beauty range he there would fix his lasting choice nor dare nor wish to change song      the fatal hours are wondrous near that from these fountains bear my dear a little space is given in vain she robs my sight and shuns the plain a little space for me to prove my boundless flame my endless love and like the train of vulgar hours invidious time that space devours near yonder beach is delias way on that i gaze the livelong day no eastern monarchs dazzling pride should draw my longing eyes aside the chief that knows of succors nigh and sees his mangled legions die casts not a more impatient glance to see the loitring aids advance not more the schoolboy that expires far from his native home requires to see some friends familiar face or meet a parents last embrace  she comes  but ah what crowds of beaus in radiant bands my fair enclose oh better had thou shunned the green oh delia better far unseen methinks by all my tender fears by all my sighs by all my tears i might from torture now be free  it is more than death to part from thee song      the lovely delia smiles again that killing frown has left her brow can she forgive my jealous pain and give me back my angry vow love is an aprils doubtful day a while we see the tempest lower anon the radiant heaven survey and quite forget the flitting shower the flowers that hung their languid head are burnished by the transient rains the vines their wonted tendrils spread and double verdure gilds the plains the sprightly birds that drooped no less beneath the power of rain and wind in every raptured note express the joy i feel  when thou art kind song      perhaps it is not love said i that melts my soul when flavias nigh where wit and sense like here is agree one may be pleased and yet be free the beauties of her polished mind it needs no lovers eye to find the hermit freezing in his cell might wish the gentle flavia well it is not love  averse to bear the servile chain that lovers wear let let me all my fears remove my doubts dispel  it is not love  oh when did wit so brightly shine in any form less fair than thine it is  it is loves subtle fire and under friendship lurks desire song      over desert plains and rushy meers and withered heaths i rove where tree nor spire nor cot appears i pass to meet my love but though my path were damaskd over with beauties ever so fine my busy thoughts would fly before to fix alone  on thine no fircrownd hills could give delight no palace please mine eye no pyramids aerial height where mouldering monarchs lie unmoved should eastern kings advance could i the pageant see splendor might catch one scornful glance not steal one thought from thee song winter      no more ye warbling birds rejoice of all that cheered the plain echo alone preserves her voice and she  repeats my pain wherever my lovesick limbs i lay to shun the rushing wind its busy murmur seems to say  she never will be kind the naiads over their frozen urns in icy chains repine and each in sullen silence mourns her freedom lost like mine soon will the suns returning rays the cheerless frost control when will relenting delia chase the winter of my soul song the scholars relapse by the side of a grove at the foot of a hill where whispered the beech and where murmured the rill i vowed to the muses my time and my care since neither could win me the smiles of my fair free i ranged like the birds like the birds free i sung and delias loved name scarce escaped from my tongue but if once a smooth accent delighted my ear i should wish unawares that my delia might hear with fairest ideas my bosom i stored allusive to none but the nymph i adored and the more i with study my fancy refined the deeper impression she made on my mind so long as of nature the charms i pursue i still must my delias dear image renew the graces have yielded with delia to rove and the muses are all in alliance with love song the rosebud  see daphne see florelio cried  and learn the sad effects of pride  yon sheltered rose how safe concealed  how quickly blasted when revealed  the sun with warm attractive rays  tempts it to wanton in the blaze  a gale succeeds from eastern skies  and all its blushing radiance dies  so you my fair of charms divine  will quit the plains too fond to shine  where fames transporting rays allure  though here more happy more secure  the breath of some neglected maid  shall make you sigh you left the shade  a breath to beautys bloom unkind  as to the rose an eastern wind the nymph replied  you first my swain  confine your sonnets to the plain  one envious tongue alike disarms  you of your wit me of my charms  what is unknown the poets skill  or what unheard the tuneful thrill  what unadmird a charming mien  or what the roses blush unseen song daphnes visit ye birds for whom i reared the grove with melting lay salute my love my daphne with your notes detain or i have reared my grove in vain ye flowers before her footsteps rise display at once your brightest dies that she your opening charms may see or what were all your charms to me kind zephyr brush each fragrant flower and shed its odours round my bower or never more o gentle wind shall i from thee refreshment find ye streams if ever your banks i loved if ever your native sounds improved may each soft murmur sooth my fair or oh twill deepen my despair and thou my grot whose lonely bounds the melancholy pine surrounds may daphne praise thy peaceful gloom or thou shall prove her damons tomb song written in a collection of bacchanalian songs adieu ye jovial youths who join to plunge old care in floods of wine and as your dazzled eyeballs roll discern him struggling in the bowl nor yet is hope so wholly flown nor yet is thought so tedious grown but limpid stream and shady tree retain as yet some sweets for me and see through yonder silent grove see yonder does my daphne rove with pride her footsteps i pursue and bid your frantic joys adieu the sole confusion i admire is that my daphnes eyes inspire i scorn the madness you approve and value reason next to love song imitated from the french yes these are the scenes where with iris i strayed but short was her sway for so lovely a maid in the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run in the bloom of her graces too fair for a nun illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove so fatal to beauty so killing to love yes these are the meadows the shrubs and the plains once the scene of my pleasures the scene of my pains how many soft moments i spent in this grove how fair was my nymph and how fervent my love be still though my heart thine emotion give over remember the season of love is no more with her how i strayed amid fountains and bowers or loiterd behind and collected the flowers then breathless with ardour my fair one pursued and to think with what kindness my garland she viewed but be still my fond heart this emotion give over fain would thou forget thou must love her no more song when bright ophelia treads the green in all the pride of dress and mien averse to freedom mirth and play the lofty rival of the day methinks to my enchanted eye the lilies droop the roses die but when disdaining art the fair assumes a soft engaging air mild as the opening morn of may and as the feathered warblers gay the scene improves wherever she goes more sweetly smiles the pink and rose  o lovely maid propitious hear  nor think thy damon insincere  pity my wild delusive flame  for though the flowers are still the same  to me they languish or improve  and plainly tell me that i love song when first philander first i came where avon rolls his winding stream the nymphs  how brisk the swains  how gay to see asteria queen of may  the parsons round her praises sung the steeples with her praises rung  i thought  no sight that ever was seen could match the fight of barels green but now since old eugenio died  the chief of poets and the pride  now meaner bards in vain aspire to raise their voice to tune their lyre their lovely season now is over thy notes florelio please no more  no more asterias smiles are seen  adieu  the sweets of barels green  the halcyon why over the verdant banks of ooze does yonder halcyon speed so fast it is all because she would not lose her favorite calm that will not last the sun with azure paints the skies the stream reflects each flowery spray and frugal of her time she flies to take her fill of love and play see her when rugged boreas blows warm in some rocky cell remain to seek for pleasure well she knows would only then enhance the pain  descend she cries thou hated shower  deform my limpid waves today  for i have chose a fairer hour  to take my fill of love and play you too my silvia sure will own lifes azure seasons swiftly roll and when our youth or health is flown to think of love but shocks the soul could damon but deserve thy charms as thou art damons only theme he would fly as quick to delias arms as yonder halcyon skims the stream moral pieces the judgment of hercules while blooming spring descends from genial skies by whose mild influence instant wonders rise from whose soft breath elysian beauties flow the sweets of hagley or the pride of stowe will lyttleton the rural landscape range leave noisy fame and not regret the change pleased will he tread the gardens early scenes and learn a moral from the rising greens there warmed alike by sols enlivening power the weed aspiring emulates the flower the drooping flower its fairer charms displayed invites from grateful hands their generous aid soon if none check the invasive foes designs the lively luster of these scenes declines it is thus the spring of youth the morn of life rears in our minds the rival seeds of strife then passion riots reason then contends and on the conquest every bliss depends life from the nice decision takes its hue and blessed those judges who decide like you on worth like theirs shall every bliss attend the world their favorite and the world their friend there are who blind to thoughts fatiguing ray as fortune gives examples urge their way not virtues foes though they her paths decline and scarce her friends though with her friends they join in here is or vices casual road advance thoughtless the sinners or the saints of chance yet some more nobly scorn the vulgar voice with judgment fix with zeal pursue their choice when ripened thought when reason born to reign checks the wild tumults of the youthful vein while passions lawless tides at their command glide through more useful tracts and bless the land happiest of these is he whose matchless mind by learning strengthened and by taste refined in virtues cause essayed its earliest powers chose virtues paths and strewed her paths with flowers the first alarmed if freedom waves her wings the fittest to adorn each art she brings loved by that prince whom every virtue fires praised by that bard whom every muse inspires blessed in the tuneful art the social flame in all that wins in all that merits fame twas youths perplexing stage his doubts inspired when great alcides to a grove retired through the lone windings of a devious glade resigned to thought with lingering steps he strayed blessed with a mind to taste sincerer joys armed with a heart each false one to despise dubious he strayed with wavering thoughts possessed alternate passions struggling shared his breast the various arts which human cares divide in deep attention all his mind employed anxious if fame an equal bliss secured or silent ease with softer charms allured the sylvan choir whose numbers sweetly flowed the fount that murmured and the flowers that blowed the silver flood that in meanders led his glittering streams along the enlivened mead the soothing breeze and all those beauties joined which whilst they please effeminate the mind in vain while distant on a summit raised the imperial towers of fame attractive blazed while thus he traced through fancys puzzling maze the separate sweets of pleasure and of praise sudden the wind a fragrant gale conveyed and a new luster gained upon the shade at once before his wondering eyes were seen two female forms of more than mortal mien various their charms and in their dress and face each seemed to vie with some peculiar grace this whose attire less clogged with art appeared the simple sweets of innocence endeared her sprightly bloom her quick sagacious eye showed native merit mixed with modesty her air diffused a mild yet awful ray severely sweet and innocently gay such the chaste image of the martial maid in artless folds of virgin white arrayed she let no borrowed rose her cheeks adorn her blushing cheeks that shamed the purple morn her charms nor had nor wanted artful foils or studied gestures or wellpractisd smiles she scorned the toys which render beauty less she proved the engaging chastity of dress and while she chose in native charms to shine even thus she seemed nay more than seemed divine one modest emrald clasped the robe she wore and in her hand the imperial sword she bore sublime her height majestic was her pace and matched the awful honors of her face the shrubs the flowers that decked the verdant ground seemed where she trod with rising luster crowned still her approach with stronger influence warmed she pleased while distant but when near she charmed so strikes the gazers eye the silver gleam that glittering quivers over a distant stream but from its banks we see new beauties rise and in its crystal bosom trace the skies with other charms the rival vision glowed and from her dress her tinsel beauties flowed a fluttering robe her pampered shape concealed and seemed to shade the charms it best revealed its form contrived her faulty size to grace its hue to give fresh luster to her face her plaited hair disguised with brilliants glard her cheeks the rubys neighboring luster shared the gaudy topaz lent its gay supplies and every gem that strikes less curious eyes exposed her breast with foreign sweets perfumed and round her brow a roseate garland bloomed soft smiling blushing lips concealed her wiles yet ah the blushes artful as the smiles often gazing on her shade the enraptured fair decreed the substance well deserved her care her thoughts to others charms malignly blind centred in that and were to that confined and if on others eyes a glance were thrown twas but to watch the influence of her own much like her guardian fair cytheras queen when for her warrior she refines her mien or when to bless her delian favrites arms the radiant fair invigorates her charms much like her pupil egypts sportive dame her dress expressive and her air the same when her gay bark over silver cydnos rolled and all the emblazond streamers waved in gold such shone the vision nor forebore to move the fond contagious airs of lawless love each wanton eye deluding glances fired and amorous dimples on each cheek conspired lifeless her gait and slow with seeming pain she dragged her loitring limbs along the plain yet made some faint efforts and first approached the swain so glaring draughts with tawdry luster bright spring to the view and rush upon the sight more slowly charms a raphaels chaster air waits the calm search and pays the searchers care wrapped in a pleased suspense the youth surveyed the various charms of each attractive maid alternate each he viewed and each admired and found alternate varying flames inspired quick over their forms his eyes with pleasure ran when she who first approached him first began  hither dear boy direct thy wandering eyes  it is here the lovely vale of pleasure lies  debate no more to me thy life resign  each sweet which nature can diffuse is mine  for me the nymph diversifies her power  springs in a tree or blossoms in a flower  to please my ear she tunes the linnets strains  to please my eye with lilies paints the plains  to form my couch in mossy beds she grows  to gratify my smell perfumes the rose  reveals the fair the fertile scene you see  and swells the vegetable world for me  let the gulled fool the toils of war pursue  where bleed the many to enrich the few  where chance from courage claims the boasted prize  where though she give your country often denies  industrious thou shall cupids wars maintain  and ever gently fight his soft campaign  his darts alone shall wield his wounds endure  yet only suffer to enjoy the cure  yield but to me  a choir of nymphs shall rise  and fire thy breast and bless thy ravished eyes  their beauteous cheeks a fairer rose shall wear  a brighter lily on their necks appear  where fondly thou thy favored head shall rest  soft as the down that swells the eygnets nest  while philomel in each soft voice complains  and gently lulls thee with mellifluous strains  whilst with each accent sweetest odours flow  and spicy gums round every bosom glow  not the famed bird arabian climes admire  shall in such luxury of sweets expire  at sloth let wars victorious sons exclaim  in vain for pleasure is my real name  nor envy thou the head with bays oergrown  no seek thou roses to adorn thy own  for well each opening scene that claims my care  suits and deserves the beauteous crown i wear  let others prune the vine the genial bowl  shall crown thy table and enlarge thy soul  let vulgar hands explore the brilliant mine  so the gay produce glitter still on thine  indulgent bacchus loads his laboring tree  and guarding gives its clustring sweets to me  for my loved train apollos piercing beam  darts through the passive glebe and frames the gem  see in my cause consenting gods employed  nor slight these gods their blessings unenjoyd  for thee the poplar shall its amber drain  for thee in clouded beauty spring the cane  some costly tribute every clime shall pay  some charming treasure every wind convey  each object round some pleasing scene shall vield  art build thy dome while nature decks thy field  of corinths order shall the structure rise  the spiring turrets glitter through the skies  thy costly robe shall glow with tyrian rays  thy vase shall sparkle and thy car shall blaze  yet thou whatever pomp the sun display  shall own the amorous night exceeds the day  when melting flutes and sweetlysounding lyres  wake the gay loves and cite the young desires  or in the ionian dance some favorite maid  improves the flame her sparkling eyes conveyed  think can thou quit a glowing delias arms  to feed on virtues visionary charms  or slight the joys which wit and youth engage  for the faint honor of a frozen sage  to find dull envy even that hope deface  and where you toiled for glory reap disgrace  o think that beauty waits on thy decree  and thy loved loveliest charmer pleads with me  she whose soft smile or gentler glance to move  you vowed the wild extremities of love  in whose endearments years like moments flew  for whose endearments millions seemed too few  she she implores she bids thee seize the prime  and tread with her the flowery tracts of time  nor thus her lovely bloom of life bestow  on some cold lover or insulting foe  think if against that tongue thou can rebel  where love yet dwelt and reason seemed to dwell  what strong persuasion arms her softer sighs  what full conviction sparkles in her eyes  see nature smiles and birds salute the shade  where breathing jasmine screens the sleeping maid  and such her charms as to the vain may prove  ambition seeks more humble joys than love  there busy toil shall never invade thy reign  nor sciences perplex thy laboring brain  or none but what with equal sweets invite  nor other arts but to prolong delight  sometimes thy fancy prune her tender wing  to praise a pendant or to grace a ring  to fix the dress that suits each varying mien  to show where best the clustring gems are seen  to sigh soft strains along the vocal grove  and tell the charms the sweet effects of love  nor fear to find a coy disdainful muse  nor think the sisters will their aid refuse  cool grots and tinkling rills or silent shades  soft scenes of leisure suit the harmonious maids  and all the wise and all the grave decree  some of that sacred train allied to me  but if more specious ease thy wishes claim  and thy breast glow with faint desire of fame  some softer science shall thy thoughts amuse  and learnings name a solemn sound diffuse  to thee all natures curious stores i will bring  explain the beauties of an insects wing  the plant which nature less diffusely kind  has to few climes with partial care confined  the shell she scatters with more careless air  and in her frolics seems supremely fair  the worth that dazzles in the tulips stains  or lurks beneath a pebbles various veins  sleeps downy god averse to wars alarms  shall over thy head diffuse his softest charms  ere anxious thought thy dear repose assail  or care my most destructive foe prevail  the watery nymphs shall tune the vocal vales  and gentle zephyrs harmonize their gales  for thy repose inform with rival joy  their streams to murmur and their winds to sigh  thus shall thou spend the sweetlyflowing day  till lost in bliss thou breathe thy soul away  till she to elysian bowers of joy repair  nor find my charming scenes exceeded there she ceased and on a lilyd bank reclined her flowing robe waved wanton with the wind one tender hand her drooping head sustains one points expressive to the flowery plains soon the fond youth perceived her influence roll deep in his breast to melt his manly soul as when favonius joins the solar blaze and each fair fabric of the frost decays soon to his breast the soft harangue conveyed resolves too partial to the specious maid he sighed he gazed so sweetly smiled the dame yet sighing gazing seemed to scorn his flame and often as virtue caught his wandering eye a crimson blush condemned the rising sigh twas such the lingering trojans shame betrayed when maias son the frown of jove displayed when wealth fame empire could no balance prove for the soft reign of dido and of love thus ill with arduous glory love conspires soft tender flames with bold impetuous fires some hovering doubts his anxious bosom moved and virtue zealous fair those doubts improved  fly fly fond youth the too indulgent maid  nor err by such fantastic scenes betrayed  though in my path the rugged thorn be seen  and the dry turf disclose a fainter green  though no gay rose or flowery product shine  the barren surface still conceals the mine  each thorn that threatens even the weed that grows  in

all the sickening splendor fades away the progress of taste or the fate of delicacy a poem on the temper and studies of the author and how great a misfortune it is for a man of small estate to have much taste part the first perhaps some cloud eclipsed the day when thus i tuned my pensive lay  the ship is launched  we catch the gale   on lifes extended ocean sail  for happiness our course we bend  our ardent cry our general end  yet ah the scenes which tempt our care  are like the forms dispersed in air  still dancing near disordered eyes  and weakest his who best descries yet let me not my birthright barter for wishing is the poets charter all bards have leave to wish what is wanted though few ever found their wishes granted extensive field where poets pride them in singing all that is denied them for humble ease ye powers i pray that plain warm suit for every day and pleasure and brocade bestow to flaunt it  once a month or so the first for constant wear we want the first ye powers for ever grant but constant wear the last bespatters and turns the tissue into tatters wherever my vagrant course i bend let me secure one faithful friend let me in public scenes request a friend of wit and taste well dressed and if i must not hope such favor a friend of wit and taste however alas that wisdom ever shuns to congregate her scattered sons whose nervous forces well combined would win the field and sway mankind the fool will squeeze from morn to night to fix his follies full in sight the note he strikes the plume he shows attract whole flights of fops and beaus and kindredfools who never had known him flock at the sight caress and own him but illstarrd sense nor gay nor loud steals soft on tiptoe through the crowd conveys his meagre form between and slides like pervious air unseen contracts his known tenuity as though twere even a crime to be nor even permits his eyes to stray and win acquaintance in their way in company so mean his air you scarce are conscious he is there till from some nook like sharpened steel occurs his faces thin profile still seeming from the gazers eye like venus newly bathed to fly yet while reluctant he displays his real gems before the blaze the fool has in its center placed his tawdry stock of painted paste disused to speak he tries his skill speaks coldly and succeeds but ill his pensive manner dullness deemed his modesty reserve esteemed his wit unknown his learning vain he wins not one of all the train and those who mutually known in friendships fairest list had shone less prone than pebbles to unite retire to shades from public sight grow savage quit their social nature and starve to study mutual satire but friends and favorites to chagrin them find counties countries seas between them meet once a year then part and then retiring wish to meet again sick of the thought let me provide some human form to grace my side at hand wherever i shape my course an useful pliant stalkinghorse no gesture free from some grimace no seam without its share of lace but marked with gold or silver either hint where his coat was piecd together his legs be lengthened i advise and stockings rolled abridge his thighs what though vandyck had other rules what had vandyck to do with fools be nothing wanting but his mind before a solitire behind a twisted ribbon like the track which nature gives an asss back silent as midnight pity twere his wisdoms slender wealth to share and whilst in flocks our fancies stray to wish the poor mans lamb away this form attracting every eye i stroll all unregarded by this wards the jokes of every kind as an umbrella sun or wind or like a sponge absorbs the sallies and pestilential fumes of malice or like a splendid shield is fit to screen the templars random wit or what some gentler cit lets fall as woolpacks quash the leaden ball aliusions these of weaker force and apter still the stalkinghorse o let me wander all unseen beneath the sanction of his mien as lilies soft as roses fair empty as airpumps drained of air with steady eye and pace remark the speckled flock that haunts the park st jamess  level my pen with wondrous heed at follies flocking there to feed and as my satire bursts amain see feathered foppry strew the plain but when i seek my rural grove and share the peaceful haunts i love let none of this unhallowed train my sweet sequestered paths profane often may some polished virtuous friend to these softwinding vales descend and love with me inglorious things and scorn with me the pomp of kings and check me when my bosom burns for statues paintings coins and urns for i in damons prayer could join and damons wish might now be mine  but all dispersed the wish the prayer are driven to mix with common air part the second how happy once was damons lot while yet romantic schemes were not ere yet he sent his weakly eyes to plan frail castles in the skies forsaking pleasures cheap and common to court a blaze still flitting from one ah happy damon thrice and more had taste never touched thy tranquil shore oh days when to a girdle tied the couples jingled at his side and damon swore he would not barter the sportsmans girdle for a garter whoever came to kill an hour found easy damon in their power pure social nature all his guide  damon had not a grain of pride he wished not to elude the snares which knavry plans and crast prepares but rather wealth to crown their wiles and win their universal smiles for who are cheerful who at ease but they who cheat us as they please he winked at many a gross design the newfalln calf might countermine thus every fool allowed his merit  yes damon had a generous spirit a coxcombs jest however vile was sure at least of damons smile that coxcomb never denied him sense for why it proved his own pretense all owned were modesty away damon could shine as much as they when wine and folly came in season damon never strove to save his reason obnoxious to the mad uproar a spy upon a hostile shore twas this his company endeared mirth never came till he appeared his lodgings  every drawr could show em the slave was kicked who did not know em thus damon studious of his ease and pleasing all whom mirth could please defied the world like idle colley to show a softer word than folly since wisdoms gorgonshield was known to stare the gazer into stone he chose to trust in follys charm to keep his breast alive and warm at length grave learnings sober train remarked the trifler with disdain the sons of taste contemned his ways and ranked him with the brutes that graze while they to nobler heights aspired and grew beloved esteemed admired hence with our youth not void of spirit his old companions lost their merit and every kind wellnaturd sot seemed a dull play without a plot where every yawning guest agrees the willing creature strives to please but temper never could amuse it barely led us to excuse twas true conversing they averred all they had seen or felt or heard talents of weight for wights like these the law might choose for witnesses but sure the attesting dry narration ill suits a judge of conversation what were their freedoms boisterous mirth  mere excuses to vent ill manners blows and bruises yet freedom gallant freedom hailing at form at form incessant railing would they examine each offense its latent cause its known pretense punctilio never was known to breed em so sure as fond prolific freedom their courage but a loaded gun machine the wise would wish to shun its guard unsafe its lock an ill one where accident might fire and kill one in short disgusted out of measure through much contempt and slender pleasure his sense of dignity returns with native pride his bosom burns he seeks respect  but how to gain it wit social mirth could never obtain it and laughter where it reigns uncheckd discards and dissipates respect the man who gravely bows enjoys it but shaking hands at once destroys it precarious plant which fresh and gay shrinks at the touch and fades away come then reserve yet from thy train banish contempt and cursed disdain teach me he cried thy magic art to act the decent distant part to husband well my complaisance nor let even wit too far advance but choose calm reason for my theme in these her royal realms supreme and over her charms with caution shown be still a graceful umbrage thrown and each abrupter period crowned with nods and winks and smiles prosound till rescued from the crowd beneath no more with pain to move or breathe i rise with head elate to share salubrious draughts of purer air respect is won by grave pretense and silence surer even than sense  it is hence the sacred grandeur springs of eastern  and of other kings or whence this awe to virtue due while virtues distant as peru the sheathless sword the guard displays which round emits its dazzling rays the stately fort the turrets tall portcullisd gate and battled wall less screens the body than controls and wards contempt from royal souls the crowns they wear but check the eye before it fondly pierce too nigh that dazzled crowds may be employed around the surface of  the void o it is the statesmans craft profound to scatter his amusements round to tempt us from their conscious breast where fullfledgd crimes enjoy their nest nor awes us every worth revealed so deeply as each vice concealed the lordly log dispatched of yore that the frog people might adore with guards to keep them at a distance had reigned nor wanted wits assistance nay  had addresses from his nation in praise of logadministration part the third the buoyant fires of youth were over and same and finery pleased no more productive of that general stare which cool reflection ill can bear and crowds commencing mere vexation retirement sent its invitation romantic scenes of pendent hills and verdant vales and falling rills and mossy banks the fields adorn where damon simple swain was born the dryads reared a shady grove where such as think and such as love may safely sigh their summers day or muse their silent hours away the oreads liked the climate well and taught the level plain to swell in verdant mounds from whence the eye might all their larger works descry the naiads poured their urns around from nodding rocks over vales profound they formed their streams to please the view and bade them wind as serpents do and having shown them where to stray threw little pebbles in their way these fancy allsagacious maid had at their several tasks surveyed she saw and smiled and often would lead our damons foot over hill and mead there with descriptive finger trace the genuine beauties of the place and when she all its charms had shown prescribe improvements of her own  see yonder hill so green so round  its brow with ambient beeches crowned  twould well become thy gentle care  to raise a dome to venus there  pleased would the nymphs thy zeal survey  and venus in their arms repay  twas such a shade and such a nook  in such a vale near such a brook  from such a rocky fragment springing  that famed apollo chose to sing in  there let an altar wrought with art  engage thy tuneful patrons heart  how charming there to muse and warble  beneath his bust of breathing marble  with laurel wreath and mimic lyre  that crown a poets vast desire  then near it scoop the vaulted cell  where musics charming maids the muses may dwell  prone to indulge thy tender passion  and make thee many an assignation  deep in the groves obscure retreat  be placed minervas sacred seat  there let her awful turrets rise  for wisdom flies from vulgar eyes  there her calm dictates shall thou hear  distinctly strike thy listening ear  and who would shun the pleasing labor  to have minerva for his neighbor in short so charmed each wild suggestion its truth was little called in question and damon dreamed he saw the fauns and nymphs distinctly skim the lawns now traced amid the trees and then lost in the circling shades again with leer oblique their lover viewing  and cupid  panting  and pursuing   fancy enchanting fair he cried  be thou my goddess thou my guide  for thy bright visions i despise  what foes may think or friends advise  the feigned concern when folks survey  expense time study cast away  the real spleen with which they see  i please myself and follow thee thus glowed his breast by fancy warmed and thus the fairy landscape charmed but most he hoped his constant care might win the favor of the fair and wandering late through yonder glade he thus the soft design betrayed  ye doves for whom i reared the grove  with melting lays salute my love  my delia with your notes detain  or i have reared the grove in vain  ye flowers which early spring supplies  display at once your brightest dies  that she your opening charms may see  or what were else your charms to me  kind zephyr brush each fragrant flower  and shed its odours round my bower  or never again o gentle wind  shall i in thee refreshment find  ye streams if ever your banks i loved  if ever your native sounds improved  may each soft murmur sooth my fair  or oh twill deepen my despair  be sure ye willows you be seen  arrayed in liveliest robes of green  or i will tear your slighted boughs  and let them fade around my brows  and thou my grott whose lonely bounds  the melancholy pine surrounds  may she admire thy peaceful gloom  or thou shall prove her lovers tomb and now the lofty domes were reared loud laughed the squires the rabble stard  see neighbors what our damons doing  i think some folks are fond of ruin  i saw his sheep at random stray   but he has thrown his crook away   and builds such huts as in foul weather  are fit for sheep nor shepherd neither whence came the sober swain misled why phoebus put it in his head phoebus befriends him we are told and phoebus coins bright tuns of gold twere prudent not to be so vain on it i think he will never touch a grain on it and if from phoebus and his muse mere earthly laziness ensues it is plain for aught that i can say the devilish inspires as well as they so they  while fools of grosser kind less weeting what our bard designed impute his schemes to real evil that in these haunts he met the devil he owned though their advice was vain it suited wights who trod the plain for dullness  though he might abhor it in them he made allowance for it nor wondered if beholding mottoes and urns and domes and cells and grottoes folks little dreaming of the muses were plagued to guess their proper uses but did the muses haunt his cell or in his dome did venus dwell did pallas in his counsels share the delian god reward his prayer or did his zeal engage the fair when all the structure shone complete not much convenient wondrous neat adorned with gilding painting planting and the fair guests alone were wanting ah me it was damons own confession came poverty and took possession part the fourth why droops my damon whilst he roves through ornamented meads and groves near columns obelisks and spires which every critic eye admires it is poverty detested maid sole tenant of their ample shade it is she that robs him of his ease and bids their very charms displease but now by fancy long controlled and with the sons of taste enrolled he deemed it shameful to commence first minister to commonsense far more elated to pursue the lowest talk of dear virtue and now behold his lofty soul that whilome flew from pole to pole settle on some elabrate flower and like a be the sweets devour now of a rose enamored prove the wild solicitudes of love now in a lilys cup enshrined forego the commerce of mankind as in these toils he wore away the calm remainder of his day conducting sun and shade and shower as most might glad the newborn flower so fate ordained  before his eye  starts up the longsought butterfly while fluttering round her plumes unfold celestial crimson dropped with gold adieu ye bands of flowerets fair the living beauty claims his care for this he strips  nor bolt nor chain could damons warm pursuit restrain see him over hill morass or mound wherever the speckled game is found though bent with age with zeal pursue and totter toward the prey in view nor

but find at last we vainly strive to fix the worst coquette alive o you that with assiduous flame have long pursued the faithless dame forsake her soft abodes a while and dare her frown and slight her smile nor scorn whatever wits may say the footpath road the kings highway no more the scruplous charmer teaze but seek the roofs of honest ease the rival fair no more pursued shall there with forward pace intrude shall there her every art essay to win you to her slighted sway and grant your scorn a glance more fair than ever she gave your fondest prayer but would you happiness pursue partake both ease and pleasure too would you through all your days dispense the joys of reason and of sense or give to life the most you can let social virtue shape the plan for does not to the virtuous deed a train of pleasing sweets succeed or like the sweets of wild desire did social pleasures ever tire yet midst the group be some preferred be some abhorred  for damon erred and such there are  of fair address  as twere unsocial to caress o learn by reasons equal rule to shun the praise of knave or fool then though you deem it better still to gain some rustic squires good will and souls however mean or vile like features brighten by a smile yet reason holds it for a crime the trivial breast should share thy time and virtue with reluctant eyes beholds this human sacrifice through deep reserve and air erect mistaken damon won respect but could the specious homage pass with any creature but an ass if conscious they who feared the skin would scorn the sluggish brute within what awestruck slaves the towers enclose where persian monarchs eat and doze what prostrate reverence all agree to pay a prince they never see mere vassals of a royal throne the sophis virtues must be shown to make the reverence his own as for thalia  would thou make her thy bride without a portion  take her she will with duteous care attend and all thy pensive hours befriend will swell thy joys will share thy pain with thee rejoice with thee complain will smooth thy pillow plait thy bowers and bind thine aching head with flowers but be this previous maxim known  if thou can feed on love alone if blessed with her thou can sustain contempt and poverty and pain if so  then rifle all her graces  and fruitful be your fond embraces too soon by caitiffspleen inspired sage damon to his groves retired the path

love lurks within the rosy bower and claims the speculative hour ambition finds his calm retreat and bids his pulse too fiercely beat even social friendship duns his ear and cites him to the public

native shore by him deserted some unfriendly strand strange bleak forlorn a desert waste and wild the fleet careend the wind propitious filled the swelling sails the glittering transports waved their pennants gay and halcyons azure wing with flight auspicious skimmd the placid main on her lone couch in tears elvira lay and chid the officious wind the tempting sea and wished a storm as merciless as tore her laboring bosom fondly now she strove to banish passion now the vassal days the captive moments that so smoothly past by many an art recalled now from her lute with trembling fingers called the favorite sounds which henry deigned to praise and now essayed with mimic chains of silken fillets wove to paint her captive state if any fraud might to her love the pleasing scenes prolong and with the dear idea feast the soul but now the chief returned prepared to launch on oceans willing breast and bid adieu to his fair prisoner she soon as she heard his hated errand now no more concealed the raging flame but with a spreading blush and rising sigh the latent pang disclosed  yes generous youth i see thy bosom glow  with virtuous transport that the task is thine  to solve my chains and to my weeping friends  and every longing relative restore  a softeyd maid a mild offenceless prey  but know my soldier never youthful mind  torn from the lavish joys of wild expense  by him he loathed and in a dungeon bound  to languish out his bloom could match the pains  this illstarrd freedom gives my tortured mind  what call i freedom is it that these limbs  from rigid bolts secure may wander far  from him i love alas ere i may boast  that sacred blessing some superior power  to mortal kings to sublunary thrones  must loose my passion must unchain my soul  even that i loathe all liberty i loathe  but most the joyless privilege to gaze  with cold indiffrence where desert is love  true i was born an alien to those eyes  i ask alone to please my fortunes crime  and ah this flattered form by dress endeared  to spanish eyes by dress may thine offend  whilst i illfated maid ordained to strive  with customs load beneath its weight expire  yet henrys beauties knew in foreign garb  to vanquish me his form however disguised  to me were fatal no fantastic robe  that ever caprice invented custom wore  or folly smiled on could eclipse thy charms  perhaps by birth decreed by fortune placed  thy countrys foe elviras warmest plea  seems but the subtler accent fraud inspires  my tenderest glances but the specious flowers  that shade the viper while she plots her wound  and can the trembling candidate of love  awake thy fears and can a female breast  by ties of grateful duty bound ensnare  is there no brighter mien no softer smile  for love to wear to dark deceit unknown  heaven search my soul and if through all its cells  lurk the pernicious drop of poisonous guile  full on my senceless head its phiald wrath  may fate exhaust and for my happiest hour  exalt the vengeance i prepare for thee  ah me nor henrys nor his countrys foe  on thee i gazed and reason soon dispelled  dim errors gloom and to thy favored isle  assigned its total merit unrestrained  oh lovely region to the candid eye  twas there my fancy saw the virtues dwell  the loves the graces play and blessed the soil  that nurtured thee for sure the virtues formed  thy generous breast the loves the graces planned  thy shapely limbs relation birth essayed  their partial power in vain again i gazed  and albions isle appeared amidst a tract  of savage wastes the darling of the skies  and thou by nature formed by fate assigned  to paint the genius of thy native shore  it is true with flowers with many a dazzling scene  of burnished plants to lure a female eye  iberia glows but ah the genial sun  that gilds the lemons fruit or scents the flower  on spanish minds a nations nobler boast  beams forth ungentle influences there  sits jealousy enthroned and at each ray  exultant lights his slowconsuming fires  not such thy charming region long before  my sweet experience taught me to decide  of english worth the sound had pleased mine ear  is there that savage coast that rude sojourn  stranger to british worth the worth which forms  the kindest friends the most tremendous foes  first best supports of liberty and love  no let subjected india while she throws  over spanish deeds the veil your praise resound  long as i heard or ere in story read  of english fame my biasd partial breast  wished them success and happiest she i cried  of women happiest she who shares the love  the fame the virtues of an english lord  and now what shall i say blessed be the hour  your fairbuilt vessels touched the iberian shores  blessed did i say the time if i may bless  that loved event let henrys smiles declare  our hearts and cities won will henrys youth  forego its nobler conquest will he slight  the soft endearments of the lovelier spoil  and yet iberias sons with every vow  of lasting faith have sworn these humble charms  were not excelled the source of all their pains  and love her just desert who sues for love  but sues to thee while natives sigh in vain  perhaps in henrys eye for vulgar minds  dissent from his it spreads an hateful stain  on honest fame amid his train to bear  a female friend then learn my gentle youth  not love himself with all the pointed pains  that store his quiver shall seduce my soul  from honors laws elvira once denied  a consorts name more swift than lightning flies  when elements discordant vex the sky  shall blushing from the form she loves retire  yet if the specious wish the vulgar voice  has titled prudence sways a soul like thine  in gems or gold what proud iberian dame  eclipses me nor paint the dreary storms  or hairbreadth escapes that haunt the boundless  and force from tender eyes the silent tear  when memory to the pensive maid suggests deep  in full contrast the safe domestic scene  for these resigned beyond the frantic rage  of conquering heroes brave the female mind  when steeled by love in loves most horrid way  beholds not danger or beholding scorns  heaven take my life but let it crown my love she ceased and ere his words her fate decreed impatient watched the language of his eye there pity dwelt and from its tender sphere sent looks of love and faithless hopes inspired  forgive me generous maid the youth returned  if by thy accents charmed thus long i bore  to let such sweetness plead alas in vain  thy virtue merits more than crowns can yield  of solid bliss or happiest love bestow  but ere from native shores i ploughd the main  to one dear maid by virtue and by charms  alone endeared my plighted vows i gave  to guard my faith whatever chance should wait  my warring sword if conquest fame and spoil  graced my return before her feet to pour  the glittering treasure and the laurel wreath  enjoying conquest then and fame and spoil  if fortune frowned adverse and death forbade  the blissful union with my latest breath  to dwell on medways and marias name  this ardent vow deeprooted from my soul  no dangers tore this vow my bosom fired  to conquer danger and the spoil enjoy  her shall i leave with fair events elate  who crowned mine humblest fortune with her love  her shall i leave who now perchance alone  climbs the proud cliff and chides my slow return  and shall that vessel whose approaching sails  shall swell her breast with ecstasies convey  death to her hopes and anguish to her soul  no may the deep my villain corse devour  if all the wealth iberian mines conceal  if all the charms iberian maids disclose  if thine elvira thine uniting all  thus far prevail  nor can thy virtuous breast  demand what honor faith and love denies  oh happy she rejoined the pensive maid  who shares thy fame thy virtue and thy love  and be she happy thy distinguished choice  declares her worth and vindicates her claim  farewell my luckless hopes my flattering dreams  of rapturous days my guilty suit farewell  yet fond however my plea or deep the wound  that waits my fame let not the random shaft  of censure pieree with me the iberian dames  they love with caution and with happier stars  and oh by pity moved restrain the taunts  of levity nor brand elviras flame  by merit raised by gratitude approved  by hope confirmed with artless truth revealed  let let me say but for one matchles maid  of happier birth with mutual ardour crowned  these radiant gems which burnish happiness  but mock misfortune to thy favrites hand  with care convey and well may such adorn  her cheerful front who finds in thee alone  the source of every transport but disgrace  my pensive breast which doomed to lasting woe  in thee the source of every bliss resign  and now farewell thou darling youth the gem  of english merit peace content and joy  and tender hopes and young desires farewell  attend ye smiling train this gallant mind  back to his native shores there sweetly smooth  his evening pillow dance around his groves  and where he treads with vilets paint his way  but leave elvira leave her now no more  your frail companion in the sacred cells  of some lone cloister let me shroud my shame  there to the matin bell obsequious pour  my constant orisons the wanton loves  and gay desires shall spy the glimmering towers  and wing their flight aloof but rest confirmed  that never shall elviras tongue conclude  her shortest prayer ere henrys dear success  the warmest accent of her zeal employ thus spoke the weeping fair whose artless mind impartial scorned to model her esteem by native customs dress and face and air and manners less nor yet resolved in vain he bound by prior love the solemn vow given and received to soft compassion gave a tender tear then with that kind adieu
