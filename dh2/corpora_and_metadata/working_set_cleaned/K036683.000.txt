e kirkall     the cruel gift a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  by mrs cent livre  london printed for e curl in fleet street and a bettesworth in paternoster row      price   s  to eustace budgell esquire sir those who devote themselves to poetry have but one way of paying the highest favors their returns are only the fruits of that art which they cultivate and they might well bewail this as a partiality in nature were not the gifts of genius sometimes beyond those of fortune men who like your self can give eternity to names they honor have no reason to complain of the muses but such as we who have it in our wills to be grateful and are shortened in the only powers we have to show it feel greater uneasiness from obligations than is easy to be expressed in such a situation we have nothing left but our attempts to please and these your superior geniuses must look upon rather as a homage than a return the effects of our good wishes rather than the accomplishment of our desires  next to being eminent in ones own character to be distinguished by men of excellence is the happiest praise and as one of these is very often introductory to the other so has it happened to you the greatest men among us first observed and cherished your merit and you soon returned the acknowledgment by making that merit useful and ornamental to your country what a noble testimony do your living virtues give to the discernment of the late lord halifax that great man had the peculiar happiness of making wit and learning not only a qualification for his friendship but of service to the business and management of public affairs the familiarity you have always entertained with the first men of letters and the applause with which you have acted and still continue to act in the sphere of business are equally to your honor and have set your character as much above flattery as detraction  for my part it has always been my ambition to desire the good opinion of men of your turn and i never have or shall be ashamed of publishing the virtues of those who have been eminent in their services for our king country and legal constitution and in this view if any thing of mine can reach so far would i be looked upon by posterity  in the mean time i cannot but congratulate my country for breeding such gallant free spirits who like your self have rose up in opposition to the two most implacable powers that can be let loose upon mankind tyranny and popery it is your praise sir to have acted a most noble part on this account in the irish senate a country more than once the scene of the most dreadful massacres but now by the actions of you and your fellow patriots happily recovered from the same threatening and oh too near impending persecution  such public services as these though they give joy and blessings to a whole nation yet they more nearly affect those who have a share in your esteem among the great number that your merit have made your friends i am proud to be accounted one and to have it known to the world i had your permission to prefix your name to this tragedy i shall be very negligent with the critics and set my heart at rest on account of the envious if it has the good fortune in the least to please and divert one hour of your retirement it comes to you with sincere wishes for a happy newyear for a long and uninterrupted health and that you may remain what now you are an ornament to the post you fill and blessing to the nation you are happily planted in are the hearty wishes and prayers of  sir your most obliged and most obedient humble servant susanna cent livre  prologue spoken by mr wilks by mr sewell this play i wonder how the thing could hold is if i reckon right two winters old it should have courted you the last hard frost but you in ice and politics were lost two slippery things  some know it to their cost the prudent mother therefore with good reason weaned not this child before a better season wellpleased sne sees the madness of the age spent in an impotent successless rage from civil life transfer your horrors here and give to tragedy its proper sphere our woman says for it is a womans wit that single word will gain us half the pit this is her first attempt in tragickstuff and here is intrigue and plot and love enough the devils in it if the sex cannot write those things in which they take the most delight if she has touched these scenes with artful care be kind and all her smaller failings spare the ladies sure will ease a womans fears for common pitys sake the men for thiers on hopes like these her tragedy depends not on confedrate clubs of clapping friends disposed in parties to support her cause and bully you by noise into applause if she must sue she scorns those vulgar arts but fain by nobler means would win your hearts tell you she wears her country in her breast and is as firmly loyal as the best then bid your hearts their kindest prayers convey and meet your coming monarch on his way who from one peaceful journey brings us more than our long list of conquering kings before for never did britains hopes so highly tower or promise such a glorious stretch of power as on that day which shall to council bring the bravest senate and the greatest king whose ripening schemes shall distant nations rule make tyrants tremble

commands smile on the man thou hate caress him to inevitable ruin from foolish pity guard thy welltaught mind to women leave the fond deceiver love that bar to glory and to great revenge think not of friendship more than of a word which once gone forth is lost in idle air  lear is this the language of paternal love forbid it all good men that i should think so you mean to prove my soul and it is most just for many wear the borrowed mask of goodness but i was made in scorn of artifice superior virtue is my awful goddess my pleasing motive and my wished reward whether she leads me to the active field or the more dangerous court she guides my life fame honor wealth when by her hand bestowed with grateful joy submissive i will receive them but offered by the world in lieu of her with scorn i would throw them back as empty trifles unworthy of an honest mans regard  ante dull moralist have thou no taste of power no thirst of glory no ambitious longings to raise thy soul and bear thee up to empire and can thou let lorenzo tower above thee call to remembrance all thy noble ancestors who all fell victims to the rage of his consider this then think if thou art injured enough to prompt thee to a great revenge  lear far be the thought of vengeance from my soul i view with equal justice friends and enemies pride may perhaps pronounce this weakness in me no matter what the haughty mind suggests i would rather wear the name of good than great  ante why this is finely said  lear for lorenzo since my royal master whose great undoubted right has power to give bestowed on him the honors which i wore long may they slourish with him who shall dare blame you in giving or resuming favors then ought we sir to impose on majesty what in our selves we would not bear  ante go on go on pursue this darling vapor unthinking to what precipice it leads extol lorenzo dwell upon his praise and help to swell the popular applause forget the conquests that have crowned thy valor the numerous wounds thou have sustained in battle for this insulting this ungrateful king  lear wore not my sword the freedom of my country wounds lose their smart in such a glorious cause he who for interest or for base revenge should in a private quarrel sell his foe deserves the scorn of every good man for it but he who would enslave his native land give up the reverend rights of law and justice to the detested lust of boundless tyranny pollute our altars change our holy worship deserves the curses both of heaven and earth and from society of human kind to be cast forth among the beasts of prey a monster far more savage  ante excellent  lear for me  i know no glory but my countrys good nor anger bear against any but her foes but all her enemies are mine for her i would make this body one entire scar ere i would see my country made a prey or know the king to whom i have sworn distressed and this i hold to be all brave mens duty  ante matchless stupidity  art thou from me from my strong blood derived and can thy ebbing pulses beat so low so distant from the vigor of my soul but spite of artifice i see quite through thee ill do thou hide from me the hated cause of this tame suffering this bastard patience deaf to ambition foolish love betrays thee lorenzos sister antimora reigns the powerful mistress over thy heart and fame thy easy mind fond of the slavish yoke forgets her haughty brother soars above thee i bad thee lift thine eyes to leonora the beauteous hope of this fair kingdom  lear yes that guilty thought of yours undid me oh was it not that finding your ambition the angry king to scatter all your hopes ruined guiltless me  ante well i remember his ungrateful rage remember it with just indignation and thou as soon might think to reconcile the eternal quarrel between death and nature as quench my eager thirst of vengeance yet i dissembled well my injuries and soothed the fiery king with so much art the bold proposal was mistook for zeal to keep the beauteous leonora with us twas thus the monarchs favor i regained his wanting this experienced head for council when that old sophister alcanor died i rose again prime minister of state and now have in my view a brave design of which thou art unworthy to partake  lear my want of merit is my pride in this for where revenge and fraud are of the party i would not be admitted   ante you would not sir  but though crowns and power want charms to move thee and injury seems to have lost her pointed sting when thou shall know that antimoras given a pledge of friendship from her brothers hand to his dear favorite and fellowwarrior i know thy spirits will be all awake  lear ha  ante yes that dangerous maid who has misled thee for whom all filial duty is forgot all wrongs forgiven all ambition quenched must be cardonos wife   lear i know lorenzo loves the man you mention but that he is to wed fair antimora is all a dream worked up by waking malice the souls of martyrs mounting from the flame are not more brightly spotless than her faith but you have leave to say whatever you please and i unruffld will with calmness hear you  ante go on young stoic bless these pair of friends go bend thy knee to this young favorite low resign thy mistress to the others arms and be renowned for patience  lear when i do that let infamy and shame pursue and blot the name of soldier from me give up my mistress quit the maid i love as soon i would give up my post in war resign the soul which animates this frame and to that latest nothing be reduced where love and glory cease  but oh i rave her brothers power no not the kings command can shock her faith   ante build not thy hopes upon a womans faith but join with me and greatly be revenged i have the means lorenzos in my snare deep as the grave i have traced his erring steps and seen him safe within the toils of fate once more i warn thee to throw off thy love wake from this idle amorous lethargy and shun that falling house like loss of honor exert thy soul and aid my great design or from this moment you are no more my son ex  lear would i indeed were not unhappy thought enter agonistus my agonistus  oh much i wanted thee and thou art come even to share misfortunes with thy friend thou kind thou best companion of my youth thou partner in my dangers well i know thee should father king and every star frown on me thou would not forsake me  ag much sooner shall this fertile kingdom change her happy pregnant soil for sterile sand than i sorsake my friend  come be not sad thou will again regain thy masters favor  lear thou know me not  il thou do think i in the least regard whom fortune mounts upon her giddy wheel or over what favorite she insulting drives a softer care does all my thoughts employ love agonistus is the fatal source from whence my sorrows spring  ag i have guessed it long but knew not to what fair your vows were paid  lear now i will tell thee all the important story and ease my burdened heart of half its load thou art well acquainted with that ancient hate between lorenzos family and mine and must remember to have heard at least his grandfather when overpowered by faction from court exiled passed many years in venice during which time his son the lord alcanor married a beautiful venetian lady and he had issue by her this lorenzo and antimora of whom she died in childbed soon after this his father also died alcanor strait employed his friends to obtain leave from the king for his return to lombardy the king gave leave he came and lived obscurely in sullen solitude and haughty privacy  ag i do remember to have heard this story  lear in a lone ancient seat alcanor lived hard by a castle which belonged to us twas there i first beheld fair antimora and gazing caught and gathered growing love bright as a sylvan goddess she appeared and shot her beauteous beams into my soul in some disguise i waited every day till in one happy evening i at last met her as she was walking forth alone with trembling awe i ventured to approach her and on my knees i begged that she would hear the truest passion that ever warmed a lover  ag and she consented   lear at first she heard with caution still objecting our houses hatred and my prosperous fate and charged me to suppress the growing flame and fix my choice on some more happy maid whose ample fortunes and whose equal merit might vindicate my love   ag thus minds formed truly great bear up their port  lear but still i pressed and told the lovely fair one my wakeful restless agonies of heart my eager fondness and my growing fears the pains of doubt and horror of despair with every care which racks a lovers breast at length the ardor of my servent vows drew from her snowy bosom unawares a pitying sigh and from her eyes a tear the rich reward of many anxious minutes at last she spoke and blessed me with this promise if there be yet a smiling hour behind that shall the grandeur of our house restore you who have loved me in this ebb of fortune shall find a grateful sense in antimora  ag she is indeed a miracle of goodness  lear she gave me leave to see her every day but soon alas my fathers waking jealousy discovered where my constant vows were paid and urged the king i might be sent abroad the turkish war concluded just before and lombardy was by this arm in peace and cause no warlike expedition offered i bore a peaceful embassy to rome before i went i saw the lovely maid and told her all the cunning of my father with all the trouble of my soul at parting she bid me go and said it was my duty to serve my king in peace as well as war then breathed a sigh and promised to be faithful twas thus we parted soon after i was gone oh agonistus fain i would forget it my father all our letters intercepted and blinded with the dazling luster of a throne raised his ambitious thoughts to leonora and dared to ask her for my services  ag unlucky thought  lear oh most abhorred ambition for this my father was displaced from court and lord alcanor grew again in favor the tuscan war about that time broke out when this lorenzo this young rivalwarrior had first the honor to command our forces he rose in favor whilst i set in shame  ag swiftly he rose as if the goddess fortune became enamored with his many graces no sooner seen but all her smiles were on him  lear for this i was recalled disgraced upbraided ruined and banished from the sight of antimora beneath her window wet with baleful dew all night i lay and told each star my grief she praised my change confessed the princes charms and all access denied to wretched me till love long tortured on the rack of grief convinced her of my muchwrongd innocence she smiled and bid me hope a better day but oh what day can i expect to see if what my father told me now be true cardono weds the beauteous antimora but haste my friend tell her learchus dies when ever she makes that hated rival happy  ag i fly but see the friends appear  lear ha how quick my spirits move i am all on fire what headstrong rage does jealousy inspire this is the court safe from unhallowed strife when next we meet guard well that hated life thou shall dispute my antimoras charms and through this breast make passage to her arms ex  enter lorenzo and cardono lor was that learchus parted hence  card it was  lor they say his mind is rich in every virtue a stranger to his fathers cankered malice and of a friendly nature yet i know not something there is that whispers to my soul beware that race  card oh most prophetic thought teach antimora to beware it too forgive my fears lovers have watchful eyes or i mistake or he is much too happy  lor the error of thy fondness nothing more she is the daughter of antipathy nursed up in hate to that invetrate house and like my self unalterable  card fain oh very fain would i believe thee my hopes are centered in that blooming maid and life without her is not worth my care yet when i speak of my excessive passion to me she seems more cold than mountainsnow and hears with unconcern what ever i say but if by chance some one learchus name a conscious blush oerspreads her face and strait she turns away to hide the rising joy  lor sure my friend thou do mistake her looks that bold aspirer most abhorred antenor once dared to ask the princess for his son oh were it but for that presumptuous guilt i would sooner wed my sister to dishonor to misery or death than to learchus but see she comes as i appointed her i mean by gentle means to aid thy suit  card the powers above assist thee  enter antimora ant cardono with him oh my boading heart aside  card who can describe the lovers painful pleasure at the approach of his enchanting fair  anti i come to know my dearest brothers will  lor come nearer sister why do tremble so have thou a cause for fear my antimora  anti i hope i need not fear my gentle brother whilst you are safe from wars destructive rage and bless me with your smiles i have no fear  lor am i then dear to thee tell me my sister  anti dear as my life my virtue or my fame you are the fondest truest best of brothers tender and careful as a guardian angel since gracious heaven took my father from me thy kind indulgence has supplied his care that providence may crown thy hopes and wishes is each returning morn my first request  lor if thou would have me credit these fond accents which more if possible endear thee to me look on cardono  on this suffering youth who treasures all his future hopes in thee pity his sorrows and prevent his fate and if no other merit reach thy knowledge remember that he is my friend  anti that speaks him of a noble nature sir and i shall still regard him with esteem  card too weak a cordial to my fainting heart that sickens with despair aside  lor esteem think i prithee what i owe him and help me to discharge the mighty debt often in the field he has my life preserved when warmed with slaughter i have rushed too far and plunged my self amongst my thickest foes hemmed round with death and yet he broke through all resolved to rescue or to perish with me  anti superior virtue cannot miss reward  lor thou must reward him sister yes thou must if i have any interest in thy breast if i have well obeyed our fathers charge and been a father to thee or if thou have not forgot his dying last command never to wed without my approbation then if thoudst know me happy make him so  anti forbear thou kind protector of my youth forbear to wound thy antimora thus nor vainly ask what i can never grant there was a time you would have sought my peace give me not cause to think you love me less  lor you are dearer to me than the smiles of kings my hopes of glory or immortal fame and therefore it is that i would place thee here safe in the arms of this deserving man who merits and who fondly loves thee  anti think you my lord cardono this the way use you authority to gain your wishes power may dispose of life but rest assured a generous mind can never be compelled  card alas my friend your kindness has undone me  lor take heed my sister how you wake mine anger which will like lightning blast thy unwary soul is there a form thy erring choice prefers to this brave man my rage will find him out and hurl a swift destruction on his head nay do not weep tears will avail thee nothing can it be possible thou should forget from whence thou art and listen to learchus the son of that vile parricide antenor detested thought  anti oh wretched antimora  lor ha dare thou to sigh for him degenerate wretch then hear me madam and observe me well teach thy fond heart taccept the proffered good or from thy disobedience date long woe affection shall give place to vowed severity unseen unnamd unpitied shall thou live and waste the tedious hours

any other way  card oh hold lorenzo i can bear no more raises her jealousy disappointments and despair are joys to what my heart this moment feels she must have ease whatever comes of me  anti where have you lost your wonted tenderness think if our dearest father now were living and should impose such harsh commands on you against your inclination charge you wed or if like me you loved where ties of duty make that love a crime what would you do  lor she touches me indeed  prithee comply  anti if antimora may have leave to plead if i have yet a place in your esteem if from your breast you have not razed me quite give to my throbbing heart a little time to weigh the many cares which hang upon it and i must beg that you my lord cardono no longer would insist upon his power urge not a cause that may increase debate between the kindest most united pair that ever one mother bore  card severe request but i obey  lor take thy desire my sister but remember that if you would preserve a brothers love let not the woman sway thee to thy ruin go then i say and summon all thy reason direct the balance with an even hand consider duty honor gratitude are poised against that trifle inclination then let impartial judgment guide thy choice tear from thy virgin breast the inglorious passion if thou regardst thy own or brothers fame  car remember my despair for the same breath which makes him happy gives me certain death ex lorenzo and cardono  anti what dire malignant planet ruled my fate why was i born to love where i should hate where i should hate no i should all things love such are the dictates of the powers above then what they teach they surely will defend on their great care shall all my hopes depend to crown my love or give my life an end exit  enter antenor and hears her last words ante curse on thy brother how i hate his sight yet like his evil genius i pursue him i have alarmed the king that work is over and now the ambassadors from tuscany pursuant to the advice i sent that duke bring with them propositions for a marriage and with unwearied diligence attend and watch those steps which bring his ruin on between that prince and leonora to day they have their audience of the king methinks it suits my purpose well but see the king appears  enter king king where art thou hid antenor when most i want thee thou do shun me most i like it not  ant what would my gracious lord  king thou have conveyed a sting into my breast which still the more i labor to draw forth with double anguish deeper points its way what do thou know that has so greatly moved thee to instill the subtle poison of distrust and stir my nature up against my child  ant if my incessant duty careful fears ever upon the guard for you and glory offend my royal master i am silent forgive my zeal and i will observe no more  king i know ambition is thy darling sin bating that i do believe thee honest then leave these doubling arts and speak thy purpose why do thou sigh and fold thy aged arms expressive signs of some approaching mischief still warning me in whispers as i pass to observe the princess leonora  ant this i have done but if i am too loyal too sincere if apprehension grows too swift in me give up the charge you did entrust me with to some more worthy of your confidence who when they have obeyed your strict command and learnt each private motion of your court may cautiously discover what will please and pass in silence what you fear to know  king tortures and death pierce me at once and speak whatever it be and rid my expectation some secret plot against my life and crown much rather had i hear of brooding treason of raging pestilence or blazing cities prodigious earthquakes universal ruin than ought which touches leonoras fame  ant that i had died ere given the secret vent i beg your majesty will urge no more this hated subject  king urge not my temper no i charge thee do not thou have raised my curiosity so high or give me ease or racks shall force it from thee  ant what sad distraction tears my aged breast oh think how much the tale will wound you sir and let me keep the fatal secret hid  king speak i command thee  ant oh my tortured soul the princess loves   king say thou ha whom does she love  ant the fatal secret trembles on my tongue and fears to fall  lorenzo  king ha have a care i shall not credit this too easily  ant alas great sir my heart would dance with joy could i but doubt the wretched truth i tell which i shall ever mourn but it is most certain her heart and beauteous person are bestowed on that selected man   king traitor it is false i know thou hatst lorenzo the ancient quarrel twixt his blood and thine has made a villain of thee   ant this i feared oh hard return for loyalty  king if thou do not prove this accusation thy head shall answer it  ant be it as you say if i discover not near to the bower a place through which at midnight he is let in and sure the purpose is not hard to guess  king do this antenor and my heart is thine my pulse beats high impatient of revenge and speech grows painful choked with indignation down all my wild resentments for a while and let me see and judge like majesty oh leonora if you are fallen so low to hold thy nightly revels with my slave there is not a rack thy crimes can make me feel but i will double it upon you both lingering unheard of torments you shall prove and curse the fatal sweets of guilty love exeunt  the end of the first act act ii scene a room of state the king and leonora seated on a throne attended by antenor lorenzo

master much renowned in arms witness the many conquests he has gained though victory of late declared for you charged us to say success is not infurd you cannot bribe the fickle goddess stay she will not long forsake his vetran bands choice hardened troops unused to fly the field but yet to cultivate a friendship with you so firm and strict it may to ages last yet even now whilst ready warriors wait he offers peace  king on what conditions does your master send  emb conditions sir he did not term em so but supplication to your royal will that this fair princess beauteous leonora would with your leave receive him for her husband  lor ha  emb and join the long disputed lands in peace to these of lombardy  ant i see lorenzo gathers up his brows this proposal stings him to the soul aside  king had he been conqueror thus he might have asked but tell your duke i have not yet forgotten his great injustice to the duke of milan he took the advantage of the turkish war when all my force was bent against the infidels to chase my uncle from his dukedom forth and set a bold usurper in his stead these twenty years he has an exile been he and one only son nor know we where or to what country if alive they are driven by which my daughter is become the heir of this my kingdom yet i will not force her will but leave it free and therefore she shall answer ye  lor a thousand blessings follow that indulgence aside  leon since i have my royal fathers leave to speak i tell you sirs that your request is bold your sinking master half subdued demands our populous kingdom to recruit his own and i must be the passport to convey it there is more ambition in his eyes than love it is for my dowry not for me he sues tell him i scorn his offer with his crown and when though long avert it gracious heaven this happy kingdom shall devolve on me i will defend it with my utmost strength to this small tract of earth whereon i stand ever give a nation to a vanquished foe he should have been the monarch of the world his conquering legions drawn around our walls his battring cannon playing on the town and dreadsul famine raging through the streets our trembling maids and matrons drowned in

majesty approve this scorn  king i do so tell your duke from me  mb then once again prepare for battle sir you will find our master strong enough to cope ye and make you well repent this haughty port

fierce in peace the child of softness one would imagine envys self might spare thee  lor the mighty favors which you heap upon me my royal master fill my soul with gratitude  king but wherefore keeps learchus from our presence is there not room in hearts of mighty kings to hold the worth of all deserving men  lear i attend your majesty  king come near learchus thou have served me well and though of late thou have not fought my battles for secret reasons from thy charge removed i love thee still and to confirm i do i make thee governor of the citadel and royal fort  lear my life shall answer for the important trust will antimora come to agonistus  ago she answered me in tears she would aside to him  ant the king seems greatly pleased and wisely hides the purpose he intends  short are your joys ye false ones aside  leon the king my lord is lavish in your praise but where should grateful monarchs cast their smiles if not on heroes that have served them truly  lor i plead no merit for my service madam i owe my princes bounty this applause if i see thee not this night my laurels fade and certain death ever morning will overtake me aside to leonora  leon we are observed the passage shall be open  ant by their eyes i know the appointments made that whisper told the hour  did they but know how very fatal i shall make their meeting their inclination would grow cool upon it it joys my soul to think i shall undo them  king meet me here some moments hence antenor and now let all withdraw but leonora exeunt daughter methinks this day youre doubly mine your words contained what ere my heart could wish in thee alone i treasure all my hopes and have in thee forgot thy mothers loss and well i think thou will deserve this fondness say will thou not my child surely thou will and never be justly cast from out my breast  leon alas what means my father why this caution  king you have this day disdained a sovereign prince let no mean choice disgrace so just a pride and sully all thy virgin fame at once but like my child like thee apparent heir of our fair lombardy support thy grandeur  leon my heart beats fast at the alarm of fear aside  king i do remember thou have often told me thy heart burnt only with the fire of greatness and love no converse held within thy bosom and that my glory filled each thought of thine and bore thee up to empire  leon wherein have i betrayed more weakness sir and why am i accused of disobedience  king do i accuse thee leonora no i warn thee only of degenerate love could i accuse i should not argue thus thou know my temper is composed of fire though like the steel when unprovoked it is cool but if the flint of disobedience strikes fierce sparks fly out and threaten ruin round  leon do not i guard the actions of my life with all that dutious care which you directed do i not wait my royal fathers will deny access to all the shining court except in public and by your command i never see the heroes of our age  king pray heaven it prove so aside  leon within the bower by your self asignd do i not pass my time amongst my maids nor once appear but when you call me forth  king all this i know at least i think i know it  leon think grant heaven i am not betrayed aside  king but do not trust to secret management for kings have many eyes and watchful all as those bright lamps of heaven that wake forever they can though all the curtains of the night be drawn and solemn darkness reigns around discover every action of their court  leon it is so and we are certainly undone i cannot guess what it is my father means or what the purport of your words intend if any villain has traduced my fame and rendered me suspected to your majesty give me to know my vile accuser strait and let the wretch confront me instantly  king if thou art innocent as i hope thou art then thou have naught to fear  leon if i am innocent oh my throbing heart flutters and leaps as it would force my breast and must portend some mischief aside enter antenor ha now i no longer am concerned to know who has created all these doubts within you for here here comes the subtle working mole that heaves your breast and breaks the plain of nature purely for mischief and his own revenge that you refused his son still galls his soul the viper seemed but to have lost his sting till he had wound himself into your bosom where he at once might strike your tenderest part  ante alas what have i done my gracious princess  leon go on vile politician i defy thee spread all thy nets and magnify suspicion till it appears great as thy own villainy in a most hideous most gigantick form to fright the world from thy society from thy own bowels spin the poisonous thread that may entangle innocence and honor my spotless fame shall break thy cobwebarts my virtue all thy treacherous plots confound and like a bolt of thunder strike thee to the ground exit leonora  ante i soon shall calm this guilty rage has then my royal lord informed the princess of his suspicion that she is thus provoked against the humblest servant of his will and threatens to destroy me  king if what thou have declared be honest truth thou can not fear thou have a king thy guard but take thou heed be careful in the proof thou see she does defy thee  ante her passion shows her guiltiness the more it is the nature of the sex to do it they think to screen their faults with empty clamor and stop our just resentments with their noise but if your majesty discovered ought that may instruct her to prevent our purpose then i must fall a sacrifice indeed  king you are safe from that proceed and say have thou learnt more since last i saw thee  ante this night i know they meet i have placed a spy who is to give me notice when they are met and then   king then they shall part for ever  ante please you to walk toward the laurelgrove where i have ordered this old spy to meet us  king thy words but add fresh fuel to my flame lead on and let me view at once my shame and with his blood wash off the inglorious stain exeunt  enter learchus meeting antimora in tears lear why do thou dress those beauteous eyes in tears why does thy bosom thus with sorrows heave where are the gares of soft consenting love to breath new life and wake my dying hopes  anti alas learchus fates become our foe and now the fatal warrants issued forth to blast our loves and part our meeting souls else why should such a faithful pair as we so often be obstructed in our happiness  lear oh much i fear my father spoke too true aside what means my love has there some new misfortune sprung up to intercept our promised joy  anti is not thy father fond of wealth and power and deaf to all thy tender sighs of love his cruel nature never will forgive nor will my brother bear to hear
