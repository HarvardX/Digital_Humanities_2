sketches of the history of man  volume iv  sketches of the history of man  in four volumes  by henry home lord kaims author of elements of criticism etc  volume iv  dublin printed for james williams no   skinnerrow mdcclxxiv  sketches of the history of man sketch ii principles and progress of morality the science of morals like other sciences is in a very imperfect state among savages and arrives at maturity among enlightened nations by very slow degrees this progress points out the historical part as first in order but as that history would give little satisfaction without a rule for comparing the morals of different ages and of different nations i begin with the principles of morality such as ought to govern at all times and in all nations the present sketch accordingly is divided into two parts in the first the principles are unfolded and the second is altogether historical  part i principles of morality sect i human actions analyzed the hand of god is no where more visible than in the nice adjustment of our internal frame to our situation in this world an animal is endued with a power of selfmotion and in performing animal functions requires not any external aid this more especially is the case of man the noblest of terrestrial beings his heart beats his blood circulates his stomach digests evacuations proceed etc etc by what means not surely by the laws of mechanism which are far from being adequate to such operations the operations mentioned are effects of an internal power bestowed on man for preserving life the power is exerted uniformly and without interruption independent of will and without consciousness  man is a being susceptible of pleasure and pain these generate desire to attain what is agreeable and to shun what is disagreeable and he is enabled by other powers to gratify his desires one power termed instinct is exerted indeed with consciousness but blindly without will and without intention to produce any effect brute animals act for the most part by instinct hunger prompts them to eat and cold to take shelter knowingly indeed but without exerting any act of will and without foresight of what will happen infants of the human species little superior to brutes are like brutes governed by instinct they lay hold of the nipple without knowing that sucking will satisfy their hunger and they weep when pained without any view of relief akin to these are certain habitual acts done without thought such as snuffing or grinning custom enables one to move the fingers on an instrument of music without being directed by will the motion is often too quick for an act of will some arrive at great perfection in the art of balancing the slightest deviation from the just balance is instantly redressed were a preceding act of will necessary it would be too late an unexpected hollow in walking occasions a violent shock is not this evidence that external motion is governed by the mind frequently without consciousness and that in walking the body is adjusted beforehand to what is expected  another power is governed by intention and will in the progress from infancy to maturity the mind opens to objects without end of desire and of aversion the attaining or shunning of which depend more or less on our own will we are placed in a wide world left to our own conduct and we are by nature provided with a proper power for performing what we intend and will the actions we perform by this power are termed voluntary there still remain another species of actions termed involuntary as where we act by some irresistible motive against our will an action may be voluntary though done with reluctance as where a man to free himself from torture reveals the secrets of his friend his confession is voluntary though drawn from him with great reluctance but let us suppose that after the firmest resolution to reveal nothing his mind is unhinged by exquisite torture the discovery he makes may be justly termed involuntary he speaks indeed but he is compelled to it absolutely against his will  man is by his nature an accountable being answerable for his conduct to god and man in doing any action that wears a double face he is prompted by his nature to explain the same to his relations his friends his acquaintance and above all to those who have authority over him he hopes for praise for every right action and dreads blame for every one that is wrong but for what sort of actions does he hold himself accountable not surely for an instinctive action which is done blindly without intention and without will neither for an involuntary action because it is extorted from him against his will and least of all for actions done without consciousness such as those which preserve life what only remain are voluntary actions which are either right or wrong such actions are done wittingly and willingly for these we must answer if at all accountable and for these every man in conscience holds himself bound to answer  and now more particularly upon voluntary actions to intend and to will though commonly held synonymous signify different acts of the mind intention respects the effect will respects the action that is exerted for producing the effect it is my intention for example to relieve my friend from distress upon seeing him it is my will to give him a sum for his relief the external act of giving follows and my friend is relieved which is the effect intended but these internal acts though in their nature different are always united i cannot will the means without intending the effect and i cannot intend the effect without willing the means to incline to resolve to intend to will are acts of the mind relative to external action these several acts are well understood though they cannot be defined being perfectly simple   some effects of voluntary action follow necessarily a wound is an effect that necessarily follows the stabbing a person with a dagger death is a necessary effect of throwing one down from the battlements of a high tower some effects are probable only i labor in order to provide for my family fight for my country to rescue it from oppressors take physic for my health in such cases the event intended does not necessarily nor always follow  a man when he wills to act must intend the necessary effect a person who stabs certainly intends to wound but where the effect is probable only a man may act without intending the effect that follows a stone thrown by me at random into the marketplace may happen to wound a man without my intending it one acts by instinct without either will or intention voluntary actions that necessarily produce their effect imply intention voluntary actions when the effect is probable only are sometimes intended sometimes not  human actions are distinguished from each other by certain qualities termed right and wrong but as these make the cornerstone of morality they are reserved to the following section  sect ii division of human actions into right wrong and indifferent the qualities of right and wrong in voluntary actions are universally acknowledged as the foundation of morality and yet philosophers have been strangely perplexed about them the history of their various opinions would signify little but to darken the subject the reader will have more satisfaction in seeing these qualities explained without entering at all into controversy  no person is ignorant of primary and secondary qualities a distinction much insisted on by philosophers primary qualities such as figure cohesion weight are permanent qualities that exist in a subject whether perceived or not secondary qualities such as color taste smell depend on the percipient as much as on the subject being nothing when not perceived beauty and ugliness are qualities of the latter sort they have no existence but when perceived and like all other secondary qualities they are perceived intuitively having no dependence on reason nor on judgment more than color has or smell or taste elements of criticism vol   p  0  edit     the qualities of right and wrong in voluntary actions are secondary like beauty and ugliness and the other secondary qualities mentioned like them they are objects of intuitive perception and depend not in any degree on reason or on judgment no argument is requisite to prove that to rescue an innocent babe from the jaws of a wolf to feed the hungry to clothe the naked are right actions they are perceived to be so intuitively as little is an argument requisite to prove that murder deceit perjury are wrong actions they are perceived intuitively to be so the deity has bestowed on man different faculties for different purposes truth and falsehood are investigated by the reasoning faculty beauty and ugliness are objects of a sense known by the name of taste right and wrong are objects of a sense termed the moral sense or conscience and supposing these qualities to be hid from our perception in vain would we try to discover them by any argument or process of reasoning the attempt would be absurd no less so than an attempt to discover color by reasoning or taste or smell every perception must proceed from some faculty or power of perception termed sense the moral sense by which we perceive the qualities of right and wrong may be considered either as a branch of the sense of seeing by which we perceive the actions to which these qualities belong or as a sense distinct from all others the senses by which objects are perceived are not separated from each other by distinct boundaries and the sorting or classing them seems to depend more on taste and fancy than on nature i have followed the plan laid down by former writers which is to consider the moral sense as a sense distinct from others because it is the easiest and clearest manner of conceiving it   right and wrong as mentioned above are qualities of voluntary actions and of no other kind an instinctive action is beneficial is agreeable but it cannot properly be denominated either right or wrong an involuntary act is hurtful to the agent and disagreeable to the spectator but in the agent it is neither right nor wrong these qualities also depend in no degree on the event thus if to save my friend from drowning i plunge into a river the action is right though i happen to come too late and if i aim a stroke at a man behind his back the action is wrong though i happen not to touch him  the qualities of right and of agreeable are inseparable and so are the qualities of wrong and of disagreeable a right action accordingly is agreeable not only in the direct perception but equally so in every subsequent recollection and in both circumstances equally a wrong action is disagreeable  right actions are distinguished by the moral sense into two kinds viz what ought to be done and what may be done or left undone wrong actions admit not that distinction they are all prohibited to be done to say that an action ought to be done means that we are tied or obliged to perform and to say that an action ought not to be done means that we are restrained from doing it though the necessity implied in the being tied or obliged is not physical but only what is commonly termed moral yet we conceive ourselves deprived of liberty or freedom and necessarily bound to act or to forbear acting in opposition to every other motive the necessity here described is termed duty the moral necessity we are under to forbear harming the innocent is a proper example the moral sense declares the restraint to be our duty which no motive whatever will excuse us for transgressing  the duty of performing or forbearing any action implies a right in some person to exact performance of that duty and accordingly a duty or obligation necessarily infers a corresponding right a promise on my part to pay l  00 confers a right to demand performance the man who commits an injury violates the right of the person injured which entitles him to demand reparation of the wrong  duty is twofold duty to others and duty to ourselves with respect to the former the doing what we ought to do is termed just the doing what we ought not to do and the omitting what we ought to do are termed unjust with respect to ourselves the doing what we ought to do is termed proper the doing what we ought not to do and the omitting what we ought to do are termed improper thus right signifying a quality of certain actions is a genus of which just and proper are species wrong signifying a quality of other actions is a genus of which unjust and improper are species  right actions left to our free will to be done or left undone come next in order they are like the former right when done but they differ in not being wrong when left undone to remit a just debt for the sake of a growing family to yield a subject in controversy rather than go to law with a neighbor generously to return good for ill are examples of this species they are universally approved as right actions but as no person has a right or title to obligue us to perform such actions the leaving them undone is not a wrong no person is injured by the forbearance actions that come under this class shall be termed arbitrary for want of a more proper designation  so much for right actions and their divisions wrong actions are of two kinds criminal and culpable what are done intentionally to produce mischief are criminal such rash or unguarded actions as produce mischief without intention are culpable the former are restrained by punishment to be handled in the  th section the latter by reparation to be handled in the  th  the divisions of voluntary actions are not yet exhausted some there are that properly speaking cannot be denominated either right or wrong actions done merely for amusement or pastime without intention to produce good or ill are of that kind leaping for example running jumping over a stick throwing a stone to make circles in the water such actions are neither approved nor disapproved they may be termed indifferent  there is no cause for doubting the existence of the moral sense more than for doubting the existence of the sense of beauty of seeing or of hearing in fact the perception of right and wrong as qualities of actions is no less distinct and clear than that of beauty of color or of any other quality and as every perception is an act of sense the sense of beauty is not with greater certainty evinced from the perception of beauty than the moral sense is from the perception of right and wrong we find this sense distributed among individuals in different degrees of perfection but there perhaps never existed any one above the condition of an idiot who possessed it not in some degree and were any man entirely destitute of it the terms right and wrong would be to him no less unintelligible than the term color is to one born blind  that every individual is endued with a sense of right and wrong more or less distinct will probably be granted but whether there be among men what may be termed a common sense of right and wrong producing uniformity of opinion as to right and wrong is not so evident there is no absurdity in supposing the opinions of men about right and wrong to be as various as about beauty and deformity and that this supposition is not destitute of foundation we are led to suspect upon discovering that in different countries and even in the same country at different times the opinions publicly espoused with regard to right and wrong are extremely various that among some nations it was held lawful for a man to sell his children for slaves and in their infancy to abandon them to wild beasts that it was held equally lawful to punish children even capitally for the crime of their parent that the murdering an enemy in cold blood was once a common practice that human sacrifices impious no less than immoral according to our notions were of old universal that even in later times it has been held meritorious to inflict cruel torments for the slightest deviations from the religious creed of the plurality and that among the most enlightened nations there are considerable differences with respect to the rules of morality  these facts tend not to disprove the reality of a common sense in morals they only prove that the moral sense has not been equally perfect at all times nor in all countries this branch of the history of morality is reserved for the second part to give some present satisfaction i shall shortly observe that the savage state is the infancy of man during which the more delicate senses lie dormant leaving nations to the authority of custom of imitation and of passion without any just taste of morals more than of the fine arts but nations like individuals ripen gradually and acquire a refined taste in morals as well as in the fine arts after which we find great uniformity of opinion about the rules of right and wrong with few exceptions but what may proceed from imbecility or corrupted education there may be found it is true even in the most enlightened ages men who have singular notions of morality and there may be found the like singularity upon many other subjects which no more affords an argument against a common sense or standard of right and wrong than a monster does against the standard that regulates our external form or than an exception does against the truth of a general proposition  that there is in mankind an uniformity of opinion with respect to right and wrong is a matter of fact of which the only infallible evidence is observation and experience and to that evidence i appeal entering only a caveat that for the reason above given the enquiry be confined to enlightened nations in the mean time i take liberty to suggest an argument from analogy that if there be great uniformity among the different tribes of men in seeing and hearing in pleasure and pain in judging of truth and error the same uniformity ought to hold with respect to right and wrong whatever minute differences there may be to distinguish one person from another yet in the general principles that constitute our nature internal and external there is wonderful uniformity  this uniformity of sentiment which may be termed the common sense of mankind with respect to right and wrong is essential to social beings did the moral sentiments of men differ as much as their faces they would be altogether unqualified for society discord and controversy would be endless and major vis would be the only rule of meum et tuum  but such uniformity of sentiment though general is not altogether universal men there are as above mentioned who differ from the common sense of mankind with respect to various points of morality what ought to be the conduct of such men ought they to regulate their conduct by that standard or by their private conviction there will be occasion afterward to observe that we judge of others as we believe they judge of themselves and that private conviction is the standard for rewards and punishments sect    but with respect to every controversy about property and pecuniary interest and in general about every civil right and obligation the common sense of mankind is the standard and not private conviction or conscience which i shall endeavor to make out as follows  we have an innate sense of a common nature not only in our own species but in every species of animals and that the fact corresponds to our sense of it is verified by experience for there appears a remarkable uniformity in creatures of the same kind and a difformity no less remarkable in creatures of a different kind as that common nature is perceived to be a model or standard for each individual of the kind it raises wonder to find an individual deviating from the common nature of the species whether in its internal or external structure a child born with aversion to its mothers milk is a wonder no less than if born without a mouth or with more than one  secondly the innate sense mentioned dictates that the common nature of man in particular is invariable as well as universal that it will be the same hereafter as it is at present and as it was in time past the same among all nations and in all corners of the earth nor are we deceived because allowing for slight differences occasioned by culture and other accidental circumstances the fact corresponds to our perception  thirdly we perceive that this common nature is right and perfect and that it ought to be a model or standard for every human being any remarkable deviation from it in the structure of an individual appears imperfect or irregular and raises a painful emotion a monstrous birth exciting curiosity in philosophers fails not at the same time to excite aversion in every spectator  this sense of perfection in the common nature of man comprehends every branch of his nature and particularly the common sense of mankind with respect to right and wrong which accordingly is perceived by all to be perfect having authority over all men as the ultimate and unerring standard of morals even in contradiction to private conviction thus a law in our nature binds us to regulate our conduct by that standard its authority is universally acknowledged as nothing is more common in every dispute about meum et tuum than an appeal to it as the ultimate and unerring standard  at the same time as that standard through infirmity or prejudice is not conspicuous to every individual many are misled into erroneous opinions by mistaking a false standard for that of nature and hence a distinction between a right and a wrong sense in morals a distinction which every one understands but which unless for the conviction of a moral standard would be altogether unintelligible  the final cause of this branch of our nature is conspicuous were there no standard of right and wrong for determining endless controversies about matters of interest the strong would have recourse to force the weak to cunning and society would be intolerable courts of law could afford no remedy for without a standard of morals their decisions would be arbitrary and of no authority happy it is for men to be provided with such a standard it is necessary in society that our actions be uniform with respect to right and wrong and in order to uniformity of action it is necessary that our perceptions of right and wrong be also uniform to produce such uniformity a standard of morals is indispensable nature has provided us with that standard which is daily applied by courts of law with success  in reviewing what is said it must afford great satisfaction to find morality established upon the most solid of all foundations viz intuitive perception which is not only a single mental act but is complete in itself having no dependence on any antecedent proposition the most accurate reasoning affords not equal conviction for every sort of reasoning as explained in the sketch immediately foregoing requires not only selfevident truths or axioms to found upon but employs over and above various propositions to bring out its conclusions by intuitive perception solely without reasoning we acquire knowledge of right and wrong of what we may do of what we ought to do and of what we ought to abstain from and considering that we have thus greater certainty of moral laws than of any proposition discoverable by reasoning man may well be deemed a favorite of heaven when he is so admirably qualified for acting the part that is agreeable to his maker the moral sense or conscience is the voice of god within us constantly admonishing us of our duty and requiring from us no exercise of our faculties but attention merely the celebrated lock ventured what he thought a bold conjecture that moral duties might be susceptible of demonstration how agreeable would the discovery have been to him that they are founded upon intuitive perception still more convincing and authoritative  by one branch of the moral sense we are taught what we ought to do and what we ought not to do and by another branch what we may do or leave undone but society would be imperfect if the moral sense stopped here there is no particular that tends more to complete society than what is mentioned in the first section viz that every man is accountable for his conduct to his fellow creatures and he is rendered accountable by a third branch of the moral sense which teaches him that this is his duty and it will be made evident afterward in the  d sketch that we are accountable to our maker as well as to our fellow creatures  to complete this theory i add that an action is right or wrong independent of the actors own opinion thus when a man excited by friendship or pity rescues a heretic from the flames the action is right even though he think it wrong from a conviction that heretics ought to be burnt but we apply a different rule to those who act a man is approved and held to be innocent when he does what he himself thinks right he is disapproved and held to be guilty when he does what he himself thinks wrong thus to assassinate an atheist for the sake of religion is a wrong action and yet the enthusiast who commits that wrong may be innocent and one is guilty who against conscience eats meat in lent though the action is not wrong in short an action is perceived to be right or wrong independent of the actors own opinion but he is approved or disapproved held to be innocent or guilty according to his own opinion  sect iii laws of nature respecting our moral conduct in society a standard being thus established for regulating our moral conduct in society we proceed to investigate the laws that result from it but first we take under consideration what other principles concur with the moral sense to qualify men for society  when we reflect on the different branches of human knowledge it might seem that of all subjects human nature should be the best understood because every man has daily opportunities to study it in his own passions and in his own actions but human nature an interesting subject is seldom left to the investigation of philosophy writers of a sweet disposition and warm imagination hold that man is a benevolent being and that every man ought to direct his conduct for the good of all without regarding himself but as one of the number lord shaftesbury  those of a cold temperament and contracted mind hold him to be an animal entirely selfish to evince which examples are accumulated without end helvetius  neither of these systems is that of nature the selfish system is contradicted by the experience of all ages affording the clearest evidence that men frequently act for the sake of others without regarding themselves and sometimes in direct opposition to their own interest and however much selfishness may prevail in action it certainly prevails not in sentiment and affection all men conspire to put a high estimation upon generosity benevolence and other social virtues while even the most selfish are disgusted with selfishness in others and endeavor to hide it in themselves the most zealous patron of the selfish principle will not venture to maintain that it renders us altogether indifferent about our fellow creatures laying aside selfinterest with every connection of love and hatred good fortune happening to any one is agreeable to all and bad fortune happening to any one is disagreeable to all on the other hand the system of universal benevolence is no less contradictory to experience from which we learn that men commonly are disposed to prefer their own interest before that of others especially where there is no strict connection nor do we find that such bias is opposed by the moral sense man in fact is a complex being composed of principles some benevolent some selfish and these principles are so justly blended in his nature as to fit him for acting a proper part in society it would indeed be losing time to prove that without some affection for his fellow creatures he would be ill qualified for society and it will be made evident afterward sect    that universal benevolence would be more hurtful to society than even absolute selfishness many moralists enter so deeply into one passion or bias of human nature that to use the painters phrase they quite overcharge it thus i have seen a whole system of morals founded upon a single pillar of the inward frame and the entire conduct of life and all the characters in it accounted for sometimes from superstition sometimes from pride and most commonly from interest they forget how various a creature it is they are painting how many springs and weights nicely adjusted and balanced enter into the movement and require allowance to be made for their several clogs and impulses ere you can define its operation and defects enquiry into the life and writings of homer   we are now prepared for investigating the laws that result from the foregoing principles the several duties we owe to others shall be first discussed taking them in order according to the extent of their influence and for the sake of perspicuity i shall first present them in a general view and then proceed to particulars of our duties to others one there is so extensive as to have for its object all the innocent part of mankind it is the duty that prohibits us to hurt others than which no law is more clearly dictated by the moral sense nor is the transgression of any other law more deeply stamped with the character of wrong a man may be hurt externally in his goods in his person in his relations and in his reputation hence the laws do not steal defraud not others do not kill nor wound be not guilty of defamation a man may be hurt internally by an action that occasions to him distress of mind or by being impressed with false notions of men and things therefore conscience dictates that we ought not to treat men disrespectfully that we ought not causelessly to alienate their affections from others and in general that we ought to forbear whatever may tend to break their peace of mind or tend to unqualify them for being good men and good citizens  the duties mentioned are duties of restraint our active duties regard particular persons such as our relations our friends our benefactors our masters our servants it is our duty to honor and obey our parents and to establish our children in the world with all advantages internal and external we ought to be faithful to our friends grateful to our benefactors submissive to our masters kind to our servants and to aid and comfort every one of these persons when in distress to be obliged to do good to others beyond these bounds must depend on positive engagement for as will appear afterward universal benevolence is not a duty  this general sketch will prepare us for particulars the duty of restraint comes first in view that which bars us from harming the innocent and to it corresponds a right in the innocent to be safe from harm this is the great law preparatory to society because without it society could never have existed here the moral sense is inflexible it dictates that we ought to submit to any distress even death itself rather than procure our own safety by laying violent hands upon an innocent person and we are under the same restraint with respect to the property of another for robbery and theft are never upon any pretext indulged it is indeed true that in extreme hunger i may lawfully take food where it can be found and may freely lay hold of my neighbors horse to carry me from an enemy who threatens death but it is his duty as a fellow creature to assist me in distress and when there is no time for delay i may lawfully use what he ought to offer were he present and what i may presume he would offer for the same reason if in a storm my ship be driven among the anchorropes of another ship i may lawfully cut the ropes in order to get free but in every case of this kind it would be a wrong in me to use my neighbors property without resolving to pay the value if my neighbor be bound to aid me in distress conscience binds me to make up his loss this doctrine is obviously founded on justice and yet in the roman law there are two passages which deny any recompense in such cases item labeo scribit si cum vi ventorum navis impulsa esset in funes anchorarum alterius et nautae funes praecidissent si nullo alio modo nisi praecisis funibus explicare se potuit nullam actionem dandam l      ad leg aquil quod dicitur damnum injuria datum aquilia persequi sic erit accipiendum ut videatur damnum injuria datum quod cum damno injuriam attulerit nisi magna vi cogente fuerit factum ut celsus scribit circa eum qui incendii arcendi gratia vicinas aedes intercidit et sive pervenit ignis sive ante extinctus est existimat legis aquiliae actionem cessare l      eod   in english thus in the opinion of labeo if a ship is driven by the violence of a tempest among the anchorropes of another ship and the sailors cut the ropes having no other means of getting free there is no action competent  the aquilian law must be understood to apply only to such damage as carries the idea of an injury along with it unless such injury has not been wilfully done but from necessity thus celsus puts the case of a person who to stop the progress of a fire pulls down his neighbors house and whether the fire had reached that house which is pulled down or was extinguished before it got to it in neither case he thinks will an action be competent from the aquilian law  these opinions are undoubtedly erroneous and it is not difficult to say what has occasioned the error the cases mentioned are treated as belonging to the lex aquilia which being confined to the reparation of wrongs lays it justly down for a rule that no action for reparation can lie where there is no culpa but had labeo and celsus adverted that these cases belong to a different head viz the duty of recompense where one suffers loss by benefitting another they themselves would have had no difficulty of sustaining a claim for making up that loss   the prohibition of hurting others internally is perhaps not essential to the formation of societies because the transgression of that law does not much alarm plain people but where manners and refined sentiments prevail the mind is susceptible of more grievous wounds than the body and therefore without that law a polished society could have no long endurance  by adultery mischief is done both external and internal each sex is so constituted as to require strict fidelity and attachment in a mate and the breach of these duties is the greatest external harm that can befall them it harms them also internally by breaking their peace of mind it has indeed been urged that no harm will ensue if the adultery be kept secret and consequently that there can be no crime where there is no discovery but such as reason thus do not advert that to declare secret adultery to be lawful is in effect to overturn every foundation of mutual trust and fidelity in the married state it is clear beyond all doubt says a reputable writer that no man is permitted to violate his faith and that the man is unjust and barbarous who deprives his wife of the only reward she has for adhering to the austere duties of her sex but an unfaithful wife is still more criminal by dissolving the whole ties of nature in giving to her husband children that are not his she betrays both and joins perfidy to infidelity emile live     veracity is commonly ranked among the active duties but erroneously for if a man be not bound to speak he cannot be bound to speak truth it is therefore only a restraining duty prohibiting us to deceive others by affirming what is not true among the many corresponding principles in the human mind that in conjunction tend to make society comfortable a principle of veracity truth is always uppermost being the natural issue of the mind it requires no art nor training no inducement nor temptation but only that we yield to natural impulse lying on the contrary is doing violence to our nature and is never practiced even by the worst of men without some temptation speaking truth is like using our natural food which we would do from appetite although it answered no end lying is like taking physic which is nauseous to the taste and which no man takes but for some end which he cannot otherwise attain dr reids enquiry into the human mind  and a principle that leads us to rely on human testimony are two without the latter the former would be an useless principle and without the former the latter would lay us open to fraud and treachery the moral sense accordingly dictates that we ought to adhere strictly to truth without regard to consequences  it must not be inferred that we are bound to explain our thoughts when truth is demanded from us by unlawful means words uttered voluntarily are naturally relied on as expressing the speakers mind and if his mind differ from his words he tells a lie and is guilty of deceit but words drawn from a man by torture are no indication of his mind and he is not guilty of deceit in uttering whatever words may be agreeable however alien from his thoughts if the author of the unlawful violence suffer himself to be deceived he ought to blame himself not the speaker  it need scarce be mentioned that the duty of veracity excludes not fable nor any liberty of speech intended for amusement solely  active duties as hinted above are all of them directed to particular persons and the first i shall mention is that which subsists between a parent and child the relation of parent and child the strongest that can exist between individuals binds these persons to exert their utmost powers in mutual good offices benevolence among other bloodrelations is also a duty but not so indispensable being proportioned to the inferior degree of relation  gratitude is a duty directed to the person who has been kind to us but though gratitude is strictly a duty the measure of performance and the kind are left mostly to our own choice it is scarce necessary to add that the active duties now mentioned are acknowledged by all to be absolutely inflexible perhaps more so than the restraining duties many find excuses for doing harm but no one hears with patience an excuse for deviating from truth friendship or gratitude  distress tends to convert benevolence into a duty but distress alone is not sufficient without other concurring circumstances for to relieve every person in distress is beyond the power of any human being our relations in distress claim that duty from us and even our neighbors but distant distress without a particular connection scarce rouses our sympathy and never is an object of duty many other connections too numerous for this short essay extend the duty of relieving others from distress and these make a large branch of equity though in various instances benevolence is thus converted into a duty by distress it follows not that the duty is always proportioned to the degree of distress nature has more wisely provided for the support of virtue a virtuous person in distress commands our pity a vicious person in distress has much less influence and if by vice he have brought on the distress indignation is raised not pity see elements of criticism vol   p     edit     one great advantage of society is the cooperation of many to accomplish some useful work where a single hand would be insufficient arts manufactures and commercial dealings require many hands but as hands cannot be secured without a previous engagement the performance of promises and covenants is upon that account a capital duty in society in their original occupations of hunting and fishing men living scattered and dispersed have seldom opportunity to aid and benefit each other and in that situation covenants being of little use are little regarded but husbandry requiring the cooperation of many hands draws men together for mutual assistance and then covenants make a figure arts and commerce make them more and more necessary and in a polished society great regard is paid to them  but contracts and promises are not confined to commercial dealings they serve also to make benevolence a duty and are even extended to connect the living with the dead a man would die with regret if he thought his friends were not bound by their promises to fulfill his will after his death and to quiet the minds of men with respect to futurity the moral sense makes the performing such promises our duty thus if i promise to my friend to erect a monument for him after his death conscience binds me even though no person alive be entitled to demand performance every one perceives this to be my duty and i must expect to suffer reproach and blame if i neglect my engagement  to fulfill a rational promise or covenant deliberately made is a duty no less inflexible than those duties are which arise independent of consent but as man is fallible often misled by ignorance or error and liable to be deceived his condition would be deplorable did the moral sense compel him to fulfill every engagement however imprudent or irrational here the moral sense gives way to human infirmity it relieves from deceit from imposition from ignorance from error and binds a man by no engagement but what answers the end fairly intended  the other branch of duties viz those we owe to ourselves shall be discussed in a few words propriety a branch of the moral sense regulates our conduct with respect to ourselves as justice another branch of the moral sense regulates our conduct with respect to others propriety dictates that we ought to act up to the dignity of our nature and to the station allotted us by providence it dictates in particular that temperance prudence modesty and uniformity of conduct are self duties these duties contribute to private happiness by preserving health peace of mind and selfesteem which are inestimable blessings they contribute no less to happiness in society by gaining the love and esteem of others and aid and support in time of need  upon reviewing the foregoing duties respecting others we find them more or less extensive but none so extensive as to have for their end the good of mankind in general the most extensive duty is that of restraint prohibiting us to harm others but even that duty has a limited end for its purpose is only to protect others from mischief not to do them any positive good the active duties of doing positive good are circumscribed within still narrower bounds requiring some relation that connects us with others such as those of parent child friend benefactor the slighter relations unless in peculiar circumstances are not the foundation of any active duty neighborhood for example does not alone make benevolence a duty but supposing a neighbor to be in distress it becomes our duty to relieve him if it can be done without distress to ourselves the duty of relieving from distress seldom goes farther for though we always sympathise with our relations and with those under our eye the distress of persons remote and unknown affects us very little pactions and agreements become necessary if we would extend the duty of benevolence in any particular beyond the limits mentioned men it is true are capable of doing more good than is required of them as a duty but every such good must be a free will offering  and this leads to arbitrary actions viz those that may be done or left undone which make the second general head of moral actions with respect to these the moral sense leaves us at freedom a benevolent act is approved but the omission is not condemned this holds strictly in single acts but in viewing the whole of a mans conduct the moral sense appears to vary a little as the nature of man is complex partly social partly selfish we have an intuitive perception that our conduct ought to be conformable to our nature and that in advancing our own interest we ought not altogether to neglect that of others the man accordingly who confines his whole time and thoughts within his own little sphere is condemned by all the world as guilty of wrong conduct and the man himself if his moral perceptions be not blunted by selfishness must be sensible that he deserves to be condemned on the other hand it is possible that free benevolence may be extended beyond proper bounds the just temperament is a subordination of benevolence to selflove but where benevolence prevails it commonly leads to excess by prompting a man to sacrifice a great interest of his own to a small interest of others and the moral sense dictates that such conduct is wrong  thus moral actions are divided into two classes the first regards our duty containing actions that ought to be done and actions that ought not to be done the other regards arbitrary actions containing actions that are right when done but not wrong when left undone the wellbeing of society depends more on the first class than on the second society is indeed promoted by the latter but it can scarce subsist unless the former be made our duty hence it is that actions only of the first class are made indispensable those of the other class being left to our free will and hence also it is that the various propensities that dispose us to actions of the first sort are distinguished by the name of primary virtues leaving the name of secondary virtues to those propensities which dispose us to actions of the other sort virtue signifies that disposition of mind which gives the ascendant to moral principles vice signifies that disposition of mind which gives little or no ascendant to moral principles   the deduction above given makes it evident that the general tendency of right actions is to promote the good of society and of wrong actions to obstruct that good universal benevolence is indeed not required of man because to put that principle in practice is beyond his utmost abilities but for promoting the general good every thing is required of him that he can accomplish which will appear from reviewing the foregoing duties the prohibition of harming others is an easy task and upon that account is made universal our active duties are very different man is circumscribed both in capacity and power he cannot do good but in a slow succession and therefore it is wisely ordered that his obligation to do good should be confined to his relations his friends his benefactors even distress makes not benevolence a general duty all a man can readily do is to relieve those at hand and accordingly we hear of distant misfortunes with little or no concern  at the same time let not the moral system be misapprehended as if it were our duty or even lawful to prosecute what upon the whole we reckon the most beneficial to society balancing ill with good the moral sense permits not a violation of any persons right however trivial whatever benefit may thereby accrue to another a man for example in low circumstances by denying a debt he owes to a rich miser saves himself and a hopeful family from ruin in that case the good effect far outweighs the ill or rather has no counterbalance but the moral sense permits not the debtor to balance ill with good nor gives countenance to an unjust act whatever benefit it may produce and hence a maxim in which all moralists agree that we must not do ill to bring about even the greatest good the final cause of which shall be given below sect     sect iv principles of duty and of benevolence having thus shortly delineated the moral laws of our nature we proceed to an article of great importance which is to enquire into the means provided by our maker for compelling obedience to these laws the moral sense is an unerring guide but the most expert guide will not profit those who are not disposed to follow this consideration makes it evident that to complete the moral system we ought to be endued with some principle or propensity some impulsive power to enforce obedience to the laws dictated by the moral sense  the author of our nature leaves none of his works imperfect in order to render us obsequious to the moral sense as our guide he has implanted in our nature the principles of duty of benevolence of rewards and punishments and of reparation it may possibly be thought that rewards and punishments of which afterward are sufficient of themselves to enforce the laws of nature without necessity of any other principle human laws it is true are enforced by these means because no higher sanction is under command of a terrestrial legislator but the celestial legislator with power that knows no control and benevolence that knows no bounds has enforced his laws by means no less remarkable for mildness than for efficacy he employs no external compulsion but in order to engage our will on the right side has in the breast of every individual established the principles of duty and of benevolence which efficaciously excite us to obey the dictates of the moral sense  as the restraining as well as active duties are essential to society our maker has wisely ordered that the principle which enforces these several duties should be the most cogent of all that belong to our nature other principles may solicit allure or terrify but the principle of duty assumes authority commands and must be obeyed  as one great purpose of society is to furnish opportunities without end of mutual aid and support nature seconding that purpose has provided the principle of benevolence which excites us to be kind beneficent and generous nor ought it to escape observation that the author of nature attentive to our wants and to our wellbeing has endued us with a liberal portion of that principle it enforces benevolence not only to those we are connected with but to our neighbors and even to those we are barely acquainted with providence is peculiarly attentive to objects in distress who require immediate aid and relief to the general principle of benevolence it has superadded the passion of pity which in every feeling heart is irresistible to make benevolence more extensive would be fruitless because here are objects in plenty to fill the most capacious mind it would not be fruitless only but hurtful to society i say hurtful for inability to procure gratification rendering benevolence a troublesome guest would weaken the principle itself and attach us the more to selfishness which we can always gratify at the same time though there is not room for greater variety of particular objects yet the faculty we have of uniting numberless individuals in one complex object enlarges greatly the sphere of benevolence by that faculty our country our government our religion become objects of public spirit and of a lively affection the individuals that compose the group considered apart may be too minute or too distant for our benevolence but when comprehended in one great whole accumulation makes them great greatness renders them conspicuous and affection preserved entire and undivided is bestowed upon an abstract object as upon one that is single and visible but with much greater energy being proportioned to its superior dignity and importance thus it appears that the principle of benevolence is not too sparingly scattered among men it is indeed made subordinate to selfinterest which is wisely ordered as will afterward be made evident sect    but its power and extent are nicely proportioned to the limited capacity of man and to his situation in this world so as better to fulfill its destination than if it were an overmatch for selfinterest and for every other principle  sect v laws respecting rewards and punishments reflecting on the moral branch of our nature qualifying us for society in a manner suited to our capacity we cannot overlook the hand of our maker for means so finely adjusted to an important end never happen by chance it must however be acknowledged that in many individuals the principle of duty has not vigor nor authority sufficient to stem every tide of unruly passion by the vigilance of some passions we are taken unguarded deluded by the fly insinuations of others or overwhelmed with the stormy impetuosity of a third sort moral evil is thus introduced and much wrong is done this new scene suggests to us that there must be some article still wanting to complete the moral system the means provided for directing us in the road of duty have been explained but as in deviating from the road wrongs are committed nothing hitherto has been said about redressing such wrongs nor about preventing the reiteration of them to accomplish these important ends there are added to the moral system laws relative to rewards and punishments and to reparation of which in their order  many animals are qualified for society by instinct merely such as beavers sheep monkeys bees rooks but men are seldom led by instinct their actions are commonly prompted by passions of which there is an endless variety social and selfish benevolent and malevolent and were every passion equally entitled to gratification man would be utterly unqualified for society he would be a ship without a rudder obedient to every wind and moving at random without any ultimate destination the faculty of reason would make no opposition for were there no sense of wrong it would be reasonable to gratify every desire that harms not ourselves and to talk of punishment would be absurd for punishment in its very idea implies some wrong that ought to be redressed hence the necessity of the moral sense to qualify us for society by instructing us in our duty it renders us accountable for our conduct and makes us susceptible of rewards and punishments the moral sense fulfils another valuable purpose it erects in man an unerring standard for the application and measure of rewards and punishments  to complete the system of rewards and punishments it is necessary that a provision be made both of power and of willingness to reward and punish the author of our nature has provided amply for the former by entitling every man to reward and punish as his native privilege and he has provided for the latter by a noted principle in our nature prompting us to exercise the power impelled by that principle we reward the virtuous with approbation and esteem and punish the vicious with disapprobation and contempt so prevalent is the principle that we have great satisfaction in rewarding and no less in punishing  as to punishment in particular an action done intentionally to produce mischief is criminal and merits punishment such an action being disagreeable raises my resentment even where i have no connection with the person injured and the principle under consideration impels me to chastise the delinquent with indignation and hatred an injury done to myself raises my resentment to a higher tone i am not satisfied with so slight a punishment as indignation and hatred the author must by my hand suffer mischief as great as he has made me suffer  even the most secret crime escapes not punishment the delinquent is tortured with remorse he even desires to be punished sometimes so ardently as himself to be the executioner there cannot be imagined a contrivance more effectual to deter one from vice for remorse is itself a grievous punishment selfpunishment goes still farther every criminal sensible that he ought to be punished dreads punishment from others and this dread however smothered during prosperity breaks out in adversity or in depression of mind his crime stares him in the face and every accidental misfortune is in his disturbed imagination interpreted to be a punishment and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us and reuben answered them saying spoke i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required genesis xlii     john duke of britany commonly termed the good duke illustrious for generosity clemency and piety reigned fortythree years wholly employed about the good of his subjects he was succeeded by his eldest son francis a prince weak and suspicious and consequently fit to be governed arthur of montauban in love with the wife of gilles brother to the duke persuaded the duke that his brother was laying plots to dethrone him gilles being imprisoned the dukes best friends conjured him to pity his unhappy brother who might be imprudent but assuredly was innocent but in vain gilles being prosecuted before the three estates of the province for high treason was unanimously absolved which irritated the duke more and more arthur of montauban artfully suggested to his master to try poison which having miscarried they next resolved to starve the prisoner to death the unfortunate prince through the bars of a window cried aloud for bread but the passengers durst not supply him one poor woman only had courage more than once to slip some bread within the window he charged a priest who had received his confession to declare to the duke that seeing justice was refused him in this world he appealed to heaven and called upon the duke to appear before the judgment seat of god in forty days the duke and his favorite amazed that the prince lived so long without nourishment employed assassins to smother him with his bedcloaths the priest in obedience to the orders he had received presented himself before the duke and with a loud voice cited him in the name of the deceased lord gilles to appear before god in forty days shame and remorse verified the prediction the duke was seized with a sudden terror and the image of his brother expiring by his orders haunted him day and night he decayed daily without any marks of a regular disease and died within the forty days in frightful agony  see this subject further illustrated in the sketch principles and progress of theology chap       no transgression of selfduty escapes punishment more than transgression of duty to others the punishments though not the same differ in degree more than in kind injustice is punished with remorse impropriety with shame which is remorse in a lower degree injustice raises indignation in the beholder and so does every flagrant impropriety slighter improprieties receive a milder punishment being rebuked with some degree of contempt and commonly with derision see elements of criticism chap  0   so far we have been led in a beaten track but in attempting to proceed we are entangled in mazes and intricacies an action well intended may happen to produce no good and an action ill intended may happen to produce no mischief a man overawed by fear may be led to do mischief against his will and a person mistaking the standard of right and wrong may be innocently led to do acts of injustice by what rule in such cases are rewards and punishments to be applied ought a man to be rewarded when he does no good or punished when he does no mischief ought he to be punished for doing mischief against his will or for doing mischief when he thinks he is acting innocently these questions suggest a doubt whether the standard of right and wrong be applicable to rewards and punishments  we have seen that there is an invariable standard of right and wrong which depends not in any degree on private opinion or conviction by that standard all pecuniary claims are judged all claims of property and in a word every demand founded on interest not excepting reparation as will afterward appear but with respect to the moral characters of men and with respect to rewards and punishments a different standard is erected in the common sense of mankind neither rigid nor inflexible which is the opinion that men have of their own actions it is mentioned above that a man is esteemed innocent in doing what he himself thinks right and guilty in doing what he himself thinks wrong in applying this standard to rewards and punishments we reward those who in doing wrong are however convinced that they are innocent and punish those who in doing right are however convinced that they are guilty virtuous and vicious innocent and guilty signify qualities both of men and of their actions approbation and disapprobation praise and blame signify certain emotions or sentiments of those who see or contemplate men and their actions  some it is true are so perverted by bad education or by superstition as to espouse numberless absurd tenets contradictory to the standard of right and wrong and yet such men are no exception from the general rule if they act according to conscience they are innocent and safe against punishment however wrong the action may be and if they act against conscience they are guilty and punishable however right the action may be it is abhorrent to every moral perception that a guilty person be rewarded or an innocent person punished further if mischief be done contrary to will as where a man is compelled by fear or by torture to reveal the secrets of his party he may be grieved for yielding to the weakness of his nature contrary to his firmest resolves but he has no check of conscience and upon that account is not liable to punishment and lastly in order that personal merit and demerit may not in any measure depend on chance we are so constituted as to place innocence and guilt not on the event but on the intention of doing right or wrong and accordingly whatever be the event a man is praised for an action well intended and condemned for an action ill intended  but what if a man intending a certain wrong happen by accident to do a wrong he did not intend as for example intending to rob a warren by shooting the rabbits he accidentally wounds a child unseen behind a bush the delinquent ought to be punished for intending to rob and he is also subjected to repair the hurt done to the child but he cannot be punished for the accidental wound because our nature regulates punishment by the intention and not by the event during the infancy of nations pecuniary compositions for crimes were universal and during that long period very little weight was laid upon intention this proceeded from the cloudiness and obscurity of moral perceptions among barbarians joined with the resemblance of pecuniary punishment to reparation where a man does mischief intentionally or is versans in illicito as expressed in the roman law he is justly bound to repair all the harm that ensues however accidentally and from the resemblance of pecuniary punishment to reparation the rule was childishly extended to punishment but this rule so little consistent with moral principles could not long subsist after pecuniary compositions gave place to corporal punishment and accordingly among civilized nations the law of nature is restored which prohibits punishment for any mischief that is not intentional the english must be excepted who remarkably tenacious of their original laws and customs preserve in force even as to capital punishment the abovementioned rule that obtained among barbarians when pecuniary compositions were in vigor the following passage is from hales pleas of the crown chap    regularly he that voluntarily and knowingly intends hurt to the person of a man as for example to beat him though he intend not death yet if death ensues it excuses not from the guilt of murder or manslaughter at least as the circumstances of the case happen and foster in his crownlaw teaches the same doctrine never once suspecting in it the least deviation from moral principles a shoots at the poultry of b and by accident kills a man if his intention was to steal the poultry which must be collected from circumstances it will be murder by reason of that felonious intent but if it was done wantonly and without that intention it will be barely manslaughter p       a crime against any primary virtue is attended with severe and neverfailing punishment more efficacious than any that have been invented to enforce municipal laws on the other hand the preserving primary virtues inviolate is attended with little merit the secondary virtues are directly opposite the neglecting them is not attended with any punishment but the practice of them is attended with illustrious rewards offices of undeserved kindness returns of good for ill generous toils and sufferings for our friends or for our country are attended with consciousness of selfmerit and with universal praise and admiration the highest rewards human nature is susceptible of  from what is said the following observation will occur the pain of transgressing justice fidelity or any duty is much greater than the pleasure of performing but the pain of neglecting a generous action or any secondary virtue is as nothing compared with the pleasure of performing among the vices opposite to the primary virtues the most striking moral deformity is found among the secondary virtues the most striking moral beauty  sect vi laws respecting reparation the principle of reparation is made a branch of the moral system for accomplishing two ends which are to repress wrongs that are not criminal and to make up the loss sustained by wrongs of whatever kind with respect to the former reparation is a species of punishment with respect to the latter it is an act of justice these ends will be better understood after ascertaining the nature and foundation of reparation to which the following division of actions is necessary first actions that we are bound to perform second actions that we perform in prosecution of a right or privilege third indifferent actions described above actions of the first kind subject not a man to reparation whatever damage ensues because it is his duty to perform them and it would be inconsistent with morality that a man should be subjected to reparation for doing his duty the laws of reparation that concern actions of the second kind are more complex the social state highly beneficial by affording opportunity for mutual good offices is attended with some inconveniences as where a person happens to be in a situation of necessarily harming others by exercising a right or privilege if the foresight of harming another restrain me not from exercising my right the interest of that other is made subservient to mine on the other hand if such foresight restrain me from exercising my right my interest is made subservient to his what does the moral sense provide in that case to preserve as far as possible an equality among persons born free and by nature equal in rank the moral sense lays down a rule no less beautiful than salutary which is that the exercising a right will not justify me for doing direct mischief but will justify me though i foresee that mischief may possibly happen the first branch of the rule resolves into a proposition established above viz that no interest of mine not even life itself will authorize me to hurt an innocent person the other branch is supported by expediency for if the bare possibility of hurting others were sufficient to restrain a man from prosecuting his rights and privileges men would be too much cramped in action or rather would be reduced to a state of absolute inactivity with respect to the first branch i am criminal and liable even to punishment with respect to the other i am not even culpable nor bound to repair the mischief that happens to ensue  with respect to the third kind viz indifferent actions the moral sense dictates that we ought carefully to avoid doing mischief either direct or consequential as we suffer no loss by forbearing actions that are done for pastime merely such an action is culpable or faulty if the consequent mischief was foreseen or might have been foreseen and the actor of course is subjected to reparation as this is a cardinal point in the doctrine of reparation i shall endeavor to explain it more fully without intending any harm a man may foresee that what he is about to do will probably or possibly produce mischief and sometimes mischief follows that was neither intended nor foreseen the action in the former case is not criminal because ill intention is essential to a crime but it is culpable or faulty and if mischief ensue the actor blames himself and is blamed by others for having done what he ought not to have done thus a man who throws a large stone among a crowd of people is highly culpable because he must foresee that mischief will probably ensue though he has no intention to hurt any person as to the latter case though mischief was neither intended nor foreseen yet if it might have been foreseen the action is rash or uncautious and consequently culpable or faulty in some degree thus if a man in pulling down an old house happen to wound one passing accidentally without calling aloud to keep out of the way the action is in some degree culpable because the mischief might have been foreseen but though mischief ensue an action is not culpable or faulty if all reasonable precaution have been adhibited the moral sense declares the author to be innocent innocent here is opposed to culpable in a broader sense it is opposed to criminal with respect to punishment an action though culpable is innocent if it be not criminal with respect to reparation it is not innocent if it be culpable and blameless the mischief is accidental and the action may be termed unlucky but comes not under the denomination of either right or wrong in general when we act merely for amusement our nature makes us answerable for the harm that ensues if it was either foreseen or might with due attention have been foreseen but our rights and privileges would profit us little if their exercise were put under the same restraint it is more wisely ordered that the probability of mischief even foreseen should not restrain a man from prosecuting his concerns which may often be of consequence to him he proceeds accordingly with a safe conscience and is not afraid of being blamed either by god or man  with respect to rash or uncautious actions where the mischief might have been foreseen though not actually foreseen it is not sufficient to escape blame that a man naturally rash or inattentive acts according to his character a degree of precaution is required both by himself and by others such as is natural to the generality of men he perceives that he might and ought to have acted more cautiously and his conscience reproaches him for his inattention no less than if he were naturally more sedate and attentive thus the circumspection natural to mankind in general is applied as a standard to every individual and if they fall short of that standard they are culpable and blameable however unforeseen by them the mischief may have been  what is said upon culpable actions is equally applicable to culpable omissions for by these also mischief may be occasioned entitling the sufferer to reparation if we forbear to do our duty with an intention to occasion mischief the forbearance is criminal the only question is how far forbearance without such intention is culpable supposing the probability of mischief to have been foreseen though not intended the omission is highly culpable and though neither intended nor foreseen yet the omission is culpable in a lower degree if there have been less care and attention than are proper for performing the duty required but supposing all due care the omission of extreme care and diligence is not culpable  by ascertaining what acts and omissions are culpable or faulty the doctrine of reparation is rendered extremely simple for it may be laid down as a rule without a single exception that every culpable act and every culpable omission binds us in conscience to repair the mischief occasioned by it the moral sense binds us no farther for it loads not with reparation the man who is blameless and innocent the harm is accidental and we are so constituted as not to be responsible in conscience for what happens by accident but here it is requisite that the man be in every respect innocent for if he intend harm though not what he has done he will find himself bound in conscience to repair the accidental harm he has done as for example when aiming a blow unjustly at one in the dark he happens to wound another whom he did not suspect to be there and hence it is a rule in all municipal laws that one versans in illicito is liable to repair every consequent damage that these particulars are wisely ordered by the author of our nature for the good of society will appear afterward sect    in general the rules above mentioned are dictated by the moral sense and we are compelled to obey them by the principle of reparation  we are now prepared for a more particular inspection of the two ends of reparation above mentioned viz the repressing wrongs that are not criminal and the making up what loss is sustained by wrongs of whatever kind with respect to the first it is clear that punishment in its proper sense cannot be inflicted for a wrong that is culpable only and if nature did not provide some means for repressing such wrongs society would scarce be a comfortable state laying conscience aside pecuniary reparation is the only remedy that can be provided against culpable omissions and with respect to culpable commissions the necessity of reparation is still more apparent for conscience alone without the sanction of reparation would seldom have authority sufficient to restrain us from acting rashly or uncautiously even where the possibility of mischief is foreseen and far less where it is not foreseen  with respect to the second end of reparation my conscience dictates to me that if a man suffer by my fault whether the mischief was foreseen or not foreseen it is my duty to make up his loss and i perceive intuitively that the loss ought to rest ultimately upon me and not upon the sufferer who has not been culpable in any degree  in every case where the mischief done can be estimated by a pecuniary compensation the two ends of reparation coincide the sum is taken from the one as a sort of punishment for his fault and is bestowed on the other to make up the loss he has sustained but in numberless cases where mischief done cannot be compensated with money reparation is in its nature a sort of punishment defamation contemptuous treatment personal restraint the breaking ones peace of mind are injuries that cannot be repaired by money and the pecuniary reparation decreed against the wrongdoer can only be a sort of punishment in order to deter him from reiterating such injuries the sum it is true is awarded to the person injured but not as sufficient to make up his loss which money cannot do but only as a solatium for what he has suffered  hitherto it is supposed that the man who intends a wrong action is at the same time conscious of its being so but a man may intend a wrong action thinking erroneously that it is right or a right action thinking erroneously that it is wrong and the question is what shall be the consequence of such errors with respect to reparation the latter case is clear the person who occasionally suffers loss by a right action has not a claim for reparation because he has no just cause of complaint on the other hand if the action be wrong the innocence of the author for which he is indebted to an error in judgment will not relieve him from reparation when he is made sensible of his error he feels himself bound in conscience to repair the harm he has done by a wrong action and others sensible of his error from the beginning have the same feeling nor will his obstinacy in resisting conviction or his dullness in not apprehending his error mend the matter it is well that these defects relieve him from punishment without wronging others by denying a claim for reparation a mans errors ought to affect himself only and not those who have not erred hence in general reparation always follows wrong and is not affected by any erroneous opinion of a wrong action being right more than of a right action being wrong  but this doctrine suffers an exception with respect to a man who having undertaken a trust is bound in duty to act a judge is in that situation it is his duty to pronounce sentence in every case that comes before him and if he judge according to the best of his knowledge he is not liable for consequences a judge cannot be subjected to reparation unless it can be verified that the judgment he gave was intentionally wrong an officer of the revenue is in the same predicament led by a doubtful clause in a statute he makes a seizure of goods as forfeited to the crown which afterward in the proper court are found not to be seizable the officer ought not to be subjected to reparation if he have acted to the best of his judgment this rule however must be taken with a limitation a public officer who is grossly erroneous will not be excused for he ought to know better  reparation is due though the immediate act be involuntary provided it be connected with a preceding voluntary act example if a ride an unruly horse in lincolns inn fields to tame him and the horse breaking from a run over b and grievously hurt him b shall have an action against a for though the mischief was done against the will of a yet since it was his fault to bring a wild horse into a frequented place where mischief might ensue he must answer for the consequences gaius seems to carry this rule still farther holding in general that if a horse by the weakness or unskilfulness of the rider break away and do mischief the rider is liable l     ad leg aquil  but gaius probably had in his eye a frequented place where the mischief might have been foreseen thus in general a man is made liable for the mischief occasioned by his voluntary deed though the immediate act that occasioned the mischief be involuntary  sect vii final causes of the foregoing laws of nature several final causes have been occasionally mentioned in preceding parts of this essay which could not conveniently be reserved for the present section being necessary for explaining the subjects to which they relate the final cause for instance of erecting a standard of morals upon the common sense of mankind i proceed now to what have not been mentioned or but slightly mentioned  the final cause that presents itself first to view respects man considered as an accountable being the sense of being accountable is one of our most vigilant guards against the silent attacks of vice when a temptation moves me it immediately occurs what will the world say i imagine my friends expostulating my enemies reviling  i dare not dissemble  my spirits sink  the temptation vanishes  dly praise and blame especially from those we regard are strong incentives to virtue but if we were not accountable for our conduct praise and blame would be seldom well directed for how should a mans intentions be known without calling him to account and praise or blame frequently illdirected would lose their influence  dly this branch of our nature is the cornerstone of the criminal law did not a man think himself accountable to all the world and to his judge in a peculiar manner it would be natural for him to think that the justest sentence pronounced against him is oppression not justice  thly this branch is a strong cement to society if we were not accountable beings those connected by blood or by country would be no less shy and reserved than if they were mere strangers to each other  the final cause that next occurs being simple and obvious is mentioned only that it may not seem to have been overlooked all right actions are agreeable all wrong actions disagreeable this is a wise appointment of providence we meet with so many temptations against duty that it is not always an easy task to persevere in the right path would we persevere were duty disagreeable and were acts of pure benevolence disagreeable they would be extremely rare however worthy of praise  another final cause respects duty in contradistinction to pure benevolence all the moral laws are founded on intuitive perception and are so simple and plain as to be perfectly apprehended by the most ignorant were they in any degree complex or obscure they would be perverted by selfishness and prejudice no conviction inferior to what is afforded by intuitive perception could produce in mankind a common sense with respect to moral duties reason would afford no general conviction because that faculty is distributed in portions so unequal as to bar all hopes from it of uniformity either in practice or in opinion at the same time we are taught by woeful experience that reason has little influence over the greater part of men reason it is true aided by experience supports morality by convincing us that we cannot be happy if we abandon duty for any other interest but conviction seldom weighs much against imperious passion to control which the vigorous and commanding principle of duty is requisite directed by the shining light of intuition  a proposition laid down above appears to be a sort of mystery in the moral system viz that though evidently all moral duties are contrived for promoting the general good yet that choice is not permitted among different goods or between good and ill and that we are strictly tied down to perform or forbear certain particular acts without regard to consequences or in other words that we must not do wrong whatever good it may produce the final cause which i am about to unfold will clear this mystery and set the beauty of the moral system in a conspicuous light i begin with observing that as the general good of mankind or even of the society we live in results from many and various circumstances intricately combined it is far above the capacity of man to judge in every instance what particular actions will tend the most to that end the authorizing therefore a man to trace out his duty by weighing endless circumstances good and ill would open a wide door to partiality and passion and often lead him unwittingly to prefer the preponderating ill under a false appearance of being the greater good at that rate the opinions of men about right and wrong would be as various as their faces which as observed above would totally unhinge society it is better ordered by providence even for the general good that avoiding complex and obscure objects we are directed by the moral sense to perform certain plain and simple acts which are obvious to us by intuitive perception  in the next place to permit ill in order to produce greater good may suit a being of universal benevolence but is repugnant to the nature of man composed of selfish and benevolent principles we have seen above that the true moral balance depends on a subordination of selflove to duty and of arbitrary benevolence to selflove and accordingly every man is sensible of injustice when he is hurt in order to benefit another were it a rule in society that a greater good to any other would make it an act of justice to deprive me of my life of my reputation or of my property i should renounce the society of men and associate with more harmless animals  thirdly the true moral system that which is displayed above is not only better suited to the nature of man and to his limited capacity and intelligence but contributes more to the general good which i now proceed to demonstrate it would be losing time to prove that a man entirely selfish is ill fitted for society and we have seen sect    that universal benevolence were it a duty would contribute to the general good perhaps less than absolute selfishness man is too limited in capacity and in power for universal benevolence even the greatest monarch has not power to exercise his benevolence but within a very small compass and if so how unfit would such a duty be for private persons who have very little power serving only to distress them by inability of performance they would endeavor to smother it altogether and give full scope to selfishness man is much better qualified for doing good by a constitution in which benevolence is duly blended with selflove benevolence as a duty takes place of selflove a regulation essential to society benevolence as a virtue not a duty gives place to selflove because as every man has more power knowledge and opportunity to promote his own good than that of others a greater quantity of good is produced than if benevolence were our only principle of action this holds even supposing no harm done to any person much more would it hold were we permitted to hurt some in order to produce more good to others  the foregoing final causes respect morality in general we now proceed to particulars and the first and most important is the law of restraint man is evidently framed for society and as there can be no society among creatures who prey upon each other it was necessary to provide against mutual injuries which is effectually done by this law its necessity with respect to personal security is selfevident and with respect to property its necessity will appear from what follows in the nature of every man there is a propensity to hoard or store up things useful to himself and family but this natural propensity would be rendered ineffectual were he not secured in the possession of what he thus stores up for no man will toil to accumulate what he cannot securely possess this security is afforded by the moral sense which dictates that the first occupant of goods provided by nature for the subsistence of man ought to be secure in his possession and that such goods ought to be inviolable as his property thus by the great law of restraint men have a protection for their goods as well as for their persons and are no less secure in society than if they were separated from each other by impregnable walls  several other duties are little less essential than that of restraint to the existence of society mutual trust and confidence without which society would be an uncomfortable state enter into the character of the human species to which the duties of veracity and fidelity correspond the final cause of these corresponding duties is obvious the latter would be of no use in society without the former and the former without the latter would be hurtful by laying men open to fraud and deceit  with respect to veracity in particular man is so constituted that he must be indebted to information for the knowledge of most things that benefit or hurt him and if he could not depend upon information society would be very little beneficial further it is wisely ordered that we should be bound by the moral sense always to speak truth even where we perceive no harm in transgressing that duty because it is sufficient that harm may ensue though not foreseen at the same time falsehood always does mischief it may happen not to injure us externally in our reputation or in our goods but it never fails to injure us internally for one great blessing of society is a candid intercourse of sentiments of opinions of desires of wishes and to admit any falsehood in such intercourse would poison the most refined pleasures of life  because man is the weakest of all animals in a state of separation and the very strongest in society by mutual aid and support to which covenants and promises greatly contribute these are made binding by the moral sense  the final cause of the law of propriety which enforces the duty we owe to ourselves comes next in order in discoursing upon those laws of nature which concern society there is no occasion to mention any selfduty but what relates to society of which kind are prudence temperance industry firmness of mind and that such qualities should be made our duty is wisely ordered in a double respect first as qualifying us to act a proper part in society and next as intitling us to good will from others it is the interest no doubt of every man to suit his behavior to the dignity of his nature and to the station allotted him by providence for such rational conduct contributes to happiness by preserving health procuring plenty gaining the esteem of others and which of all is the greatest blessing by gaining a justlyfounded selfesteem but here interest solely is not relied on the powerful authority of duty is added that in a matter of the utmost importance to ourselves and of some importance to the society we live in our conduct may be regular and steady these duties tend not only to render a man happy in himself but also by procuring the good will and esteem of others to command their aid and assistance in time of need  i proceed to the final causes of natural rewards and punishments it is laid down above that controversies about property and about other matters of interest must be adjusted by the standard of right and wrong but to bring rewards and punishments under the same standard without regard to private conscience would be a plan unworthy of our maker it is extremely clear that to reward one who is not conscious of merit or to punish one who is not conscious of guilt cannot answer any good end and in particular cannot tend either to improvement or to reformation of manners how much more like the deity is the plan of nature which rewards no man who is not conscious that he merits reward and punishes no man who is not conscious that he merits punishment by that plan and by that only rewards and punishments accomplish every good end a final cause most illustrious the rewards and punishments that attend the primary and secondary virtues are finely contrived for supporting the distinction between them set forth above punishment must be confined to the transgression of primary virtues it being the intention of nature that secondary virtues be entirely free on the other hand secondary virtues are more highly rewarded than primary generosity for example makes a greater figure than justice and magnanimity heroism undaunted courage a still greater figure one would imagine at first view that primary virtues being more essential should be entitled to the first place in our esteem and be more amply rewarded than secondary and yet in elevating the latter above the former peculiar wisdom and foresight are conspicuous punishment is appropriated to enforce primary virtues and if these virtues were also attended with high rewards secondary virtues degraded to a lower rank would be deprived of that enthusiastic admiration which is their chief support selfinterest would universally prevail over benevolence and banish those numberless favors we receive from each other in society which are beneficial in point of interest and still more so by generating affection and friendship  in our progress through final causes we come at last to reparation one of the principles destined by providence for redressing wrongs committed and for preventing the reiteration of them the final cause of this principle when the mischief arises from intention is clear for to protect individuals in society it is not sufficient that the delinquent be punished it is necessary over and above that the mischief be repaired  secondly where the act is wrong or unjust though not understood by the author to be so it is wisely ordered that reparation should follow which will thus appear considering the fallibility of man it would be too severe to permit advantage to be taken of ones error in every circumstance on the other hand to make it a law in our nature never to take advantage of error would be giving too much indulgence to indolence and remission of mind tending to make us neglect the improvement of our rational faculties our nature is so happily framed as to avoid these extremes by distinguishing between gain and loss no man is conscious of wrong when he takes advantage of an error committed by another to save himself from loss if there must be a loss common sense dictates that it ought to rest upon the person who has erred however innocently rather than upon the person who has not erred thus in a competition among creditors about the estate of their bankrupt debtor every one is at liberty to avail himself of every error committed by his competitor in order to recover payment but in lucro captando the moral sense teaches a different lesson which is that no man ought to lay hold of anothers error to make gain by it thus an heir finding a rough diamond in the repositories of his ancestor gives it away mistaking it for a common pebble the purchaser is in conscience and equity bound to restore or to pay a just price  thirdly the following considerations unfold a final cause no less beautiful than that last mentioned society could not subsist in any tolerable manner were full scope given to rashness and negligence and to every action that is not strictly criminal whence it is a maxim founded no less upon utility than upon justice that men in society ought to be extremely circumspect as to every action that may possibly do harm on the other hand it is also a maxim that as the prosperity and happiness of man depend on action activity ought to be encouraged instead of being discouraged by dread of consequences these maxims seemingly in opposition have natural limits that prevent their encroaching upon each other there is a certain degree of attention and circumspection that men generally bestow upon affairs proportioned to their importance if that degree were not sufficient to defend against a claim of reparation individuals would be too much cramped in action which would be a great discouragement to activity if a less degree were sufficient there would be too great scope for rash or remiss conduct which would prove the bane of society these limits which evidently tend to the good of society are adjusted by the moral sense which dictates as laid down in the section of reparation that the man who acts with foresight of the probability of mischief or acts rashly and uncautiously without such foresight ought to be liable for consequences but that the man who acts cautiously without foreseeing or suspecting any mischief ought not to be liable for consequences  in the same section it is laid down that the moral sense requires from every man not his own degree of vigilance and attention which may be very small but that which belongs to the common nature of the species the final cause of that regulation will appear upon considering that were reparation to depend upon personal circumstances there would be a necessity of enquiring into the characters of men their education their manner of living and the extent of their understanding which would render judges arbitrary and such lawsuits inextricable but by assuming the common nature of the species as a standard by which every man in conscience judges of his own actions lawsuits about reparation are rendered easy and expeditious  sect viii liberty and necessity considered with respect to morality having in the foregoing sections ascertained the reality of a moral sense with its sentiments of approbation and disapprobation praise and blame the purpose of the present section is to show that these sentiments are consistent with the laws that govern the actions of man as a rational being in order to which it is first necessary to explain these laws for there has been much controversy about them especially among divines of the arminian and calvinist sects  human actions as laid down in the first section are of three kinds one where we act by instinct without any view to consequences one where we act by will in order to produce some effect and one where we act against will with respect to the first the agent acts blindly without deliberation or choice and the external act follows necessarily from the instinctive impluse a stonechatter makes its nest on the ground or near it and the young as soon as they can shift for themselves leave the nest instinctivly an egg of that bird was laid in a swallows nest fixed to the roof of a church the swallow fed all the young equally without distinction the young stonechatter left the nest at the usual time before it could fly and falling to the ground it was taken up dead here is instinct in purity exerting itself blindly without regard to variation of circumstances the same is observable in our dunghillfowl they feed on worms corn and other feeds dropped on the ground in order to discover their food nature has provided them with an instinct to scrape with the foot and the instinct is so regularly exercised that they scrape even when they are set upon a heap of corn  actions done with a view to an end are in a very different condition in these deliberation choice will enter the intention to accomplish the end goes first the will to act in order to accomplish the end is next and the external act follows of course it is the will then that governs every action done as means to an end and it is desire to accomplish the end that puts the will in motion desire in this view being commonly termed the motive to act thus hearing that my friend is in the hands of robbers i burn with desire to free him desire influences my will to arm my servants and to fly to his relief actions done against will come in afterward  but what is it that raises desire the answer is at hand it is the prospect of attaining some agreeable end or of avoiding one that is disagreeable and if it be again enquired what makes an object agreeable or disagreeable the answer is equally ready that our nature makes it so and more we cannot say certain visible objects are agreeable certain sounds and certain smells other objects of these senses are disagreeable but there we must stop for we are far from being so intimately acquainted with our own nature as to assign the causes these hints are sufficient for my present purpose if one be curious to know more the theory of desire and of agreeableness and disagreeableness will be found in elements of criticism chap     with respect to instinctive actions no person i presume thinks that there is any freedom more than in acts done against will an infant applies to the nipple and a bird builds its nest no less necessarily than a stone falls to the ground with respect to voluntary actions such as are done with a view to an end the necessity is the same though less apparent at first view the external action is determined by the will the will is determined by desire and desire by what is agreeable or disagreeable here is a chain of causes and effects not one link of which is arbitrary or under command of the agent he cannot will but according to his desire he cannot desire but according to what is agreeable or disagreeable in the objects perceived nor do these qualities depend on his inclination or fancy he has no power to make a beautiful woman ugly nor to make a rotten carcass sweet  many good men apprehending danger to morality from holding our actions to be necessary endeavor to break the chain of causes and effects above mentioned maintaining that whatever influence desire or motives may have it is the agent himself who is the cause of every action that desire may advise but cannot command and therefore that a man is still free to act in contradiction to desire and to the strongest motives that a being may exist which in every case acts blindly and arbitrarily without having any end in view i can make a shift to conceive but it is difficult for me even to imagine a thinking and rational being that has affections and passions that has a desirable end in view that can easily accomplish this end and yet after all can fly off or remain at rest without any cause reason or motive to sway it if such a whimsical being can possibly exist i am certain that man is not such a being there is perhaps not a person above the condition of a changeling but can say why he did so and so what moved him what he intended nor is a single fact stated to make us believe that ever a man acted against his own will or desire who was not compelled by external violence on the contrary constant and universal experience proves that human actions are governed by certain inflexible laws and that a man cannot exert his selfmotive power but in pursuance of some desire or motive  had a motive always the same influence actions proceeding from it would appear no less necessary than the actions of matter the various degrees of influence that motives have on different men at the same time and on the same man at different times occasion a doubt by suggesting a notion of chance some motives however have such influence as to leave no doubt a timid female has a physical power to throw herself into the mouth of a lion roaring for food but she is withheld by terror no less effectually than by cords if she should rush upon the lion would not every one conclude that she was frantic a man though in a deep sleep retains a physical power to act but he cannot exert it a man though desperately in love retains a physical power to refuse the hand of his mistress but he cannot exert that power in contradiction to his own ardent desire more than if he were fast asleep now if a strong motive have a necessary influence there is no reason for doubting but that a weak motive must also have its influence the same in kind though not in degree some actions indeed are strangely irregular but let the wildest action be scrutinized there will always be discovered some motive or desire which however whimsical or capricious was what influenced the person to act of two contending motives is it not natural to expect that the stronger will prevail however little its excess may be if there be any doubt it must be from a supposition that a weak motive can be resisted arbitrarily where then are we to fix the boundary between a weak and a strong motive if a weak motive can be resisted why not one a little stronger and why not the strongest in elements of criticism chap   part   the reader will find many examples of contrary motives weighing against each other let him ponder these with the strictest attention his conclusion will be that between two motives however nearly balanced a man has not an arbitrary choice but must yield to the stronger the mind indeed fluctuates for some time and feels itself in a measure loose at last however it is determined by the more powerful motive as a balance is by the greater weight after many vibrations  such then are the laws that govern our voluntary actions a man is absolutely free to act occording to his own will greater freedom than which is not conceivable at the same time as man is made accountable for his conduct to his maker to his fellow creatures and to himself he is not left to act arbitrarily for at that rate he would be altogether unaccountable his will is regulated by desire and desire by what pleases or displeases him where we are subjected to the will of another would it be our wish that his will should be under no regulation and where we are guided by our own will would it be reasonable to wish that it should be under no regulation but be exerted without reason without any motive and contrary to common sense thus with regard to human conduct there is a chain of laws established by nature not one link of which is left arbitrary by that wise system man is rendered accountable by it he is made a fit subject for divine and human government by it persons of sagacity foresee the conduct of others and by it the prescience of the deity with respect to human actions is firmly established  the absurd figure men would make if they could act contrary to motives should be sufficient one may think to open our eyes without an argument what a despicable figure does a person make upon whom the same motive has great influence at one time and very little at another he is a bad member of society and cannot be relied on as a friend or as an associate but how highly rational is this supposed person compared with one who can act in contradiction to every motive the former may be termed whimsical or capricious the latter is worse he is absolutely unaccountable and cannot be the subject of government more than a lump of matter unconscious of its own motion  let the faculty of acting be compared with that of reasoning the comparison will tend to soften our reluctance to the necessary influence of motives a man sometimes blunders in reasoning but he is tied by his nature to form conclusions upon what appears to him true at the time if he could arbitrarily form a different conclusion what an absurd reasoner would he be would a man be less absurd if he had a power of acting against motives and contrary to what he thinks right or eligible to act in that manner is inconsistent with any notion we can form of a sensible being nor do we suppose that man is such a being in accounting for any action however whimsical we always ascribe it to some motive never once dreaming that there was no motive  and after all where would be the advantage of such an arbitrary power can a rational man wish seriously to have such a power or can he seriously think that god would make man so whimsical a being to endue man with a degree of selfcommand sufficient to resist every vicious motive without any power to resist those that are virtuous would indeed be a gift of value but too great for man because it would exalt him to be an angel but such selfcommand as to resist both equally which is the present supposition would unqualify us for being governed either by god or by man better far to be led as rational creatures by the prospect of good however erroneous our judgment may sometimes be  considering that man is the only terrestrial being formed to know his maker and to worship him will it not sound harshly while all other animals are subjected to divine government and unerringly fulfill their destination that man alone should be withdrawn from divine government and be so framed that neither his maker nor he himself can foresee what he will do the next moment the power of resisting the strongest motives whether of religion or of morality would render him independent of the deity  this reasoning is too diffuse may it not be comprehended in a single view it will make the deeper impression there may be conceived different systems for governing man as a thinking and rational being one is that virtuous motives should always prevail over every other motive this in appearance would be the most perfect government but man is not so constituted and there is reason to doubt whether such perfection would in his present state correspond to the other branches of his nature see book   sketch   at the end  another system is that virtuous motives sometimes prevail sometimes vicious and that we are always determined by the prevailing motive this is the true system of nature and hence great variety of character and of conduct among men a third system is that motives have influence but that one can act in contradiction to every motive this is the system i have been combating observe only what it resolves into how is an action to be accounted for that is done in contradiction to every motive it wanders from the region of common sense into that of mere chance if such were the nature of man no one could rely on another a promise or an oath would be a rope of sand the utmost cordiality between my friend and me would be no security against his stabbing me with the first weapon that comes in his way would any man wish to have been formed according to such a system he would probably wish to have been formed according to the system first mentioned but that is denied him virtuous motives sometimes prevailing sometimes vicious and from the wisdom of providence we have reason to believe that this law is of all the best fitted for man in his present state  to conclude this branch of the subject in none of the works of providence so far as we can penetrate is there displayed a deeper reach of art and wisdom than in the laws of action peculiar to man as a thinking and rational being were he left loose to act in contradiction to motives there would be no place for prudence foresight nor for adjusting means to an end it could not be foreseen by others what a man will do the next hour nay it could not be foreseen even by himself man would not be capable of rewards and punishments he would not be fitted either for divine or for human government he would be a creature that has no resemblance to the human race but man is not left loose for though he is at liberty to act according to his own will yet his will is regulated by desire and desire by what pleases and displeases this connection preserves uniformity of conduct and confines human actions within the great chain of causes and effects by this admirable system liberty and necessity seemingly incompatible are made perfectly concordant fitting us for society and for government both human and divine  having explained the laws that govern human actions we proceed to what is chiefly intended in the present section which is to examine how far the moral sentiments handled in the foregoing sections are consistent with these laws let it be kept in view that our moral sentiments and feelings are founded entirely upon the moral sense which unfolds to us a right and a wrong in actions from the same sense are derived the sentiments of approbation and praise when a man does right and of disapprobation and blame when he does wrong were we destitute of the moral sense right and wrong praise and blame would be as little understood as colors are by one born blind in an intricate subject like the present great care should be taken to avoid ambiguities the term praise has two different significations in one sense it is opposed to blame in another to dispraise in the former sense it expresses a moral sentiment in the latter it expresses only the approving any object that pleases me i praise one man for his candor and blame another for being a doubledealer these both of them imply will and intention i praise a man for being acute but for being dull i only dispraise him i praise a woman for beauty but blame not any for ugliness i only dispraise them none of these particulars imply will or intention   the formidable argument that is urged to prove that our moral sentiments are inconsistent with the supposed necessary influence of motives is what follows if motives have a necessary influence on our actions there can be no good reason to praise a man for doing right nor to blame him for doing wrong what foundation can there be either for praise or blame when it was not in a mans power to have acted otherwise a man commits murder instigated by a sudden fit of revenge why should he be punished if he acted necessarily and could not resist the violence of the passion here it is supposed that a power of resistance is essential to praise and blame but upon examination it will be found that this supposition has not any support in the moral sense nor in reason nor in the common sense of mankind  with respect to the first the moral sense as we have seen above places innocence and guilt and consequentty praise and blame entirely upon will and intention the connection between the motive and the action so far from diminishing enhances the praise or blame the greater influence a virtuous motive has the greater is the virtue of the agent and the more warm our praise on the other hand the greater influence a vicious motive has the greater is the vice of the agent and the more violently do we blame him as this is the cardinal point i wish to have it considered in a general view it is essential both to human and divine government that the influence of motives should be necessary it is equally essential that that necessary influence should not have the effect to lessen guilt in the estimation of men to fulfill both ends guilt is placed by the moral sense entirely upon will and intention a man accordingly blames himself for doing mischief willingly and intentionally without once considering whether he acted necessarily or not and his sentiments are adopted by all the world they pronounce the same sentence of condemnation that he himself does a man put to the torture yields to the pain and with bitter reluctance reveals the secrets of his party another does the same yielding to a tempting bribe the latter only is blamed as guilty of a crime and yet the bribe perhaps operated as strongly on the latter as torture did on the former but the one was compelled against his will to reveal the secrets of his party and therefore is innocent the other acted willingly in order to procure a great sum of money and therefore is guilty  with respect to reason i observe that the argument i am combating is an appeal to a wrong tribunal the moral sense is the only judge in this controversy not the faculty of reason at the same time i should have no fear of a sentence against me were reason to be the judge for would not reason dictate that the less a man wavers about his duty or in other words the less influence vicious motives have the more praiseworthy he is and the more blameable the less influence virtuous motives have  nor are we led by common sense to differ from reason and the moral sense a man commits murder overcome by a sudden fit of revenge which he could not resist will not one be led to reflect even at first view that the man did not wish to resist on the contrary that he would have committed the murder though he had not been under any necessity a person of plain understanding will say what signifies it whether the criminal could resist or not when he committed the murder wittingly and willingly a man gives poison privately out of revenge does any one doubt of his guilt when he never once repented though after administering the poison it no longer was in his power to draw back a man may be guilty and blameworthy even where there is external compulsion that he cannot resist with sword in hand i run to attack an enemy my foot slipping i fall headlong upon him and by that accident the sword is pushed into his body the external act was not the effect of will but of accident but my intention was to commit murder and i am guilty all men acknowledge that the deity is necessarily good does that circumstance detract from his praise in common apprehension on the contrary he merits from us the highest praise on that very account  it is commonly said that there can be no virtue where there is no struggle virtue it is true is best known from a struggle a man who has never met with a temptation can be little confident of his virtue but the observation taken in a strict sense is undoubtedly erroneous a man tempted to betray his trust wavers but after much doubting refuses at last the bribe another hesitates not a moment but rejects the bribe with disdain duty is obstinate and will not suffer him even to deliberate is there no virtue in the latter undoubtedly more than in the former  upon the whole it appears that praise and blame rest ultimately upon the disposition or frame of mind nor is it obvious that a power to act against motives could vary in any degree these moral sentiments when a man commits a crime let it be supposed that he could have resisted the prevailing motive why then did he not resist instead of bringing upon himself shame and misery the answer must be for no other can be given that his disposition is vicious and that he is a detestable creature further it is not a little difficult to conceive how a man can resist a prevailing motive without having any thing in his mind that should engage him to resist it but letting that pass i make the following supposition a man is tempted by avarice to accept a bribe if he resist upon the principle of duty he is led by the prevailing motive if he resist without having any reason or motive for resisting i cannot discover any merit in such resistance it seems to resolve into a matter of chance or accident whether he resist or do not resist where can the merit lie of resisting a vicious motive when resistance happens by mere chance and where the demerit of resisting a virtuous motive when it is owing to the same chance if a man actuated by no principle good or bad and having no end or purpose in view should kill his neighbor i see not that he would be more accountable than if he had acted in his sleep or were mad  human punishments are perfectly consistent with the necessary influence of motives without supposing a power to withstand them if it be urged that a man ought not to be punished for committing a crime when he could not resist the answer is that as he committed the crime intentionally and with his eyes open he is guilty in his own opinion and in the opinion of all men and he justly suffers punishment to prevent him or others from doing the like in time to come the dread of punishment is a weight in the scale on the side of virtue to counterbalance vicious motives  the final cause of this branch of our nature is admirable if the necessary influence of motives had the effect either to lessen the merit of a virtuous action or the demerit of a crime morality would be totally unhinged the most virtuous action would of all be the least worthy of praise and the most vicious be of all the least worthy of blame nor would the evil stop there instead of curbing inordinate passions we should be encouraged to indulge them as an excellent excuse for doing wrong thus the moral sentiments of approbation and disapprobation of praise and blame are found perfectly consistent with the laws above mentioned that govern human actions without having recourse to an imaginary power of acting against motives  the only plausible objection i have met with against the foregoing theory is the remorse a man feels for a crime he suddenly commits and as suddenly repents of during a fit of bitter remorse for having slain my favorite servant in a violent passion without just provocation i accuse myself for having given way to passion and acknowledge that i could and ought to have restrained it here we find remorse founded on a system directly opposite to that above laid down a system that acknowledges no necessary connection between an action and the motive that produced it but on the contrary supposes that it is in a mans power to resist his passion and that he ought to resist it what shall be said upon this point can a man be a necessary agent when he is conscious of the contrary and is sensible that he can act in contradiction to motives this objection is strong in appearance and would be invincible were we not happily relieved of it by a doctrine laid down in elements of criticism chap   part   concerning the irregular influence of passion on our opinions and sentiments upon examination it will be found that the present case may be added to the many examples there given of this irregular influence in a peevish fit i take exception at some slight word or gesture of my friend which i interpret as if he doubted of my veracity i am instantly in a flame in vain he protests that he had no meaning for impatience will not suffer me to listen i bid him draw which he does with reluctance and before he is well prepared i give him a mortal wound bitter remorse and anguish succeed instantly to rage what have i done why did i not abstain i was not mad and yet i have murdered my innocent friend there is the hand that did the horrid deed why did not i rather turn it against my own heart here every impression of necessity vanishes my mind tells me that i was absolutely free and that i ought to have smothered my passion i put an opposite case a brutal fellow eats me with great indignity and proceeds even to a blow my passion rises beyond the possibility of restraint i can scarce forbear so long as to bid him draw and that moment i stab him to the heart i am sorry for having been engaged with a ruffian but have no contrition nor remorse in this case my sentiments are very different from what they are in the other i never once dream that i could have resisted the impulse of passion on the contrary my thoughts and words are that flesh and blood could not bear the affront and that i must have been branded for a coward had i not done what i did in reality both the actions were equally necessary whence then opinions and sentiments so opposite to each other the irregular influence of passion on our opinions and sentiments will solve the question all violent passions are prone to their own gratification a man affected with deep remorse abhors himself and is odious in his own eyes and it gratifies the passion to indulge the thought that his guilt is beyond the possibility of excuse in the first case accordingly remorse forces upon me a conviction that i might have restrained my passion and ought to have restrained it i will not give way to any excuse because in a fit of remorse it gives me pain to be excused in the other case there being no remorse there is no disguise and things appear in their true light to illustrate this reasoning i observe that passion warps my judgment of the actions of others as well as of my own many examples are given in the chapter above quoted join to these the following my servant aiming at a partridge happens to shoot a favorite spaniel crossing the way unseen inflamed with anger i storm at his rashness pronounce him guilty and will listen to no excuse when my passion is spent i become sensible that it was merely accidental and that the man is absolutely innocent the nurse overlays my only child the longexpected heir to a great estate it is with difficulty that i refrain from putting her to death the wretch has murdered my infant and deserves to be torn to pieces when my passion subsides i see the matter in a very different light the poor woman is inconsolable and can scarce believe that she is innocent she bitterly reproaches herself for want of care and concern but upon cool reflection both she and i are sensible that no person in sound sleep has any selfcommand and that we cannot be answerable for any action of which we are not conscious thus upon the whole we find that any impression we may occasionally have of being able to act in contradiction to motives is the result of passion not of sound judgment  the reader will observe that this section is copied from essays on morality and natural religion the groundwork is the same the alterations are only in the superstructure and the subject is abridged in order to adapt it to its present place part of the abridgment was published in the second edition of the principles of equity but as law books have little currency the publishing the whole in one essay will not i hope be thought improper  appendix upon chance and contingency i hold it to be an intuitive proposition that the deity is the primary cause of all things that with consummate wisdom he formed the great plan of government which he carries on by laws suited to the different natures of animate and inanimate beings and that these laws produce a regular chain of causes and effects in the moral as well as the material world admitting no events but what are comprehended in the original plan see essays on morality and natural religion part   essay    hence it clearly follows that chance is excluded out of this world that nothing can happen by accident and that no event is arbitrary or contingent this is the doctrine of the essay quoted and in my apprehension well founded but i cannot subscribe to what follows viz that we have an impression of chance and contingency which consequently must be delusive i would not willingly admit any delusion in the nature of man where it is not made evident beyond contradiction and i now see clearly that the impression we have of chance and contingency is not delusive but perfectly consistent with the established plan  the explanation of chance and contingency in the said essay shall be given in the authors own words as a proper text to reason upon in our ordinary train of thinking it is certain that all events appear not to us as necessary a multitude of events seem to be under our power to cause or to prevent and we readily make a distinction betwixt events that are necessary i e that must be and events that are contingent i e that may be or may not be this distinction is void of truth for all things that fall out either in the material or moral world are as we have seen alike necessary and alike the result of fixed laws yet whatever conviction a philosopher may have of this the distinction betwixt things necessary and things contingent possesses his common train of thought as much as it possesses the most illiterate we act universally upon that distinction nay it is in truth the cause of all the labor care and industry of mankind i illustrate this doctrine by an example constant experience has taught us that death is a necessary event the human frame is not made to last for ever in its present condition and no man thinks of more than a temporary existence upon this globe but the particular time of our death appears a contingent event however certain it be that the time and manner of the death of each individual is determined by a train of preceding causes and is no less fixed than the hour of the suns rising or setting yet no person is affected by this doctrine in the care of prolonging life we are directed by the supposed contingency of the time of death which to a certain term of years we consider as depending in a great measure on ourselves by caution against accidents due use of food exercise etc these means are prosecuted with the same diligence as if there were in fact no necessary train of causes to fix the period of life in short whoever attends to his own practical ideas whoever reflects upon the meaning of the following words which occur in all languages of things possible contingent that are in our power to cause or prevent whoever i say reflects upon these words will clearly see that they suggest certain perceptions or notions repugnant to the doctrine above established of universal necessity  in order to show that there is no repugnance i begin with defining chance and contingency the former is applied to events that have happened the latter to future events when we say a thing has happened by chance we do not mean that chance was the cause for no person ever thought that chance is a thing that can act and by acting produce events we only mean that we are ignorant of the cause and that for aught we see it might have happened or not happened or have happened differently aiming at a bird i shoot by chance a favorite spaniel the meaning is not that chance killed the dog but that as to me the dogs death was accidental with respect to contingency future events that are variable and the cause unknown are said to be contingent changes of the weather for example whether it will be frost or thaw tomorrow whether fair or foul in a word chance and contingency applied to events mean not that such events happen without any cause but only that we are ignorant of the cause  it appears to me clear that there is no such thing in human nature as a sense of contingency or in other words a sense that any thing happens without a cause such a sense would be grossly delusive true it is indeed that our sense of a cause is but cloudy and indistinct with respect to certain events events that happen regularly such as summer and winter rising and setting of the sun give us a distinct impression of a cause the impression is less distinct with respect to events less regular such as alterations of the weather and extremely indistinct with respect to events that seldom happen and that happen without any known cause but with respect to no event whatever does our sense of a cause vanish altogether and give place to a positive sense of contingency that is a sense of things happening without a cause  chance and contingency thus explained suggest not any perception or notion repugnant to the doctrine of universal necessity for my ignorance of a cause does not even in my own apprehension exclude a cause descending to particulars i take the example mentioned in the text viz the uncertainty of the time of my death knowing that my life depends in some measure on myself i use all means to preserve it by proper food exercise and care to prevent accidents nor is there any delusion here i am moved to use these means by the desire i have to live these means accordingly prove effectual to carry on my present existence to the oppointed period and in that view are so many links in the great chain of causes and effects a burning coal falling from the grate upon the floor wakes me from a sound sleep i start up to extinguish the fire the motive is irresistible nor have i reason to resist were it in my power for i consider the extinction of the fire by my hand to be one of the means chosen by providence for prolonging my life to its destined period  were there a chain of causes and effects established entirely independent on me and were my life in no measure under my own power it would indeed be fruitless for me to act and the absurdity of knowingly acting in vain would be a prevailing motive for remaining at rest upon that supposition the ignavia ratio of chrysippus might take place cui si pareamus nihil omnino agamus in vita the indolent principle which if we were to follow we should do nothing in life  but i act necessarily when influenced by motives and i have no reason to forbear considering that my actions by producing their intended effects contribute to carry on the universal chain  part ii progress of morality having unfolded the principles of morality the next step is to trace out its gradual progress from its infancy among savages to its maturity among polished nations the history of opinions concerning the foundation of morality falls not within my plan and i am glad to be relieved from an article that is executed in perfection by more able hands dr cudworth and dr smith   an animal is brought forth with every one of its external members and completes its growth not by production of any new member but by addition of matter to those originally formed the same holds with respect to internal members the senses for example instincts powers and faculties principles and propensities these are coeval with the individual and are gradually unfolded some early some late the external senses being necessary for selfpreservation soon arrive at maturity some internal senses of order for instance of propriety of dignity being of no use during infancy are not only slow in their progress toward maturity but require much culture among savages they are scarce perceptible  the moral sense in its progress differs from those last mentioned it is frequently discovered even in childhood it is however slow of growth and seldom arrives at perfection without culture and experience  the moral sense not only ripens gradually with the other internal senses mentioned but from them acquires force and additional authority a savage makes no difficulty to kill an enemy in cold blood bloody scenes are familiar to him and his moral sense is not sufficiently vigorous to give him compunction the action appears in a different light to a person who has more delicacy of feeling and accordingly the moral sense has much more authority over those who have received a refined education than over savages  it is pleasant to trace the progress of morality in members of a polished nation objects of external sense make the first impressions and from them are derived a stock of simple ideas affection accompanying ideas is first directed to particular objects such as my brother my wise my friend the mind opening by degrees takes in complex objects such as my country my religion the government under which i live and these also become objects of affection our connections multiply and the moral sense gaining strength as the mind opens regulates our duty to each of them objects of hatred multiply as well as objects of affection and give full scope to dissocial passions the most formidable antagonists that morality has to encounter but nature has provided a remedy the person who indulges malice or revenge is commonly the greatest sufferer by the indulgence men become wise by experience and have more peace and satisfaction in fostering kindly affection stormy passions are subdued or brought under rigid discipline and benevolence triumphs over selfishness we refine upon the pleasures of society we learn to submit our opinions we affect to give preference to others and readily fall in with whatever sweetens social intercourse we carefully avoid causes of discord and overlooking trifling offenses we are satisfied with moderate reparation even for gross injuries  a nation from its original savage state grows to maturity like the individuals above described and the progress of morality is the same in both the savage state is the infancy of a nation during which the moral sense is feeble yielding to custom to imitation to passion but a nation like a member of a polished society ripens gradually and acquires a taste in the fine arts with acuteness of sense in matters of right and wrong hatred and revenge the great obstacles to moral duty raged without control while the privilege of avenging wrongs was permitted to individuals see historical lawtracts tract    but hatred and revenge yielding gradually to the pleasures of society and to the growing authority of the moral sense and benevolent affections prevailed over dissocial passions in that comfortable period we hear no more of cruelty as a national character on the contrary the aversion we have to an enemy is even in war exercised with moderation nor do the stormy passions ever again revive for after a nation begins to decline from its meridian height the passions that prevail are not of the violent kind but selfish timorous and deceitful  morality however has not to this day arrived to such maturity as to operate between nations with equal steadiness and vigor as between individuals ought this to be regretted as an imperfection in our nature i think not had we the same compunction of heart for injuring a nation as for injuring an individual and were injustice equally blameable as to both war would cease and a golden age ensue than which a greater misfortune could not befall the human race book   sketch     in the progress from maturity to a declining state a nation differs widely from an individual old age puts an end to the latter there are many causes that weaken the former but old age is none of them if it be not in a metaphorical sense riches selfishness and luxury are the diseases that weaken prosperous nations these diseases following each other in a train corrupt the heart dethrone the moral sense and make an anarchy in the soul men stick at no expense to purchase pleasure and they stick at no vice to supply that expense  such are the outlines of morality in its progress from birth to burial and these outlines i propose to fill up with an induction of particulars looking back to the commencement of civil society when no wants were known but those of nature and when such wants were amply provided for we find individuals of the same tribe living innocently and cordially together they had no irregular appetites nor any ground of strife in that state moral principles joined their influence with that of national affection to secure individuals from harm savages accordingly who have plenty of food and are simple in habitation and clothing seldom transgress the rules of morality within their own tribe diodorus siculus who composed his history recently after caesars expedition into britain says that the inhabitants dwelt in mean cottages covered with reeds or sticks that they were of much sincerity and integrity contented with plain and homely fare and were strangers to the excess and luxury of rich men in friezeland in holland and in other maritime provinces of the netherlands locks and keys were unknown till the inhabitants became rich by commerce they contented themselves with bare necessaries which every one had in plenty the laplanders have no notion of theft when they make an excursion into norway which is performed in the summer months they leave their huts open without fear that any thing will be purloined formerly they were entirely upright in their only commerce that of bartering the skins of wild beasts for tobacco brandy and coarse cloth but being often cheated by strangers they begin to more cunning crantz describing the inhabitants of iceland before they were corrupted by commerce with strangers says that they lived under the same roof with their cattle that every thing was common among them except their wives and children and that they were simple in their manners having no appetite but for what nature requires in the reign of edwin king of northumberland a child as historians report might have traveled with a purse of gold without hazard of robbery in our days of luxury want is so intolerable that even fear of death is not sufficient to deter us all travelers agree that the native canadians are perfectly disinterested abhorring deceit and lying the californians are fond of iron and sharp instruments and yet are so strictly honest that carpentertools left open during night were safe the savages of north america had no locks for their goods they probably have learned from europeans to be more circumspect procopius bears testimony historia gothica lib    that the sclavi like the huns were innocent people free of all malice plan carpin the popes ambassador to the cham of tartary ann      says that the tartars are not addicted to thieving and that they leave their goods open without a lock nicholas damascenus reports the same of the celtae the original inhabitants of the island borneo expelled by the mahometans from the seacoast to the center of the country are honest industrious and kindly to each other they have some notion of property but not such as to render them covetous pagans in siberia are numerous and though grossly ignorant especially in matters of religion they are a good moral people it is rare to hear among them of perjury thieving fraud or drunkenness if we except those who live among the russian christians with whose vices they are tainted strahlenberg description of russia siberia etc bears testimony to their honesty having employed a number of them in a long navigation he slept in the same boat with men whose names he knew not whose language he understood not and yet lost not a particle of his baggage being obliged to remain a fortnight among the ostiacs upon the river oby his baggage lay open in a hut inhabited by a large family and yet nothing was purloined the following incident which he also mentions is remarkable a russian of tobolski in the course of a long journey lodged one night in an ostiacs hut and the next day on the road missed his purse with a hundred rubles his landlords son hunting at some distance from the hut found the purse but left it there by his fathers order he covered it with branches to secure it in case an owner should be found after three months the russian returning lodged with the same ostiac and mentioning occasionally the loss of his purse the ostiac who at first did not recollect his face cried out with joy art thou the man who lost that purse my son shall go and show thee where it lies that thou may take it up with thine own hand the hottentots kolben have not the least notion of theft though immoderately fond of tobacco and brandy they are employed by the dutch for tending warehouses full of these commodities here is an instance of probity above temptation even among savages in the first stage of social life some individuals are more liberally endued than others with virtuous principles may it not be thought that in that respect nature has been more kind to the hottentots than to many other tribes spaniards settled on the seacoast of chili carry on a commerce with neighboring savages for bridles spurs knives and other manufactures of iron and in return receive oxen horses and even children for slaves a spaniard carries his goods there and after obtaining liberty to dispose of them he moves about and delivers his goods without the least reserve to every one who bargains with him when all is sold he intimates his departure and every purchaser hurries with his goods to him and it is not known that any one indian ever broke his engagement they give him a guard to carry him safe out of their territory with all the slaves horses and cattle he has purchased the savages of brazil are faithful to their promises and to the treaties they make with the portuguese upon some occasions they may be accused of error and wrong judgment but never of injustice nor of duplicity  while the earth was thinly peopled plenty of food procured by hunting and fishing promoted population but as population lessens the stock of animal food a savage nation increasing in numbers must spread wider and wider for more game thus tribes at first widely separate from each other approach gradually till they become neighbors hence a new scene with respect to morality differences about their hunting fields about their game about personal injuries multiply between neighbors and every quarrel is blown into a flame by the aversion men naturally have to strangers anger hatred and revenge find now vent which formerly lay latent without an object dissocial passions prevail without control because among savages morality is no match for them and cruelty becomes predominant in the human race ancient history accordingly is full of enormous cruelties witness the incursions of the northern barbarians into the roman empire and witness the incursions of genhizcan and tamerlane into the fertile countries of asia spreading destruction with fire and sword and sparing neither man woman nor infant  malevolent passions daily exercised against persons of a different tribe acquiring strength by exercise came to be vented against persons even of the same tribe and the privilege long enjoyed by individuals of avenging the wrongs done to them bestowed irresistible force upon such passions see historical lawtracts tract    the history of ancient greece presents nothing to the reader but usurpations assassinations and other horrid crimes the names of many famous for wickedness are still preserved atreus for example eteocles alcmeon phedra clytemnestra the story of pelops and his descendants is a chain of criminal horrors during that period parricide and incest were ordinary incidents euripides represents medea vowing revenge against her husband jason and laying a plot to poison him of that infamous plot the chorus express their approbation justifying every woman who in like circumstances acts the same part  the frequent incursions of northern barbarians into the roman empire spread desolation and ruin through the whole the romans from the highest polish degenerating into savages assumed by degrees the cruel and bloody manners of their conquerors and the conquerors and conquered blended into one mass equalled the grossest barbarians of ancient times in ignorance and brutality clovis king of the franks even after his conversion to christianity assassinated without remorse his nearest kinsman the children of clodomir ann   0 were assassinated by their two uncles in the thirteenth centuary ezzelino de aromano obtained the sovereignty of padua by massacring   000 of his fellowcitizens galeas sforza duke of milan was assassinated ann      in the cathedral church of milan after the assassins had put up their prayers for courage to perpetrate the deed it is a still stronger proof how low morality was in those days that the pope himself sextus iv attempted to assassinate the two brothers laurent and julien de medicis choosing the elevation of the host as a proper time when the people would be busy about their devotions nay more that very pope with unparalleled impudence excommunicated the florentines for doing justice upon the intended assassins the most sacred oaths were in vain employed as a security against that horrid crime childebert ii king of the franks enticed magnovald to his court by a solemn oath that he should receive no harm and yet made no difficulty to assassinate him during the gaiety of a banquet but these instances however horrid make no figure compared with the massacre of st bartholomew where many thousands were inhumanly and treacherously butchered even so late as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries assassination was not held in every case to be criminal many solicitous applications were made to general councils of christian clergy to declare it criminal in every case but without success ferdinand king of aragon and navarre after repeated assassinations and acts of perfidy obtained the appellation of great so little authority had the moral sense during those dark ages  but it is scarce necessary to mention particular instances of the overbearing power of malevolent passions during such ages an opinion formerly universal that the innocent may be justly involved in the same punishment with the guilty is of itself irrefragable evidence that morality once had very little influence when opposed by revenge there is no moral principle more evident than that punishment cannot be inflicted with justice but upon the guilty and yet in greece the involving of the innocent with the guilty in the same punishment was authorized even by positive law by an athenian law a man committing sacrilege or betraying his country was banished with all his children meurseus de legibus atticis lib   cap    and when a tyrant was put to death his children suffered the same fate eod lib   cap     the punishment of treason in macedon was extended against the criminals relations quintus curtius lib   cap     hanno a citizen of carthage formed a plot to enslave his country by poisoning the whole senate at a banquet he was tortured to death and his children with all his relations were cut off without mercy though they had no accession to his guilt among the japannese a people remarkably ferocious it is the practice to involve children and relations in the punishment of capital crimes even cicero the chief man for learning in the most enlightened period of the roman republic and a celebrated moralist approves that practice nec vero me fugit quam sit acerbum parentum scelera filiorum poenis lui sed hoc praeclare legibus comparatum est ut caritas liberorum amiciores parents reipublicae redderet i am sensible of the hardship of punishing the child for the crime of the parent this however is a wise enactment of our laws for hereby the parent is bound to the interest of the state by the strongest of all ties the affection to his offspring ep    ad brutum  in britain every one knows that murder was retaliated not only against the criminal and his relations but against his whole clan a practice so common as to be distinguished by a peculiar name that of deadly feud as late as the days of king edmund a law was made in england prohibiting deadly feud except between the relations of the person murdered and the murderer himself  i embrace the present opportunity to honor the jews by observing that they were the first people we read of who had correct notions of morality with respect to the present point the following law is express the fathers shall not be put to death for the children neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers every man shall be put to death for his own sin deuteronomy xxiv     amaziah king of judah gave strict obedience to that law in avenging his fathers death and it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father but the children of the murderers he slew not according to that which is written in the book of the law of moses   kings chap     there is an elegant passage in ezekiel to the same purpose chap     what mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten four grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge as i live says the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel the soul that sins it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him among the jews however as among other nations there are instances without number of involving innocent children and relations in the same punishments with the guilty such power has revenge as to trample upon conscience and upon the most express laws instigated with rage for nabals ingratitude king david made a vow to god not to leave alive of all who pertained to nabal any that pisseth against the wall and it was not any compunction of conscience that diverted him from his cruel purpose but nabals beautiful wife who pacified him   samuel chap     but such contradiction between principle and practice is not peculiar to the jews we find examples of it in the laws of the roman empire the true principle of punishment is laid down in an edict of the emperors arcadius and honorius l    cod de poenis  sancimus ibi esse poenam ubi et noxia est propinquos notos familiares procul a calumnia submovemus quos reos sceleris societas non facit nec enim adfinitas vel amicitia nefarium crimen admittunt peccata igitur suos teneant auctores nec ulterius progrediatur metus quam reperiatur delictum hoc singulis quibusque judicibus intimetur we ordain that the punishment of the crime shall extend to the criminal alone we hold his relations his friends and his acquaintances unsuspected for intimacy friendship or connection are no proof or argument of guilt the consequences of the crime shall pursue only its perpetrator let this statute be intimated to all our judges  these very emperors with respect to treason which touched them nearer than other crimes talk a very different language after observing that will and purpose alone without an ouvert act is treason subjecting the criminal to capital punishment and to forfeiture of all that belongs to him they proceed in the following words l   cod ad leg jul majest  filii vero ejus quibus vitam imperatoria specialiter lenitate concedimus paterno enim deberent perire supplicio in quibus paterni hoc est hereditarii criminis exempla metuuntur a materna vel avita omnium etiam proximorum hereditate ac successione habeantur alieni testamentis extraneorum nihil capiant sint perpetuo egentes et pauperes infamia eos paterna semper comitetur ad nullos prorsus honores ad nulla sacramenta perveniant sint postremo tales ut his perpetua egestate sordentibus sit et mors solatium et vita supplicium by a special extension of our imperial clemency we allow the sons of the criminal to live although in strict justice being tainted with hereditary guilt they ought to suffer the punishment of their father but it is our will that they shall be incapable of allinheritance either from the mother the grandfather or any of their kindred that they shall be deprived of the power of inheriting by the testament of a stranger that they shall be abandoned to the extreme of poverty and perpetual indigence that the infamy of their father shall ever attend them incapable of honors and excluded from the participation of religious rites that such in fine shall be the misery of their condition that life shall be a punishment and death a comfort   human nature is not so perverse as without veil or disguise to punish a person acknowledged to be innocent an irregular bias of imagination which extends the qualities of the principal to its accessories paves the way to that unjust practice elements of criticism chap   sect    that bias strengthened by indignation against an atrocious criminal leads the mind hastily to conclude that all his connections are partakers of his guilt in an enlightened age the clearness of moral principles fetters the imagination from confounding the innocent with the guilty there remain traces however of that bias though not carried so far as murder the sentence pronounced against ravilliac for assassinating henry iv of france ordains that his house be erazed to the ground and that no other building be ever erected upon that spot was not this in imagination punishing a house for the proprietors crime  murder and assassination are not only destructive in themselves but if possible still more destructive in their consequences the practice of shedding blood unjustly and often wantonly blunts conscience and paves the way to every crime this observation is verified in the ancient greeks their cruel and sanguinary character rendered them little regardful of the strict rules of justice right was held to depend on power among men as among wild beasts it was conceived to be the will of the gods that superior force should be a lawful title to dominion for what right can the weak have to what they cannot defend were that maxim to obtain a weak man would have no right to liberty nor to life that impious doctrine was avowed by the athenians and publicly asserted by their ambassadors in a conference with the melians reported by thucydides lib    many persons act as if force and right were the same but a barefaced profession of such a doctrine is uncommon in the eumenides a tragedy of eschylus orestes is arraigned in the areopagus for killing his mother minerva president of the court decrees in favor of orestes and for what reason having no mother myself the murder of a mother touches not me athens from the nature of its government as established by solon was rendered incapable of any regular or consistent body of laws in every case civil and criminal the whole people were judges in the last resort and what sort of judges will an ignorant multitude make who have no guide but passion and prejudice it is vain to make good laws when such judges are interpreters anacharsis the scythian being present at an assembly of the people said it was singular that in athens wise men pleaded causes and fools determined them  in the tragedy of electra orestes consulting the delphic oracle about means to avenge his fathers murder was enjoined by apollo to forbear force but to employ fraud and guile obedient to that injunction orestes commands his tutor to spread in argos the news of his death and to confirm the same with a solemn oath in homer even the great jupiter makes no difficulty to send a lying dream to agamemnon chief of the greeks dissimulation is recommended by the goddess minerva odyssey book     ulysses delcares his detestation at using freedom with truth book     and yet no man deals more in feigned stories book    book     in the   d book of the iliad minerva is guilty of gross deceit and treachery to hector when he flies from achilles she appears to him in the shape of his brother deiphobus exhorts him to turn upon achilles and promises to assist him hector calls upon his brother for another lance but in vain for deiphobus was not there the greeks in homers time must have been strangely deformed in their morals when such a story could be relished upon the story of jupiter being deceived by juno in the   th book of the iliad pope says that he knows not a bolder fiction in all antiquity nor one that has a greater air of impiety pope it would seem was little acquainted with antiquity for such acts of impiety were common among the greeks and in particular the incident mentioned in the text is not only more impious but also a more gross violation of the laws of morality  a nation begins not to polish nor to advance in morality till writing be common and writing was not known among the greeks at the siege of troy nor were the morals of that people as we see much purified for a long time after writing became common when plautus wrote the roman system of morals must have been extremely impure in his play termed menaechmi a gentleman of fashion having accidentally got into his hands a ladys robe with a gold clasp instead of returning them to the owner endeavors to sell them without shame or remorse such a scene would not be suffered at present except among pickpockets both the greeks and carthaginians were held by the romans to be artful and cunning the romans continued a plain people with much simplicity of manners when the nations mentioned had made great progress in the arts of life and it is a fad truth that morality declines in proportion as a nation polishes but if the romans were later than the greeks and carthaginians in the arts of life they soon surpassed them in every sort of immorality for this change of manners they were indebted to their rapid conquests the sanguinary disposition both of the greeks and romans appears from another practice that of exposing their infant children which continued till humanity came in some measure to prevail the practice continues in china to this day the populousness of the country throwing a veil over the cruelty but from the humanity of the chinese i conjecture that the practice will be found rare the jews a cloudy and peevish tribe much addicted to bloodshed were miserably defective in moral principles take the following examples out of an endless number recorded in the bocks of the old testament jael wife of heber took under her protection sisera general of the canaanites and engaged her faith for his security she put him treacherously to death when asleep and was applauded by deborah the prophetess for the meritorious action judges iv    that horrid deed would probably have appeared to her in a different light had it been committed against barac general of the israelites david flying from saul took refuge with achish king of gath and though protected by that king made war against the kings allies saying that it was against his own countrymen of judah and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath and achish believed david saying he has made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever i samuel xxvii     this was a complication of ingratitude lying and treachery ziba by presents to king david and by defaming his master mephibosheth procured from the king a gift of his masters inheritance though mephibosheth had neither trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed till he returned in peace and it came to pass when mephibosheth was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest thou not with me mephibosheth and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame and he has slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes for all my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king yet did thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table what right therefore have i to cry any more unto the king david could not possibly atone for his rashness but by restoring to mephibosheth his inheritance and punishing ziba in an exemplary manner but hear the sentence and the king said unto him why speak thou any more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land   samuel xix     the same king after pardoning shimei for cursing him and swearing that he should not die yet upon his deathbed enjoined his son solomon to put shimei to death now therefore hold him not guiltless but his hoary head bring thou down to the grave with blood   kings ii    i wish not to be misapprehended as intending to censure david in particular if the best king the jews ever had was so miserably deficient in morality what must be thought of the nation in general when david was lurking to avoid the wrath of saul he became acquainted with nabal who had a great stock of cattle he discharged his followers says josephus antiquities book    either for avarice or hunger or any pretext whatever to touch a single hair of them preaching still on the text of doing justice to all men in conformity to the will of god who is not pleased with any man that covets or lays violent hands on the goods of his neighbor our author proceeds to acquaint us that nabal having refused to supply david with provisions and having sent back the messengers with a scoffing answer david in great rage made a vow that he would destroy nabal with his house and family our author observes that davids indignation against nabal was not so much for his ingratitude as for the virulence of an insolent outrage against one who had never injured him and what was the outrage it was says our author that nabal enquiring who the said david was and being told that he was one of the sons of jesse yes yes says nabal your runaway servants look upon themselves to be brave fellows i warrant you strange looseness of morals i mean not david who was in wrath but josephus writing sedately in his closet he every where celebrates david for his justice and piety composes for him the very warm exhortation mentioned above and yet thinks him not guilty of any wrong in vowing to break every rule of justice and humanity upon so slight a provocation as a scoffing expression such as no man of temper will regard  european nations who originally were fierce and sanguinary like the greeks and jews had the same cloudy and uncorrect notions of right and wrong it is scarce necessary to give instances the low state of morality during the dark ages of christianity being known to all in the time of louis xi of france promises and engagements were utterly disregarded till they were sanctified by a solemn oath nor were such oaths long regarded they lost their force and were not relied on more than simple promises all faith among men seemed to be at an end even those who appeared the most scrupulous about character were however ready to grasp at any subterfuge to excuse their breach of engagement and it is a still stronger proof of selfdeceit that such subterfuges were frequently prepared beforehand in order to furnish an excuse it was a common practice some ages ago to make private protestations which were thought sufficient to relieve men in conscience from being bound by a solemn treaty charles afterward emperor of germany during his minority gave authority to declare publicly his accession to a treaty of peace between his grandfather maximilian and the king of france but at the same time protested privately before a notary and witnesses that notwithstanding his public accession to the said treaty it was not his intention to be bound by every article of it and particularly that the clause reserving to the king of france the sovereignty of certain territories in the netherlands should not be binding is it possible charles could be so blind as not to see that such practice if it have any effect must destroy all faith among men what better was this than what was practiced by robert king of france in the tenth century to free his subjects from the guilt of perjury they swore upon a box of relics out of which the relics were privately taken correa a portuguese general made a treaty with the king of pegu and it was agreed that each party should swear to observe the treaty laying his hand upon the sacred book of his religion correa swore upon a collection of songs and by that vile stratagem thought that he was not bound the inhabitants of britain were so loose formerly that a man was not reckoned safe in his own house without a mastiff to protect him from violence mastiffs were permitted even to those who dwelt within the kings forests and to prevent danger to the deer there was in england a court for lawing or expeditation of mastives i e for cutting off the claws of their forefeet to prevent them from running carta de foresta cap    the trial and condemnation of charles i in a pretended court of justice however audacious and unconstitutional was yet an effort toward regularity and order in the preceding age the king would have been taken off by assassination or poison every prince in europe had an officer whose province it was to secure his master against poison a lady was appointed to that office by queen elizabeth of england and the form was to give to each of the servants a mouthful to eat of the dish he brought in poison must have been frequent in those days to make such a regulation necessary to vouch still more clearly the low ebb of morality during that period seldom it happened that a man of figure died suddenly or of an unusual disease but poison was suspected men conscious of their own vicious disposition are prone to suspect others the dauphin son to francis i of france a youth of about eighteen having overheated himself at play took a great draught of iced water and died of a pleurisy in five days the death was sudden but none is more natural the suspicion however of poison was universal and montecuculi who attended the young prince was formally condemned to death and executed for it for no better reason than that he had at all times ready access to the prince  considering the low state of morality where dissocial passions bear rule as in the scenes now displayed one would require a miracle to recover mankind out of such anarchy but as observed above book   sketch    providence brings order out of confusion the intolerable distress of a state of things where a promise or even an oath is a rope of sand and where all are set against all hobbes  made people at last sensible that they must either renounce society altogether or qualify themselves for it by checking their dissocial passions finding from experience that the gratification of social affections exceeds greatly that of cruelty and revenge men endeavored to acquire a habit of selfcommand and of restraining their stormy passions the necessity of fulfilling every moral duty was recognized men listened to conscience the voice of god in their hearts and the moral sense was cordially submitted to as the ultimate judge in all matters of right and wrong salutary laws and steady government contributed to perfect that glorious revolution private conviction alone would not have been effectual not at least in many ages  from that revolution is derived what is termed the law of nations meaning certain regulations dictated by the moral sense in its maturity the laws of our nature refine gradually as our nature refines the putting an enemy to death in cold blood is averse to improved nature though common while barbarity prevailed it is held infamous to use poisoned weapons though the moral sense made little opposition while rancour and revenge were ruling passions aversion against strangers is taught to vary its object from individuals to the nation that is our enemy i bear enmity against france but dislike not any one frenchman being conscious that it is the duty of subjects to serve their king and country in one of our illconcerted descents upon france during the late war signal humanity appeared in forbearing to burn a manufactory of sails and ropes belonging to the king because it would have destroyed an adjoining building of the same kind belonging to a private manufacturer  in distributing justice we make no distinction between natives and foreigners if any partiality be indulged it is in favor of the helpless stranger  but cruelty is not the only antagonist to morality there is another less violent indeed but more cunning and undermining and that is the hoardingappetite before money was introduced that appetite was extremely faint in the first stage of civil society men are satisfied with plain necessaries and having these in plenty they think not of providing against want but money is a species of property so universal in operation and so permanent in value as to rouse the appetite for hoarding love of money excites industry and the many beautiful productions of industry magnificent houses splendid gardens rich garments inflame the appetite to an extreme in the thirteenth century so obscured was the moral sense by rapacity and avarice that robbery on the highway and the coining false money were in germany held to be privileges of great lords that perjury was common in the city of london especially among jurymen makes a preamble in more than one statute of henry vii in the dance of death translated from the french in the said kings reign with additions adapted to english manners a juryman is introduced who influenced by bribes had often given a false verdict and the sheriff was often suspected as accessory to the crime by returning for jurymen persons of a bad character carew in his account of cornwall says that it was an ordinary article in an attorneys bill to charge pro amicitia vicecomitis for the friendship of the sheriff  perjury in jurors of the city of london is greatly complained of stow informs us that in the year      many jurors of that city were punished and papers fixed on their heads declaring their offense of being corrupted by the parties to the suit he complains of that corruption as flagrant in the reign of elizabeth when he wrote his account of london fuller in his english worthies mentions it as a proverbial saying that london juries hang half and save half grafton in his chronicle mentions that the chancellor of the bishop of london being indicted for murder the bishop wrote a letter to cardinal wolsey begging his interposition for having the prosecution stopped because london juries were so corrupted that they would find abel guilty of the murder of cain in that period the morals of the english were in every particular extremely loose we learn from strypes annals vol    that in the county of somerset alone forty persons were executed in one year for robbery theft and other felonies thirtyfive burnt in the hand thirtyseven whipped one hundred and eightythree discharged though most wicked and desperate persons and yet that the fifth part of the felonies committed in that county were not brought to trial either from cunning in the felons indolence in the magistrate or foolish lenity in the people that other counties were in no better condition and many in a worse and that commonly there were three or four hundred ablebodied vagabonds in every county who lived by theft and rapine harrison computes that in the reign of henry viii seventytwo thousand thieves and rogues were hanged and that in elizabeths time there were only hanged yearly between three and four hundred for theft and robbery at present there are not forty hanged in a year for these crimes the same author reports that in the reign of elizabeth there were computed to be in england ten thousand gypsies in the year   0  complaints were made in parliament of the rapine of the justices of peace and a member said that this magistrate was an animal who for half a dozen of chickens would dispense with a dozen of penal statutes the people of whidah in guinea are much addicted to pilfering bosman was told by the king that his subjects were not like those of ardrah who on the slightest umbrage will poison an european this says he you have no reason to apprehend here but take care of your goods for so expert are my people at thieving that they will steal from you while you are looking on the caribbeans who know no wants but what nature inspires are amazed at the industry of the europeans in amassing wealth listen to one of them expostulating with a frenchman in the following terms how miserable art thou to expose thy person to tedious and dangerous voyages and to suffer thyself to be oppressed with anxiety about futurity an inordinate appetite for wealth is thy bane and yet thou art no less tormented in preserving the goods thou have acquired than in acquiring more fear of robbery or shipwreck suffers thee not to enjoy a quiet moment thus thou growest old in thy youth thy hair turns gray thy forehead is wrinkled a thousand ailments afflict thy body a thousand distresses surround thy heart and thou movest with painful hurry to the grave why art thou not content with what thy own country produces why not contemn superfluities as we do  to control the hoarding appetite which when inflamed is the bane of civil society the god of nature has provided two efficacious principles the moral sense and the sense of property the hoarding appetite it is true is more and more inflamed by beautiful productions in the progress of art but on the other hand the senses mentioned growing to maturity have a commanding influence over the actions of men and when cherished in a good government are a sufficient counterbalance to the hoarding appetite the ancient egyptians enjoyed for ages the blessings of good government and moral principles were among them carried to a greater degree of refinement than at present even in our courts of equity it was made the duty of every one to succor those who were unjustly attacked even passengers were not exempted a regulation among them that a man could not be imprisoned for debt was well suited to the tenor of their laws and manners it could not have taken place but among an honest and industrious people in old rome though remarkable for temperance and austerity of manners a debtor could be imprisoned and even sold as a slave for payment of the debt but the patricians were the creditors and the poor plebeians were held in woeful subjection a bankrupt in england who pays three fourths of his debt and obtains a certificate of his good behavior is discharged of all the debts contracted by him before his bankruptcy such regulation was perhaps not unsuitable to the moderation and frugality of the period when it was made but luxury and external show have now become our ruling passions and to supply our extravagance money must be procured at any rate trade in particular has degenerated into a species of gaming men venturing their all in hopes of a lucky hit to elevate them above their neighbors and did they only venture their own the case would not be deplorable they venture all they can procure upon credit and by that means reduce to beggary many an innocent family with respect to themselves they know the worst of it which is to be cleared from their debts by a certificate the morals of our people are indeed at so low an ebb as to require the most severe laws against bankruptcy when a man borrows a sum it is implied in the covenant that all his effects present and future shall lie open to the creditor for which reason it is contradictory to justice that a creditor should be forced to discharge his debtor without obtaining complete payment many debtors it is true deserve favor but it ought to be left to the humanity of creditors and not to be forced from them by law the debtor at the same time may be safely left to the humanity of his creditors for if he have conducted his affairs with strict integrity and with any degree of prudence there will scarce be found one man so hardhearted as to stand out against the laudable and benevolent intentions of his fellowcreditors nay if he have any regard to character he dares not stand out he would be held as a monster and be abhorred by all the world to leave a bankrupt thus to the mercy of his creditors would produce the most salutary effects it would excite men to be strictly just in their dealings and put an end to gaming so destructive to credit because misbehaviour in any of these particulars would set the whole creditors against their debtor and leave him no hope of favor in the late bankruptstatute for scotland accordingly the clause concerning the certificate was wisely left out as unsuitable to the depraved manners of the present times  the moderation of the inhabitants of hamburgh and their public spirit kept in vigor by a free government preserve morality among them entire from taint or corruption i give an illustrious instance instead of a tax upon trade or riches every merchant puts privately into the public chest what he thinks ought to be his contribution the total sum seldom falls short of expectation and among that numerous body of men not one is suspected of contributing less than his proportion but luxury has not yet got footing in that city a climate not kindly and a soil not fertile enured the swiss to temperance and to virtue patriotism continues their ruling passion they are fond of serving their country and are honest and faithful to each other a lawsuit among them is a wonder and a door is seldom shut unless to keep out cold  the hurtful effects of the hoarding appetite with respect to individuals make no figure compared with its poisonous influence upon the public in every state enriched by conquest or by commerce which i have had more than one opportunity to mention overflowing riches unequally distributed multiply artificial wants beyond all bounds they eradicate patriotism they foster luxury sensuality and selfishness which are commonly gratified at the expense even of justice and honor the athenians were early corrupted by opulence to which every thing was made subservient it is an oracle says the chorus in the agamemnon of eschylus that is not purchased with money during the infancy of a nation vice prevails from imbecility in the moral sense in the decline of a nation it prevails from the corruption of affluence  in a small state there is commonly much virtue at home and much violence abroad the romans were to their neighbors more baneful than famine or pestilence but patriotism in them occasioned great integrity at home an oath when given to fortify an engagement with a fellowcitizen was more sacred at rome than in any other part of the world lesprit des loix live   chapter     the censorian office cannot succeed but among a virtuous people because its rewards and punishments have no influence but upon those who are ashamed of vice in the fifteenth century the french clergy from the pulpit censured public transactions and even the conduct of their king as our british clergy did in the days of charles i and ii they assumed the privilege of a roman censor but they were not men of such authority as to do any good in a corrupted nation  as soon as asiatic opulence and luxury prevailed in rome selfishness sensuality and avarice formed the character of the romans and the censorian power was at an end such relaxation of morals ensued as to make a law necessary prohibiting the custody of an infant to be given to the heir for fear of murder and for the same reason it was held unlawful to make a covenant de hereditate viventis these regulations prove the romans to have been grossly corrupt our law is different in both articles because it entertains not the same bad opinion of the people whom it governs domitius enobarbus and appius pulcher were consuls of rome in the    th year and memmius and calvinus were candidates for succeeding them in that office it was agreed among these four worthy gentlemen that they should mutually assist each other the consuls engaged to promote the election of memmius and calvinus and they on the other hand subscribed a bond obliging themselves under a penalty of about l  000 sterling to procure three augurs who should attest that they were present in the comitia when a law passed investing the consuls with military command in their provinces and also obliging themselves to produce three persons of consular rank to depose that they were not only present in the senate but actually in the number of those who signed a decree conferring on the consuls the usual proconsular appointments and yet the law made in the comitia and the decree in the senate were pure fictions never even spoken of infamous as this transaction was memmius to answer some political purpose was not ashamed to divulge it to the senate this same memmius however continued to be ciceros correspondent and his professed friend proh tempora proh mores but power and riches were at that time ruling passions and the principles of morality were very little regarded  it is needless to dissemble that selfishness sensuality and avarice must in england be the fruits of great opulence as in every other country and that morality cannot maintain its authority against such undermining antagonists customhouseoaths have become so familiar among us as to be swallowed without a wry face and is it certain that bribery and perjury in electing parliamentmembers are not approaching to the same cool state in the infancy of morality a promise makes but a slight impression to give it force it is commonly accompanied with many solemnities see historical lawtracts tract    and in treaties between sovereigns even these solemnities are not relied on without a solemn oath when morality arrives at maturity the oath is thought unnecessary and at present morality is so much on the decline that a solemn oath is not more relied on than a simple promise was originally laws have been made to prevent such immorality but in vain because none but patriots have an interest to support them and when patriotism is banished by corruption there is no remaining spring in government to make them effectual the statutes made against gaming and against bribery and corruption in elections have no authority over a degenerate people nothing is studied but how to evade the penalties and supposing statutes to be made without end for preventing known evasions new evasions will spring up in their stead the misery is that such laws if they prove abortive are never innocent with regard to consequences for nothing is more subversive of morality as well as of patriotism than a habit of disregarding the laws of our country lying and perjury are not in every case equally criminal at least are not commonly reckoned so lying or perjury in order to injure a man is held highly criminal and the greater the hurt the greater the crime to relieve from punishment few boggle at a lie or at perjury sincerity is not even expected and hence the practice of torture many men are not scrupulous about oaths when they have no view but to obtain justice to themselves the jacobites that they might not be deprived of their privileges as british subjects made no great difficulty to swallow oaths to the present government though in them it was perjury it is dangerous to withdraw the smallest peg in the moral edifice for the whole will totter and tumble men creep on to vice by degrees perjury in order to support a friend has become customary of late years witness fictitious qualifications in the electors of parliament men which are made effectual by perjury yet such is the degeneracy of the present times that no man is the worse thought of upon that account we must not flatter ourselves that the poison will reach no farther a man who boggles not at perjury to serve a friend will in time become such an adept as to commit perjury in order to ruin a friend when he becomes an enemy   but pride sometimes happily interposes to stem the tide of corruption the poor are not ashamed to take a bribe from the rich nor weak states from those that are powerful disguised only under the name of subsidy or pension both france and england have been in the practice of securing the alliance of some foreign princes by pensions and it is natural in the ministers of a pensioned prince to receive a gratification for keeping their master to his engagement england never was at any time so inferior to france as to suffer their king to accept a pension whatever private transactions might be between the kings themselves but the ministers of england thought it no disparagement to receive pensions from france every minister of edward iv of england received a pension from louis xi and they made no difficulty of granting a receipt accordingly the old earl of warwick says commines was the only exception he took the money but refused a receipt cardinal wolsey had a pension both from the emperor and from the king of france and his master henry was vain that his minister was so much regarded by the first powers in europe during the reigns of charles ii and of his brother james england made so despicable a figure that the ministers accepted pensions from louis xiv a king void of virtue was never well served king charles most disgracefully accepted a pension from france what scruple could his ministers have britain governed by a king eminently virtuous and patriotic makes at present so great a figure that even the lowest minister would disdain a pension from any foreign prince men formerly were so blind as not to see that a pension creates a bias in a minister against his master and his country at present men are so quicksighted as clearly to see that a foreign pension to a minister is no better than a bribe and it would be held so by all the world  in a nation enriched by conquest or commerce where selfish passions always prevail it is difficult to stem the tide of immorality the decline of virtue may be retarded by wholesome regulations but no regulations will ever restore it to its meridian vigor marcus aurelius emperor of rome caused statues to be made of all the brave men who figured in the germanic war it has long been a practice in china to honor persons eminent for virtue by feasting them annually at the emperors expense a late emperor made an improvement he ordered reports to be sent him annually of men and women who when alive had been remarkable for public spirit or private virtue in order that monuments might be erected to their memory the following report is one of many that were sent to the emperor according to the order of your majesty for erecting monuments to the honor of women who have been celebrated for continence for filial piety or for purity of manners the viceroy of canton reports that in the town of sinhoei a beautiful young woman named leang sacrificed her life to save her chastity in the fifteenth year of our emperor canghi she was dragged by pirates into their ship and having no other way to escape their brutal lust she threw herself headlong into the sea being of opinion that to prefer honor before life is an example worthy of imitation we purpose according to your majestys order to erect a triumphal arch for that young woman and to engrave her story upon a large stone that it may be preserved in perpetual remembrance at the foot of the report is written the emperor approves pity it is that such regulations should ever prove abortive for their purpose is excellent but they would need angels to put them in execution every deviation from a just selection enervates them and frequent deviations render them a subject of ridicule but how are deviations to be prevented when men are the judges those who distribute the rewards will prefer their friends and overlook those of greater merit like the censorian power in rome such regulations after many abuses will sink into contempt  two errors which infested morality in dark times have occasioned much injustice and i am not certain that they are yet totally eradicated the first is an opinion that an action derives its quality of right and wrong from the event without regard to intention the other is that the end justifies the means or in other words that means otherwise unlawful may be lawfully employed to bring about a good end with an account of these two errors i shall close the present historical sketch  that intention is the circumstance which qualifies an action and its author to be criminal or innocent is made evident in the first part of the present sketch and is now admitted to be so by every moral writer but rude and barbarous nations seldom carry their thoughts beyond what falls under their external senses they conclude an action to be right that happens to do good and an action to be wrong that happens to do harm without ever thinking of motives of will of intention or of any circumstance that is not obvious to eyesight from many passages in the old testament it appears that the external act only with its consequences were regarded isaac imitating his father abraham made his wife rebecca pass for his sister abimelech king of the philistines having discovered the imposture said to isaac what is this thou have done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou should have brought guiltiness upon us genesis chap     jonathan was condemned to die for transgressing a prohibition he never heard of   samuel xiv     a sin of ignorance i e an action done without ill intention required a sacrifice of expiation leviticus chap    saul being defeated by the philistines fell on his own sword the wound not being mortal he prevailed on a young amalekite to pull out the sword and to dispatch him with it josephus book   of antiquities says that david ordered the criminal to be delivered up to justice as a regicide  the greeks appear to have wavered greatly about intention sometimes holding it essential to a crime and sometimes disregarding it as a circumstance of no moment of these contradictory opinions we have pregnant evidence in the two tragedies of oedipus the first taking it for granted that a crime consists entirely in the external act and its consequences the other holding intention to be indispensable oedipus had killed his father laius and married his mother jocasta but without any criminal intention being ignorant of his relation to them and yet history informs us that the gods punished the thebans with pestilence for suffering a wretch so grossly criminal to live sophocles author of both tragedies puts the following words in the mouth of tiresias the prophet  know then with those he loves unconscious of his guilt is yet most guilty and that doctrine is espoused by aristotle in a later period who holding oedipus to have been deeply criminal though without intention is of opinion that a more proper subject for tragedy never was brought upon the stage nay as a philosopher he talks currently of an involuntary crime orestes in euripides acknowledges himself to be guilty in killing his mother yet asserts with the same breath that his crime was inevitable a necessary crime a crime commanded by religion  in oedipus coloneus the other tragedy mentioned a very different proposition is maintained a defense is made for that unlucky man agreeable to sound moral principles that having had no bad intention he was entirely innocent and that his misfortunes ought to be ascribed to the wrath of the gods thou who upbraidst me thus for all my woes murder and incest which against my will i had committed so it pleased the gods offended at my race for former crimes but i am guiltless can thou name a fault deserving this for tell me was it mine when to my father phoebus did declare that he should one day perish by the hand of his own child was oedipus to blame who had no being then if born at length to wretchedness he met his sire unknown and slew him that involuntary deed can thou condemn and for my fatal marriage do thou not blush to name it was not she thy sister she who bore me ignorant and guiltless woman afterward my wife and mother to my children what she did she did unknowing but not for that nor for my murdered father have i deserved thy bitter taunts for tell me thy life attacked would thou have staid to ask the assassin if he were thy father no selflove would urge thee to revenge the insult thus was i drove to ill by the angry gods this should my fathers soul revisit earth himself would own and pity oedipus again in the fourth act the following prayer is put up for oedipus by the chorus  o grant that not oppressed by torturing pain beneath the stroke of death he linger long but swift with easy steps descend to styxs drear abode for he has led a life of toil and pain may the just gods repay his undeserved woe the audience was the same in both plays did they think oedipus to be guilty in the one play and innocent in the other if they did not how could both plays be relished if they did they must have been grossly stupid  the statues of a roman emperor were held so sacred that to treat them with any contempt was high treason this ridiculous opinion was carried so far out of common sense that a man was held guilty of high treason if a stone thrown by him happened accidentally to touch one of these statues and the law continued in force till abrogated by a rescript of severus antoninus l   ad leg jul majest   in england so little was intention regarded that casual homicide and even homicide in selfdefence were capitally punished it requires strong evidence to vouch so absurd a law and i have the strongest viz the act of   o henry iii cap    converting the capital punishment into a forfeiture of movables the same gross blunder continued much longer to be law in scotland by act    parl      renewed act    parl      the capital punishment is converted to imprisonment or a fine to the wife and children in a period so late as the restoration strange blindness it was not to perceive that homicide in selfdefence being a lawful act justified by the strictest rules of morality subjects not a man to punishment more than the defending his property against a robber and that casual homicide meaning homicide committed innocently without ill intention may subject him to reparation but never to any punishment mild or severe  the jesuits in their doctrines seem to rest on the external act disregarding intention it is with them a matter of perfect indifference from what motive men obey the laws of god and that the service of those who obey from fear of punishment is no less acceptable to the deity than of those who obey from a principle of love external show made a great figure when nothing was regarded but what is visible by acuteness of judgment and refinement of taste the pleasures of society prevail and forms and ceremonies are disregarded external show however continues to stand its ground in several instances it occasions in particular many an illsorted match a young man is apt to be captivated with beauty or dress a young woman with equipage or a title   the other error mentioned above is that the end justifies the means in defense of that proposition it is urged that the character of the means is derived from the end that every action must be right which contributes to a good end and that every action must be wrong which contributes to an ill end but those who reason thus ought first to consider whether reasoning be at all applicable to the present subject reason is the true touchstone of truth and falsehood but the moral sense is the only touchstone of right and wrong and to maintain that reason is our guide in judging of right and wrong is no less absurd than to maintain that the moral sense is our guide in judging of truth and falsehood the moral sense dictates that on no pretext whatever is it lawful to do an act of injustice or any wrong see the first part of this sketch sect   at the end  and men conscious that the moral sense governs in matters of right and wrong submit implicitly to its dictates influenced however by the reasoning mentioned during the nonage of the moral sense men did wrong currently in order to bring about a good end witness pretended miracles and forged writings urged without reserve by every sect of christians against their antagonists and i am sorry to observe that the error is not totally eradicated missionaries employed in converting infidels to the true faith are little scrupulous about the means they make no difficulty to feign prodigies in order to convert those who are not moved by argument such pious frauds tend to sap the very foundations of morality  sketch iii principles and progress of theology as no branch of knowledge can vie with theology either in dignity or importance it justly claims to be a favorite study with every person endued with true taste and solid judgment from the time that writing was invented natural religion has employed pens without number and yet in no language is there found a complete history of it that task is far above my abilities i propose only a slight sketch which i shall glory in however imperfect if it excite any one of superior talents to undertake a task so arduous  chap i existence of a deity that there are beings one or many powerful above men has been generally believed among the various tribes of men i may say universally believed notwithstanding what is reported of some gross savages for reports repugnant to the common nature of man require more able vouchers than a few illiterate voyagers among many savage tribes there are no words but for objects of external sense is it surprising that such people are incapable to express their religious perceptions or any perception of internal sense and from their silence can it be fairly presumed that they have no such perception in the language even of peru there is not a word for expressing an abstract idea such as time endurance space existence substance matter body it is no less defective in expressing moral ideas such as virtue justice gratitude liberty the yameos a tribe on the river oroonoko described by condamine use the word poettarraroincouroac to express the number three and have no word for a greater number the brasilian language is nearly as barren  the belief of superior powers in every country where there are words to express it is so well vouched that in fair reasoning it ought to be taken for granted among the few tribes where language is deficient even the grossest idolatry affords to me evidence of that belief no nation can be so brutish as to worship a stock or a stone merely as such the visible object is always imagined to be connected with some invisible power and the worship paid to the former is as representing the latter or as in some manner connected with it every family among the ancient lithuanians entertained a real serpent as a household god and the same practice is at present universal among the negroes in the kingdom of whidah it is not the serpent that is worshipped but some deity imagined to reside in it the ancient egyptians were not idiots to pay divine honors to a bull or a cat as such the divine honors were paid to a deity as residing in these animals the sun is to man a familiar object as it is frequently obscured by clouds and totally eclipsed during night a savage readily conceives it to be a great fire sometimes flaming bright sometimes obscured and sometimes extinguished whence then sunworship once universal among savages plainly from the same cause it is not properly the sun that is worshipped but a deity who is supposed to dwell in that luminary  taking it then for granted that our belief of superior powers has been long universal the important question is from what cause it proceeds a belief so universal and so permanent cannot proceed from chance but must have a cause operating constantly and invariably upon all men in all ages philosophers who believe the world to be eternal and selfexistent and imagine it to be the only deity though without intelligence endeavor to account for our belief of superior powers from the terror that thunder and other elementary convulsions raise in savages and thence conclude that such belief is no evidence of a deity thus lucretius praeterea cui non animus formidine divum contrahitur cui non conripunt membra pavore fulminis horribili cum plaga torrida tellus contremit et magnum percurrunt murmura coelum what man can boast that firm undaunted soul that hears unmoved when thunder shakes the pole nor shrinks with fear of an offended power when lightnings flash and storms and tempests roar  lib    and petronius arbiter primus in orb deos fecit timor ardua coelo fulmina quum caderent discussaque moenia flammis atque ictus flagraret athos when dread convulsions rocked the laboring earth and livid clouds first gave the thunder birth instinctive fear within the human breast the first ideas of a god impressed   man during infancy a defenseless animal is endued on that account with a large portion of fear savages grossly ignorant of causes and effects take fright at every unusual appearance and recur to some malignant power as the cause now if the authors quoted mean only that the first perception of deity among savages is occasioned by fear i heartily subscribe to their opinion but if it was their meaning that such perceptions proceed from fear solely without having any other cause i wish to be informed from what source is derived the belief we have of superior benevolent beings fear cannot be the source and it will be seen anon that though malevolent deities were first recognized among savages yet that in the progress of society the existence of benevolent deities was universally believed the fact is certain and therefore fear is not the sole cause of our believing the existence of superior beings  it is beside to me evident that the belief even of malevolent deities once universal among all the tribes of men cannot be accounted for from fear solely i observe first that there are many men to whom an eclipse an earthquake and even thunder are unknown egypt in particular though the country of superstition is little or not at all acquainted with the two latter nor do such appearances strike terror into every one who is acquainted with them the universality of the belief must then have some cause more universal than fear i observe next that if the belief were founded solely on fear it would die away gradually as men improve in the knowledge of causes and effects instruct a savage that thunder an eclipse an earthquake proceed from natural causes and are not threatenings of an incensed deity his fear of malevolent beings will vanish and with it his belief in them if founded solely on fear yet the direct contrary is true in proportion as the human understanding ripens our belief of superior powers or of a deity turns more and more firm and authoritative which will be made evident in the chapter immediately following  philosophers of more enlarged views and of deeper penetration may possibly think that the operations of nature and the government of this world which loudly proclaim a deity may be sufficient to open the eyes of the grossest savages and to convince them that there is a deity and to give due weight to the argument i shall relate a conversation between a greenlander and a danish missionary mentioned by crantz in his history of greenland it is true says the greenlander we were ignorant heathens and knew little of a god till you came but you must not imagine that no greenlander thinks about these things a kajak a greenland boat  with all its tackle and implements cannot exist but by the labor of man and one who does not understand it would spoil it but the meanest bird requires more skill than the best kajak and no man can make a bird there is still more skill required to make a man by whom then was he made he proceeded from his parents and they from their parents but some must have been the first parents whence did they proceed common report says that they grew out of the earth if so why do not men still grow out of the earth and from whence came the earth itself the sun the moon the stars certainly there must be some being who made all these things a being more wise than the wisest man the reasoning here from effects to their causes is stated with great precision and were all men equally penetrating with the greenlander such reasoning might perhaps be sufficient to account for the belief of deity universally spread among all savages but such penetration is a rare quality among savages and yet the belief of superior powers is universal not excepting even the grossest savages who are altogether incapable of reasoning like our greenland philosopher natural history has made so rapid a progress of late years and the finger of god is so visible to us in the various operations of nature that we do not readily conceive how even savages can be ignorant but it is a common fallacy in reasoning to judge of others by what we feel in ourselves and to give juster notions of the condition of savages i take the liberty to introduce the wogultzoi a people in siberia as exhibiting a striking picture of savages in their natural state that people were baptized at the command of prince gagarin governor of the province and laurent lange in his relation of a journey from petersburgh to pekin ann      gives the following account of their conversion i had curiosity says he to question them about their worship before they embraced christianity they said that they had an idol hung upon a tree before which they prostrated themselves raising their eyes to heaven and howling with a loud voice they could not explain what they meant by howling but only that every man howled in his own fashion being interrogated whether in raising their eyes to heaven they knew that a god is there who sees all the actions and even the thoughts of men they answered simply that heaven is too far above them to know whether a god be there or not and that they had no care but to provide meat and drink another question was put whether they had not more satisfaction in worshipping the living god than they formerly had in the darkness of idolatry they answered we see no great difference and we do not break our heads about such matters judge how little capable such ignorant savages are to reason from effects to their causes and to trace a deity from the operations of nature and it may be added with great certainty that could they be made in any degree to conceive such reasoning yet so weak and obscure would their conviction be as to rest there without moving them to any sort of worship which however among savages goes hand in hand with the belief of superior powers  to sum up this argument as fear is a cause altogether insufficient for the belief of deity universal among all tribes and as reasoning from effects to their causes can have no influence upon ignorant savages what cause remains but nature itself to make this belief universal the image of the deity must be stamped upon the mind of every human being the ignorant equally with the knowing nothing less is sufficient and the perception we have of deity must proceed from an internal cause which may be termed the sense of deity  included in the sense of deity is the duty we are under to worship him and to enforce that duty the principle of devotion is made a part of our nature all men accordingly agree in worshipping superior beings however they may difser in the mode of worship and the universality of such worship proves devotion to be an innate principle  the perception we have of being accountable beings arises from another branch of the sense of deity we expect approbation from the deity when we do right and dread punishment from him when guilty of any crime not excepting the most occult crimes hid from every mortal eye from what cause can dread proceed in that case but from belief of a superior being avenger of wrongs that dread when immoderate disorders the mind and makes every unusual misfortune pass for a punishment inslicted by an invisible hand and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us and reuben answered them saying spoke i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required genesis xlii        alphonsus king of naples was a cruel and tyrannical prince he drove his people to despair with oppressive taxes treacherously assassinated several of his barons and loaded others with chains during prosperity his conscience gave him little disquiet but in adversity his crimes stared him in the face and made him believe that his distresses proceeded from the hand of god as a just punishment he was terrified to distraction when charles viii of france approached with a numerous army he deserted his kingdom and fled to hide himself from the face of god and man  but admitting a sense of deity is it evidence to us that a deity actually exists the answer is that it is complete evidence so framed is man as to rely on the evidence of his senses see essays on morality and natural religion part   sect    which evidence it is not in his power to reject were he even disposed to be a skeptic and experience confirms our belief for our senses when in order never deceive us  the foregoing sense of deity is not the only evidence we have of his existence there is additional evidence from other branches of our nature inherent in the nature of man are two passions devotion of which the diety is the immediate and only object and dread of punishment when one is guilty of any crime these passions would be idle and absurd were there no deity to be worshipped or to be dreaded they would be illusory passions having no object they would be the single instance of such irregularity and grossly irregular it would be to be endued with passions or principles contrived for no end or purpose man makes a capital figure and is the most perfect being that inhabits this earth how then is it possible to believe that he should be endued with passions contradictory to the regular and beautiful laws which govern all other things here it is not credible the passions mentioned both of them direct us to a deity and afford us irresistible evidence of his existence  thus our maker leaves no work of his imperfect he has revealed himself to us in a way perfectly analagous to our nature in the mind of every human creature he has lighted up a lamp which renders him visible even to the weakest sight nor ought it to escape observation that here as in every other case the conduct of providence to man is uniform it leaves him to be directed by reason where liberty of choice is permitted but in matters of duty he is provided with guides less fallible than reason in performing his duty to man he is guided by the moral sense in performing his duty to god he is guided by the sense of deity in these mirrors he perceives his duty intuitively  it is no slight support to this doctrine that if there really be a deity it is highly presumable that he will reveal himself to man fitted by nature to adore and worship him to other animals the knowledge of a deity is of no importance to man it is of high importance were we totally ignorant of a deity this world would appear to us a mere chaos under the government of a wise and benevolent deity chance is excluded and every event the result of established laws is perceived to be the best on the whole good men submit to whatever happens without repining trusting that every event is ordered by divine providence they submit with entire resignation and such resignation is a sovereign balsam to every misfortune  the sense of deity resembles our other senses which lie dormant till a proper object present itself when all is silent about us the sense of hearing is dormant and if from infancy a man were confined to a dark room he would be as ignorant of the sense of seeing as one born blind among savages the objects that rouse the sense of deity are uncommon events above the power of man an earthquake for example a hurricane a total eclipse of the sun a sudden swell of a river that prevents their escape from an impending enemy a savage if he be acquainted with no events but what are familiar has no perception of superior powers but thunder rattling in his ears or the convulsion of an earthquake rouses in him the sense of deity and directs him to some superior being as the cause of these dreadful effects the savage it is true errs in ascribing to the immediate operation of a deity things that have a natural cause his error however is evidence that he has a sense of deity no less pregnant than when he more justly attributes to the immediate operation of deity the formation of man of this earth of all the world  the sense of deity like the moral sense makes no capital figure among savages the perceptions of both senses being in them faint and obscure but in the progress of nations to maturity these senses turn more and more vigorous so as among enlightened nations to acquire a commanding influence leaving no doubt about right and wrong and as little about the existence of a deity  the obscurity of the sense of deity among savages has encouraged some skeptical philosophers to deny its existence it has been urged that god does nothing by halves and that if he intended to make himself known to man the sense of deity would produce equal conviction with that of seeing or hearing when we argue thus about the purposes of the almighty we tread on slippery ground where we seldom fail to stumble what if it be the purpose of the deity to afford us but an obscure glimpse of his being and attributes we have reason from analogy to conjecture that this may be the case from some particulars mentioned above book   sketch    it appears at least probable that entire submission to the moral sense would be illsuited to man in his present state and would prove more hurtful than beneficial and to me it appears evident that to be conscious of the presence of the great god as i am of a friend whom i hold by the hand would be inconsistent with the part that providence has destined me to act in this life reflect only on the restraint one is under in presence of a superior suppose the king himself how much greater our restraint with the same lively impression of gods awful presence humility and veneration would leave no room for other passions man would be no longer man and the system of our present state would be totally subverted take another instance such a conviction of future rewards and punishments as to overcome every inordinate desire would reduce us to the condition of a traveller in a paltry inn having no wish but for daylight to prosecute his journey for that very reason it appears agreeable to the plan of providence that we should have but an obscure glimpse of futurity as the same plan of providence is visible in all i conclude with assurance that a certain degree of obscurity weighs nothing against the sense of deity more than against the moral sense or against a future state of rewards and punishments whether all men might not have been made angels and whether more happiness might not have resulted from a different system lie far beyond the reach of human knowledge from what is known of the conduct of providence we have reason to presume that our present state is the result of wisdom and benevolence so much we know with certainty that the sense we have of deity and of moral duty correspond accurately to the nature of man as an imperfect being and that these senses were they absolutely perfect would unhinge his nature and convert him into a very different being  a theory espoused by several writers ancient and modern must not be overlooked because it pretends to compose the world without a deity which would reduce the sense of deity to be delusive if it have any existence the theory is that the world composed of animals vegetables and brute matter is selfexistent and eternal and that all events happen by a necessary chain of causes and effects in this theory though wisdom and benevolence are conspicuous in every part yet the great work of planning and executing the whole is understood to have been done blindly without intelligence or contrivance it is scarce necessary to remark that this theory assumed at pleasure is highly improbable if not absurd and yet that it is left naked to the world without the least cover or support but what i chiefly insist on is that the endless number of wise and benevolent effects displayed every where on the face of this globe afford to us complete evidence of a wise and benevolent cause and as these effects are far above the power of man we necessarily ascribe them to some superior being or in other words to the deity first sketch of this third book sect    and this is sufficient to remove the present objection against the existence of a sense of deity but i am not satisfied with this partial victory i proceed to observe that nothing more is required but the proof of a deity to overturn the supposition of selfexistence in a world composed of many heterogeneous parts and of a chain of causes and effects framed without intelligence or foresight though full of wisdom and contrivance in every part for if a deity exist wise and powerful above all other beings selfexistence ought to be his peculiar attribute and no person of rationality will have any hesitation in rejecting the selfexistence of such a world when so natural a supposition lies in view as that the whole is the operation of the truly selfexistent being whose power and wisdom are fully adequate to that arduous task  many gross and absurd conceptions of deity that have prevailed among rude nations are urged by some writers as another objection against a sense of deity that objection shall not be overlooked but it will be answered to better purpose after these gross and absurd conceptions are examined which shall be done in the chapter immediately following  the proof of a deity from the innate sense here explained differs materially from what is contained in essays on morality and natural religion part   sect    the proof there given is founded on a chain of reasoning altogether independent on the innate sense of deity both equally produce conviction hut as a sense operates intuitively without reasoning the sense of deity is made a branch of human nature in order to enlighten those who are incapable of a long chain of reasoning and to such who make the bulk of mankind it is more convincing than the most perspicuous reasoning to a philosopher  chap ii progress of opinions with respect to deity the sense of deity like many other delicate senses is in savages so faint and obscure as easily to be biassed from truth among them the belief of many superior beings is universal and two causes join to produce that belief the first is that being accustomed to a plurality of visible objects men mountains trees cattle and such like they are naturally led to imagine the same plurality in things not visible and from that slight bias slight indeed but natural is partly derived the system of polytheism universal among savages the other is that savages know little of the connection between causes and effects and still less of the order and government of this world every event that is not familiar appears to them singular and extraordinary and if such event exceed human power it is without hesitation ascribed to a superior being but as it occurs not to a savage nor to any person who is not a philosopher that the many various events exceeding human power and seemingly unconnected may all proceed from the same cause they are readily ascribed to different beings pliny ascribes polytheism to another cause viz the consciousness men have of their imbecility our powers are confined within narrow bounds we do not readily conceive powers in the deity much more extensive and we supply by number what is wanting in power polytheism thus founded is the first stage in the progress of theology for it is embraced by the rudest savages who have neither capacity nor inclination to pierce deeper into the nature of things  the next stage is distinguishable from others by a belief that all superior beings are malevolent man by nature weak and helpless is prone to fear dreading every new object and every unusual event savages having no protection against storms tempests or other external accidents and having no pleasures but in gratifying hunger thirst and animal love have much to fear and little to hope in that disconsolate condition they attribute the bulk of their distresses to invisible beings who in their opinion must be malevolent this seems to have been the opinion of the greeks in the days of solon as appears in a conversation between him and croesus king of lydia mentioned by herodotus in the first book of his history croesus said solon you ask me about human affairs and i answer as one who thinks that all the gods are envious and disturbers of mankind the negroes on the coast of guinea dread their deities as tyrants and oppressors having no conception of a good deity they attribute the few blessings they receive to the soil to the rivers to the trees and to the plants the lithuanians continued pagans down to the fourteenth century and worshipped in gloomy woods where their deities were held to reside their worship probably was prompted by fear which is allied to gloominess or darkness the people of kamskatka acknowledge to this day many malevolent deities having little or no notion of a good deity they believe the air the water the mountains and the woods to be inhabited by malevolent spirits whom they fear and worship the savages of guiana ascribe to the devil even their most common diseases nor do they ever think of another remedy but to apply to a sorcerer to drive him away such negroes as believe in the devil paint his images white  conviction of superior beings who like men are of a mixed nature sometimes doing good sometimes mischief constitutes the third stage this came to be the system of theology in greece the introduction of writing among the greeks while they were little better than savages produced a compound of character and manners that has not a parallel in any other nation they were acute in science skilful in fine arts extremely deficient in morals gross beyond conception in theology and superstitious to a degree of folly a strange jumble of exquisite sense and absurd nonsense they held their gods to resemble men in their external figure and to be corporeal in the   st book of the iliad minerva with a huge stone beats mars to the ground whose monstrous body covered seven broad acres as corporeal beings they were supposed to require the nourishment of meat drink and sleep homer mentions more than once the inviting of gods to a feast and pausanias reports that in the temple of bacchus at athens there were figures of clay representing a feast given by amphyction to bacchus and other deities the inhabitants of the island java are not so gross in their conceptions as to think that the gods eat the offerings presented to them but it is their opinion that a deity brings his mouth near the offering sucks out all its savor and leaves it tasteless like water all greek writers and those in their neighborhood form the world out of a chaos they had no such exalted notion of a deity as to believe that he could make the world out of nothing  the grecian gods as described by homer dress bathe and anoint like mortals venus after being detected by her husband in the embraces of mars retires to paphos where to the power an hundred altars rise and breathing odours scent the balmy skies concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers the graces ungents shed ambrosial showers unguents that charm the gods she last assumes her wondrous robes and full the goddess blooms odyssey book   junos dress is most poetically described iliad book    it was also universally believed that the gods were fond of women and had many children by them the ancient germans thought more sensibly that the gods were too high to resemble men in any degree or to be confined within the walls of a temple led by the same impressions of deity the greeks seem to have thought that the gods did not much exceed themselves in knowledge when agesilaus journeyed with his private retinue he usually lodged in a temple making the gods witnesses says plutarch of his most secret actions the greeks thought that a god like a man might know what passed within his own house without knowing any thing passing at a greater distance agamemnon in eschylus putting off his traveling habit and dressing himself in splendid purple is afraid of being seen and envied by some jealous god we learn from seneca that people strove for the seat next to the image of the deity that their prayers might be the better heard but what we hae chiefly to remark upon this head is that the grecian gods were like men held capable of doing both good and ill jupiter their highest deity was a ravisher of women and a notorious adulterer in the second book of the iliad he sends a lying dream to deceive agamemnon mars seduces venus by bribes to commit adultery odyssey book    in the rhesus of euripides minerva disguised like venus deceives paris by a gross lie the groundwork of the tragedy of xuthus is a lying oracle declaring ion son of apollo and creusa to be the son of xuthus orestes in euripides having slain his mother clytemnestra excuses himself as having been misled by apollo to commit the crime ah says he had i consulted the ghost of my father he would have dissuaded me from a crime that has proved my ruin without doing him any good he concludes with observing that having acted by apollos command apollo is the only criminal in a tragedy of sophocles minerva makes no difficulty to cheat ajax by promising to be his friend while underhand she is serving ulysses his bitter enemy mercury in revenge for the murder of his son myrtilus entails curses on pelops the murderer and on all his race the english translator of that tragedy observes it to be remarkable in the grecian creed that the gods punish the crimes of men upon their innocent posterity  in general the gods every where in greek tragedies are partial unjust tyrannical and revengeful the greeks accordingly have no reserve in maltreating their gods in the tragedy of prometheus jupiter without the least ceremony is accused of being an usurper eschylus proclaims publicly on the stage that jupiter a jealous cruel and implacable tyrant had overturned every thing in heaven and that the other gods were reduced to be his slaves in the iliad book    menelaus addresses jupiter in the following words o father jove in wisdom they say thou excellest both men and gods yet all these ills proceed from thee for the wicked thou do aid in war thou art a friend to the trojans whose souls delight in force who are never glutted with blood the gods were often treated with a sort of contemptuous familiarity and employed in very low offices nothing is more common than to introduce them as actors in greek tragedies frequently for trivial purposes apollo comes upon the stage most courteously to acquaint the audience with the subject of the play why is this not urged by our critics as classical authority against the rule of horace nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus nor let a god in person stand displayed unless the laboring plot deserve his aid francis  homer makes very useful servants of his gods minerva in particular is a faithful attendant upon ulysses she acts the herald and calls the chiefs to council odyssey book    she marks the place where a great stone fell that was thrown by ulysses book    she assists ulysses to hide his treasure in a cave book     and helps him to wrestle with a beggar book     ulysses being tossed with cares in bed she descends from heaven to make him fall asleep odyssey book  0  this last might possibly be squeezed into an allegory if minerva were not frequently introduced where there is no place for an allegory jupiter book    of the iliad is introduced comforting the steeds of achilles for the death of patroclus it appears from cicero lib   de natura deorum  that when greek philosophers began to reason about the deity their notions were wonderfully crude one of the hardest morsels to digest in platos philosophy was his doctrine that god is incorporeal which by many was thought absurd for that without a body he could not have senses nor prudence nor pleasure the religious creed of the romans seems to have been little less impure than that of the greeks it was a ceremony of theirs in besieging a town to evocate the tutelar deity and to tempt him by a reward to betray his friends and votaries in that ceremony the name of the tutelar deity was thought of importance and for that reason the tutelar deity of rome was a profound secret the form of the evocatio follows tuo ductu inquit pythie apollo tuoque numine instinctus pergo ad delendam urbem veios tibique hinc decimam partem praedae voveo te simul juno regina quae nunc veios colis precor ut nos victores in nostram tuamque mox futuram urbem sequare ubi te dignum amplitudine tua templum accipiat titus livius lib   cap      in english thus under thy guidance and divine inspiration o pythian apollo i march to the destruction of veii and to thy shrine i devote a tenth of the plunder imperial juno guardian of veii deign to prosper our victorious arms and a temple shall be erected to thy honor suitable to the greatness and majesty of thy name  but it appears from macrobius that they used a form of evocation even when the name of the tutelar deity was unknown to them si deus si dea est cui populus civitasque carthaginiensis est in tutela teque maxim ille qui urbis hujus populique tutelam recipisti precor venerorque veniamque a vobis peto ut vos populum civitatemque carthaginiensem deseratis loca templa sacra urbemque eorum relinquiatis absque his abeatis eique populo civitatique metum formidinem oblivionem injiciatis proditique romam ad me meosque veneatis nostraque vobis loca templa sacra urbs acceptior probatiorque sit mihique populoque romano militibusque meis praepositi sitis ut sciamus intelligamusque si ita feceritis voveo vobis templa ludosque facturum saturnal lib   cap     in english thus that divinity whether god or goddess who is the guardian of the state of carthage that divinity i invoke i pray and supplicate that he will desert that perfidious people honor not with thy presence their temples their ceremonies nor their city abandon them to all their fears leave them to infamy and oblivion fly hence to rome where in my country and among my fellowcitizens thou shall have nobler temples and more acceptable sacrifices thou shall be the tutelar deity of this army and of the roman state on this condition i here vow to erect temples and institute games to thine honor  appian of alexandria in his book of the parthian war reports that antony reduced to extremity by the parthians lifted up his eyes to heaven and besought the gods that if any of them were jealous of his former happiness they would pour their vengeance upon his head alone and suffer his army to escape the story of paris and the three goddesses gives no favorable impression either of the morals or religion of the romans juno and her two sisterdeities submit their dispute about beauty to the shepherd paris who conscientiously pronounces in favor of venus but  manet alta mente repostum judicium paridis spretaeque injuria formae juno not satisfied with wreaking her malice against the honest shepherd declares war against his whole nation not even eneas though a fugitive in foreign lands escapes her fury their great god jupiter is introduced on the stage by plautus to deceive alcmena and to lie with her in the shape of her husband nay it was the opinion of the romans that this play made much for the honor of jupiter for in times of national troubles and calamities it was commonly acted to appease his anger  a most pregnant instance of the gross conceptions of that warlike people in morality as well as in religion  a division of invisible beings into benevolent and malevolent without any mixture of these qualities makes the fourth stage the talents and feelings of men refine gradually under good government social amusements begin to make a figure benevolence is highly regarded and some men are found without gall having thus acquired a notion of pure benevolence and finding it exemplified in some persons it was an easy step in the progress of theological opinions to bestow the same character upon some superior beings this led men to distinguish their gods into two kinds essentially different one entirely benevolent another entirely malevolent and the difference between good and ill which are diametrically opposite favored that distinction fortunate events out of the common course of nature were accordingly ascribed to benevolent deities and unfortunate events of that kind to malevolent in the time of pliny the elder malevolent deities were worshipped at rome he mentions a temple dedicated to bad fortune another to the disease termed a fever the lacedaemonians worshipped death and fear and the people of cadiz poverty and old age in order to deprecate their wrath such gods were by the romans termed averrunci as putting away evil  conviction of one supreme benevolent deity and of inferior deities some benevolent some malevolent is the fifth stage such conviction which gains ground in proportion as morality ripens arises from a remarkable difference between gratitude and fear willing to show my gratitude for some kindness proceeding from an unknown hand several persons occur to my conjectures but i always fix at last upon one person as the most likely fear is of an opposite nature it expands itself upon every suspicious person and blackens them all equally thus upon providential good fortune above the power of man we naturally rest upon one benevolent deity as the cause and to him we confine our gratitude and veneration when on the other hand we are struck with an uncommon calamity every thing that possibly may be the cause raises terror in us hence the propensity in savages to multiply objects of fear but to confine their gratitude and veneration to a single object gratitude and veneration at the same time are of such a nature as to raise a high opinion of the person who is their object and when a single invisible being is understood to pour out blessings with a liberal hand good men inflamed with gratitude put no bounds to the power and benevolence of that being and thus one supreme benevolent deity comes to be recognized among the more enlightened savages with respect to malevolent deities as they are supposed to be numerous and as there is no natural impulse for elevating one above the another they are all of them held to be of an inferior rank subordinate to the supreme deity  unity in the supreme being has among philosophers a more solid foundation viz unity of design and of order in the creation and government of this world all things in the universe are evidently of a piece every thing is adjusted to every thing one design prevails through the whole and this uniformity leads the mind to acknowledge one author because the conception of different authors without distinction of attributes or operations serves only to perplex the imagination without bestowing any satisfaction on the understanding natural history of religion by david hume esquire  at the same time the passion of gratitude which leads even savages to the attribute of unity in the supreme being prepares the mind for relishing the proof of that unity ounded on the unity of his works  the belief of one supreme benevolent deity and of subordinate deities benevolent and malevolent is and has been more universal than any other religious creed i confine myself to a few instances for a complete enumeration would be endless the different savage tribes in dutch guiana agree pretty much in their articles of faith they hold the existence of one supreme deity whose chief attribute is benevolence and to him they ascribe every good that happens but as it is against his nature to do ill they believe in subordinate malevolent beings like our devil who occasion thunder hurricanes earthquakes and who are the authors of death diseases and of every misfortune to these devils termed in their language yowahoos they direct every supplication in order to avert their malevolence while the supreme deity is entirely neglected so much more powerful among savages is fear than gratitude the northamerican savages have all of them a notion of a supreme deity creator and governor of the world and of inferior deities some good some ill these are supposed to have bodies and to live much as men do but without being subjected to any distress the same creed prevails among the negroes of benin and congo among the people of new zeland among the inhabitants of java of madagascar of the molucca islands and of the caribbee islands the chingulese a tribe in the island of ceylon acknowledge one god creator of the universe with subordinate deities who act as his deputies agriculture is the peculiar province of one navigation of another the creed of the tonquinese is nearly the same the inhabitants of otaheite termed king georges island believe in one supreme deity and in inferior deities without end who preside over particular parts of the creation they pay no adoration to the supreme deity thinking him too far elevated above his creatures to concern himself with what they do they believe the stars to be children of the sun and moon and an eclipse to be the time of copulation according to arnobius certain roman deities presided over the various operations of men venus presided over carnal copulation puta assisted at pruning trees and peta in requesting benefits nemestrinus was god of the woods nodutus ripened corn and terensis helped to thresh it vibilia assisted travelers orphans were under the care of orbona and dying persons of naenia ossilago hardened the bones of infants and mellonia protected bees and bestowed sweetness on their honey the inhabitants of the island of formosa recognize two deities in company the one a male god of the men the other a female goddess of the women the bulk of their inferior deities are the souls of upright men who are constantly doing good and the souls of wicked men who are constantly doing ill the inland negroes acknowledge one supreme being creator of all things attributing to him infinite power infinite knowledge and ubiquity they believe that the dead are converted into spirits termed by them iananini or protectors being appointed to guard their parents and relations the ancient goths and several other northern nations acknowledged one supreme being and at the same time worshipped three subordinate deities thor reputed the same with jupiter oden or woden the same with mars and friga the same with venus regnatur omnium deus caetera subjecta atque parentia tacitus de moribus germanorum cap     in english thus one god the ruler of all the rest inferior and subordinate  socrates taking the cup of poison from the executioner held it up toward heaven and pouring out some of it as an oblation to the supreme deity pronounced the following prayer i implore the immortal god that my translation hence may be happy then turning to crito said o crito i owe a cock to esculapius pay it from this incident we find that socrates soaring above his countrymen had attained to the belief of a supreme benevolent deity but in that dark age of religion such purity is not to be expected from socrates himself as to have rejected subordinate deities even of the mercenary kind  different offices being assigned to the gods as above mentioned proper names followed of course and when a god was ascertained by a name the busy mind would naturally proceed to trace his genealogy  as unity in the deity was not an established doctrine in the countries where the christian religion was first promulgated christianity could not fail to prevail over paganism for improvements in the mental faculties lead by sure steps though slow to one god  the sixth stage is the belief of one supreme benevolent deity as in that immediately foregoing with many inferior benevolent deities and one only who is malevolent as men improve in natural knowledge and become skilful in tracing causes from effects they find much less malice and illdesign than was imagined humanity at last prevails which in connection with improved knowledge banishes the suspicion of illdesign in every case where an event can possibly be explained without it in a word a settled opinion of good prevailing in the world produced conviction among some nations less ignorant than their neighbors and less brutal that there is but one malevolent subordinate deity and good subordinate deities without number the ancient persians acknowledged two principles one all good and all powerful named hormuz and by the greeks corruptly oromazes the other evil named ahariman and by the greeks arimanes some authors assert that the persians held these two principles to be coeternal others that oromazes first subsisted alone that he created both light and darkness and that he created arimanes out of darkness that the latter was the opinion of the ancient persians appears from their bible termed the sadder which teaches that there is one god supreme over all many good angels and but one evil spirit plutarch acquaints us that hormuz and ahariman for ever at variance formed each of them creatures of their own stamp that the former created good genii such as goodness truth wisdom justice and that the latter created evil genii such as infidelity falsehood oppression theft this system of theology commonly termed the manichean system is said to be also the religious creed of pegu with the following addition that the evil principle only is to be worshipped which is abundantly probable as fear is a predominant passion in barbarians the people of florida believe a supreme benevolent deity and a subordinate deity that is malevolent neglecting the former who they say does no harm they bend their whole attention to soften the latter who they say torments them day and night the inhabitants of darian acknowledge but one evil spirit of whom they are desperately afraid the hottentots mentioned by some writers as altogether destitute of religion are on the contrary farther advanced toward its purity than some of their neighbors their creed is that there is a supreme being who is goodness itself of whom they have no occasion to stand in awe as he is incapable by his nature to hurt them that there is also a malevolent spirit subordinate to the former who must be served and worshipped in order to avert his malice the epicurean doctrine with respect to the gods in general that being happy in themselves they extend not their providential care to men differs not widely from what the hottentot believes with respect to the supreme being  having traced the sense of deity from its dawn in the grossest savages to its approaching maturity among enlightened nations we proceed to the last stage of the progress which makes the true system of theology and that is conviction of a supreme being boundless in every perfection without any subordinate deities benevolent or malevolent savages learn early to trace the chain of causes and effects with respect to ordinary events they know that fasting produces hunger that labor occasions weariness that fire burns that the sun and rain contribute to vegetation but when they go beyond such familiar events they lose sight of cause and effect the changes of weather of winds of heat and cold impress them with a notion of chance earthquakes hurricanes storms of thunder and lightning which fill them with terror are ascribed to malignant beings of greater power than man in the progress of knowledge light begins to break in upon them they discover that such phenomena however tremendous come under the general law of cause and effect and that there is no ground for ascribing them to malignant spirits at the same time our more refined senses ripen by degrees social affections come to prevail and morality makes a deep impression in maturity of sense and understanding benevolence appears more and more and beautiful final causes are discovered in many of natures productions that formerly were thought useless or perhaps destructive and the time may come we have solid ground to hope that it will come when doubts and difficulties about the government of providence will all of them be cleared up and every event be found conducive to the general good such views of providence banish malevolent deities and we settle at last in a most comfortable opinion either that there are no such beings or that if they exist and are permitted to perpetrate any mischief it is in order to produce greater good thus through a long maze of errors man arrives at true religion acknowledging but one being supreme in power intelligence and benevolence who created all other beings to whom all other beings are subjected and who directs every event to answer the best purposes this system is true theology pliny seems to relish the doctrine of unity in the deity but is at a loss about forming any just conception of him sometimes considering the world to be our only deity sometimes the sun   having gone through the different stages of religious belief in its gradual progress toward truth and purity i proceed to a very important article viz the history of tutelar deities the belief of tutelar deities preceded indeed several of the stages mentioned witness the tutelar deities of greece and rome but as it is not connected with any one of them exclusive of the rest the clearness of method required it to be postponed to all of them this belief founded on selfishness made a rapid progress after property in the goods of fortune was established the greeks the romans and indeed most nations that were not mere savages appropriated to themselves tutelar deities who were understood to befriend them upon all occasions and in particular to fight for them against their enemies the iliad of homer is full of miraculous battles between the greeks and trojans the tutelar deities mixing with the contending parties and partaking of every disaster death only excepted which immortals could not suffer the lares penates or householdgods of indostan of greece and of rome bear witness that every family perhaps every person was thought to be under the protection of a tutelar deity alexander ab alexandro gives a list of tutelar deities apollo and minerva were the tutelar deities of athens bacchus and hercules of the boeotian thebes juno of carthage samos sparta argos and mycene venus of cyprus apollo of rhodes and of delphos vulcan of lemons bacchus of naxus neptune of tenedos etc the poets testify that even individuals had tutelar deities mulciber in trojam pro troja stabat apollo aequa venus teucris pallas iniqua fuit oderat aeneam propior saturnia turno ille tamen veneris numine tutus erat saepe ferox cautum petiit neptunus ulyssem eripuit patruo saepe minerva suo  the rage of vulcan and the martial maid  pursued old troy but phoebus love repaid  aeneas safe defied great junos hate  for venus guards her savored offsprings fate  in vain ulysses neptunes wrath assails  over winds and waves minervas power prevails  ovid trist lib   eleg    though the northamerican savages recognize a supreme being wise and benevolent and also subordinate benevolent beings who are entrusted with the government of the world yet as the great distance of these subordinate beings and the full occupation they have in general government are supposed to make them overlook individuals every man has a tutelar deity of his own termed manitou who is constantly invoked during war to give him victory over his enemies the natches bordering on the missisippi offer up the skulls of their enemies to their god and deposite them in his temple they consider that being as their tutelar deity who assists them against their enemies and to whom therefore the skull of an enemy must be an acceptable offering though they worship the sun who impartially shines on all mankind yet such is their partiality that they consider themselves as his chosen people and that their enemies are his enemies  a belief so absurd shows woeful imbecility in human nature is it not obvious that the great god of heaven and earth governs the world by inflexible laws from whence he never can swerve in any case because they are the best possible in every case to suppose any family or nation to be an object of his peculiar love is no less impious than to suppose any family or nation to be an object of his peculiar hatred they equally arraign providence of partiality even the goths had more just notions of the deity totila recommending to his people justice and humanity says quare sic habete ea quae amari ab hominibus solent ita vobis salva fore si justitiae reverentiam servaveritis si transitis in mores alios etiam deum ad hosts transiturum neque enim ille aut omnibus omnino hominibus aut uni alicui genti addicit se socium be assured of this that while ye preserve your reverence for justice ye will enjoy all the blessings which are estimable among mankind if ye refuse to obey her dictates and your morals become corrupted god himself will abandon you and take the part of your enemies for although the benevolence of that power is not partially confined to tribe or people yet in the eye of his justice all men are not equally the objects of his approbation   that god was once the tutelar deity of the jews is true but not in the vulgar acceptance of that term importing a deity chosen by a people to be their patron and protector the orthodox faith is that god chose the jews as his peculiar people not from any partiality to them but that there might be one nation to keep alive the knowledge of one supreme deity which should be prosperous while they adhered to him and unprosperous when they declined to idolatry not only in order to make them persevere in the true faith but also in order to exemplify to all nations the conduct of his providence it is certain however that the perverse jews claimed god almighty as their tutelar deity in the vulgar acceptance of the term and this error throws light upon an incident related in the acts of the apostles there was a prophecy firmly believed by the jews that the messiah would come among them in person to restore their kingdom the christians gave a different sense to the prophecy viz that the kingdom promised was not of this world and they said that christ was sent to pave the way to their heavenly kingdom by obtaining forgiveness of their sins at the same time as the jews held all other nations in abhorrence it was natural for them to conclude that the messiah would be sent to them only gods chosen people for which reason even the apostles were at first doubtful about preaching the gospel to any but to the jews see the  0th and   th chapters of the acts of the apostles  but the apostles reflecting that it was one great purpose of the mission to banish from the jews their grovelling and impure notion of a tutelar deity and to proclaim a state of future happiness to all who believe in christ they proceeded to preach the gospel to all men then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted with him acts of the apostles x     the foregoing reasoning however did not satisfy the jews they could not digest the opinion that god sent his messiah to save all nations and that he was the god of the gentiles as well as of the jews they stormed against paul in particular for inculcating that doctrine acts of the apostles chap      considering that religion in its purity was established by the gospel is it not amazing that even christians fell back to the worship of tutelar deities they did not indeed adopt the absurd opinion that the supreme being was their tutelar deity but they held that there are divine persons subordinate to the almighty who take under their care nations families and even individuals an opinion that differs not essentially from that of tutelar deities among the heathens that opinion which flatters selflove took root in the fifth century when the deification of saints was introduced similar to the deification of heroes among the ancients with regard to matters spiritual as well as temporal people are fond of friends to be their intercessors and with regard to the deity deified saints were thought the properest intercessors temples were built and dedicated to them and solemn rites of worship instituted to render them propitious it was imagined that the souls of deified saints are at liberty to roam where they list and that they love the places where their bodies are interred which accordingly made the sepulchers of the saints a common rendezvous of supplicants what paved the way to notions so absurd was the gross ignorance that clouded the christian world after the northern barbarians became masters of europe in the seventh century the bishops were so illiterate as to be indebted to others for the shallow sermons they preached and the very few of that order who had any learning satisfied themselves with composing insipid homilies collected from the writings of augustine and gregory in the ninth century matters grew worse and worse for these saints held at first to be mediators for christians in general were now converted into tutelar deities in the strictest sense an opinion prevailed that such saints as are occupied about the souls of christians in general have little time for individuals which led every church and every private christian to elect for themselves a particular saint as their peculiar patron or tutelar deity that practice made it necessary to deify saints without end in order to furnish a tutelar deity to every individual the dubbing of saints became a new source of abuses and frauds in the christian world lying wonders were invented and fabulous histories composed to celebrate exploits that never were performed and to glorify persons that never had a being and thus religion among christians sunk down into as low a state as it had been among pagans  there still remains upon hand a capital branch of our history and that is idolatry which properly signifies the worshipping visible objects as deities but as idolatry evidently sprung from religious worship corrupted by the ignorant and brutish it will make its appearance with more advantage in the next section of which religious worship is the subject  we have thus traced with wary steps the gradual progress of theology through many stages corresponding to the gradual openings and improvements of the human mind but though that progress in almost all countries appears uniform with respect to the order of succession it is far otherwise with respect to the quickness of succession nations like individuals make a progress from infancy to maturity but they advance not with an equal pace some making a rapid course toward perfection in knowledge and in religion while others remain ignorant barbarians the religion of hindostan if we credit history or tradition had advanced to a considerable degree of purity and refinement at a very early period the hindostan bible termed chatahbhade or shastah gives an account of the creation lapse of the angels and creation of man instructs us in the unity of the deity but denies his prescience as being inconsistent with free will in man all of them profound doctrines of an illuminated people to establish which a long course of time must have been requisite after wandering through errors without number compared with the hindows in theology even the greeks were mere savages the grecian gods were held to be little better than men and their history as above mentioned corresponds to the notion entertained of them  in explaining the opinions of men with respect to deity i have confined my view to such opinions as are suggested by principles or biasses that make a part of common nature omitting many whimsical notions no better than dreams of a roving imagination the plan delineated shows wonderful uniformity in the progress of religion through all nations that the whimsical notions mentioned are far otherwise is not wonderful take the following specimen the kamskatkans are not so stupidly ignorant as to be altogether void of curiosity they sometimes think of natural appearances  rain say they is some deity pissing upon them and they imagine the rainbow to be a partycolored garment put on by him in preparing for that operation they believe wind to be produced by a god shaking his long hair about his head with violence such tales will scarce amuse children in the nursery the inhabitants of the island celebes formerly acknowledged no gods but the sun and the moon which were held to be eternal ambition for superiority made them fall out the moon being wounded in flying from the sun was delivered of the earth  hitherto of the gradual openings of the human mind with respect to deity i close this section with an account of some unsound notions concerning the conduct of providence and concerning some speculative matters i begin with the former  in days of ignorance the conduct of providence is very little understood far from having any notion than the government of this world is carried on by general laws which are inflexible because they are the best possible every important event is attributed to an immediate interposition of the deity as the grecian gods were thought to have bodies like men and like men to require nourishment they were imagined to act like men forming shortsighted plans of operation and varying them from time to time according to exigencies even the wise athenians had an utter aversion for philosophers who attempted to account for effects by general laws such doctrine they thought tended to fetter the gods and to prevent them from governing events at their pleasure an eclipse being held to be a prognostic given by the gods of some grievous calamity anaxagoras was accused of atheism for attempting to explain the eclipse of the moon by natural causes he was thrown into prison and with difficulty was relieved by the influence of pericles protagoras was banished athens for maintaining the same doctrine procopius overflows with signal interpositions of providence and agathias beginning at the battle of marathon sagely maintains that from that time downward there was not a battle lost but by an immediate judgment of god for the sins of the commander or of his army or of one person or other our saviors doctrine with respect to those who suffered by the fall of the tower of siloam ought to have opened their eyes but superstitious eyes are never opened by instruction at the same time it is deplorable that such belief has no good influence on manners on the contrary never does wickedness so much abound as in dark times a curious fact is related by procopius historia gothica lib   with respect to that sort of superstition when rome was besieged by the goths and in danger of destruction a part of the townwall declining from the perpendicular was in a tottering condition belisarius proposing to fortify it was opposed by the citizens affirming that it was guarded by st peter procopius observes that the event answered expectation for that the goths during a tedious siege never once attempted that weak part he adds that the wall remained in the same ruinous state at the time of his writing here is a curious conceit  peter created a tutelar deity able and willing for the sake of his votaries to counteract the laws by which god governs the material world and for what mighty benefit to them only to save them five or fifty pounds in rebuilding the crazy part of the wall  it is no less inconsistent with the regular course of providence to believe as many formerly did that in all doubtful cases the almighty when appealed to never fails to interpose in favor of the right side the inhabitants of constantinople ann      being split into parties about two contending patriarchs the emperor ordered a fire to be made in the church of st sophia and a memorial from each party to be thrown into it never doubting but that god would save from the flames the memorial of the party whose cause he espoused but to the utter astonishment of all beholders the flames paid not the least regard to either of the memorials the same absurd opinion gave birth to the trial by fire by water and by singular battle and it is not a little remarkable that such trials were common among many nations that had no intercourse one with another even the enlightened people of indostan try crimes by dipping the hand of a suspected person in boiling oil  such uniformity is there with respect even to superstitious opinions pope gregory vii insisting that the kings of castile and aragon should lay aside their gothic liturgy for the romish the matter was put to trial by singular battle and two champions were chosen to declare by victory the opinion of god almighty the emperor otho i observing the doctors to differ about a a point of law viz the right of representation in landestates appointed a duel and the right of representation gained the victory if any thing can render such a doctrine palatable it is the believing in a tutelar deity who with less absurdity may interpose in behalf of a favorite opinion or of a favorite people appian gravely reports that when the city of rhodes was besieged by mithridates a statue of the goddess isis was seen to dart flames of fire upon a bulky engine raised by the besiegers to overtop the wall  historians mention an incident that happened in the island celebes founded on a belief of the same kind with that above mentioned about two centuries ago some christian and some mohammedan missionaries made their way to that island the chief king struck with the fear of hell taught by both assembled a general council and extending his hands toward heaven addressed the following prayer to the supreme being great god from thee i demand nothing but justice and to me thou owe it men of different religions have come to this island threatening eternal punishment to me and my people if we disobey thy laws what are thy laws speak o my god who art the author of nature thou know the bottom of our hearts and that we can never intentionally disobey thee but if it be unworthy of thy essence to employ the language of men i call upon my whole people the sun which gives me light the earth which bears me the sea which surrounds my empire and upon thee thyself to bear witness for me that in the sincerity of my heart i wish to know thy will and this day i declare that i will acknowledge as the depositaries of thy oracles the first ministers of either religion that shall land on this island  it is equally erroneous to believe that certain ceremonies will protect one from mischief in the dark ages of christianity the signing with the figure of a cross was held not only to be an antidote against the snares of malignant spirits but to inspire resolution for supporting trials and calamities for which reason no christian in those days undertook any thing of moment till he had used that ceremony it was firmly believed in france that a gold or silver coin of st louis hung from the neck was a protection against all diseases and we find accordingly a hole in every remaining coin of that king for fixing it to a riband in the minority of charles viii of france the three estates ann      supplicated his majesty that he would no longer defer the being anointed with the holy oil as the favor of heaven was visibly connected with that ceremony they affirmed that his grandfather charles vii never prospered till he was anointed and that heaven afterward fought on his side till the english were expelled out of his kingdom the high altar of st margarets church in the island of icolmkill was covered with a plate of blue marble finely veined which has suffered from a superstitious conceit that the smallest bit of it will preserve a ship from sinking it has accordingly been carried off piecemeal and at present there is scarce enough leftto make an experiment in the sadder certain prayers are enjoined when one sneezes or pisses in order to chase away the devil cartwheels in lisbon are composed of two boards clumsily cut in a circular form and nailed together though the noise is intolerable yet the axles are never greased because the noise say they frightens the devil from hurting their oxen  nay so far has superstition been carried as to found a belief that the devil by magic can control the course of providence a greek bishop having dreamed that a certain miracle had failed by magic the supposed magician and his son were condemned to die without the least evidence but the dream montesquieu collects a number of circumstances each of which though all extremely improbable ought to have been clearly made out in order to prove the crime lesprit des loix lib    chapter    the emperor theodore lascaris imagining magic to be the cause of his distemper put the persons suspected to the trial of holding a redhot iron without being burnt in the capitularies of charlemagne in the canons of several councils and in the ancient laws of norway punishments are enacted against those who are supposed able to raise tempests tempestarii during the time of catharine de medicis in the court of france there was a jumble of politics gallantry luxury debauchery superstition and atheism it was common to take the resemblance of enemies in wax in order to torment them by roasting the figure at a slow fire and pricking it with needles if an enemy happened in one instance of a thousand to pine and die the charm was established for ever sorcery and witchcraft were so universally believed in england that in a preamble to a statute of henry viii ann      it is set forth that smiths weavers and women boldly take upon them great cures in which they partly use sorcery and witchcraft the first printers who were germans having carried their books to paris for sale were condemned by the parliament to be burnt alive as sorcerers and did not escape punishment but by a precipitant flight it had indeed much the appearance of sorcery that a man could write so many copies of a book without the slightest variation  there are many examples of extraordinary virtues being attributed to certain things in themselves of no significancy the hungarians were possessed of a golden crown sent from heaven with the peculiar virtue as they believed of bestowing upon the person who wore it an undoubted title to be their king  but the most extraordinary effort of absurd superstition is a persuasion that one may control the course of providence by making a downright bargain with god almighty to receive from him quid pro quo a herd of tartars in siberia named by the russians baravinskoi have in every hut a wooden idol termed in their language sheitan about eighteen inches high to which they address their prayers for plenty of game in hunting promising to give it if successful a new coat or a new bonnet a sort of bargain abundantly brutish and yet more excusable in mere savages than what is made with the virgin mary by enlightened roman catholics who upon condition of her relieving them from distress promise her a waxen taper to burn on her altar philip ii of spain made a vow that upon condition of gaining the battle of st quintin he would build the monastery of escurial as if an establishment for some idle monks could be a motive with the great god to vary the course of his providence having gained the battle of st quintin on the festival of st laurence philip reckoned himself obliged to the saint for this victory no less than to god almighty and accordingly he not only built the monastery he had vowed but also a church for the saint and a palace for himself all under one roof and what is not a little ludicrous the edifice is built in resemblance of a gridiron which according to the legend was the instrument of laurences martyrdom  beside the absurdity of thinking that such vows can have the effect to alter the established laws of providence they betray a most contemptible notion of the deity as if his favors like a horse or a cow could be purchased with money  but however loose and disjointed events appear to the ignorant when viewed as past or as passing future events take on a very differert appearance the doctrine of prognostics is evidently founded upon a supposition that future events are unalterably fixed for otherwise that doctrine would appear absurd even to the most ignorant there is no bias in human nature that has greater influence than curiosity about futurity which in dark ages governs without control men with no less folly than industry have ransacked the earth the sea the air and even the stars for prognostics of future events the greeks had their oracles the romans their augurs and all the world their omens the grecian oracles and roman auguries are evidently built upon their belief of tutelar deities and the numberless omens that influence weak people in every country seem to rest upon the same foundation it is no wonder that the romans were superstitiously addicted to omens and auguries like mere savages they put no value upon any science but that of war and for that reason they banished all philosophers as useless members of society thus that nation so fierce and so great in war surrendered themselves blindly to superstition and became slaves to imaginary evils even their gravest historians were deeply tainted with that disease  ancient histories are stuffed with omens prodigies and prognostics livy overflows with fooleries of that kind endless are the adverse omens reported by appian of alexandria that are said to have given warning of the defeat of crassus by the parthians and no fewer in number are those which happened at the death of the emperor hadrian if we believe spartianus lampridius with great gravity recites the omens which prognosticated that alexander severus would be emperor he was born the same day on which alexander the great died he was brought forth in a temple dedicated to alexander the great he was named alexander and an old woman gave to his mother a pigeons egg of a purple color produced on his birthday a comet is an infallible prognostic of the death of a king but of what king why of the king who dies next suetonius with the solemnity of a pulpitinstructor informs us that the death of the emperor claudius was predicted by a comet and of tiberius by the fall of a tower during an earthquake such opinions which indeed have some foundation in our nature take fast hold of the mind when envigorated by education and example even philosophy is not sufficient to eradicate them but by slow degrees witness tacitus the most profound of all historians who cannot forbear to usher in the death of the emperor otho with a foolish account of a strange unknown bird appearing at that time he indeed with decent reserve mentions it only as a fact reported by others but from the warm style of his narrative it is evident that the story had made an impression upon him the ancient germans drew many of their omens from horses proprium gentis equorum presagia ac monitus experiri public aluntur iisdem nemoribus ac lucis candide et nullo mortali opere contacti quos pressos sacro curru sacerdos ac rex vel princeps civitatis comitantur hinnitusque ac fremitus observant nec ulli auspicio major fides non solum apud plebem sed apud proceres apud sacerdotes it is peculiar to that people to deduce omens and presages from horses these animals are maintained at the public expense in groves and forests and are not allowed to be polluted with any work for the use of man but being yoked in the sacred chariot the priest and the king or chief of the state attend them and carefully observe their neighings the greatest faith is given to this method of augury both among the vulgar and the nobles tacitus de moribus germanorum cap  0  there is scarce a thing seen or imagined but what the inhabitants of madagascar consider as a prognostic of some future event the hindows rely on the augury of birds precisely as the old romans did though there is not the slightest probability that an impending misfortune was ever prevented by such prognostics yet the desire of knowing future events is so deeply rooted in our nature that omens will always prevail among the vulgar in spite of the clearest light of philosophy is it not mortifying to human pride that a great philosopher  bacon should think like the vulgar upon this subject mentioning great rejoicings in london upon the daughter of henry vii of england being married to james iv of scotland he adds not from any affection to the scots but from a secret instinct and inspiration of the advantages that would accrue from the match   with respect to prophecies in particular one appology may be made for them that no other prognostic of futurity is less apt to do mischief what procopius gothica historia lib   observes of the sybilline oracles is equally applicable to prophecies in general that it is above the sagacity of man to explain any of them before the event happen after perusing many he gives the following reason matters are there handled says he not in any order nor in a continued discourse but after mentioning the distresses of africa for example they give a slight touch at the persians the romans the assyrians then returning to the romans they fall slapdash upon the calamities of britain a curious example of this observation is a book of prophecies composed in scotland by thomas learmont commonly called thomas the rhymer because the book is in rhyme plutarch in the life of cicero reports that a spectre appeared to ciceros nurse and foretold that the child would become a great support to the roman state and most innocently he makes the following reflection this might have passed for an idle tale had not cicero demonstrated the truth of the prediction which in effect is saying that if a prediction happen to prove ture it is a real prophecy if otherwise that it is an idle tale there have been prophecies not altogether so well guarded as the sybilline oracles napier inventor of the logarithms found the day of judgment predicted in the revelation and named the very day which unfortunately he survived he made another prediction but prudently named a day so distant as to be in no hazard of blushing a second time michel stifels a german clergyman spent most of his life in attempting to discover the day of judgment and at last announced to his parishioners that it would happen within a year the parishioners resolving to make the best of a bad bargain spent their time merrily taking no care to lay up provisions for another year and so nice was their calculation as at the end of the year to have not a morsel remaining either of food or of industry the famous jurieu has shown great ingenuity in explaining prophecies of which take the following instance in his book entitled accomplishment of the prophecies he demonstrates that the beast in the apocalypse which held the poculum aureum plenum abominationum the golden cup full of abominations  is the pope and his reason is that the initial letters of these four latin words compose the word papa a very singular prophecy indeed that is a prophecy in latin but in no other language the candid reader will advert that such prophecies as relate to our savior and tend to ascertain the truth of his mission fall not under the foregoing reasoning for they do not anticipate futurity by producing foreknowledge of future events they were not understood till our savior appeared among men and then they were clearly understood as relative to him  there is no end of superstition in its various modes it was believed universally in dark times that by certain forms and invocations the spirits of the dead could be called upon to reveal future events a lottery in florence gainful to the government and ruinous to the people gives great scope to superstition the purchaser of tickets in order to be successful must fast six and thirty hours must repeat a certain number of ave marys and pater nosters must not speak to a living creature must not go to bed must continue in prayer to the virgin and to saints till some propitious saint appear and declare the numbers that are to be successful the ticketholder fatigued with fasting praying and expectation falls asleep occupied with the thoughts he had when awake he dreams that a saint appears and mentions the numbers that are to be successful if he be disappointed he is vexed at his want of memory but trusts in the saint as an infallible oracle again he buys tickets again falls asleep again sees a vision and again is disappointed  lucky and unlucky days which were so much relied on as even to be marked in the greek and roman calendars make an appendix to prophecies the tartars never undertake any thing of moment on a wednesday being held by them unlucky the nogayan tartars hold every thirteenth year to be unlucky they will not even wear a sword that year believing that it would be their death and they maintain that none of their warriors ever returned who went upon an expedition in one of these years they pass that time in fasting and prayer and during it never marry the inhabitants of madagascar have days fortunate and unfortunate with respect to the birth of children they destroy without mercy every child that is born on an unfortunate day  i close this important article with a reflection that ought to make an impression upon every rational mind the knowledge of future events as far as it tends to influence our conduct is inconsistent with a state of trial such as providence has allotted to man in this life it would deprive him of hopes and fears and leave him nothing to deliberate upon nor any end to prosecute in a word it would put an end to his activity and reduce him to be merely a passive being providence therefore has wisely drawn a veil over future events affording us no light for prying into them but sagacity and experience  these are a few of the numberless absurd opinions about the conduct of providence that have prevailed among christians and still prevail among some of them many opinions no less absurd have prevailed about speculative points i confine myself to one or two instances for to make a complete list would require a volume the first i shall mention and the most noted is transubstantiation which though it has not the least influence on practice is reckoned so essential to salvation as to be placed above every moral duty the following text is appealed to as the sole foundation of that article of faith and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom st matthew xxvi    etc  that this is a metaphor must strike every one the passage cannot even bear a literal meaning considering the final clause for surely the most zealous roman believes not that christians are to drink new wine with their savior in the kingdom of heaven at the same time it is not so much as insinuated that there was here any miraculous transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of our savior nor is it insinuated that the apostles believed they were eating the slesh of their master and drinking his blood st john the favorite apostle mentions not a word of this ceremony which he certainly would not have omitted had he imagined it an essential article of faith  but supposing transubstantiation to be more clearly expressed in this text than it really is yet men of good understanding will be loath to admit a meaning that contradicts their five senses they will reflect that no man now living ever saw the original books of the new testament nor are they certain that the editions we have are copied directly from the originals every remove from them is liable to errors which may justly create a suspicion of every text that contradicts reason and common sense add that the bulk of christians have not even a copy from the original to build their faith upon but only a translation into another language  and this leads to what chiefly determined me to select that instance god and nature have bestowed upon us the faculty of reasoning for distinguishing truth from fasehood if by reasoning with candor and impartiality we discover a proposition to be true or false it is not in our power to remain indifferent we must judge and according to our judgment we must pronounce i say more to pronounce is a duty we owe to our maker for to what purpose has he bestowed reason upon us but in order to direct our belief at the same time we may depend on it as an intuitive truth that god will never impose any belief on us contradictory not only to our reason but to our senses  the following objection however will perhaps relish more with people of plain understanding transubstantiation is a very extraordinary miracle reiterated every day and in every corner of the earth by priests not always remarkable either for piety or for morality now i demand an answer to the following plain question to what good end or purpose is such a profusion of miracles subservient i see none but i discover a very bad one if they have any influence which is that they accustom the roman catholics to more cruelty and barbarity than even the grossest savages are ever guilty of some of them indeed devour the flesh of their enemies but none of them the flesh of their friends especially their greatest friend but to do justice to people of that religion i am confident that this supposed miracle has no influence whatever upon their manners to me it appears impossible for any man seriously to believe that the bread and wine used at the lords supper is actually converted into the body and blood of our savior the romish church requires the belief of transubstantiation and a zealous catholic out of pure obedience thinks he believes it convince once a man that salvation depends on belief and he will believe any thing that is he will imagine that he believes credo quia impossible est a traveller describing the virgin marys house at loretto has the following reflection when there are so many saints endued with such miraculous powers so many relics and so many impregnated wells each of them able to cure the most dangerous diseases one would wonder that physicians could live there or others die but people die here as elsewhere and even churchmen who preach upon the miracles wrought by relics grow sick and die like other men it is one thing to believe it is another thing to fancy that we believe in the year      a jew named sabatai levi appeared at smyrna pretending to be the true messiah and was acknowledged to be such by many the grand signior for proof of his mission insisted for a miracle proposing that he should present himself as a mark to be shot at and promising to believe that he was the messiah if he remained unwounded sabatai declining the trial turned mohammedan to save his life but observe the blindness of superstition though sabatai was seen every day walking the streets of constantinople in the turkish habit the jews insisted that the true sabatai was taken up into heaven leaving only behind him his shadow and probably they most piously fancied that they believed so   that our first reformers who were prone to differ from the romish faith should adopt this doctrine shows the supreme influence of superstition the lutherans had not even the excuse of inattention after serious examination they added one absurdity more teaching that the bread and wine are converted into the body and blood of our savior and yet remain bread and wine as at first which is termed by them consubstantiation i am persuaded that at this time not a single man of them harbors such a thought  many persons proof against a serious argument are sufficiently clearsighted to discover falsehood when put in a ridiculous light it requires i am sensible a very delicate hand to attack a grave subject with ridicule as a test of truth and for that reason i forbear to offer any thing of my own but i will set before my readers some excerpts from a book of absolute authority with roman catholics though transubstantiation be there handled in the most serious manner with all the ceremonies and punctilios that naturally flow from it yet to my taste nothing can be contrived to give it a more ridiculous appearance the book is the roman missal from which the following is a literal translation  mass may be deficient in the matter in the form in the minister or in the action first in the matter if the bread be not of wheat or if there be so great a mixture of other grain that it cannot be called wheatbread or if any way corrupted it does not make a sacrament if it be made with rose water or any other distilled water it is doubtful whether it make a sacrament or not though corruption have begun or though it be leavened it makes a sacrament but the celebrator sins grievously  if the celebrator before consecration observe that the host is corrupted or is not of wheat he must take another host if after consecration he must still take another and swallow it after which he must also swallow the first or give it to another or preserve it in some place with reverence but if he have swallowed the first before observing its defects he must nevertheless swallow also the perfect host because the precept about the perfection of the sacrament is of greater weight than that of taking it fasting if the consecrated host disappear by an accident as by wind by a miracle or by some animal another must be consecrated  if the wine be quite sour or putrid or made of unripe grapes or be mixed with so much water as to spoil the wine it is no sacrament if the wine have begun to sour or to be corrupted or be quite new or not mixed with water or mixed with rose water or other distilled water it makes a sacrament but the celebrator sins grievously  if the priest before consecration observe that the materials are not proper he must stop if proper materials cannot be got but after consecration he must proceed to avoid giving scandal if proper materials can be procured by waiting he must wait for them that the sacrifice may not remain imperfect  second in form if any of the words of consecration be omitted or any of them be changed into words of a different meaning it is no sacrament if they be changed into words of the same meaning it makes a sacrament but the celebrator sins grievously  third in the minister if he does not intend to make a sacrament but to cheat if there be any part of the wine or any water that he has not in his eye and does not intend to consecrate if he have before him eleven wafers and intends to consecrate only ten not determining what ten he intends in these cases the consecration does not hold because intention is requisite if he think there are ten only and intends to consecrate all before him they are all consecrated therefore priests ought always to have such intention if the priest thinking he has but one wafer shall after the consecration find two sticking together he must take them both and he must take off all the remains of the consecrated matter for they all belong to the same sacrifice if in consecrating the intention be not actual by wandering of mind but virtual in approaching the altar it makes a sacrament though priests should be careful to have intention both virtual and actual  beside intention the priest may be deficient in disposition of mind if he be suspended or degraded or excommunicated or under mortal sin he makes a sacrament but sins grievously he may be deficient also in disposition of body if he have not fasted from midnight if he have tasted water or any other drink or meat even in the way of medicine he cannot celebrate nor communicate if he have taken meat or drink before midnight even though he have not slept nor digested it he does not sin but on account of the perturbation of mind which bars devotion it is prudent to refrain  if any remains of meat sticking in the mouth be swallowed with the host they do not prevent communicating provided they be swallowed not as meat but as spittle the same is to be said if in washing the mouth a drop of water be swallowed provided it be against our will  fourth in the action if any requisite be wanting it is no sacrament for example if it be celebrated out of holy ground or upon an altar not consecrated or not covered with three napkins if there be no wax candles if it be not celebrated between daybreak and noon if the celebrator have not said mattins with lauds if he omit any of the sacerdotal robes if these robes and the napkins be not blessed by a bishop if there be no clerk present to serve or one who ought not to serve a woman for example if there be no chalice the cup of which is gold or silver or pewter if the vestment be not of clean linen adorned with silk in the middle and blessed by a bishop if the priest celebrate with his head covered if there be no missal present though he have it by heart  if a gnat or spider fall into the cup after consecration the priest must swallow it with the blood if he can otherwise let him take it out wash it with wine burn it and throw it with the washings into holy ground if poison fall into the cup the blood must be poured on tow or on a linen cloth remain till it be dry then be burnt and the ashes be thrown upon holy ground if the host be poisoned it must be kept in a tabernacle till it be corrupted  if the blood freeze in winter put warm cloths about the cup if that be not sufficient the cup in boiling water  if any of christs blood fall on the ground by negligence it must be licked up with the tongue and the place scraped the scrapings must be burnt and the ashes buried in holy ground  if the priest vomit the eucharist and the species appear entire it must be licked up most reverently if a nausea prevent that to be done it must be kept till it be corrupted if the species do not appear let the vomit be burnt and the ashes thrown upon holy ground    as the foregoing article has beyond intention swelled to an enormous size i shall add but one other article which at the same time shall be extremely short and that is the creed of athanasius it is a heap of unintelligible jargon and yet we are appointed to believe every article of it under the pain of eternal damnation as it enjoins belief of rank contradictions it seems purposely calculated to be a test of slavish submission to the tyrannical authority of a proud and arrogant priest bishop burnet seems doubtful whether this creed was composed by athanasius though his doubts in my apprehension are scarce sufficient to weigh against the unanimous opinion of the christian church   chap iii religious worship in the foregoing chapter are traced the gradual advances of the sense of deity from its imperfect state among savages to its maturity among enlightened nations displaying to us one great being to whom all other beings owe their existence who made the world and who governs it by the most perfect laws and our perception of deity arising from that sense is fortified by an intuitive proposition that there necessarily must exist some being who had no beginning considering the deity as the author of our existence we owe him gratitude considering him as governor of the world we owe him obedience and upon these duties is founded the obligation we are under to worship him further god made man for society and implanted in his nature the moral sense to direct his conduct in that state from these premises may it not with certainly be inferred to be the will of god that men should obey the dictates of the moral sense in fulfilling every duty of justice and benevolence these moral duties it would appear are our chief business in this life being enforced not only by a moral but by a religious principle  morality as laid down in a former sketch consists of two great branches viz the moral sense which unfolds our duty to man and an active moral principle which prompts us to perform that duty natural religion consists also of two great branches viz the sense of deity which unfolds our duty to our maker and the active principle of devotion which prompts us to perform our duty to him the universality of the sense of deity proves it to be innate the same reason proves the principle of devotion to be innate for all men agree in worshipping superior beings whatever difference there may be in the mode of worship  both branches of the duty we owe to god that of worshipping him and that of obeying his will with respect to our fellow creatures are summed up by the prophet micah in the following emphatic words he has showed thee o man what is good and what does the lord require of thee but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god the two articles first mentioned are moral duties regarding our fellow creatures and as to such what is required of us by the lord is to do our duty to others not only as directed by the moral sense but as being the will of our maker to whom we owe absolute obedience that branch of our duty is reserved for a second section at present we are to treat of religious worship included in the third article viz the walking humbly with our god  sect i religious worship the obligation we are under to worship god or to walk humbly with him is as observed above founded on the two great principles of gratitude and obedience both of them requiring fundamentally a pure heart and a welldisposed mind but heartworship is alone not sufficient there are over and above required external signs testifying to others the sense we have of these duties and a firm resolution to perform them that such is the will of god will appear as follows the principle of devotion like most of our other principles partakes of the imperfection of our nature yet however faint originally it is capable of being greatly invigorated by cultivation and exercise private exercise is not sufficient nature and consequently the god of nature require public exercise or public worship for devotion is infectious like joy or grief elements of criticism vol   p   0 edit    and by mutual communication in a numerous assembly is greatly invigorated a regular habit of expressing publicly our gratitude and resignation never fails to purify the mind tending to wean it from every unlawful pursuit this is the true motive of public worship not what is commonly inculcated viz that it is required from us as a testimony to our maker of our obedience to his laws god who knows the heart needs no such testimony arnobius adversus gentes lib   accounts rationally for the worship we pay to the deity huic omnes ex more prosternimur hunc collatis precibus adoramus ab hoc justa et honesta et auditu ejus condigna deposcimus non quo ipse desideret supplices nos esse aut amet substerni tot millium venerationem videre utilitas haec nostra est et commodi nostri rationem spectans nam quia proni ad culpas et ad libidinis varios appetitus vitio sumus infirmitatis ingenitae patitur se semper nostris cogitationibus concipi ut dum illum oramus et mereri ejus contendimus munera accipiamus innocentiae voluntatem et ab omni nos labe delictorum omnium amputatione purgemus   in english thus it is our custom to prostrate ourselves before him and we ask of him such gifts only as are consistent with justice and with honor and suitable to the character of the being whom we adore not that he receives pleasure or satisfaction from the humble veneration of thousands of his creatures from this we ourselves derive benefit and advantage for being the slaves of appetite and prone to err from the weakness of our nature when we address ourselves to god in prayer and study by our actions to merit his approbation we gain at least the wish and the inclination to be virtuous  i shall only add upon the general head that lawgivers ought to avoid with caution the enforcing public worship by rewards and punishments human laws cannot reach the heart in which the essence of worship consists they may indeed bring on a listless habit of worship by separating the external act from the internal affection than which there can be nothing more hurtful to true religion the utmost that can be safely ventured is to bring public worship under censorian powers as a matter of police for preserving good order and for preventing bad example  the religion of confucius professed by the literati and persons of rank in china and tonquin consists in a deep inward veneration for the god or king of heaven and in the practice of every moral virtue they have neither temples nor priests nor any settled form of external worship every one adores the supreme being in the manner he himself thinks best this is indeed the most refined system of religion that ever took place among men there is however an invincible objection against it which is that it is not fitted for the human race an excellent religigion it would be for angels but is far too refined even for sages and philosophers  proceeding to deviations from the genuine worship required by our maker and gross deviations there have been i begin with that sort of worship which is influenced by fear and which for that reason is universal among savages the american savages believe that there are inferior deities without end most of them prone to mischief they neglect the supreme deity because he is good and direct their worship to soothe the malevolent inferior deities from doing harm the inhabitants of the molucca islands who believe the existence of malevolent invisible beings subordinate to the supreme benevolent being confine their worship to the former in order to avert their wrath and one branch of their worship is to set meat before them hoping that when the belly is full there will be less inclination to mischief the worship of the inhabitants of java is much the same the negroes of benin worship the devil as dapper expresses it and sacrifice to him both men and beasts they acknowledge indeed a supreme being who created the universe and governs it by his providence but they regard him not for say they it is needless if not impertinent to invoke a being who good and gracious is incapable of injuring or molesting us  the austerities and penances that are practiced in almost all religions spring from the same root one way to please invisible malignant powers is to make ourselves as miserable as possible hence the horrid penances of the faquirs in hindostan who outdo in mortification whatever is reported of the ancient christian anchorites some of these faquirs continue for life in one posture some never lie down some have always their arms raised above their head and some mangle their bodies with knives and scourges the town of jagrenate in hindostan is frequented by pilgrims some of them from the distance of  00 leagues which they travel not by walking or riding but by measuring the road by the length of their bodies in which method of locomotion some of them consume years before they complete their pilgrimage a religious sect made its way some centuries ago into japan termed bubsdoists from bubs the founder this sect has prevailed over the ancient sect of the sintos chiefly by its austerity and mortifications the spirit of this sect inspires nothing but excessive fear of the gods who are painted prone to vengeance and always offended the people of that religion pass most of their time in tormenting themselves to expiate imaginary faults and they are treated by their priests with despotism and cruelty that is not paralleled but by the inquisitors of spain the manners of the people are fierce cruel and unrelenting such as never fail to be inspired by horrible superstition the notion of invisible malevolent powers formerly universal is not to this hour eradicated even among christians for which i appeal to the fastings and flagellations among romancatholics held by them to be an essential part of religion people infected with religious horrors are never seriously convinced that an upright heart and sound morality make the essence of religion the doctrine of the jansenists concerning repentance and mortification shows evidently however they may deceive themselves that they have an impression of the deity as a malevolent being they hold the guilt contracted by adams fall to be a heinous sin which ought to be expiated by acts of mortification such as the torturing and macerating the body with painful labor excessive abstinence continual prayer and contemplation their penances whether for original or voluntary sin are carried to extravagance and they who put an end to their lives by such severities are termed the sacred victims of repentance consumed by the fire of divine love such suicides are esteemed peculiarly meritorious in the eye of heaven and it is thought that their sufferings cannot fail to appease the anger of the deity that celibacy is a state of purity and perfection is a prevailing notion in many countries among the pagans a married man was forbid to approach the altar for some days after knowing his wife and this ridiculous notion of pollution contributed to introduce celibacy among the romancatholic priests the emperor otho anno      became a signal penitent but instead of atoning for his sins by repentance and restitution he laid himself down to be trod under foot by the boys of his kitchen and frequently submitted to the discipline of the whip inflicted by monks the emperor charles v toward the end of his days was sorely depressed in spirit with fear of hell monks were his only companions with whom he spent his time in chanting hymns as an expiation for his sins he in private disciplined himself with such severity that his whip found after his death was tinged with his blood nor was he satisfied with these acts of mortification timorous and illiberal solicitude still haunting him he aimed at something extraordinary at some new and singular act of piety to display his zeal and to merit the favor of heaven the act he fixed on was as wild as any that superstition ever suggested to a distempered brain it was to celebrate his own obsequies he ordered his tomb to be erected in the chapel of the monastery his domestics marched there in a funeral procession holding black tapers he followed in his shroud he was laid in his coffin with much solemnity the service of the dead was chanted and he himself joined in the prayers offered up for his requiem mingling his tears with those of his attendants the ceremony closed with sprinkling holy water upon the coffin and the assistants reretiring the doors of the chapel were shut then charles rose out of the coffin and stole privately to his apartment  the history of ancient sacrifices is not so accurate as in every instance to ascertain upon what principle they were founded whether upon fear upon gratitude for favors received or to solicit future favor human sacrifices undoubtedly belong to the present head for being calculated to deprecate the wrath of a malevolent deity they could have no other motive but fear and indeed they are a most direful effect of that passion it is needless to lose time in mentioning instances which are well known to those who are acquainted with ancient history a number of them are collected in historical lawtracts tract    and to these i take the liberty of adding that the cimbrians the germans the gauls particularly the druids practiced human sacrifices for which we have the authority of julius caesar strabo and other authors a people upon the missisippi named tensas worship the sun and like the natches their neighbors have a temple for that luminary with a sacred fire in it continually burning the temple having been set on fire by thunder was all in flames when some french travelers saw them throw children into the fire one after another to appease the incensed deity the prophet micah chap    in a passage partly quoted above inveighs bitterly against such sacrifices wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god shall i come before him with burntofferings with calves of a year old will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul he has showed thee o man what is good and what does the lord require of thee but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  the ancient persians acknowledged oromazes and arimanes as their great deities authors of good and ill to men but i find not that arimanes the evil principle was ever an object of any religious worship the gaures who profess the ancient religion of persia address no worship but to one god allgood and allpowerful  next of worshipping the deity in the character of a mercenary being under that head come sacrifices and oblations whether prompted by gratitude for favors received or by selfinterest to procure future favors which for the reason mentioned i shall not attempt to distinguish as the deities of early times were thought to resemble men it is not wonderful that men endeavored to conciliate their favor with such offerings as were the most acceptable to themselves it is probable that the first sacrifices of that kind were of sweet smelling herbs which in the fire emitted a flavor that might reach the nostrils of a deity even at a distance the burning incense to their gods was practiced in mexico and peru and at present is practiced in the peninsula of corea an opportunity so favorable for making religious zeal a fund of riches to the priesthood is seldom neglected there was no difficulty to persuade ignorant people that the gods could eat as well as smell what was offered to a deity for food being carried into the temple was understood to be devoured by him  with respect to the jewish sacrifices of burntofferings meat offerings sin offerings peace offerings heaveofferings and waveofferings these were appointed by god himself in order to keep that stiffnecked people in daily remembrance of their dependence on him and to preserve them if possible from idolatry but that untractable race did not adhere to the purity of the institution they insensibly degenerated into the notion that their god was a mercenary being and in that character only was the worship of sacrifices performed to him the offerings mentioned were liberally bestowed on him not singly as a token of their dependence but chiefly in order to avert his wrath or to gain his favor there is no mention in ancient authors of fish being offered to the gods in sacrifice the reason i take to be that the most savoury food of man was reckoned the most agreeable to their gods that savages never thought of fish till landanimals became scarce and that the matter as well as form of sacrifices were established in practice long before men had recourse to fish for food   the religious notions of the greeks were equally impure they could not think of any means for conciliating the favor of their gods more efficacious than gifts homer paints his gods as mercenary to an extreme in the fourth book of the iliad jupiter says of these cities honored the most by the soul of jove is sacred troy never stands the altar empty before me oblations poured forth in my presence savor that ascends the skies speaking in the fifth book of a warrior known afterward to be diomedes some god he is some power against the trojans enraged for vows unpaid destructive is the wrath of the gods diomedes prays to minerva with thine arm ward from me the foe a year old heifer o queen shall be thine broadfronted unbroken and wild her to thee i will offer with prayer gilding with gold her horns precisely of the same kind are the offerings made by superstitious roman catholics to the virgin mary and to saints electra in the tragedy of that name supplicates apollo in the following terms  o hear electra too who with unsparing hand her chicest gifts has never failed to lay before thy altars accept the little all that now remains for me to give   the people of hindostan as mentioned above atone for their sins by austere penances but they have no notion of presenting gifts to the deity nor of deprecating his wrath with the blood of animals on the contrary they reckon it a sin to slay any living creature which reduces them to vegetable food this is going too far for the deity could never mean to prohibit animal food when mans chief dependence originally was upon it the abstaining however from animal food shows greater humanity in the religion of hindostan than of any other known country the inhabitants of madagascar are in a stage of religion common among many nations which is the acknowledging one supreme benevolent deity and many malevolent inferior deities most of their worship is indeed addressed to the latter but they have so far advanced before several other nations as to offer sacrifices to the supreme being without employing either idols or temples  philosophy and sound sense in polished natitions have purified religious worship by banishing the profession at least of oblations and sacrifices the being that made the world governs it by laws that are inflexible because they are the best possible and to imagine that he can be moved by prayers oblations or sacrifices to vary his plan of government is an impious thought degrading the deity to a level with ourselves hear o my people and i will testify against thee i am god even thy god i will take no bullock out of thy house nor hegoat out of thy fold for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows to the most high call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shall glorify me psalm  0  thou desire not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not in burntoffering the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou will not despise psalm     for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burntofferings hosea vi    in dark ages there is great show of religion with little heart worship in ages of philosophy warm heartworship with little show agathias urges a different reason against sacrifices ego nullam naturam esse existimo cui voluptati sint soedata sanguine altaria et animantium lanienae quod si qua tamen est cui ista sint cordi non ea mitis et benigna est aliqua sed fera ac rabida qualem pavorem poetae fingunt et metum et bellonam et malam fortunam et discordiam quam indomitam appellant   in english thus i cannot conceive that there should exist a superior being who takes delight in the sacrifice of animals or in altars stained with blood if such there be his nature is not benevolent but barbarous and cruel such indeed were the gods whom the poets have created such were fear and terror the goddess of war of evil fortune and of discord  arnobius batters down bloody sacrifices with a very curious argument ecce si bos aliquis aut quodlibet ex his animal quod ad placandas caeditur mitigandasque ad numinum furias vocem hominis sumat eloquaturque his verbis ergone o jupiter aut quis alius dues es humanum est istud et rectum aut aequitatis alicujus in aestimatione ponendum ut cum alius peccaverit ego occidar et de me sanguine fieri tibi patiaris satis qui nunquam te laeserim nunquam sciens aut nesciens tuum numen majestatemque violarim animal ut scis mutum naturae meae simplicitatem sequens nec multiformium morum varietatibus lubricum   in english thus what if the ox while he is led out to slaughter to appease the fancied wrath of an offended deity should assume the human voice and in these words astonish his conductors are these o merciful god are these the dictates of humanity or of justice that for the crime of another i should forfeit my life i have never by my will offended thee and dumb as i am and uninformed by reason my actions according to the simplicity of my nature cannot have given thee displeasure who have made me as i am  if this argument were solid it would be equally conclusive against animal food   this is a proper place for the history of idolatry which as will anon appear sprung from religious worship corrupted by men of shallow understanding and gross conceptions upon whom things invisible make little impression  savages even of the lowest class have an impression of invisible powers though they cannot form any distinct notion of them but such impression is too faint for the exercise of devotion whether inspired with love to a good being or with fear of an ill being savages are not at ease without some sort of visible object to animate them a great stone served that purpose originally a very low instrument indeed of religious worship but not altogether whimsical if it was introduced which is highly probable in the following manner it was an early and a natural custom among savages to mark with a great stone the place where their worthies were interred of which we have hints every where in ancient history particularly in the poems of ossian place me says calmar mortally wounded at the side of a stone of remembrance that future times may bear my same and the mother of calmar rejoice over the stone of my renown superstition in later times having deified these worthies their votaries rejoicing as formerly over the stones dedicated to them held these stones to be essential in every act of religious worship performed to their new deities frequent mention is made of such stones in the poems of ossian but remember my son to place this sword this bow and this horn within that dark and narrow house marked with one gray stone p    whose same is in that darkgreen tomb four stones with their heads of moss stand there and mark the narrow house of death p    let thy bards mourn those who fell let erin give the sons of lochlin to earth and raise the mossy stones of their fame that the children of the north hereafter may behold the place where their fathers fought p    earth here incloses the loveliest pair on the hill grass grows between the stones of the tomb p  0  in the same poems we find stones made instruments of worship the spirit of loda is introduced threatening fingal fly to thy land replied the form receive the wind and fly the blasts are in the hollow of my hand the course of the storm is mine the king of sora is my son he bends at the stone of my power p  00  tradition points out many stones in different parts of the world that were used in religious worship a large stone worshipped by the pessenuntians a people of phrygia under the name of idaea matter was upon a solemn embassy to that people brought to rome it being contained in the sybilline books that unless the romans got possession of that goddess they never would prevail over hannibal and pausanias mentions many stones in greece dedicated to different divinities particularly thirty square stones in achaia on which were engraved the names of as many gods in another place he mentions a very ancient statue of venus in the island delos which instead of feet had only a square stone this may appear a puzzling circumstance in the history of greece considering that all the grecian gods were originally mortals whom it was easy to represent by statues but in that early period the greeks knew no more of statuary than the most barbarous nations it is perhaps not easy to gather the meaning of savages with respect to such stones the most natural conjecture is that a great stone dedicated to the worship of a certain deity was considered as belonging to him this notion of property had a double effect the worshippers by connection of ideas were led from the stone to the deity and the stone tended to fix their wandering thoughts it was probably imagined over and above that some latent virtue communicated to the stone made it holy or sacred even among enlightened people a sort of virtue or sanctity is conceived to reside in the place of worship why not also in a stone dedicated to a deity the ancient ethiopians in their worship introduced the figure of a serpent as a symbol of the deity two sticks laid cross represented castor and pollux roman divinities a javelin represented their god mars and in tartary formerly the god of war was worshipped under the symbol of an old rusty sabre the ancient persians used consecrated fire as an emblem of the great god though the negroes of congo and angola have images without number they are not however idolaters in any proper sense their belief is that these images are only organs by which the deities signify their will to their votaries  if the use that was made of stones and of other symbols in religious worship be fairly represented it may appear strange that the ingenious greeks sunk down into idolatry at the very time they were making a rapid progress in the fine arts their improvements in statuary one of these arts was the cause they began with attempting to carve heads of men and women representing their deified heroes which were placed upon the stones dedicated to these divinities in the progress of the art statues were executed complete in every member and at last statues of the gods were made expressing such dignity and majesty as insensibly to draw from beholders a degree of devotion to the statues themselves hear quintilian upon that subject at quae polycleto defuerunt phidiae atque alcameni dantur phidias tamen diis quam hominibus efficiendis melior artifex traditur in ebore vero long citra aemulum vel si nihil nisi minervam athenis aut olympium in elide jovem fecisset cujus pulchritudo adjecisse aliquid etiam receptae religioni videtur adeo majestas operis deum aequavit the deficiencies of polycletus were made up in phidias and alcamenes phidias is reckoned to have had more skill in forming the statues of gods than of men in works of ivory he was unrivalled although there had been no other proofs of his excellence than the statue of minerva at athens and the jupiter olympius in elis its beauty seems to have added to the received religion the majestic statue resembling so much the god himself  here is laid a foundation for idolatry let us trace its progress such statues as are represented by quintilian serve greatly to enslame devotion and during a warm fit of the religious passion the representation is lost and the statue becomes a deity precisely as where king lear is represented by garrick the actor vanishes and behold the king himself this is not singular anger occasions a metamorphosis still more extraordinary if i happen to strike my gouty toe against a stone the violence of the pain converts the stone for a moment into a voluntary agent and i wreak my resentment on it as if it really were so it is true the image is only conceived to be a deity during the fervor of devotion and when that subsides the image falls back to its original representative state but frequent instances of that kind have at last the effect among illiterate people to convert the image into a sort of permanent deity what such people see makes a deep impression what they see not little or none at all there is another thing that concurs with eyesight to promote this delusion devotion being a vigorous principle in the human breast will exert itself upon the meanest object when none more noble is in view  the ancient persians held the consecrated fire to be an emblem only of the great god but such veneration was paid to that emblem and with so great ceremony was it treated that the vulgar came at last to worship it as a sort of deity the priests of the gaures watch the consecrated fire day and night they keep it alive with the purest wood without bark they touch it not with sword nor knife they blow it not with bellows nor with the mouth even the priest is prohibited to approach it till his mouth be covered with fine linen lest it be polluted with his breath if it happen to go out it must be rekindled by striking fire from flint or by a burning glass  the progress of idolatry will more clearly appear from attending to the religion of the greeks and romans the greeks as mentioned above made use of stones in divine worship long before idolatry was introduced and we learn from varro that for a hundred and seventy years after numa the romans had no statues nor images in their temples after statues of the gods came in fashion they acquired by degrees more and more respect the greek and roman writers talk of divine virtue being communicated to statues and some of the roman writers talk familiarly of the numen of a deity residing in his statue arnobius in his book against the gentiles introduces a gentile delivering the following opinion we do not believe that the metal which composes a statue whether gold or silver or brass is a god but we believe that a solemn dedication brings down the god to inhabit his image and it is the god only that we worship in that image this explains the roman ceremony of inviting to their side the tutelar deities of towns besieged by them termed evacatio tutelarium deorum the romans cruel as they were overflowed with superstition and as they were averse from combating the tutelar deities even of their enemies they endeavored to gain these deities by large promises and assurance of honorable treatment as they could not hope that a statue would change its place their notion must have been that by this ceremony the tutelar deity might be prevailed upon to withdraw its numen and leave the statue a dead lump of matter when stilpo was banished by the areopagus of athens for affirming that the statue in the temple of minerva was not the goddess but a piece of matter carved by phidias he surely was not condemned for saying that the statue was made by phidias a fact universally known his heresy consisted in denying that the numen of minerva resided in the statue augustus having twice lost his fleet by storm forbade neptune to be carried in procession along with the other gods imagining he had avenged himself of neptune by neglecting the favorite statue in which his numen resided  when saints in the christian church were deified even their images became objects of worship from a fond imagination that such worship draws down into the images the souls of the saints they represent which is the same doctrine that arnobius in the passage above mentioned ascribes to the gentiles and is not widely different from the belief of the pagan tartars and ostiacs by and by to be mentioned in the eleventh century there was a violent dispute about images in the greek church many asserting that in the images of our savior and of the saints there resides an inherent sanctity which is a proper object of worship and that christians ought not to confine their worship to the persons represented but ought also to extend it to their images  as ignorant and savage nations can form no conception of deity but of a being like a man only superior in power and greatness images are made of the deity in several nations conformable to this conception it is easy to make some resemblance of a man but how is power and greatness to be represented to perform this with propriety would require a hogarth savages go more bluntly to work they endeavor to represent a man with many heads and with a still greater number of hands the northern tartars seem to have no deities but certain statues or images coarsely formed out of wood and bearing some distant resemblance to the human figure to palliate so gross an absurdity as that a god can be fabricated by the hands of man they imagine this image to be endued with a soul to say whence that soul came would puzzle the wisest of them that soul is conceived to be too elevated for dwelling constantly in a piece of matter they believe that it resides in some more honorable place and that it only visits the image or idol when it is called down by prayers and supplications they sacrifice to this idol by rubbing its mouth with the fat of fish and by offering it the warm blood of some beast killed in hunting the last step of the ceremony is to honor the soul of the idol with a joyful shout as a sort of convoy to it when it returns home the ostiacs have a wooden idol termed the old man of oby who is guardian of their fishery it has eyes of glass and a head with short horns when the ice dissolves they crowd to this idol requesting that he will be propitious to their fishery if unsuccessful he is loaded with reproaches if successful he is entitled to a share of the capture they make a feast for him rubbing his snout with choice fat and when the entertainment is over they accompany the soul of the idol a little way beating the air with their cudgels the ostiacs have another idol that is fed with milk so abundantly as to come out on both sides of the spoon and to fall down upon the vesture which however is never washed so little is cleanliness thought essential to religion by that people it is indeed wonderfully absurd to think that invisible souls require food like human creatures and yet the same absurdity prevailed in greece  the ancient germans a sober and sensible people had no notion of representing their gods by statues nor of building temples to them they worshipped in consecrated groves tacitus de moribus germanorum cap    the egyptians from a just conception that an invisible being can have no resemblance to one that is visible employed hieroglyphical figures for denoting metaphorically the attributes of their gods and they employed not only the figures of birds and beasts but of vegetables leeks for example and onions this metaphorical adjunct to religion innocent in itself sunk the egyptians to the lowest degree of idolatry as hieroglyphical figures composed frequently of heterogeneous parts resemble not any being human or devine the vulgar losing sight of the emblematic signification which is not readily understood but by poets and philosophers took up with the plain figures as real divinities how otherwise can it be accounted for that the ox the ape the onion were in egypt worshipped as deities but this must be understood of the vulgar only it is scarce supposable that the better sort of people could think so grossly and we have the authority of plutarch for doubting in his chapter upon isis and osiris he observes that the egyptians worshipped the bull the cat and other animals not as divinities but as representatives of them like an image seen in a glass or as he expresses it in another part of the same chapter just as we see the resemblance of the sun in a drop of water however this be the egyptian worship is an illustrious instance of the influence of devotion how powerful must it be in its purity when even in a wrong direction it can force its way against every obstacle of common sense and such respect was paid to these animals if we can trust diodorus siculus that in a great famine the egyptians ventured not to touch the sacred animals though they were forced to devour one another the veneration paid to a cow in hindostan arose probably from the same cause viz its having been used as a symbol of the deity a snake of a particular kind about a yard long and about the thickness of a mans arm is worshipped by the whidans in guinea it has a large round head piercing eyes a short pointed tongue and a smooth skin beautifully speckled it has a strong antipathy to all the venomous kind in other respects innocent and tame to kill them being a capital crime they travel about unmolested even into bedchambers they occasioned ann      a ridiculous persecution a hog teased by one of them gnashed it with his tusks till it died the priests carried their complaint to the king and no one presuming to appear as counsel for the hogs orders were issued for slaughtering the whole race at once were brandished a thousand cutlasses and the race would have been extirpated had not the king interposed representing to the priests that they ought to rest satisfied with the innocent blood they had spilt rancour and cruelty never rage more violently than under the mask of religion  it is amazing how prone the most polished nations formerly were to idolatry the tyrians besieged by alexander chained down hercules their tutelar deity to prevent him from deserting to the enemy which is said to have been also practiced in sparta the city of ambracia being taken by the romans and every statue of their gods being carried to rome the ambracians complained bitterly that not a single divinity was left them to worship how much more rational are the hindostan bramins who teach their disciples that idols are emblems only of the deity intended merely to fix the attention of the populace  the first statues in greece and tuscany were made with wings to signify the swift motion of the gods these statues were so clumsy as scarce to resemble human creatures not to talk of a divinity but the admirable statues executed in later times were imagined to resemble most accurately the deities represented by them whence the vulgar notion that gods have wings and that angels have wings  i proceed to what in the history of idolatry may be reckoned the second part statues we have seen were at first used as representatives only of the deity but came afterward to be metamorphosed into divinities the absurdity did not stop there people not satisfied with the visible deities erected in temples for public worship became fond to have private deities of their own whom they worshipped as their tutelar deities and this practice spread so wide as that among many nations every family had household gods cut in wood or stone every family in kamskatka has a tutelar deity in the shape of a pillar with the head of a man which is supposed to guard the house against malevolent spirits they give it food daily and anoint the head with the fat of fish the prophet isaiah chap    put this species of deification in a most ridiculous light he burns part thereof in the fire with part thereof he roasteth flesh of the residue he makes a god even his graven image he falls down worshipping and praying to it and says deliver me for thou art my god multiplication could not fail to sink householdgods into a degree of contempt expectation of good from them might produce some cold ceremonial worship but there could be no real devotion at heart the chinese manner of treating their householdgods will vouch for me when a chinese does not obtain what he prays for thou spiritual dog he will say i lodge thee well thou art beaufully gilded treated with perfumes and burntofferings and yet thou withholdest from me the necessaries of life sometimes they fasten a cord to the idol and drag it through the dirt the inhabitants of ceylon treat their idols in the same manner thor woden and friga were the great deities of the scandinavians they had at the same time inferior deities who were supposed to have been men translated into heaven for their good works these they treated with very little ceremony refusing to worship them if they were not propitious and even punishing them with banishment but restoring them after a time in hopes of amendment domestic idols are treated by the ostiacs not more reverently than by the people mentioned but they have public idols some particularly of brass which are highly reverenced the solidity of the metal is in their imagination connected with immortality and great regard is paid to these idols for the knowledge and experience they must have acquired in an endless course of time  saints or tutelar deities are sometimes not better treated among roman catholics than among pagans when we were in portugal says captain brydone the people of castelbranco were so enraged at st antonio for suffering the spaniards to plunder their town contrary as they affirmed to his express agreement with them that they broke many of his statues to pieces and one that had been more revered than the rest they took the head off and in its stead placed one of st francis the great st januarius himself was in imminent danger during the last famine at naples they loaded him with abuse and invective and declared point blank that if he did not procure them corn by such a time he should be no longer their saint the tutelar saint of cattania at the foot of mount etna is st agatha a torrent of lava burst over the walls and laid waste great part of that beautiful city where was st agatha at this time the people say that they had given her just provocation but that she has long ago been reconciled to them and has promised never to suffer the lava to hurt them again at the foot of mount etna a statue of a saint is placed as a memorial for having prevented the lava from running up the mountain of taurominum and destroying that town the saint having conducted the lava down a low valley to the sea  when a traveller once happens to deviate from the right road there is no end of wandering porphyrius reports that in anubis an egyptian city a real man was worshipped as a god which is also asserted by minucius foelix in his apology for the christians a thousand writers have said that the tartars believe their high priest termed dalai lama to be immortal but that is a mistake his death is published through the whole country and couriers sent even to pekin intimate it to the emperor of china his effigy at the same time is taken down from the portal of the great church and that of his successor is put in its stead the system of the metempsychosis adopted in that country has occasioned the mistake they believe that the holy spirit which animates a dalai lama passes upon his death into the body of his successor the spirit therefore is believed to be immortal not the body the dalai lama however is the object of profound veneration the tartar princes are daily sending presents to him and consulting him as an oracle they even undertake a pilgrimage in order to worship him in person in a retired part of the temple he is shown covered with precious stones and sitting crosslegged they prostrate themselves before him at a distance for they are not permitted to kiss his toe the priests make traffic even of his excrements which are greedily purchased at a high price and are kept in a golden box hanging from the neck as a charm against every misfortune like the cross of jesus or the virgins milk we may believe there never will be wanting plenty of that precious stuff to answer all demands the priests out of charity will furnish a quota rather than suffer votaries to depart with their money for want of goods to purchase the person of the japan pope or ecclesiastical emperor is held so sacred as to make the cutting his beard or his nails a deadly sin but absurd laws are never steadily executed the beard and the nails are cut in the nightime when the pope is supposed to be sleeping and what is taken away by that operation is understood to be stolen from him which is no impeachment upon his holiness  that the jews were idolaters when they sojourned in the land of goshen were it not presumable from their commerce with the egyptians would however be evident from the history of moses notwithstanding their miraculous deliverance from the egyptian king notwithstanding the daily miracles wrought among them in the wilderness so addicted were they to a visible deity that during even the momentary absence of moses conversing with god on the mount they fabricated a golden calf and worshipped it as their god and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf have worshipped it have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt exodus xxxii    the history of the jews shows how difficult it is to reclaim from idolatry a brutish people addicted to superstition and and fettered by inveterate habit what profusion of blood to bring that obstinate and perverse people to the true religion all in vain the book of judges in particular is full of reiterated relapses from their own invisible god to the visible gods of other nations and in all probability their anxious desire for a visible king related in the first book of samuel arose from their being deprived of a visible god there was a necessity for prohibiting images deuteronomy xvi     which would have soon been converted into deities visible and it was extremely prudent to supply the want of a visible god with endless shows and ceremonies which accordingly became the capital branch of the jewish worship  it appears to me from the whole history of the jews that a gross people are not susceptible but of a gross religion and without an enlightened understanding that it is vain to think of eradicating superstition and idolatry and after all the covenants made with the jews after all the chastisements and all the miracles lavished on them that they were not however reclaimed from the most grovelling idolatry is evident from the two golden calves fabricated by jeroboam saying behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt   kings xii     the people also of judah fell back to idolworship under rehoboam son of solomon   kings xiv     jehu king of the ten tribes did not tolerate the worship of other gods   kings x     but he continued to worship the two golden calves fabricated by jeroboam   kings x     down to the days of king hezekiah the jews worshipped the brazen serpent erected by moses in the wilderness the jews seem indeed to have been a very perverse people the many promises and threatenings announced by their prophets and the many miracles wrought among them had no permanent effect to restrain them from idolatry and yet during their captivity in babylon several of them submitted to be burnt alive rather than to join in idol worship daniel chap    captivity cured them radically of idolatry and from that period to this day they have not been guilty of a single relapse xiphilin in his abridgement of dion cassius relating their war with pompey many centuries after the babylonish captivity gives the following account of them their customs are quite different from those of other nations beside a peculiar manner of living they acknowledge none of the common deities they acknowledge but one whom they worship with great veneration there never was an image in jerusalem because they believe their god to be invisible and ineffable they have built him a temple of great size and beauty remarkable in the following particular that it is open above without any roof  there lies no solid objection against images among an enlightened people when used merely to rouse devotion but as images tend to pervert the vulgar they ought not to be admitted into churches pictures are less liable to be misapprehended and the ethiopians accordingly indulge pictures though they prohibit statues in their churches the general council of frankfort permitted the use of images in churches but strictly prohibited any worship to be addressed to them so prone however to idolatry are the low and illiterate that the prohibition lost ground both in france and in germany and idolworship became again general  it is extremely probable that the sun and moon were early held to be deities and that they were the first visible objects of worship it must indeed be acknowledged that of all the different kinds of idolatry it is the most excusable upon the sun depends health vigor and cheerfulness during his retirement all is dark and disconsolate when he performs his majestic round to bless his subjects and to bestow fecundity upon every animal and vegetable can a mere savage withold gratitude and veneration hear an old pagan bard upon that subject o thou who rollest above round as the shield of my fathers whence are thy beams o sun thy everlasting light thou come forth in thy awful beauty and the stars hide their faces thou movest alone for who can be a companion of thy course the oaks of the mountain fall the mountains decay with years the ocean shrinks and grows again the moon herself is lost in heaven but thou art for ever the same rejoicing in the brightness of thy course when tempests darken the world when thunder rolls and lightning flies thou look in thy beauty from the clouds and laughest at the storm ossian  worship to the sun as a real deity was in former times universal and prevails in many countries even at present the american savages worship the sun as sovereign of the universe known by the name of ariskoui among the hurons and of agriskoue among the iroquois they offer him tobacco which they term smoking the sun the chief man in the assembly lights the calumet and offers it thrice to the rising sun imploring his protection and recommending the tribe to his care the chief proceeds to smoke and every one smokes in his turn this ceremony is performed on important occasions only less matters are reserved for their manitou the missisippi people offer to the sun the first of what they take in hunting which their commander artfully converts to his own use the apalachites bordering on florida worship the sun but sacrifice nothing to him that has life they hold him to be the parent of life and think that he can take no pleasure in the destruction of any living creature their devotion is exerted in perfumes and songs the mexicans while a free people presented to the sun a share of their meat and drink the inhabitants of darien believe in the sun as their god and in the moon as his wife paying equal adoration to each the people of borneo worship the sun and moon as real divinities the samoides worship both bowing to them morning and evening in the persian manner  but if the sun and moon were the first objects of idolatry knowledge and reflection reformed many from the error of holding these luminaries to be deities that original intelligence say the magians who is the first principle of all things discovers himself to the mind and understanding only but he has placed the sun as his image in the visible universe and the beams of that bright luminary are but a faint copy of the glory that shines in the higher heavens the persians as herodotus reports had neither temples nor altars nor images for says that author they do not think like the greeks that there is any resemblance between gods and men the gaures who to this day profess the ancient religion of persia celebrate divine worship before the sacred fire and turn with peculiar veneration toward the rising sun as the representative of god but they adore neither the sun nor the sacred fire they are professed enemies to every image of the deity cut with hands and hence the havoc made by the ancient persians upon the statues and temples of the grecian gods such sublimity of thought was above the reach of other uninspired nations excepting only the hindows and chinese  i close the history of idolatry with a brief recapitulation of the outlines admitting the sun and moon to have been the first objects of idolatry yet as polytheism was once universal they make only two of the many gods that were every where worshipped we have seen that the sacred fire was employed in the worship of the sun and that images were employed in the worship of other deities images were originally used for the sole purpose of animating devotion such was their use in persia and hindostan and such was their use in every country among philosophers the emperor julian in an epistle to theodore concerning the images of the gods says we believe not that these images are gods we only use them in worshipping the gods in the progress toward idolatry the next step is to imagine that a deity loves his image that he makes it his residence or at least communicates some virtue to it the last step is to imagine the image itself to be a deity which gained ground imperceptibly as statuary advanced toward perfection it would be incredible that men of sense should ever suffer themselves to be impressed with so wild a delusion were it not the overbearing influence of religious superstition credo quia impossible est is applicable to idolatry as well as to transubstantiation the worshipping the sun and moon as deities is idolatry in the strictest sense with respect to images the first step of the progress is not idolatry the next is mixed idolatry and the last is rank idolatry  so much upon idolatry i proceed to what approaches the nearest to it which is worship addressed to deified mortals the ancient gods were exalted so little above men that it was no hard task for the imagination to place in heaven men who had made a figure on earth the grecian heaven was entirely peopled with such men as well as that of many other nations men are deified every day by the romish church under the denomination of saints persons are frequently selected for that honor who scarce deserved a place on earth and some who never had a place there the roman catholics copy the pagans in worshipping these subordinate divinities by prayers and oblations and they are well rewarded by being taken under protection of these saints in quality of tutelar deities one branch of the office bestowed on these saints is to explain the wants of their votaries to the king of heaven and to supplicate for them the mediatorial office prevails with respect to earthly potentates as well as heavenly being struck with awe and timidity in approaching those exalted above us we naturally take hold of some intermediate person to solicit for us in approaching the almighty the mind sinking down into humility and profound veneration stops short relying upon some friend in heaven to intercede in its behalf temples among the cochinchinese are constructed with a deep and dark niche which is their sanctum sanctorum they hold that no representation whether by painting or sculpture can be made of god who is invisible the niche denotes his incomprehensibility and the good men placed by them in heaven are believed to be their intercessors at the throne of grace the prayers of the chingulese are seldom directed to the supreme being but to his vicegerents intercessors at the same time contribute to the ease of their votaries a roman catholic need not assume a very high tone in addressing a tutelar saint chosen by himself  false notions of providence have prompted grovelling mortals to put confidence in mediators and intercessors of a still lower class viz living mortals who by idle austerities have acquired a reputation for holiness take the following instance the strongest of the kind that can be figured louis xi of france sensible of the approach of death sent for a hermit of calabria named francisco martarillo and throwing himself at the hermits feet in a flood of tears entreated him to intercede with god that his life might be prolonged as if the voice of a calabrian friar says voltaire could alter the course of providence by preserving a weak and perverse soul in a wornout body  having discussed the persons that are the objects of worship the next step in order is to take under view the forms and ceremonies employed in religious worship forms are necessary wherever a number of persons join in one operation they are essential in an army and little less essential at public worship the use of ceremonies is to excite devotion but to preserve a just medium requires great delicacy of taste for though ceremonies are necessary at public worship to prevent languor yet superfluity of ceremonies quenches devotion by occupying the mind too much upon externals the romancatholic worship is crowded with ceremonies it resembles the italian opera which is all sound and no sentiment the presbyterian form of worship is too naked it is proper for philosophers more than for the populace this is fundamentally the cause of the numerous secessions from the church of scotland that have made a figure of late people dislike the established forms when they find less comfort in public worship than is expected and without being sensible of the real cause they choose pastors for themselves who supply the want of ceremonies by loud speaking with much external fervor and devotion  the frequent ablutions or washings among the mahometans and others as acts of devotion show the influence that the slightest resemblances have on the ignorant because purification in several languages is a term applicable to the mind as well as to the body shallow thinkers misled by the double meaning imagine that the mind like the body is purified by water  the sect of ali use the alcoran translated into the persian language which is their native tongue the sect of omar esteem this to be a gross impiety being persuaded that the alcoran was written in arabic by the angel gabriel at the command of god himself the roman catholics are not then the only people who profess to speak nonsense to god almighty or which is the same who profess to pray in an unknown tongue  at meals the ancients poured out some wine as a libation to the gods christians pronounce a short prayer termed a grace  the gross notion of deity entertained by the ancients is exemplified in their worshipping and sacrificing on high places in order as they thought to be more within sight jupiter in homer praises hector for sacrificing to him frequently upon the top of ida and strabo observes that the persians who used neither images nor altars sacrificed to the gods in high places balak carried balaam the prophet to the top of pisgah and other mountains to sacrifice there and to curse israel the votaries of baal always worshipped in high places even the sage tacitus was infected with that absurdity speaking of certain high mountains where the gods were worshipped he expresses himself thus maxim coelo appropinquare precesque mortalium a deo nusquam propius audiri as approaching nearer to heaven the prayers of mortals are there more distinctly heard   ceremonies that tend to unhinge morality belong more properly to the following section treating of the connection between religion and morality  it is now full time to take under consideration an objection to the sense of deity hinted above arguing from the gross conceptions of deity among many nations that this sense cannot be innate the objection is not indeed stated in the following passage borrowed from a justly celebrated author but as it may be implied the passage shall be fairly transcribed the universal propensity to believe invisible intelligent power being a general attendant on human nature if not an original instinct may be considered as a kind of stamp which the deity has set upon his work and nothing surely can more dignify mankind than to be the only earthly being who bears the stamp or image of the universal creator but consult this image as it commonly is in popular religions how is the deity disfigured what caprice absurdity and immorality are attributed to him natural history of religion  a satisfactory answer to the objection implied in this passage will occur upon recollecting the progress of men and nations from infancy to maturity our external senses necessary for selfpreservation soon arrive at perfection the more refined senses of propriety of right and wrong of deity of being accountable creatures and many others of the same kind are of slower growth the sense of right and wrong in particular and the sense of deity seldom reach perfection but by good education and much study if such be the case among enlightened nations what is to be expected from savages who are in the lowest stage of understanding to a savage of new holland whose sense of deity is extremely obscure one may talk without end of a being who created the world and who governs it by wise laws but in vain for the savage will be never the wiser the same savage has also a glimmering of the moral sense as all men have and yet in vain will you discourse to him of approbation and disapprobation of merit and demerit of these terms he has no clear conception hence the endless aberrations of rude and barbarous nations from pure religion as well as from pure morality of the latter there are many instances collected in the preceding tract and of the former instances still more plentiful in the present tract the sense of deity in dark times has indeed been strangely distorted by certain biasses and passions that enslave the rude and illiterate but these yield gradually to the rational faculty as it ripens and at last leave religion free to sound philosophy then it is that men listening to the innate sense of deity purified from every bias acquire a clear conviction of one supreme deity who made and governs the world  the foregoing objection then impartially considered weighs not against the sense of deity more than against the moral sense if it have weight it resolves into a complaint against providence for the weakness of the sense of deity in rude and illiterate nations if such complaint be solidly founded it pierces extremely deep why have not all nations even in their nascent state the sense of deity and the moral sense in purity and perfection why do they not possess all the arts of life without necessity of culture or experience why are we born poor and helpless infants instead of being produced complete in every member internal and external as adam and eve were the plan of providence is far above the reach of our weak criticisms i shall only observe that as with respect to individuals there is a progress from infancy to maturity so there is a similar progress in every nation from its savage state to its maturity in arts and sciences a child that has just conceptions of the deity and of his attributes would be a great miracle and would not such knowledge in a savage be equally so nor can i discover what benefit a child or a savage could reap from such knowledge provided it remained a child or a savage in every other respect the genuine fruits of religion are gratitude to the author of our being veneration to him as the supreme being absolute resignation to the established laws of his providence and cheerful performance of every duty but a child has not the slightest idea of gratitude nor of veneration and very little of moral duties and a savage with respect to these is not much superior to a child the formation and government of the world as far as we know are excellent we have great reason to presume the same with respect to what we do not know and every good man will rest satisfied with the following reflection that we should have been men from the hour of our birth complete in every part had it been conformable to the system of unerring providence  sect ii morality considered as a branch of duty to our maker having traveled long on a rough road not a little fatiguing the agreeable part lies before us which is to treat of morality as a branch of religion it was that subject which induced me to undertake the history of natural religion a subject that will afford salutary instruction and will inspire true piety if instruction can produce that effect  bail starts a question whether a people may not be happy in society and be qualified for good government upon principles of morality singly without any sense of religion the question is ingenious and may give opportunity for subtle reasoning but it is useless because the fact supposed cannot happen the principles of morality and of religion are equally rooted in our nature they are indeed weak in children and in savages but they grow up together and advance toward maturity with equal steps wherever the moral sense is in perfection a sense of religion cannot be wanting and if a man who has no sense of religion live decently in society he is more indebted for his conduct to good temper than to sound morals  we have the authority of the prophet micah formerly quoted for holding that religion or in other words our duty to god consists in doing justice in loving mercy and in walking humbly with him the last is the foundation of religious worship discussed in the foregoing section the two former belong to the present head and if we have gratitude to our maker and benefactor if we owe implicit obedience to his will as our rightful sovereign we ought not to separate the worship we owe to him from justice and benevolence to our fellow creatures for to be unjust to them to be cruel or hardhearted is a transgression of his will no less gross than a total neglect of religious worship master which is the great commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets matthew xxii     then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you for i was hungry and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me sick and ye visited me in prison and ye came unto me then shall the righteous answer saying lord when saw we thee hungry and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer verily i say unto you in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me matthew xxv     pure religion and undefiled before god is this to visit the fatherless and widow in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world james i     hostias et victimas domino offeram quas in usum mei protulit ut rejiciam ei suum munus ingratum est cum sit litabilis hostia bonus animus et pura mens et sincera conscientia igitur qui innocentiam colit domino supplicat qui justitiam deo libat qui fraudibus abstinet propitiat deum qui hominem periculo subripit optimam victimam caedit haec nostra sacrificia haec dei sacra sunt sic apud nos religiosior est ille qui justior shall i offer to god for a sacrifice those creatures which his bounty has given me for my use it were ingratitude to throw back the gift upon the giver the most acceptable sacrifice is an upright mind an untainted conscience and an honest heart the actions of the innocent ascend to god in prayer the observance of justice is more grateful than incense the man who is sincere in his dealings secures the favor of his creator and the delivery of a fellow creature from danger or destruction is dearer in the eyes of the almighty than the sacrifice of blood minucius foelix  the laws of zaleucus lawgiver to the locrians who lived before the days of pythagoras are introduced with the following preamble no man can question the existence of deity who observes the order and harmony of the universe which cannot be the production of chance men ought to bridle their passions and to guard against every vice god is pleased with no sacrifice but a sincere heart and differs widely from mortals whose delight are splendid ceremonies and rich offerings let justice therefore be studied for by that only can a man be acceptable to the deity let those who are tempted to do ill have always before their eyes the severe judgments of the gods against wicked men let them always keep in view the hour of death that fatal hour which is attended with bitter remorse for transgressing the rules of justice if a bad disposition incline you to vice pray to heaven at the foot of the altar to mend your heart  morality is thus included in religion some nations however leave not this proposition to reasoning or conviction but ingross many moral duties in their religious creed in the   th chapter of the sadder a lie is declared to be a great sin and is discharged even where it tends to bring about good so much purer is the morality of the ancient persians than of the present jusuits the religion of the people of pegu inculcates charity forbids to kill to steal or to injure others attend to the consequence that people fierce originally have become humane and compassionate in a sacred book of the ancient persians it is written if you incline to be a saint give good education to your children for their virtuous actions will be imputed to you the people of japan pay great respect to their parents it being an article in their creed that those who fail in duty to their parents will be punished by the gods in these two instances religion tends greatly to connect parents and children in the most intimate tie of cordial affection the reverence the chinese have for their ancestors and the ceremonies performed annually at their tombs tend to keep them at home and prevent their wandering into foreign countries  superstitious rites in some religions are successfully employed to enforce certain moral duties the romans commonly made their solemn covenants in the capitol before the statue of jupiter by which solemnity he was understood to guarantee the covenant ready to pour out vengeance upon the transgressor the burates a people in grand tartary have a custom which is to demand an oath upon a mountain held to be sacred they are firmly persuaded that the person who swears a falsehood will not come down alive the essenes a jewish sect bound themselves by a solemn oath to shun unlawful gain to be faithful to their promises not to lie and never to harm any one in cochinchina the souls of those who have been eminent for arts or arms are worshipped their statues are placed in the temples and the size of a statue is proportioned to the merit of the person represented if that custom be executed with candor there cannot be a nobler incitement to public spirit the egyptians did not reach the thought of honoring virtue after death but they dishonored vice by prohibiting it from the elysian fields  the salutary influence of religion on morality is not confined to pure religion whether by its connection with morality in general or by inculcating particular moral duties there are many religious doctrines doubtful or perhaps erroneous that contribute also to enforce morality some followers of confucius ascribe immortality to the souls only of the just and believe that the souls of the wicked perish with their bodies in the second chapter of the sadder it is written that a man whose good works are more numerous than his sins will go to paradise otherwise that he will be thrust into hell there to remain for ever it adds that a bridge erected over the great abyss where hell is situated leads from this earth to paradise that upon the bridge there stands an angel who weighs in a balance the merits of the passengers that the passenger whose good works are found light in the balance is thrown over the bridge into hell but that the passenger whose good works preponderate proceeds in his journey to paradise where there is a glorious city gardens rivers and beautiful virgins whose looks are a perpetual feast but who must not be enjoyed in the fourth chapter of the sadder good works are zealously recommended in the following parable zeradusht or zoroaster being in company with god saw a man in hell who wanted his right foot oh my creator said zoroaster who is that man who wants the right foot god answered he was the king of thirtythree cities reigned many years but never did any good except once when seeing a sheep tied where it could not reach its food he with his right foot pushed the food to it upon which account that foot was saved from hell in japan those of the sinto religion believe that the souls of good men are translated to a place of happiness next to the habitation of their gods but they admit no place of torment nor have they any notion of a devil but what animates the fox a very mischievous animal in that country what then becomes of the souls of ill men being denied entrance into heaven they wander about to expiate their sins those of the bubsdo religion believe that in the other world there is a place of misery as well as of happiness of the latter there are different degrees for different degrees of virtue and yet far from envying the happier lot of others every inhabitant is perfectly satisfied with his own there are also different degrees of misery for justice requires that every man be punished according to the nature and number of his sins jemma o is the severe judge of the wicked their vices appear to him in all their horror by means of a mirror named the mirror of knowledge when souls have expiated their sins after suffering long in the prison of darkness they are sent back into the world to animate serpents toads and such vile animals as resembled them in their former existence from these they pass into the bodies of more innocent animals and at last are again suffered to enter human bodies after the dissolution of which they run the same course of happiness or misery as at first the people of benin in africa believe a mans shadow to be a real being that gives testimony after death for or against him and that he accordingly is made happy or miserable in another world a religious belief in ancient greece that the souls of those who are left above ground without rites have no access to elysium tended to promote humanity for those who are careful of the dead will not be altogether indifferent about the living  immense are the blessings that men in society reap from the union of pure religion with sound morality but however immense i boldly affirm that they scarce counterbalance the manifold evils that society has suffered from impure religion indulging and even encouraging gross immoralities a few of the most glaring instances shall be selected the first i shall mention is the holding religion to consist in the belief of points purely speculative such as have no relation to good works the natural effect of that doctrine is to divorce religion from morality in manifest contradiction to the will of god what avails it for example to the glory of god or to the happiness of mankind whether the conception of the virgin mary was maculate or immaculate the following few instances taken out of a large heap are controversies of that kind which miserably afflicted the christian church for ages and engendered the bitterest enmity raging with destruction and slaughter among brethren of the same religion in the fifth century it was the employment of more than one general council to determine whether the mother of god or the mother of christ is the proper epithet of the virgin mary in the sixth century a bitter controversy arose whether christs body was corruptible in the seventh century christians were divided about the volition of christ whether he had one or two wills and how his will operated in the eighth and ninth centuries the greek and latin churches divided about the holy ghost whether he proceeded from the father and son or only from the father in the eleventh century there arose a warm contest between the greek and latin churches about using unleavened bread in the eucharist in the fourteenth century it was controverted between pope john xxii and the divines of his time whether souls in their intermediate state see god or only the human nature of christ franciscans have suffered death in multitudes about the form of their hood it was disputed between the dominicans and franciscans whether christ had any property the pope pronounced the negative proposition to be a pestilential and blasphemous doctrine subversive of catholic faith many councils were held at constantinople to determine what sort of light it was that the disciples saw on mount tabor it was solemnly pronounced to be the eternal light with which god is encircled and which may be termed his energy or operation but is distinct from his nature and essence a heap of propositions in the creed of st athanasius as far as intelligible are merely speculative such as may be adopted or rejected without the least danger to religion or to morality and yet we are commanded to believe every one of them under the pain of eternal damnation an endless number of such propositions adopted by the romish church clearly evince that christianity was in that church held to consist entirely in belief without any regard to good works the great weight that was laid upon orthodoxy appears from a triumphal arch erected over the tomb of charlemagne upon which was the following inscription here lies the body of charles a great and orthodox emperor  whether the alcoran was eternal or whether it was created is a dispute that has occasioned much effusion of mohammedan blood the calif mamoun with many doctors held it to have been created but the greater number insisted that being the word of god it must like him be eternal this opinion is embraced by the present mahometants who hold all who deny it to be infidels there is among men great uniformity of opinion in matters of importance religious differences are generally about trifles where liberty ought to be indulged without reserve elements of criticism vol   p     edit    and yet upon these trifles are founded the bitterest enmities it ought therefore to be a fundamental law in every church to abstain from loading its creed with articles that are not essential for such articles tend to eradicate brotherly love and to convert into bitter enemies men who are fundamentally of the same faith  in the next place shall be mentioned certain articles of faith that tend to sap the very foundation of one or other moral duty what for example can more effectually promote cruelty than the creed of the idaans a people in the island of borneo that every person they put to death must attend them as a slave in the other world this belief makes them prone to war and occasions assassinations without end according to the creed of the savages in canada the killing and burning enemies are what chiefly entitle them to be happy in another world and that he who destroys the greatest number will be the most happy at the same time they have no notion of greater happiness there than plenty of game great abundance of all things without labor and full gratification of every sensual appetite the scandinavians had no notion of greater bliss in another world than to drink beer out of the skull of an enemy in the hall of woden their tutelar deity can hatred and revenge in this world be more honorably rewarded the doctrine of tutelar deities is equally productive of hatred and revenge relying on a superior power who espouses all my quarrels i put no bounds to my resentment and every moral duty in opposition is trampled under foot the following creed of the inhabitants of the marian or ladrone islands is a great encouragement to cowardice heaven according to that creed is a region under the earth filled with cocoatrees sugarcanes and variety of other delicious fruits hell is a vast furnace constantly red hot their condition in the other world depends not on good or bad actions but on the manner of their death those who die a natural death go straight to heaven they may sin freely if they can but secure their persons against violence but war and bloodshed are their aversion because those who suffer a violent death go straight to hell in many ancient nations a goddess was worshipped whose province it was to promote animal love without regard to matrimony that goddess was in greece termed aphrodite in rome venus and in babylon militta to her was sacrificed in some countries the virginity of young women which it was believed did secure their chastity for ever after justin mentions a custom in the island of cyprus of sending young women at stated times to the seashore where they prostituted themselves as a tribute to venus that they might be chaste the rest of their lives his words are pro reliqua pudicitiae libamenta veneri soluturas lib    cap    in other nations a small number only were prostituted in order to secure to the remainder a chaste and regular life this explains a custom among the babylonians which far from being thought a religious act is held as a proof of abandoned debauchery the custom was that every woman once in her life should prostitute herself in the temple of the goddess mylitta herodotus reports that thereby they became proof against all temptation and aelian observes the same of the lydian ladies credat judaeus apella margaret poretta who in the fourteenth century made a figure among the beguines preached a doctrine not a little favorable to incontinence she undertook to demonstrate that the soul when absorbed in the love of god is free from the restraint of law and may freely gratify every natural appetite without contracting guilt a cordial doctrine for a lady of pleasure that crazy person instead of being laughed at was burnt alive at paris in the fifteenth century a sect termed brethren and sisters of the free spirit held that modesty is a mark of inhering corruption and that those only are perfect who can behold nakedness without emotion these fanatics appeared at public worship without the least covering many tenets professed by the jesuits open a door to every immorality persons truly wicked and void of the love of god may expect eternal life in heaven provided only they be impressed with fear of divine anger and avoid heinous crimes through the dread of future punishment again persons may transgress with safety who have a probable reason for transgressing such as any plausible argument a judge for example may decide for the least probable side of a question and even against his own opinion provided he be supported by any tolerable authority again actions intrinsically evil and contrary to divine law may however be innocently performed by those who can join even ideally a good end to the performance for example an ecclesiastic may safely commit simony by purchasing a benefice if to the unlawful act he join the innocent purpose of procuring to himself a subsistence a man who runs another through the body for a slight affront renders the action lawful if his motive be honor not revenge a famous jesuit taught that a young man may wish the death of his father and even rejoice at his death provided the wish proceed not from hatred but from fondness of his fathers estate and another jesuit has had the effrontery to maintain that a monk may lawfully assassinate a calumniator who threatens to charge his order with scandalous practices  a doctrine that strikes at the root of every moral duty as well as of religion itself is that god will accept of a composition for sin a doctrine that prevailed universally during the days of ignorance compositions for crimes were countenanced by law in every country historical law tracts tract    and men prone to indulge their passions flattered themselves that they might compound with god for sinning against him as with their neighbors for injuring them those who have no notion of any motive but interest naturally think it to be equally powerful with the deity an opinion prevailed universally in the christian church from the eighth century down to the reformation that liberal donations to god to a saint to the church would procure pardon even for the grossest sins during that period the building churches and monasteries was in high vogue this absurd or rather impious doctrine proved a plentiful harvest of wealth to the clergy for the great and opulent who are commonly the boldest sinners have the greatest ability to compound for their sins there needs nothing but such an opinion to annihilate every duty whether moral or religious for what wicked man will think either of restitution or of reformation who can purchase a pardon from heaven with so little trouble louis xi of france was remarkably superstitious even in a superstitious age to ingratiate himself with the virgin mary he surrendered to her the county of boulogne with great solemnity voltaire remarks that godliness consists not in making the virgin a countess but in abstaining from sin composition for sins is a doctrine of the church of rome boldly professed without disguise a book of rates published by authority of the pope contains stated prices for absolutions not excepting the most heinous sins that men are capable to commit so true is the observation of aeneas silvius afterward pope paul ii nihil est quod absque argento romana curia det ipsa manuum impositio et spiritus sancti dona venduntur nec peccatorum venia nisi nummatis impenditur there is nothing to be obtained from the court of rome but by the force of money even the ceremony of consecration and the gifts of the holy ghost are sold and the remission of sins is bestowed only on those who can pay for it  of all the immoral atonements for sin human sacrifices are the most brutal deviating no less from the purity of religion than from the fundamental principles of morality they wore out of use as kindly affections prevailed and will never again be restored unless we fall back to the savage manners of our forefathers composition for crimes once universal is now banished from every enlightened nation composition for sins was once equally universal and i wish it could be said that there are now no remains of that poisonous opinion among christians the practice of the church of rome will not permit it to be said were men deeply convinced as they ought to be that sincere repentance and reformation of manners are the only means for obtaining pardon they would never dream of making bargains with the almighty and of compounding with him for their sins  in the practice of religion the laying too great weight on forms ceremonies and other external arbitrary acts has an unhappy tendency on morality that error has infected every religion the sadder the bible of the gaures prohibits calumny and detraction lying stealing adultery and fornication it however enervates morality and religion by placing many trifling acts on a level with the most important duties it enjoins the destruction of five kinds of reptiles frogs mice ants serpents and flies that sting it teaches that to walk barefoot profanes the ground great regard for water is enjoined it must not be used during the night and when set upon the fire a third part of the pot must be empty to prevent boiling over the bramins have woefully degenerated from their original institutions thinking at present that religion consists in forms and ceremonies as soon as an infant is born the word oum must be pronounced over it otherwise it will be eternally miserable its tongue must be rubbed with consecrated meal the third day of the moon it must be carried into open air with its head to the north the inhabitants of formosa believe in hell but it is only for punishing those who fail to go naked in certain seasons or who wear cotton instead of silk in the time of ghenhizcan it was held in tartary a mortal sin to put a knife into the fire to whip a horse with his bridle or to break one bone with another and yet these pious tartars held treachery robbery murder to be no sins a faction in aegina a greek commonwealth treacherously assassinated seven hundred of their fellowcitizens they cut off the hands of a miserable fugitive who had laid hold of the altar for protection in order to murder him without the precincts of the temple their treacherous assassinations made no impression but though they refrained from murder in the temple yet by profaning it with blood says herodotus they offended the gods and contracted inexpiable guilt would one believe that a tribunal was established by charlemagne more horrible than the inquisition itself it was established in westphalia to punish with death every saxon who eat meat in lent the same law was established in flanders and in frenchcounty the beginning of the seventeenth century  listen to a celebrated writer upon that poisonous conceit it is certain that in every religion however sublime many of the votaries perhaps the greatest number will still seek the divine favor not by virtue and good morals which alone can be acceptable to a perfect being but either by frivolous observances by intemperate zeal by rapturous ecstasies or by the belief of mysterious and absurd opinions when the old romans were attacked with a pestilence they never ascribed their sufferings to their vices or dreamed of repentance and amendment they never thought that they were the general robbers of the world whose ambition and avarice made desolate the earth and reduced opulent nations to want and beggary they only created a dictator in order to drive a nail into a door and by that means they thought that they had sufficiently appeased their incensed deity natural history of religion by david hume esquire  thus gradually the essentials of religion wear out of mind by the attention given to forms and ceremonies these intercept and exhaust the whole stock of devotion which ought to be reserved for the higher exercises of religion the neglect or transgression of mere punctilios are punished as heinous sins while sins really heinous are suffered to pass with impunity the jews exalted the keeping their sabbath holy above every other duty and it was the general belief that the strict observance of that day was alone sufficient to atone for every sin the command of resting that day was taken so literally that they would not on that day defend themselves even against an assassin ptolomy son of lagus entered jerusalem on the jewish sabbath in a hostile manner without resistance nor did experience open the eyes of that foolish people xiphilin relating the siege of jerusalem by pompey says that if the jews had not rested on the sabbath pompey would not have been successful every saturday he renewed his batteries and having on that day made a breach he marched into the town without opposition one cannot help smiling at an amsterdam jew who had no check of conscience for breaking open a house and carrying off money and yet being stopped in his flight by the sabbath before he got out of the territory he most piously rested till he was apprehended and led to the gallows nor are the jews to this day cured of that frenzy in some late accountsfrom constantinople a fire broke out in a jews house on saturday rather than profane the sabbath he suffered the flames to spread which occasioned the destruction of five hundred houses and there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and jesus laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god and the ruler of the synagogue with indignation said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day the lord then said thou hypocrite does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering and ought not this woman whom satan has bound be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day luke xiii     we laugh at the jews and we have reason and yet there are many wellmeaning protestants who lay the whole of religion upon punctual attendance at public worship are the roman catholics less superstitious with respect to the place of worship than the jews are with respect to the day of worship in the year    0 some arabians watching an opportunity got into the town of dieu when the gates were opened in the morning they might easily have been expelled by the canon of the citadel but the portuguese governor was obliged to look on without firing a gun being threatened with excommunication if the least mischief should be done to any of the churches the only doctrines inculcated from the romish pulpit down to the reformation were the authority of holy mother church the merit of the saints and their credit in the court of heaven the dignity glory and love of the blessed virgin the efficacy of relics the intolerable fire of purgatory and the vast importance of indulgences relying on such pious acts for obtaining remission of sins all orders of men rushed headlong into vice an ingenious writer pleasantly observes that a croifade was the south sea project of former times by the latter men hoped to gain riches without industry by the former they hoped to gain heaven without repentance amendment of life or sanctity of manners sir david dalrymple a judge in the court of session  nor was there a single attempt to stem the current of immorality for the traffic of indulgences could not but flourish in proportion to the growth of sin and thus was religion set in direct opposition to morality st eloy bishop of noyon in the seventh century and canonized by the church of rome delivers the following doctrine he is a good christian who goes frequently to church who presents his oblations upon the altar who tastes not the fruit of his own industry till part be consecrated to god who when the holy festivals approach lives chastely even with his own wife for several days and who can repeat the creed and the lords prayer redeem then your souls from destruction while you have the means in your power offer presents and tithes to churchmen come more frequently to church humbly implore the patronage of saints if you observe these things you may in the day of judgment go with confidence to the tribunal of the eternal judge and say give to us o lord for we have given unto thee a modern author subjoins a proper observation we see here a very ample description of a good christian in which there is not the least mention of the love of god resignation to his will obedience to his laws nor of justice benevolence nor charity gross ignorance and wretched superstition prevailed so much even in the fourteenth century that people reckoned themselves secure of salvation if at the day of judgment they could show any connection with monks many at the point of death made it their last request to be admitted into the mendicant order or to be interred in their burialplace religion need not associate with morality if such silly practices be sufficient for obtaining the favor of god is this less absurd than the hindostan belief that the water of the ganges has a sanctifying virtue and that those who die on its banks are not only exempted from future punishment but are wafted straight to paradise  forms and ceremonies are visible acts which make a deep impression on the vulgar hence their influence in reasoning and in morality as we have seen in the two sketches immediately foregoing and hence also their influence in religion forms and ceremonies are useful at public worship but they ought not to take place of essentials people however governed by what they see and hear are more addicted to external acts of devotion than to heartworship which is not known but by reflection  it will be no excuse for relying so much on forms and ceremonies that they are innocent in themselves they may be innocent but not so in their consequences for they have by such reliance a violent tendency to relax the obligations of morality religious rites that contradict not any passion are keenly embraced and punctually performed and men flattering themselves that they have thus been punctual in their duty to god give vent to their passions against men they pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin but omit the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith matthew xxiii     upon such a man religion sits extremely light as he seldom exercises any act of genuine devotion he thinks of the deity with ease and familiarity how otherwise is it accountable that the plays termed mysteries could be relished where mean and perhaps dissolute persons are brought on the stage acting jesus christ the virgin mary and even god himself these divine persons were certainly not more regarded than the grecian gods who frequently made part of the dramatis personae in greek plays many other facts might be urged to prove the low ebb of religion in those days i select one or two which probably will afford some amusement to the reader bartolus the famous lawyer in order to show the form of proceeding in a court of justice imagines a process between the devil and mankind the devil cites mankind to appear at the tribunal of jesus christ claiming them as belonging to him by adams fall he swells in rage demanding whether any one dares appear in their behalf against the virgin mary offering herself as their advocate the devil makes two objections first that being the mother of the judge her influence would be too great second that a woman is debarred from being an advocate and these objections are supported by numberless quotations from the corpus juris the virgin on her part quotes texts permitting women to appear for widows orphans and for persons in distress she is allowed to plead for mankind as coming under the last article the devil urges prescription as having been in possession of mankind ever since the fall the virgin answers that a malafide possessor cannot acquire by prescription prescription being repelled the parties go to the merits of the cause which are learnedly discussed with texts from the pandects the memoirs of the french academy of belles letters vol    have the following story a monk returning from a house which he durst not visit in daylight had a river to cross the boat was overturned by satan and the monk was drowned when he was beginning to invocate the virgin mary two devils having laid hold of his soul were stopped by two angels my lords said the devils true it is and not a fable that god died for his friends but this monk was an enemy to god and we are carrying him to hell after much altercation it was proposed by the angels to refer the dispute to the virgin mary the devils were willing to accept of god for judge because he would judge according to law but from the virgin mary said they we expect no justice she would break to atoms every gate of hell rather than suffer one to remain there a moment who pays any worship to her image she may say that black is white and that puddled water is pure  god never contradicts her the day on which god made his mother was a fatal day to us  people who profess the same religion and differ only in forms and ceremonies may justly be compared to neighboring states who are commonly bitter enemies to each other if they have any difference at the same time dissocial passions never rage so furiously as under the mask of religion for in that case they are held to be meritorious as exerted in the cause of god this observation is but too well verified in the disputes among christians however low religion was in the dark ages yet men fought for forms and ceremonies as pro aris et focis in the armenian form of baptism the priest says at the first immersion in name of the father at the second in name of the son at the third in name of the holy ghost this form is bitterly condemned by the romish church which appoints the three persons of the trinity to be joined in the same expression in token of their union strahlenberg gives an account of a christian sect in russia which differs from the established greek church in the following particulars first in public worship they repeat halleluia but twice and it is a mortal sin to repeat it thrice second in celebrating mass not five but seven loaves ought to be used third the cross stamped upon a massloaf ought to have eight corners fourth in signing with the cross at prayers the end of the ringfinger must be joined to the end of the thumb and the two intermediate fingers be held out at full length how trifling are these differences and yet for such differences all who dissent from them are held unclean and no better than pagans they will not eat nor drink with any of the established church and if a person of that church happen to sit down in a house of theirs they wash and purify the seat christians occupied too much with external forms have corrupted several of the fine arts they have injured architecture by erecting magnificent churches in the ugly form of a cross and they have injured painting by withdrawing the best hands from proper subjects and employing them on the legendary martyrdom of pretended saints and other such disagreeable stories  there are few sects founded upon more triival differences than the turkish and persian mahometans the epithets given to the persians by the turks are forsaken of god abominable blasphemers of the holy prophet and so bitter is their enmity to the persians that the schools of the seraglio are open to young men of all nations those of persia alone excepted the persians are held to be such apostates from the true faith as to be utterly past recovery they receive no quarter in war being accounted unworthy of life or slavery nor do the persians yield to the turks in hatred whether coffee be or be not prohibited in the alcoran has produced much controversy in the mohammedan church and consequently much persecuting zeal a mufti not fond of coffee declared it like wine to have an inebriating quality and therefore was virtually prohibited by mahomet another mufti fond of coffee for its exhilarating virtue declared it lawful because said he all things are lawful that are not expressly prohibited in the alcoran the coffeehouses in constantinople were for a long period alternately opened and shut according to the taste of the reigning mufti till coffee at last surmounting all obstacles came to be an established mohammedan liquor religion thus runs wild whenever it loses sight of its true ends that of worshipping god and that of being just to man the hindows hate the mahometans for eating the flesh of cows the mahometans hate the hindows for eating the flesh of swine the aversion that men of the same religion have at each other for the most trivial differences converts them frequently into brutal savages suppose for example that a poor man reduced to the extremity of hunger makes a greedy meal of a dead horse a case so deplorable would wring every heart and yet let this be done in lent or on a meagre day  behold every zealot is instantly metamorphosed into a devil incarnate in the records of st claude a small district of burgundy is engrossed a sentence against a poor gentleman named claude guillon the words are having considered the process and taken advice of the doctors of law we declare the said claude guillon duly convicted for having carried away and boiled a piece of a dead horse and of having eat the same on the   st march being saturday and he was beheaded accordingly   th july      notwithstanding a defense above all exception that he committed that irregularity to preserve his life how was it possible for the monsters to persuade themselves that this sentence was agreeable to god who is goodness itself  no less prejudicial to morality than the relying too much on forms and ceremonies is the treating some sins with great severity neglecting others equally heinous or perhaps more so in a book of rates for absolution mentioned above no just distinction is made among sins some venial sins being taxed at a higher rate than many of the deepest dye for example the killing father mother brother sister or wife is taxed at five gross and the same for incest with a mother or sister the lying with a woman in the church is taxed at six gross and at the same time absolution for usury is taxed at seven gross and for simony at no less than sixteen gross a gross is the third part of a ducat   a maxim adopted by many pious persons has a smiling appearance but in its consequences is hurtful both to religion and morality which is that to testify our veneration for the deity and zeal for his service the performing public and private worship and the fulfilling moral duties are not alone sufficient that over and above we are bound to fast to do penance to honor the priesthood and to punish the enemies of god i e those who differ from us in principles or practice this maxim which may be termed the doctrine of supererogation is finely illustrated by an author mentioned above the duties which a man performs as a friend or parent seem merely owing to his benefactor or children nor can he be wanting to these duties without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality a strong inclination may prompt him to the performance a sentiment of order and moral beauty joins its force to these natural ties and the whole man is drawn to his duty without any effort or endeavor even with regard to the virtues which are more austere and more founded on reflection such as public spirit filial duty temperance or integrity the moral obligation in our apprehension removes all pretense to religious merit and the virtuous conduct is esteemed no more than what we owe to society and to ourselves in all this a superstitious man finds nothing which he has properly performed for the sake of his deity or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favor and protection he considers not that the most genuine method of serving the divinity is by promoting the happiness of his creatures he still looks out for some more immediate service of the supreme being and any practice recommended to him which either serves to no purpose in life or offers the strongest violence to his natural inclinations that practice he will the more readily embrace on account of those very circumstances which should make him absolutely reject it it seems the more purely religious that it proceeds from no mixture of any other motive or consideration and if for its sake he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers in restoring a loan or paying a debt his divinity is no wise beholden to him because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform and what many would have performed were there no god in the universe but if he fast a day or give himself a sound whipping this has a direct reference in his opinion to the service of god no other motive could engage him to such austerities by these distinguished marks of devotion he has now acquired the divine favor and may expect in recompense protection and safety in this world and eternal happiness in the next natural history of religion  my yoke is easy says our savior and my burden is light so they really are every essential of religion is founded on our nature and to a pure heart is pleasant in the performance what can be more pleasant than gratitude to our maker and obedience to his will in comforting our fellow creatures but enthusiasts are not easily persuaded that to make ourselves happy in the exercises of piety and benevolence is the most acceptable service to god that we can perform in loading religion with unnecessary articles of faith and practice they contradict our savior by making his yoke severe and his burden heavy an old woman walking with others to a sacrament was observed to pick out the worst bits of the road i never can do enough said she for sweet jesus  law upon christian perfection enjoins such unnatural austerity of manners as to be subversive both of religion and morality loose education is not more so our passions when denied their proper exercise are apt to break their fetters and to plunge us into every extravagance like the body which squeezed in one part swells the more in another in the same way of thinking the pious jeremy tailor treating of mortification prescribes it as the indispensable duty of a christian to give no indulgence even to the most innocent emotions because says he the most indifferent action becomes sinful when there is no other motive for the performance but barely its being pleasant could a malevolent deity contrive any thing more severe against his votaries  in the same spirit of supererogation holidays have been multiplied without end depriving the working poor of time that would be more usefully employed in providing bread for themselves and families such a number of holidays beside contradicting providence which framed us more for action than contemplation have several poisonous effects with respect to morality the moral sense has great influence on the industrious who have no time for indulging their irregular appetites the idle on the contrary are obvious to every temptation men likewise are apt to assume great merit from a rigid observance of holidays and other ceremonies and having thus acquired in their opinion the favor of god they rely on his indulgence in other matters which they think too sweet for sinners  monastic institutions are an improvement upon holidays the whole life of a monk is intended to be a holiday dedicated entirely to the service of god the idleness of the monastic state among christians opens a wide door to immorality  in the third section penances are handled as a mode of worship for obtaining pardon of sin but they are sometimes submitted to by the innocent in order to procure from the almighty still more favor than innocence alone is entitled to in which view they are evidently a work of supererogation they seem to have no bad effect with respect to religion as distinguished from morality the body is indeed cruciated unnecessarily but if enthusiasts voluntarily submit to bodily distresses they have themselves only to blame with respect to morality their bad tendency is not slight those who perform extraordinary acts of devotion conceive themselves peculiarly entitled to the favor of god proud of his favor they attach themselves to him alone and turn indifferent about every other duty the favorite of a terrestrial potentate assumes authority and takes liberties that private persons dare not venture upon shall a favorite of heaven be less indulged the faquirs in hindostan submit to dreadful penances and holding themselves secure of gods favor they are altogether indifferent about the duty they owe to their neighbor so much are they above common decency as to go about naked not even concealing what modesty forbids us to expose the penances enjoined in the romish church such as fasting and flagellation have evidently the same bad tendency a sect of christians styled flagellantes held that flagellation is of equal virtue with baptism and the other sacraments that it will procure forgiveness of sin that the old law of christ is to be abolished and a new law substituted enjoining the baptism of blood to be administered by whipping  with respect to fasting in particular to what good purpose it can serve except to gluttons is not readily conceived temperance in eating and drinking is essential to health too much or too little are equally noxious though their effects are different fasting therefore ought never to be enjoined to the temperate as a religious duty because it cannot be acceptable to a benevolent deity listen to a great prophet on that subject behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him will thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou see the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh isaiah lviii   etc   the most extraordinary penance of all is celibacy considered as a religious duty many fathers of the church declare against matrimony st jerome in particular says that the end of matrimony is eternal death that the earth indeed is filled by it but heaven by virginity the intemperate zeal of many primitive christians led them to abstain from matrimony and even from conjugal caresses if they had the misfortune to be married believing that the carnal appetite is inconsistent with pure religion edward the confessor was sainted for no better reason than the abstaining from matrimonial duties jovinian in the fourth century taught that all who observe the laws of piety and virtue laid down in the gospel have an equal title to happiness in another life consequently that those who pass their days in celibacy and mortification are in no respect more acceptable to god than those who live virtuously in marriage without mortification he published his opinions in a book against which jerome wrote a bitter and abusive treatise still extant these opinions were condemned by the church and by st ambrose in a council at milan and jovinian was banished by the emperor honorius such ridiculous selfdenial was not confined to christians strabo mentions a sect among the thracians who made a vow of perpetual virginity and were much respected on that account garcilasso mentions virgins in peru consecrated to the sun a vestal guilty of frailty was buried alive her lover hanged and the inhabitants of the town where she lived put to the sword among all the absurd acts of mortification the present affords the strongest instance of superstition triumphing over common sense for what can be more inconsistent with common sense not to talk of religion than an endeavor to put an end to the human species some glimpses of reason have abated the zeal of enthusiasts for celebacy but have not totally extirpated it for celibacy of the clergy remains to this day a law in the romish church it cannot however seriously be thought the will of our benevolent god that his priests should be denied the exercise of natural powers bestowed on all for a most valuable purpose this impious restraint which contradicts the great law of increase and multiply has opened the door to gross debauchery in the pastors of the romish church though ecclesiastics ought of all men to be the most circumspect in their conduct men restrained from what is necessary and proper are more prone than others to break out into gross irregularities an ingenious writer mentioned above makes the following observation the celibacy of ecclesiastics was originally introduced by some superstitious refinements on the law of god and nature could men have been kept alive without eating or drinking as well as without marriage the same refinements would have prohibited ecclesiastics from eating and drinking and thereby have elevated them so much nearer to the state of angels in process of time this fanatical interdiction became an instrument of worldly wisdom and thus as frequently happens what weak men began politicians completed sir david dalrymple  marriage is warmly recommended in the laws of zoroaster children are said to be a bridge that conducts men to heaven and a man who has no children is held to be under the power of ahriman the prayer of a priest who has no children is held disagreeable to ormusd  the celibacy of the clergy was countenanced by the pope and enforced from a political consideration that it united the whole clergy into one firm body under his spiritual majesty how shortsighted is man it was justly esteemed at the time to be the cornerstone of papal power and yet became the chief cause of its downfall celibacy precipitated the romish clergy into adultery fornication cunning dissimulation and every secret vice will men of such manners be listened to when they preach purity to their hearers there was no medium but either to reform their own manners or to give every indulgence to the laity but the ignorance and superstition of the latter rendered the former secure in their own opinion the restoration of learning broke the charm men beginning to think for themselves were provoked at the dissolute lives of their pastors and raised a loud cry against them not yet thinking of their doctrines reformers were burnt as heretics and clergymen were held to be emissaries from satan to establish his throne upon earth knox that violent reformer believed seriously that cardinal beaton was a conjured enemy to christ jesus providence brings good out of ill had not the clergy been dissolute poor christians might have labored under ignorance and ecclesiastical thraldom to this hour our reformers beginning with their pastors extended insensibly their hatred to the doctrines taught by their pastors every article of faith was sifted the chaff was separated from the corn and a reformation was established upon the scriptures rejecting every innovation of the romish church  there is not mentioned in history a more impudent attack upon moral principles than a privilege assumed by the bishop of rome to disengage men from their oaths and promises it is not a greater stretch to disengage them from every duty whether of morality or of religion the barons of valentia dreading a persecution against the industrious moors their tenants obtained the following clause to be in their kings coronation oath that he should not expel the moriscos nor force them to be baptized that he should never desire to be relieved from the oath by a dispensation from the pope nor accept a dispensation if offered the emperor charles v took this oath solemnly in presence of his nobles and yet accepted a dispensation from the pope absolving him from the oath and from the guilt of perjury in breaking it augustus king of poland in the treaty of altramstadt renounced the kingdom of poland to his competitor stanislaus the defeat of the king of sweden at poltowa was an inviting opportunity to renew his pretensions a solemn treaty stood in his way but the pope removed that obstacle by annulling the treaty and setting him at liberty the pope has been known even to bestow that wonderful privilege upon others pope pascal ii having with a solemn oath renounced the right of investitures empowered the cardinals to declare his oath null bishops also imitating their superior have assumed the privilege of dispensing with moral duties instances are not rare of curates being authorized by their bishop to entertain concubines paying for each a regular tax of a crown yearly nay in some provincial synods they are enjoined to keep concubines in order to prevent scandal common prostitutes licensed in the city of leghorn have a church peculiar to themselves and must not enter into any other they follow their trade with the utmost freedom except in passionweek during which they must forbear sinning under pain of banishment  the power of bestowing kingdoms assumed by the bishop of rome was an encroachment on the rules of justice no less bold christian princes not many ages ago esteemed the popes gift to be their best title of property in the year      the venetians requested the popes permission to carry on commerce in asia and to purchase there pepper and cinnamon the pope not only granted their request but pronounced anathemas upon any who should dare to interfere in that commerce ferdinand and isabella of spain applied to pope alexander vi to vest in them the property of america discovered under their auspices by columbus the pope having formerly made a grant to the kings of portugal of their discoveries in the east indies both grants were held sacred and it came to be strenuously disputed under which of the grants the molucca islands were comprehended both grants proceed upon a narrative of the power bestowed by almighty god on the pope as successor to st peter and vicar of christ to imagine that the almighty would bestow such powers on the bishop of rome or on any human being shows gross ignorance of the common rights of mankind and of the government of providence  the grossest of all deviations not only from sound morality but from pure religion and the most extensive in its baneful effects is a doctrine embraced by established churches not many excepted that because heretics are odious in the sight of god it is the duty of the orthodox to extirpate them root and branch observe the consequence people who differ from the established church are held to be obstinate sinners deserving punishment here as well as hereafter the religion of every country is changeable and the religion at present dominant may soon be under depression which of course subjects all mankind to the rigor of persecution an invention more effectual for extirpating the human race is not within the reach of human powers the horror of human sacrifices is as nothing in comparison  the old romans far from having any notion of persecution adopted the gods of every nation they conquered a learned writer morinus observes that as the number of their gods increased with their conquests it is possible that they might have worshipped all the gods in the world their belief in tutelar deities produced that effect titus livius mentions a sect of bacchanals that spread through italy they performed their ceremonies during night men and women mixing in the dark after intemperate eating and drinking never did wicked wretches deserve more exemplary punishment yet listen to the following decree of the roman senate breathing the true spirit of toleration ne qua bacchanalia romae neve in italia essent si quis tale sacrum solenne et necessarium duceret nec sine religione et piaculo se id omittere posse apud praetorem urbanum profiteretur praetor senatum consuleret si ei permissum esset quum in senatu centum non minus essent ita id sacrum faceret dum ne plus quinque sacrificio interessent neu qua pecunia communis neu quis magister sacrorum aut sacerdos esset let there be no bacchanalian ceremonies performed in the city nor within italy if there be any person who reckons it a matter of conscience to perform these rites and that he ought not to omit them let him state his opinion to the citypraetor who shall thereupon consult the senate if liberty be granted him by the senate when no fewer than a hundred senators are present let him perform the sacrifice but privately in presence of no greater number than five persons let there be no public fund for them nor any who shall preside as priest or master of the rites  the jews however were prone to persecution for though they considered the supreme being as their tutelar deity yet the malignity of their nature prevailed to make them hold in abhorrence the worship of every other god even among themselves they were abundantly disposed to war and nothing kept within bounds the pharisees the sadduces and the essenes their three sects but terror of the roman power the christian religion implies toleration in its very nature and principles but being corrupted by ignorance interest and superstition it became prone to persecution above all others christian sects were enflamed against each other to a degree of brutality the most opposite to peace and brotherly love inculcated in the gospel it was propagated by the orthodox that arius expired in a common jakes and that his entrails burst out the same is related of huneric king of the vandals a zealous arian with the following addition that being possessed with the devil whom he had glutted with the blood of many martyrs he tore his flesh off with his teeth and ended his wretched life in the most excruciating though justly deserved torments the falsehoods every where spread during the fourteenth century against the jews such as their poisoning the public fountains killing christian infants and drinking their blood with many other falsehoods of the same stamp were invented and greedily swallowed through the influence of religious hatred the greater part of persecutions have been occasioned in the same manner for men are not so desperately wicked as to approve of persecution unless when blinded by intemperate zeal the same religious hatred produced the assassination of the duke of guise and of two henrys kings of france produced the gunpowder plot and produced the most horrid deed that ever was perpetrated among men the massacre of st bartholomew monsieur de tavannes afterward marshall of france was a great partisan of the queen mother and so active in the massacre that with his own hand he murdered no fewer than seventeen huguenots having on deathbed made a full confession of his sins what said the priest not a word of st bartholomew of st bartholomew answered the penitent the service i did that memorable day to god and the church is alone a sufficient atonement for all my transgressions   no false principle in religion has shed more innocent or rather virtuous blood than that of persecuting heretics i e those who differ in any article from the religion established by law the doctrine of burning heretics is in effect the professing to burn men highly virtuous for they must be so in an eminent degree who submit to be burnt alive rather than be guilty even of dissimulation the mohammedan practice of converting people by the sword if not more rational is at least more manly louis ix of france one of its best princes would have been a greater blessing to his people had he been less pious he had an implacable aversion to heretics against whom he thought it more proper to employ racks and gibbets than argument and persuasion torquemada that infernal inquisitor of spain brought into the inquisition in the space of fourteen years no fewer than  0000 persons of whom  000 were condemned to the flames and burnt alive with the greatest pomp and exultation of that vast number there was perhaps not a single person who was not more pure in religion as well as in morals than their outrageous persecutor hunter a young man about nineteen years of age was one of the unhappy victims to the zeal of queen mary of england for popery having been inadvertently betrayed by a priest to deny transubstantiation he absconded to keep out of harms way bonner that archhangman of popery threatened ruin to the father if he did not deliver up the young man hunter hearing of his fathers danger made his appearance and was burnt alive instead of being rewarded for his filial piety a woman of guernsey was brought to the stake without regard to her big belly which bursting by the torture she was delivered in the midst of the flames one of the guards snatched the infant from the fire but the magistrate who attended the execution ordered it to be thrown back being resolved he said that nothing should survive which sprung from a parent so obstinately heretical father paul council of trent book   computes that in the netherlands alone from the time that the edict of charles v was promulgated against the reformers fifty thousand persons were hanged beheaded buried alive or burnt on account of religion some faquirs crazed with opium and fanaticism have been known with poisoned daggers to fall upon uncircumcised europeans and to put every one to death whom they could master in the last century a faquir at surate murdered within the space of a minute seventeen dutch sailors with seventeen stabs of a dagger we think with horror of human sacrifices among the ancient pagans and yet we behold them every day among christians rendered still more horrid by the most atrocious torments that religious hatred can devise  the great motive to such cruelties is the superstitious and absurd notion that heretics are gods enemies which makes it thought an acceptable service to god not only to persecute them by fire and sword in this world but to deliver them over to satan in the world to come another circumstance enflames religious hatred which is that neighbors are either intimate friends or bitter enemies this holds with a slight variation in sects of the same religion however minute their differences be they cannot be intimate friends and therefore are bitter enemies the nearer they approach to unison if not entirely concordant the greater in proportion is their mutual natred such hatred subduing the meek spirit of christianity is an additional cause for persecution blind zeal for what is believed to be the only true religion never discovers error nor innocence in those who differ but perverseness and criminal obstinacy two religions totally different like two countries in opposite parts of the globe produce no mutual enmity at the siege of constantinople by the turks ann      the emperor in order to procure assistance from the princes of the latin church ordered mass to be celebrated in one of his churches according to the form used in rome the people with great indignation protested that they would rather see the turks in their churches than the hat of a cardinal  the history of the waldenses though well known cannot be too often repeated in the twelfth century a merchant of lions named peter valdo dissatisfied with the pomp and ceremonies of the romish church ill suited in his opinion to the humility of a christian retired to a desert in the high country of provence with several poor people his disciples there he became their spiritual guide instructing them in certain doctrines the same that were afterward adopted by the protestants their incessant labor subdued the barren soil and prepared it for grain as well as for pasture the rent which in time they were enabled to pay for land that afforded none originally endeared them to their landlords in   0 years they multiplied to the number of   000 occupying thirty villages beside hamlets the work of their own hands priests they had none nor any disputes about religion neither had they occasion for a court of justice as brotherly love did not suffer them to go to law they worshipped god in their own plain way and their innocence was secured by incessant labor they had long enjoyed the sweets of peace and mutual affection when the reformers of germany and geneva sent ministers among them which unhappily laid them open to religious hatred the most unrelenting of all furies in the year    0 the parliament of provence condemned nineteen of them to be burnt for heresy their trees to be rooted up and their houses to be razed to the ground the waldenses terrified at this sentence applied in a body to cardinal sadolet bishop of carpentras who received them kindly and obtained from francis i of france a pardon for the persons under sentence of death on condition of abjuring heresy the matter lay over five years when the parliament irritated at them for persevering in their tenets prevailed on the king to withdraw his pardon the sentence was executed with great rigor and the parliament laying hold of that opportunity broke through every restraint of law and commenced a violent persecution against the whole nation the soldiers began with massacring old men women and children all having fled who were able to fly and proceeded to burn their houses barns and corn there remained in the town of cabriere sixty men and thirty women who having surrendered upon promise of life were butchered each of them without mercy some women who had taken refuge in a church were dragged out and burnt alive twentytwo villages were reduced to ashes and that populous and flourishing district became once more a desert  to conceive this horrid scene in all its deformity the people persecuted ought to be compared with the clergy their persecutors for the civil magistrate was the hand only that executed their vengeance on the one side an industrious people pure in their morals and no less pure in their religion on the other proud pampered priests abandoned without shame to every wickedness impure in their morals and still more impure in their religion  the world never furnished such another contrast had the scene been reversed to make these wretches suffer persecution from the waldenses  but that people were too upright and too religious for being persecutors the manners of the christian clergy in general before the reformation enlivens the contrast the doctrine promulgated during the dark times of christianity that god is a mercenary being and that every person however wicked may obtain pardon of his sins by money made riches flow into the hands of ecclesiastics in a plentiful stream and riches had the same effect upon the christian clergy that they have upon all men which is to produce pride sensuality and profligacy these again produced dissipation of money which prompted avarice and every invention for recruiting exhausted treasures in the eleventh and twelfth centuries many of the clergy dealt in merchandise and being free of taxes engrossed all in the netherlands particularly there was a great cry that monasteries were converted into shops and warehouses and the mansions of secular priests into taphouses and inns  even as early as the eighth century the christian clergy tempted by opulence abandoned themselves to pleasure without moderation and far exceeded the laity in luxury gluttony and lust when such were the pastors what must have been the flock rejoice o scotland over the poverty and temperance of thy pastors during that period the clergy could read and like parrots they could mumble prayers in latin in every other respect they rivalled the laity in ignorance they were indeed more cunning than the laity and understood their interest better if to covet riches at the expense of probity deserve that name three articles were established that made religion an easy service first that faith is the essence of religion without regard to good works and hence the necessity of being strictly orthodox which the church only could determine second religious worship was reduced to a number of external ceremonies and forms which being declared sufficient for salvation absolved christians from every moral duty remark that a priest is always the chief person in ceremonial worship the third article that god is a mercenary being is mentioned above with its necessary consequences these articles brought about a total neglect both in clergy and laity not only of morality but of every essential religious duty in fine there never was a religion that deviated more from just principles than that professed by christians during the dark ages persecution reached none but the sincerely pious and virtuous what a glorious tolerating sentiment does arnobius lib   adversus gentes throw out and what profusion of blood would have been prevented had it been adopted by all christians da veniam rex sum tuos persequentibus famulos et quod tuae benignitatis est proprium fugientibus ignosce tui nominis et religionis cultum non est mirum si ignoraris majoris est admirationis si sciaris forgive almighty power the persecutors of thy servants and in the peculiar benevolence of thy nature pardon those men whose unhappiness it is to be strangers to thy name and worship ignorant as they are of thee we cannot wonder at the impiety of their actions  the following parable against persecution was communicated to me by dr franklin of philadelphia a man who makes a great figure in the learned world and who would make a still greater figure for benevolence and candor were virtue in this declining age as much regarded as knowledge and it came to pass after these things that abraham sat in the door of his tent about the going down of the sun and behold a man bent with age coming from the way of the wilderness leaning on a staff and abraham arose and met him and said unto him turn in i pray thee and wash thy feet and tarry all night and thou shall arise early in the morning and go on thy way and the man said nay for i will abide under this tree but abraham pressed him greatly so he turned and they went into the tent and abraham baked unleavened bread and they did eat and when abraham saw that the man blessed not god he said unto him wherefore do thou not worship the most high god creator of heaven and earth and the man answered and said i do not worship thy god neither do i call upon his name for i have made to myself a god which abides always in mine house and provideth me with all things and abrahams zeal was kindled against the man and he arose and fell upon him and drove him forth with blows into the wilderness and god called unto abraham saying abraham where is the stranger and abraham answered and said lord he would not worship thee neither would he call upon thy name therefore have i driven him out from before my face into the wilderness and god said have i borne with him these hundred ninety and eight years and nourished him and clothed him notwithstanding his rebellion against me and could not thou who art thyself a sinner bear with him one night the historical style of the old testament is here finely imitated and the moral must strike every one who is not sunk in stupidity and superstition were it really a chapter of genesis one is apt to think that persecution could never have shown a bare face among jews or christians but alas that is a vain thought such a passage in the old testament would avail as little against the rancorous passions of men as the following passages in the new testament though persecution cannot be condemned in terms more explicit him that is weak in the faith receive you but not to doubtful disputations for one believes that he may eat all things another who is weak eats herbs let not him that eats despise him that eats not and let not him which eats not judge him that eats who art thou that judge another mans servant to his own master he stands or falls one man esteems one day above another another esteems every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind but why do thou judge thy brother or why do thou set at naught thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ every one to give an account of himself to god i know that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteems any thing unclean to him it is unclean the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another epistle of paul to the romans chap     our savior himself declared against persecution in the most express terms the jews and samaritans were of the same religion but some trivial differences in the ceremonial part of worship rendered them odious to each other our savior being refused lodging in a village of samaria because he was traveling to jerusalem his disciples james and john said lord will thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did but he rebuked them and said the son of man is not come to destroy means lives but to save them luke ix      it gives me real concern that even the hot fire of persecution did not altogether purify our reformed clergy from that satanical spirit no sooner were the dissenters settled in new england where they fled to avoid persecution than they set on foot a persecution against the quakers no less furious than what they themselves had suffered at home nor did the reformed clergy in scotland lose sight of that magisterial authority which had been assumed by their predecessors of the romish church on the ridiculous pretext of being ambassadors to men from jesus christ upon a representation ann      from the commission of the kirk of scotland james bell and colin campbell bailies of glasgow were committed to prison by the parliament merely for having said that kirkmen meddled too much in civil matters could a despotic prince have exerted a more arbitrary act but the church was allpowerful in those days toleration in religion though obvious to common understanding was not however the production of reason but of commerce the advantage of toleration for promoting commerce was discovered long before by the portuguese they were too zealous catholics to venture so bold a measure in portugal but it was permitted in goa and the inquisition in that town was confined to roman catholics   i would do justice to every church not excepting that of rome and it is doing that church no more but justice to acknowledge that the spirit of persecution was not more eminent in it than zeal for making converts the former is retiring out of the world and i wish it most profound rest never again to revive people begin to be ashamed of it as of a garment long out of fashion let the other continue for amusement it is innocent and if it do no good it is not productive of so much harm  the desire of making converts proceeds from two different causes in superstitious zealots it proceeds from an opinion that all who differ from them are in the road to damnation for which reason there is a rage of making converts among roman catholics who without ceremony deliver over to the flames of hell every person who is not of their communion the other cause is more natural every man thinks himself in the right especially in matters of consequence and for that reason he is happy to find others of his opinion elements of criticism vol   p     edit    with respect to the first cause i beg attention to the following considerations not with any hope of converting zealots but to prevent if possible others from becoming such in none of the works of god is variety more happily blended with uniformity than in the formation of man uniformity prevails in the human face with respect to eyes nose mouth and other capital parts variety prevails in the expressions of these parts serving to distinguish one person from another without hazard of error in like manner the minds of men are uniform with respect to their passions and principles but the various tones and expressions of these form different characters without end a face destitute of a nose or of a mouth is monstrous a mind destitute of the moral sense or of a sense of religion is no less so but variety of expression in different faces is agreeable because we relish variety and a similar variety in the expressions or tones of passion ought to be equally agreeable endless differences in temper in taste and in mental faculties that of reason in particular produce necessarily variety in sentiment and in opinion can god be displeased with such variety when it is his own work he requires no uniformity except with respect to an upright mind and clear conscience which are indispensable here at the same time is discovered an illustrious final cause different countenances in the human race not only distinguish one person from another but promote society by aiding us to choose a friend an associate a partner for life differences in opinion and sentiment have still more beneficial effects they rouse the attention give exercise to the understanding and sharpen the reasoning faculty with respect to religion in particular perfect uniformity which furnishes no subject for thinking nor for reasoning would produce languor in divine worship and make us sink into cold indifference how frantic then is the rage of making proselytes let every man enjoy his native liberty of thinking as well as of acting free to act as he pleases provided he obey the rules of morality equally free to think as he pleases provided he obey the great god as his maker and master and acknowledge the necessary connection of religion with morality strict uniformity in other matters may be compared to a springday calm and serene neither so hot as to make us drop a garment nor so cold as to require an addition no wind to ruffle nor rain to make shelter necessary we enjoy the sweet scene for a moment we walk we sit we muse  but soon fall asleep agitation is the element of man and the life of society let us not attempt to correct the works of god the attempt will betray us into absurd errors this doctrine cannot be better illustrated than by a conversation reported by the jesuit tachard between the king of siam and a french ambassador who in his masters name urged that king to embrace the christian religion i am surprised said his majesty of siam that the king of france my good friend should interest himself so warmly in what concerns god only he has given to his creatures different minds and different inclinations which naturally lead them two differ in opinion we admire variety in the material world why not equally admire it in matters of religion have we not then reason to believe that god takes pleasure in all the different forms of worship had it been the intention of god to produce uniformity in religion he would have formed all men with the same mind bernier introduces some gentiles of hindostan defending their religion much in the same manner that they did not pretend their law to be universal that they did not hold ours to be false as for aught they knew it might be a good law for us and that god probably made many roads to heaven  with respect to the other cause above mentioned viz the desire of putting people in the right road to reason others into our religious principles is natural but it is not always prudent i wish my neighbor to be of my opinion because i think my opinion right but is there no danger of undermining his religious principles without establishing better in their stead ought i not to restrain my desire of making converts when the attempt may possibly reduce them to abandon religion altogether as a matter of utter uncertainty if a man of clear understanding has by some unhappy means been led into error that man may be set right by fair reasoning but beware of endeavoring to convert people of low parts who are indebted for their creed to parents to education or to example it is safer to let them rest as they are  at any rate let us never attempt to gain proselytes by rewards nor by terror what other effect can such motives produce but dissimulation and lying parents of every secret crime the empress of russia uses a method for converting her pagan subjects of kamskatka no less agreeable than effectual which is to exempt from taxes for ten years such of them as profess the christian religion this practice may be political but it tends not to advance religion and is destructive of morality terror on the other hand may be equally effectual but is not altogether so agreeable the people of rum one of the hebrides were papists till the beginning of the present century when in one day they were all proselyted to the protestant faith maclean of coll their chieftain went to the island with a protestant minister and ordered all the inhabitants to appear on sunday at public worship they came but refused to hear a protestant minister the chieftain reasoned with them but finding that his reasonings made no impression he laid hold of the most forward and having made a deep impression on him with his cane pushed him into the church the rest followed like meek lambs and from that day have continued firm protestants the protestantism of rum is styled by their popish neighbors the faith of the yellow stick  to apply rewards terror or any other means for making proselytes except fair reasoning appears to me a strange perversion can god be pleased with such means or can any rational man justify them what then should move any one to put them in practice i should be utterly at a loss to answer the question but for a fact mentioned more than once above that the rude and illiterate judge by sight only and not by reflection which makes them lay weight on the external visible act without thinking of intention because it is not visible in truth the bulk of mankind rest upon the external profession of religion they never dip into the heart nor consider how that stands affected what else is it but the external act merely that moves the romish missionaries to baptize the infants of savages even at the moment of expiring which they prosecute with much pious ardour their zeal merits applause but by no means their judgment can any rational person seriously believe that the dipping a savage or an infant in water will make either of them a christian or that the want of this ceremony will precipitate them into hell the lithuanians before their conversion to christianity worshipped serpents every family entertaining one as a household god sigismundus in his commentaries of muscovy reports the following incident a converted christian having persuaded a neighbor to follow his example and in token of his conversion to kill his serpent was surprised at his next visit to find his convert in the deepest melancholy bitterly lamenting that he had murdered his god and that the most dreadful calamities would befall him was this person a christian more than nominally at the end of the last century when kempfer was in japan there remained but about fifty japan christians who were locked up in prison for life these poor people knew no more of the christian religion but the names only of our savior and of the virgin mary and yet so zealous christians were they as rather to die miserably in jail than to renounce the name of christ and be set at liberty  i cannot with satisfaction conclude this sketch without congratulating my present countrymen of britain upon their knowledge of the intimate connection that true religion has with morality may the importance of that connection always at heart excite us to govern every action of our lives by the united principles of morality and religion  what a happy people would we be  appendix sketches concerning scotland sketch i scotch entails considered in moral and political views man is by nature a hoarding animal and to secure to men what they acquire by honest industry the sense of property is made a branch of human nature book   sketch    during the infancy of nations when artificial wants are unknown the hoarding appetite makes no figure the use of money produced a great change in the human heart money having at command the goods of fortune introduced inequality of rank luxury and artificial wants without end no bounds are set to hoarding where an appetite for artificial wants is indulged love of money becomes the ruling passion it is coveted by many in order to be hoarded and means are absurdly converted into an end  the sense of property weak among savages ripens gradually till it arrives at maturity in polished nations in every stage of the progress some new power is added to property and now for centuries men have enjoyed every power over their own goods that a rational mind can desire historical law tracts tract    they have the free disposal during life and even after death by naming an heir these powers are sufficient for accomplishing every rational purpose they are sufficient for commerce and they are sufficient for benevolence but the artificial wants of men are boundless not content with the full enjoyment of their property during life nor with the prospect of its being enjoyed by a favorite heir they are anxiously bent to preserve it to themselves for ever a man who has amassed a great estate in land is miserable at the prospect of being obliged to quit his hold to sooth his diseased fancy he makes a deed securing it for ever to certain heirs who must without end bear his name and preserve his estate entire death it is true must at last separate him from his idol it is some consolation however that his will governs and gives law to every subsequent proprietor how repugnant to the frail state of man are such swollen conceptions upon these however are founded entails which have prevailed in many parts of the world and unhappily at this day infest scotland did entails produce no other harm but the gratification of a distempered appetite for property they might be endured though far from deserving approbation but like other transgressions of nature and reason they are productive of much mischief not only to commerce but to the very heirs for whose benefit it is pretended that they are made  considering that the law of nature has bestowed on man every power of property that is necessary either for commerce or for benevolence how blind was it in the english legislature to add a most irrational power that of making an entail but men will always be mending and when a lawgiver ventures to tamper with the laws of nature he hazards much mischief we have a pregnant instance above of an attempt to mend the laws of god in many absurd regulations for the poor and that the law authorizing entails is another instance of the same kind will be evident from what follows  the mischievous effects of english entails were soon discovered they occasioned such injustice and oppression that even the judges ventured to relieve the nations from them by an artificial form termed fine and recovery and yet though no moderate man would desire more power over his estate than he has by common law the legislature of scotland enabled every landproprietor to fetter his estate for ever to tyrannize over his heirs and to reduce their property to a shadow by prohibiting alienation and by prohibiting the contracting debt were it even to redeem the proprietor from death or slavery thus many a man fonder of his estate than of his wife and children grudges the use of it to his natural heirs reducing them to the state of mere liferenters behold the consequences a number of noblemen and gentlemen among us lie in wait for every parcel of land that comes to market intent upon aggrandizing their family or rather their estate which is the favorite object they secure every purchase by an entail and the same course will be followed till no land be left to be purchased thus every entailed estate in scotland becomes in effect a mortmain admitting additions without end but absolutely barring any alienation and if the legislature interpose not the period is not distant when all the land in scotland will be locked up by entails and withdrawn from commerce  the purpose of the present essay is to set before our legislature coolly and impartially the destructive effects of a scotch entail i am not so sanguine as to hope that men who convert means into an end and avariciously covet land for its own sake will be prevailed upon to regard either the interest of their country or of their posterity but i would gladly hope that the legislature may be roused to give attention to a national object of no slight importance  i begin with effects of a private or domestic nature to the possessor an entail is a constant source of discontent by subverting that liberty and independence which all men covet with respect to their goods as well as their persons what can be more vexatious to a proprietor of a great landestate than to be barred from the most laudable acts suitable provisions for example to a wife or children not to mentiom numberless acts of benevolence that endear individuals to each other and make society comfortable were he ever so industrious his fields must lie waste for what man will lay out his own money upon an estate that is not his own a great proportion of the land in scotland is in such a state that by laying out a thousand pounds or so an intelligent proprietor may add a hundred pounds yearly to his rentroll but an entail effectually bars that improvement it affords the proprietor no credit and supposing him to have the command of money independent of the estate he will be illfated if he have not means to employ it more profitably for his own interest an entail at the same time is no better than a trap for an improvident possessor to avoid altogether the contracting debt is impracticable and if a young man be guided more by pleasure than by prudence which commonly is the case of young men a vigilant and rapacious substitute taking advantage of a forfeiting clause turns him out of possession and delivers him over to want and misery  but an entail is productive of consequences still more dismal even with respect to heirs a young man upon whom the family estate is entailed without any power reserved to the father is not commonly obsequious to advice nor patiently submissive to the fatigues of education he abandons himself to pleasure and indulges his passions without control in one word there is no situation more subversive of morals than that of a young man bred up from infancy in the certainty of inheriting an opulent fortune  the condition of the other children daughters especially is commonly deplorable the proprietor of a large entailed estate leaves at his death children who have acquired a taste for sumptuous living the sons drop off one by one and a number of daughters remain with a scanty provision or perhaps with none at all a collateral male heir succeeds who after a painful search is discovered in some remote corner qualified to procure bread by the spade or the plough but entirely unqualified for behaving as master of an opulent fortune by such a metamorphosis the poor man makes a ludicrous figure while the daughters reduced to indigence are in a situation much more lamentable than are the brats of beggars  our entails produce another domestic evil for which no proper remedy is provided the sums permitted in most entails to younger children however adequate when the entail is made become in time too scanty by a fall in the value of money and by increase of luxury which is peculiarly hard upon daughters of great families the provisions destined for them will not afford them bread and they cannot hope to be suitably matched without a decent fortune if we adhere to entails nunneries ought to be provided  but the domestic evils of an entail make no figure compared with those that respect the public these in their full extent would fill a volume they are well known and it may be sufficient to keep them in view by some general hints  as observed above few tenants in tail can command money for improvements however profitable such discouragement to agriculture hurtful to proprietors of entailed estates is still more so to the public it is now an established maxim that a state is powerful in proportion to the product of its land a nation that feeds its neighbors can starve them the quantity of land that is locked up in scotland by entails has damped the growing spirit of agriculture there is not produced sufficiency of corn at home for our own consumption and our condition will become worse and worse by new entails till agriculture and industry be annihilated were the great entailed estates in scotland split into small properties of fifty or a hundred pounds yearly rent we should soon be enabled not only to supply our own markets but to spare for our neighbors  in the next place our entails are no less subversive of commerce than of agriculture there are numberless landestates in scotland of one two or three hundred pounds yearly rent such an estate cannot afford bare necessaries to the proprietor if he pretend to live like a gentleman but he has an excellent resource let him apply to any branch of trade his estate will afford him credit for what money he wants the profit he makes pays the interest of the money borrowed with a surplus and this surplus added to the rent of his estate enables him to live comfortably a number of landproprietors in such circumstances would advance commerce to a great height but alas there are not many who have that resource such is the itch in scoland for entailing as even to descend lower than one hundred pounds yearly can one behold with patience the countenance that is given to selfish wrongheaded people acting in direct opposition to the prosperity of their country commerce is no less hurt in another respect when our land is withdrawn from commerce by entails every prosperous trader will desert a country where he can find no land to purchase for to raise a family by acquiring an estate in land is the ultimate aim of every merchant and of every man who accumulates money  thirdly an entail is a bitter enemy to population population is generally proportioned to the number of landproprietors a very small portion of land managed with skill and industry affords bread to a numerous family and the great aim of the frugal proprietor is to provide a fund for educating his children and for establishing them in business a numerous issue at the same time is commonly the lot of the temperate and frugal because they are strangers to luxury and voluptuousness which enervate the body and dry up the sources of procreation this is no chimera or fond imagination traverse europe compare great capitals with distant provinces and it will be found to hold universally that children abound much more among the industrious poor than among the luxurious rich but if division of land into small properties tend to population depopulation must be the necessary consequence of an entail the avowed intent of which is to unite many small properties in one great estate and consequently to reduce landproprietors to a small number  let us in the fourth place take under consideration the children of landholders with respect to education and industry for unless men be usefully employed population is of no real advantage to a state in that respect great and small estates admit no comparison children of great families accustomed to affluence and luxury are too proud for business and were they even willing are incapable to drudge at a laborious employment at the same time as the fathers hands are tied up by his entail from affording them means to subsist as persons of rank they become a burden on the family and on the state and can do no service to either but by dying yet there are men so blind or so callous as to be fond of entails let us try whether a more pleasing scene will have any effect upon them children of small landholders are from infancy educated in a frugal manner and they must be industrious as they depend on industry for bread among that class of men education has its most powerful influence and upon that class a nation chiefly relies for its skilful artists and manufacturers for its lawyers physicians divines and even for its generals and statesmen  and this leads to consider in the fifth place the influence that great and small estates have on manners gentlemen of a moderate fortune connected with their superiors and inferiors improve society by spreading kindly affection through the whole members of the state in such only resides the genuine spirit of liberty abhorrence equally of servility to superiors and of tyranny to inferiors the nature of the british government creates a mutual dependence of the great and small on each other the great have favors to bestow the small have many more by their privilege of electing parliament men which obliges men of high rank to affect popularity if they have none at heart this connection produces good manners at least between different ranks and perhaps some degree of cordiality accumulation of land into great estates produces opposite manners when all the land in scotland is swallowed up by a number of grandees and few gentlemen of the middle rank are left even the appearance of popularity will vanish leaving pride and insolence on the one hand and abject servility on the other in a word the distribution of land into many shares accords charmingly with the free spirit of the british constitution but nothing is more repugnant to that spirit than overgrown estates in land  in the sixth place arts and sciences can never flourish in a country where all the land is engrossed by a few men science will never be cultivated by the dispirited tenant who can scarce procure bread and still less if possible by the insolent landlord who is too selfsufficient for instruction there will be no encouragement for arts great and opulent proprietors fostering ambitious views will cling to the seat of government which is far removed from scotland and if vanity make them sometimes display their grandeur at their countryseats they will be too delicate for any articles of luxury but what are foreign the arts and sciences being thus banished scotland will be deserted by every man of spirit who can find bread elsewhere  in the seventh place such overgrown estates will produce an irregular and dangerous influence with respect to the house of commons the parliamentboroughs will be subdued by weight of money and with respect to countyelections it is a chance if there be left in a county as many landholders capable to elect and to be elected as even to afford a choice in such circumstances will our constitution be in no danger from the ambitious views of men elevated above others by their vast possessions is it unlikely that such men taking advantage of public discord will become an united body of ambitious oppressors overawing their sovereign as well as their fellow subjects such was the miserable condition of britain while the seudal oligarchy subsisted such at present is the miserable condition of poland and such will be the miserable condition of scotland if the legislature afford not a remedy  if the public interest only were to be regarded the axe ought to be applied cutting down entails to the very root but a numberless body of substitutes are interested many of whom would be disinherited if the tenants in tail had power to reconcile as much as possible these opposite interests it is proposed that the following articles be authorized by a statute first that the act of parliament      be repealed with respect to all future operations second that entails already made and completed shall continue effectual to such substitutes as exist at the date of the act proposed but shall not benefit any substitute born after it third that power be reserved to every proprietor after the act      is at an end to settle his estate upon what heirs he thinks proper and to bar these heirs from altering the order of succession these powers being inherent in property at common law  at the same time the prohibiting entails will avail little if trustdeeds be permitted in their utmost extent as in england and therefore in order to reestablish the law of nature with respect to land property a limitation of trustdeeds is necessary my proposal is that no trustdeed directing or limiting the succession of heirs to a landestate shall be effectual beyond the life of the heirs in existence at the time  sketch ii government of royal boroughs in scotland by a royal borough is in scotland understood an incorporation that hold their lands of the crown and are governed by magistrates of their own naming the administration of the annual revenues of a royal borough termed the common good is trusted to the magistrates but not without control it was originally subjected to the review of the great chamberlain and accordingly the chap       of the iter camerarii contains the following articles recommended to the chamberlain to be enquired into giff there be an good assedation and uptaking of the common good of the burgh and giff faithful count be made thereof to the community of the burgh and giff no count is made he whom and in quhaes hands it is come and how it passes by the community in pursuance of these instructions the chamberlains precept for holding the air or circuit is directed to the provost and bailies enjoining them to call all those who have received any of the towns revenues or used any office within the burgh since the last chamberlainayr to answer such things as shall be laid to their charge iter camer cap   and in the third chapter which contains the forms of the chamberlainayr the first thing to be done after fencing the court is to call the bailies and sergeants to be challenged and accused from the time of the last air  this office dangerous by excess of power being suppressed the royal boroughs were left in a state of anarchy the magistracy being now no longer under any check or control was coveted by noblemen and gentlemen in the neighborhood who under the name of officebearers laid their hands on the revenues of the borough and converted all to their own profit this corruption was heavily complained of in the reign of james v and a remedy was provided by act    parl      enacting   st that none be qualified to be provost bailie or alderman but an indwelling burgess  dly that no inhabitant purchase lordship out of burgh to the terror of his comburgesses and  dly that all provosts bailies and aldermen of boroughs bring yearly to the chequer at a day certain the comptbooks of their common good to be seen and considered by the lords auditors giff the same be spended for the common well of the burgh or not under the penalty of losing their freedom and that the said provosts bailies and aldermen warn yearly fifteen days before their coming to the chequer all those who are willing to come for examining the said accounts that they may impugn the same in order that all murmur may cease in that behalf and to enforce these regulations a brieve was issued from the chancery commanding the magistrates to present their accounts to the exchequer and summoning the burgesses to appear and object to the same  a defect in this statute made it less effectual than it was intended to be magistrates to avoid the penalty brought the countbooks of their common good to the exchequer but they brought no rental of the common good to found a charge against them this defect was remedied by act    parl      containing the following preamble that the royal boroughs by the maladministration of their magistrates have fallen under great debts and burdens to the diminution of their dignity and the disabling of them to serve the crown and government as they ought and that the care oversight and control of the common good of boroughs belong to their majestys by virtue of their prerogativeroyal therefore for preventing the like abuses and misapplications in all time thereafter their majestys statute and ordain that every burghroyal shall betwixt this and the first of november next bring to the lords of treasury and exchequer an exact account of charge and discharge subscribed by the magistrates and town clerk of their whole publicgood and revenues and of the whole debts and encumbrances that affect the same this completed the remedy by putting means into the hands of the barons of exchequer to control the accounts enjoined by the former statute to be yearly given in  the foregoing regulations are kept in observance every year a precept issues from the exchequer signed by one of the barons addressed to the director of the chancery requiring him to make out a brieve for every royal borough the brieve is accordingly made out returned to the exchequer and sent to the several sheriffs to be served in all the royal boroughs within their bounds as directed by the statute these brieves are accordingly so served by the sheriffs and particularly it is a constant form in most of the royal boroughs to issue a proclamation fifteen days before the day named for appearance in exchequer warning the inhabitants to repair there in order to object to the public accounts of the town and further in order to give them opportunity to frame objections the book and accounts are laid open for these fifteen days to be inspected by all the inhabitants  we learn from the records of exchequer that from the year    0 to the year      accounts were regularly given in to exchequer in obedience to the statute the town of edinburgh only having failed for some short time captain thomas hamilton merchant there by an action in exchequer compelled the magistrates to produce upon oath their treasurers accounts which were accordingly audited and we also learn that from the restoration down to the union a clerk to the boroughroll was appointed by the crown whose proper business it was to examine and audite the accounts of the boroughs  notwithstanding the foregoing salutary regulations and the form constantly practiced to make them effectual the boroughs of late years have forborne to present their accounts in exchequer hoping that they would be overlooked by the english court of exchequer established in scotland after the union which accordingly happened this neglect in the court of exchequer is greatly to be regretted because it reduces the royal boroughs by the maladministration of their magistrates to the same miserable condition that is so loudly complained of in the statutes above mentioned it is undoubtedly in the power of the barons to restore good government to the boroughs by compelling the magistrates to account yearly in the court of exchequer according to the foregoing regulations and to that end no more is necessary but to signify publicly that they are resolved hereafter to put these regulations in execution  how beneficial that step would be to this country in general and to the royal boroughs in particular will appear from considering first the unhappy consequences that result from suffering magistrates to dispose of the towns revenues without any check or control and next the good effects that must result from a regular and careful management under the inspection of the kings judges  the unhappy consequences of leaving magistrates without any check or control are too visible to be disguised the revenues of a royal borough are seldom laid out for the good of the town but in making friends to the knot who are in possession of the magistracy and in rioting and drunkenness for which every pretext is laid hold of particularly that of hospitality to strangers such mismanagement tends to idleness and corruption of manners which accordingly are remarkable in most royal boroughs nor is the contagion confined within the town it commonly spreads all around  another consequence no less fatal of leaving magistrates to act without control is a strong desire in every licentious burgess of stepping into the magistracy for his own sake and for that of his friends hence the factions and animosities that prevail in almost all the royal boroughs which are violently and indecently pursued without the least regard to the good of the community  the greatest evil of all respects the choice of their representatives in parliament a habit of riot and intemperance makes them fit subjects to be corrupted by every adventurer who is willing to lay out money for purchasing a seat in parliament hence the infamous practice of bribery at elections which tends not only to corrupt the whole mass of the people but which is still more dreadful tends to fill the house of commons with men of dissolute manners void of probity and honor  but turning from scenes so dismal let us view the beautiful effects that result from an administration regularly carried on as directed by the statutes above mentioned the revenues of the royal boroughs are supposed to be above l  0000 yearly and were this sum or the half of it prudently expended for promoting arts and industry among the numerous inhabitants of royal boroughs the benefit in a country so narrow and poor as scotland would be immense it would tend to population it would greatly increase industry manufactures and commerce beside augmenting the public revenue in the next place as there would be no temptation for designing men to convert the burden of magistracy into a benefit faction and discord would vanish and there would be no less solicitude to shun the burden than at present is seen to obtain it none would submit to the burden but the truly patriotic men who would cheerfully bestow their time and perhaps their money upon the public and whose ambition it would be to acquire a character by promoting industry temperance and honesty among their fellowcitizens  and when the government of the royal boroughs comes to be in so good hands bribery which corrupts the very vitals of our constitution will be banished of course and considering the proper and constitutional dependence of the royal boroughs upon the kings judges we may have reasonable assurance that few representatives will be chosen but who are friends to their country and to their sovereign  sketch iii plan for improving and preserving in order the highways in scotland preface highways have in scotland become a capital object of police by the increase of inland commerce upon which bad roads are a heavy tax happily for our country no person is ignorant of this truth and we see with pleasure the fruits of their conviction in various attempts public and private to establish this valuable branch of police upon the best footing as this will be found no easy task it may reasonably be hoped that men of genius will seriously apply themselves to it and in general that every person will freely produce such hints as occur to them in the latter view the following plan is offered to the public and if from the various proposals that have been or shall be published an effective plan can be framed such as completely to answer its purpose it may safely be pronounced that it will produce more benefit to this country than has been produced by any other single improvement since the union of the two kingdoms    the justices of peace commissioners of supply the sheriff or stewart depute and the first magistrate of royal boroughs shall be commissioners for making and repairing highways bridges and ferries in the several shires and stewartries all the powers given by law to the justices of peace and commissioners of supply with respect to highways bridges and ferries shall be transferred to them and any two shall be a quorum except where a greater number is required by this act    the sheriff or stewart depute shall appoint the first day of meeting of the said commissioners as soon as may conveniently be after the date of the act by an intimation at each parishchurch upon a sunday at the close of the forenoonservice and the last tuesday of march shall yearly thereafter be a day of meeting at the head borough of the shire or stewartry in place of the first or third tuesday of may appointed by former acts the commissioners shall appoint a preses convener and clerk and they shall be empowered to adjourn themselves from time to time    the commissioners at their first meeting shall set about a division of the shire or stewartry into two or more districts as they see convenient and if they cannot overtake this work at that meeting they shall appoint proper persons to form a plan of the intended divisions which plan shall be reported to the commissioners at their next meeting in order to be approved or altered by them this being settled the commissioners shall appoint the heritors in these several districts or any three of them to meet on a certain day and place to make lists of the whole public roads within their respective districts and to settle the order of reparation beginning with those that are the most frequented the proceedings of these districtmeetings must be reported to the commissioners at their next meeting who are empowered to settle the order of reparation in case of variance among the heritors and also to add any road that may have been omitted and they shall record a scheme or plan of the whole roads in the shire thus enlisted with their resolutions thereupon to be seen in the clerks hands gratis but upon any just cause appearing in the course of administration the commissioners shall be empowered to alter or vary this plan provided it be at a meeting previously appointed for that purpose and where three fifths at least of the commissioners are present    if the sheriff or stewart neglect to appoint the first meeting of the commissioners he shall incur a penalty of l  00 upon a summary complaint to the court of session by any one heritor of the shire with costs of suit the one half to the plaintiff and the other half to be applied by the commissioners for the purposes of this act if the commissioners fail to meet at the day appointed by the sheriff or stewart or fail to divide the shire or stewartry into districts within six months of their first meeting the sheriff or stewart depute under the foresaid penalty shall be bound to do that work himself and also to appoint the heritors in the several districts or any three of them to make lists of the public roads as above mentioned and to report their resolutions to him and he is empowered to settle the order of reparation in case of variance among the heritors if the heritors fail to meet and to make a list of the roads as aforesaid this work shall be performed by the sheriff or stewart depute himself and he shall be indemnified of whatever expenses he is at in prosecuting the said work out of the sums that are to be levied by authority of this act in manner after mentioned with an additional sum for his own trouble to be named by the circuitjudges    no person shall act as a commissioner upon this statute but who has an estate within the county of l  00 scots valuation or is heirpresumptive to such an estate or is named a commissioner virtute officii under the penalty of l  0 sterling toties quoties to be prosecuted before any competent court by a popular action with costs of suit the one half to the plaintiff the other half to the purposes of this act    whereas the sum of  0d directed by the act      to be imposed upon each l  00 of valued rent is insufficient for the purposes therein expressed and whereas the six days statutework for repairing the highways is in many respects inconvenient therefore instead of the  0d and instead of the statutework the commissioners together with the heritors possessed of l  00 scots of valued rent five whether commissioners or heritors making a quorum shall annually upon the said last tuesday of march assess each heritor in a sum not exceeding  upon each l  00 valued rent the assessment imposed on the heritors to be levied by the collector of supply along with the cess and by the same legal remedies the heritors are entitled to relieve themselves of the one half of the said assessment by laying the same upon their tenants in proportion to their rents an heritor being always considered as a tenant of the land he has in his natural possession    with respect to boroughs of royalty regality and barony and large trading villages the commissioners are empowered to levy from each householder a sum not exceeding   s yearly more or less in proportion to the assessment of the shire to be paid within forty days after notice given under the penalty of double besides expense of process provided that any of these householders who have country farms by which they contribute to relieve their landlords as above mentioned shall be exempted from this part of the assessment    if the commissioners and heritors neglect to assess their shire or name so small a sum as to be an elusory assessment insufficient to answer the purposes of this act the court of justiciary or the circuit judges are in that case empowered and required to lay on the highest assessment that is made lawful by this act in case of a total omission the commissioners and heritors who by neglecting to convene without a good cause of absence have occasioned the said omission shall be subjected each of them to a penalty of l  0 sterling and to make these penalties effectual the trustees for fisheries and manufactures are appointed to sue for the same before the court of session and to apply the same when recovered to any useful purpose within the shire especially to the purposes of this act and to preserve the said fines entire for the public service the trustees shall be entitled to costs of suit    the sums levied as aforesaid shall be laid out annually upon the highways bridges and ferries for making repairing or improving the same proceeding regularly with the reparation according to the scheme or plan ordered as above to be settled in each shire and stewartry   0 with respect to roads that are not the first in order and for which there is no interim provision by this act during reparation of the more frequented roads the commissioners are empowered to exact from cottars and daylabourers their statutework according to the acts presently in force to be applied to those secondary roads the statutework is not to be demanded unless for this purpose and is to cease totally after the highways have by means of the present act been once totally repaired     the commissioners and heritors at all their meetings shall bear their own charges     the clause in the act      empowering heritors at the sight of the sheriff to cast about highways for their convenience shall be repealed and it shall be declared unlawful in time coming to turn about or change any highway unless for the benefit of the public as by shortening it carrying it through firmer ground or making it more level and to that purpose the commissioners shall be empowered to turn about highways as also to widen the same not exceeding thirty feet free of ditches but the commissioners shall have no power to carry a road through any house garden orchard or pleasureground     the commissioners shall have power to take from the adjacent lands stones sand gravel or other materials for making the highways paying always for the damage done     with respect to highroads which bound the properties of neighboring heritors and which it may be found necessary to alter or widen the commissioners shall be empowered to adjudge to one heritor any small bits of ground cut off from the other by the road so altered and if land cannot be given for land to make a compensation in money valuing the land at the current price of the country     in order to prevent water stagnating on the highways the commissioners shall be empowered to make ditches or drains through neighboring grounds and such ditches or drains shall be preserved entire by the proprietors of the land or at their charges     as the aforesaid assessment after repairing the highways may not be sufficient for building bridges or making ferries where rivers are large any five of the commissioners may for building bridges or making ferries establish a pontage or toll so much for horses so much for horned cattle and so much for sheep and the double for each beast in a wheelcarriage upon the credit of the toll the said commissioners may borrow money to be employed wholly upon the bridge or ferry where the toll is gathered but before borrowing the money an estimate must be made of the expense of the work after the work is finished the sum bestowed on it must be ascertained an accurate account must be kept of the gradual payment of this sum by the toll and when it is completely paid the commissioners must declare the bridge or ferry to be free     the determinations of the commissioners shall be final unless complained of in manner following     if any heritor apprehend that undue preference is given to a certain highway or conceive himself aggrieved by an order or sentence of the commissioners it shall be lawful for him within forty days of the act complained of to enter a complaint in the court of session and the judgment upon such complaint shall be final but such complaint shall only be effectual for damages and shall not stay execution of the work at the same time no complaint shall be admitted till security be given to pay full costs in case the plaintiff be found in the wrong     former laws concerning highways bridges or ferries to continue in force unless as far as altered by this act   0 an annual state of what is done by virtue of this act made up by the commissioners or their clerk shall before the last tuesday of march be laid before the trustees for fisheries and manufactures in order to be made a part of their annual report to the king and these trustees shall direct proper persons to inspect what work is done upon the highroads and in what manner upon any misapplication or embezzlement of the money levied any neglect in levying or any wrong done to the public contrary to the intention of this act the trustees are required to set on foot and prosecute what redress is competent in law or equity provided the prosecution be commenced within a year after the offense  query ought not broad wheels to be required  considerations on the preceding plan the laws in scotland relating to this branch of public police are numerous some enacted while scotland was a separate kingdom some after its union with england it is not the purpose of this paper to enter into a detail of the various regulations established by these laws they are generally known and in the late abridgment of our statute law they are all recapitulated with brevity and precision it shall suffice cursorily to observe that the acts made during the reign of charles ii form the groundwork of our regulations concerning highways the latter acts are little more than explanatory of the former  it seems to have been the plan of the legislature that highways should be repaired by those who are employed in husbandry and accordingly the six days annual labor is in the statutes of charles ii imposed upon them only  this was a measure not ill suited to the state of scotland at that period during the last century we had little inland commerce to require good roads except that of corn carried to market and for that reason it was natural to impose upon husbandmen the burden of repairing highways these persons at the same time passing the whole summer in idleness unless when called to perform personal services to capricious and unfeeling landlords could not think it a hardship to have some part of their time employed in serving themselves instead of their landlords  that annual labor upon highways limited to a few days should be required from men in that condition appears not unjust and why may we not suppose the legislature at that time capable of such enlarged views as to prefer this method for repairing highways in order to bring on gradually a habit of labor and industry but the condition of scotland at present differs widely from what it was in the reign of charles ii and the regulations for repairing highways which were then proper have by alteration of circumstances become both unjust and inexpedient  unjust they have become in a high degree inland commerce which begins to flourish in scotland is greatly promoted by good roads and every dealer and indeed every traveller profits by them but no men are less interested in good roads than daylabourers or those who are commonly called cottars and yet these chiefly are burdened with the reparation such men at the same time having commonly many children find it difficult to support their families even with their utmost industry nothing can be more unjust than to impose upon such men an annual tax of six days labor for repairing roads the goodness of which contributes little or nothing to their convenience  our present laws are inexpedient as well as unjust in the first place a tax of this nature discourages the propagation of children in which the strength of a state consists the poor labourer ought to be encouraged with a reward instead of being discouraged with a tax in the next place cottars called out to perform the statutework obey with reluctance and trifle away time without doing any thing effectual to enforce the law and to compel such men to labor is grievous to the gentlemen who are empowered to execute the law they cannot punish with rigor or firmness men who have so good reason to decline the service they are soon disgusted with being taskmasters and the generality desist altogether  laws concerning private property are always kept in observance and they execute themselves as is commonly expressed because there are always a multitude of individuals strongly interested to have them executed but in making public laws the great difficulty has ever been to lay down effectual measures for putting them in execution and by what means to make such laws execute themselves is one of the most intricate problems in politics our laws concerning highways are eminently defective in that respect and accordingly though most of them have existed near a century they never have at any period been executed to any extent take the following specimen among many that may be urged of this defect overseers are forced into service under a penalty in order to compel the peasants to perform faithfully their sixdays labor to hope any good from a reluctant overseer set over a set of reluctant laborers is a fond conceit it is much if his resentment tempt him not to encourage their idleness in vain would we expect that any overseer without a suitable reward will exert himself in promoting the work  to remedy the hardship of laying the burden of reparation upon those who are leastable and least benefited and at the same time to make this remedy effectual is the purpose of the foregoing plan and upon considering the matter in its different views the only method that promises success appears to be a countytax laid upon land according to the valuation and a capitationtax on the inhabitants of boroughs these taxes relieve the laboring poor and lay the burden where it ought to be laid and the law will execute itself if that effect can be hoped from any public law effectual measures are laid down for levying the tax and if once levied there is no danger of its being allowed to lie unemployed in the hands of the collector for every heritor will be anxious to have some part employed for his benefit the danger will rather be of factious disputes about the distribution this danger also is attempted to be prevented and it is hoped with success  some narrowminded persons may possibly grudge a tax that loads the present generation for the advantage of those who come after but is it rational to grudge that others should benefit by measures evidently calculated for advancing our own interest let us suppose that the heritors of a shire were to concert measures in common for improving their lands to make good roads would be one effectual measure for supposing the reparation to cost l  000 their estates would be bettered double that sum  to conclude it is not to be expected that any regulations concerning highways or concerning any branch of police can be so framed as to please every individual wise men are practicable men to use an expression of lord bacon and will make concessions in order to promote a general good if without such concessions it cannot be obtained better far to have a good law though in our opinion defective in some articles than to have no law at all or which is worse a law eminently defective unjust and inexpedient  finis the binder is requested to take notice that the signa of
