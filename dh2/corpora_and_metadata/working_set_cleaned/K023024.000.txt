to lordings proud i tune my song who feast in bower or hall  tho dukes they be yet dukes shall see that pride will have a fall that pride will have a fall    i to lordings proud i tune my song who feast in bower or hall though dukes they be yet dukes shall see that pride will have a fall ii now that this same it is right sooth full plainly does appear from what befell john duke of guise and nic of lancastere iii when richard coeur de lion reigned which means a lyons heart like him his barons raged and roared each played a lyons part iv a word and blow was then enough such honor did them prick if you but turned your cheek a cuff and if your ae a kick v look in their face they tweakd your nose at every turn fell to it come near they trod upon your toes they fought from head to foot vi of these the duke of lancastere stood paramount in pride he kicked and cuffd and tweakd and trod his foes and friends beside vii firm on his front his beaver sat so broad it hid his chin for why he thought no man his mate and feared to tan his skin viii with spanish wool he died his cheek with essence oiled his hair no vixen civet cat more sweet nor more could scratch and tear ix right tall he made himself to show though made full short by gd and when all other dukes did bow this duke did only nod x yet courteous blithe and debonaire to guises duke was he never was such a loving pair why did they disagree xi oh thus it was he loved him dear and cast how to requite him and having no friend left but this he deemed it meet to fight him xii forthwith he drenched his desperate quill and thus he did indite this eve at wisk our self will play sir duke be here to night xiii ah no ah no the guileless guise demurely did reply i cannot go nor yet can stand so sore the gout have i xiv the duke in wrath called for his steeds and fiercely drove them on lord lord how rattled then thy stones o kingly kensington xv all in a trice on guise he rushed thrust out his lady dear he tweakd his nose trod on his toes and smote him on the ear xvi but mark how midst of victory fate shows an old dogtrick up leaped duke john and knocked him down and so down fell duke nic xvii alas oh nic oh nic alas right did thy gossip call thee as who should say alas the day when john of guise shall maul thee xviii for on thee did he clap his chair and on that chair did sit and looked as if he meant therein to do what was not fit xix up did thou look oh woeful duke thy mouth yet durst not open certes for fear of finding there a td instead of trope xx  lie there thou caitiff vile quoth guise  no sheet is here to save thee  the casememt it is shut likewise  beneath my feet i have thee xxi  if thou have ought to say now speak then lancaster did cry  know thou not me not yet thy self  who thou and who am i xxii  know thou not me who god be praised  have bawled and quarelld more  than all the line of lancaster  that battled heretofore xxiii  in senates famed for many a speech  and what some awe must give ye  though laid thus low beneath thy breech  still of the council privy xxiv  still of the duchy chancellor  durante life i have it  and turn as now thou do on me  my ae on those that gave it xxv but now the servants they rushed in and duke nic up leaped he i will not cope against such odds but guise i will fight with thee xxvi to morrow with thee will i fight under the greenwood tree no not to morrow but to night quoth guise i will fight with thee xxvii and now the sun declining low bestreakd with blood the skies when with his sword at saddle bow rode forth the valiant guise xxviii full gently prauncd he on the lawn often rolled his eye around and from his sirrup stretched to find who was not to be found xxix long brandished he his blade in air long looked the field all over at length he spied the merry men brown and eke the coach and four xxx from out the boot bold nicholas did wave his hand so white as pointing out the gloomy glade whereat he meant to fight xxxi all in that dreadful hour so calm was lancaster to see as if he meant to take the air or only take a fee xxxii and so he did for to new court his trowling wheels they run not that he shunned the doubtful strife but business must be done xxxiii back in the dark by brompton park he turned up through the gore so slunk to campden house so high all in his coach and four xxxiv mean while the guise did fret and fume a sight it was to see benumbed beneath the evening dew under the greenwood tree xxxv then wet and weary home he fared sore muttring all the way the day i meet nic he shall rue the cudgel of that day xxxvi mean time on every pissing post paste me this recreants name so that each pisserby shall read and piss against the same xxxvii now god preserve our gracious king and grant his nobles all may learn this lesson from duke nic that pride will have a fall finis
