the london merchant or the history of george barnwell as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  by mr lillo  learn to be wise from others harm and you shall do full well old ballad of the ladys fall london printed for j gray at the crosskeys in the poultry and sold by j roberts in warwick lane mdccxxxi price oneshilling and sixpence  to sir john eyles bar member of parliament for and alderman of the city of london and subgovernor of the south sea company sir if tragic poetry be as mr dryden has some where said the most excellent and most useful kind of writing the more extensively useful the moral of any tragedy is the more excellent that piece must be of its kind  i hope i shall not be thought to insinuate that this to which i have presumed to prefix your name is such that depends on its fitness to answer the end of tragedy the exciting of the passions in order to the correcting such of them as are criminal either in their nature or through their excess whether the following scenes do this in any tolerable degree is with the deference that becomes one who would not be thought vain submitted to your candid and impartial judgment  what i would infer is this i think evident truth that tragedy is so far from losing its dignity by being accommodated to the circumstances of the generality of mankind that it is more truly august in proportion to the extent of its influence and the numbers that are properly affected by it as it is more truly great to be the instrument of good to many who stand in need of our assistance than to a very small part of that number  if princes etc were alone liable to misfortunes arising from vice or weakness in themselves or others there would be good reason for confining the characters in tragedy to those of superior rank but since the contrary is evident nothing can be more reasonable than to proportion the remedy to the disease  i am far from denying that tragedies founded on any instructive and extraordinary events in history or a wellinvented fable where the persons introduced are of the highest rank are without their use even to the bulk of the audience the strong contrast between a tamerlane and a bajazet may have its weight with an unsteady people and contribute to the fixing of them in the interest of a prince of the character of the former when through their own levity or the arts of designing men they are rendered factious and uneasy though they have the highest reason to be satisfied the sentiments and example of a cato may inspire his spectators with a just sense of the value of liberty when they see that honest patriot prefer death to an obligation from a tyrant who would sacrifice the constitution of his country and the liberties of mankind to his ambition or revenge i have attempted indeed to enlarge the province of the graver kind of poetry and should be glad to see it carried on by some abler hand plays founded on moral tales in private life may be of admirable use by carrying conviction to the mind with such irresistible force as to engage all the faculties and powers of the soul in the cause of virtue by stifling vice in its first principles they who imagine this to be too much to be attributed to tragedy must be strangers to the energy of that noble species of poetry shakespeare who has given such amazing proofs of his genius in that as well as in comedy in his hamlet has the following lines had he the motive and the cause for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appale the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculty of eyes and ears and farther in the same speech i have heard that guilty creatures at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been so struck to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions prodigious yet strictly just but i shall not take up your valuable time with my remarks only give me leave just to observe that he seems so firmly persuaded of the power of a well wrote piece to produce the effect here ascribed to it as to make hamlet venture his soul on the event and rather trust that than a messenger from the other world though it assumed as he expresses it his noble fathers form and assured him that it was his spirit i will have says hamlet grounds more relative  the plays the thing wherein i will catch the conscience of the king such plays are the best answers to them who deny the lawfulness of the stage  considering the novelty of this attempt i thought it would be expected from me to say something in its excuse and i was unwilling to lose the opportunity of saying something of the usefulness of tragedy in general and what may be reasonably expected from the farther improvement of this excellent kind of poetry  sir i hope you will not think i have said too much of an art a mean specimen of which i am ambitious enough to recommend to your favor and protection a mind conscious of superior worth as much despises flattery as it is above it had i found in my self an inclination to so contemptible a vice i should not have chose sir john eyles for my patron and indeed the best writ panegyric though strictly true must place you in a light much inferior to that in which you have long been fixed by the love and esteem of your fellow citizens whose choice of you for one of their representatives in parliament has sufficiently declared their sense of your merit nor has the knowledge of your worth been confined to the city the proprietors in the south sea company in which are included numbers of persons as considerable for their rank fortune and understanding as any in the kingdom gave the greatest proof of their confidence in your capacity and probity when they chose you subgovernor of their company at a time when their affairs were in the utmost confusion and their properties in the greatest danger nor is the court insensible of your importance i shall not therefore attempt your character nor pretend to add any thing to a reputation so well established  whatever others may think of a dedication wherein there is so much said of other things and so little of the person to whom it is addressed i have reason to believe that you will the more easily pardon it on that very account  i am sir your most obedient humble servant george lillo  prologue spoke by mr cibber jun the tragic muse sublime delights to show princes distressed and scenes of royal woe in awful pomp majestic to relate the fall of nations or some heros fate that sceptered chiefs may by example know the strange vicissitude of things below what dangers on security attend how pride and cruelty in ruin end hence providence supreme to know and own humanity adds glory to a throne in every former age and foreign tongue with native grandeur thus the goddess sung upon our stage indeed with wished success you have sometimes seen her in a humbler

prefer your conversation to mine yet intend me no disrespect at all for though he may lose no honor in my company it is very natural for him to expect more pleasure in yours i remember the time when

hopes that by observation i should learn which way your inclination tends for as i know love to be essential to happiness in the marriage state i had rather my approbation should confirm your choice than direct it   ma what can i say how shall i answer as i ought this tenderness so uncommon even in the best of parents but you are without example yet had you been less indulgent i had been most

your wit and beauty    mill first made me a wretch and still continue me so  men however generous or sincere to one another are all selfish hypocrites in their affairs with us we are no otherwise esteemed or regarded by them but as we contribute to their satisfaction   lucy you are certainly madam on the wrong side in this argument is not the expense all theirs and i am sure it is our own fault if we havnt our share of the pleasure   mill we are but slaves to men   lucy nay it is they that are slaves most certainly for we lay them under contribution   mill slaves have no property no

plundered the natives of all the wealth they had and then condemned the wretches to the mines for life to work for more   lucy well i shall never approve of your scheme of government i should think it much more politic as well as just to find my subjects an easier employment   mill it is a general maxim among the knowing part of mankind that a woman without virtue like a man without honor or honesty is capable of any action though never so vile and yet what pains will they not take what arts not use to seduce us from our innocence and make us contemptible and wicked even in their own opinions then is it not just the villains to their cost should find us so  but guilt makes them suspicious and keeps them on their guard therefore we can take advantage only of the young and innocent part of the sex who having never injured women apprehend no injury from them   lucy ay they must be young indeed   mill such a one i think i have found  as i have passed through the city i have often observed him receiving and paying considerable sums of money from thence i conclude he is employed in affairs of consequence   lucy is he handsome   mill ay ay the stripling is well made   lucy about

have done with him much sooner having long had a design on him and meeting him yesterday i made a full stop and gazing wishfully on his face asked him his name he blushed and bowing very low answered george barnwell i begged his pardon for the freedom i had taken and told him that he was the person i had long wished to see and to whom i had an affair of importance to communicate at a proper time and place he named a tavern i talked of honor and reputation and invited him to my house he swallowed the bait promised to come and this is the time i expect him knocking at the door some body knocks  do you hear i am at home to no body to day but him    scene iv millwood mill less affairs must give way to those of more consequence and i am strangely mistaken if this does not prove of great importance to me and him too before i have done with him  now after what manner shall i receive him let me consider  what manner of person am i to receive  he is young innocent and bashful therefore i must take care not to shock him at first  but then if i have any skill in phisiognomy he is amorous and with a little assistance will soon get the better of his modesty  i will trust to nature who does wonders in these matters  if to seem what one is not in order to be the better liked for what one really is if to speak one thing and mean the direct contrary be art in a woman i know nothing of

mill what then are your thoughts of love   barn if you mean the love of women i have not thought of it all  my youth and circumstances make such thoughts improper in me yet but if you mean the general love we owe to mankind i think no one has more of it in his temper than my self  i dont know that person in the world whose happiness i dont wish and would nt promote were it in my power  in an especial manner i love my uncle and my master but above all my friend   mill you have a friend then whom you love   barn as he does me sincerely   mill he is no doubt often blessed with your company

women before or this is sure the most beautiful of her sex aside you seem disordered madam may i know the cause   mill do not ask me  i can never speak it whatever is the cause  i wish for things impossible  i would be a servant bound to the same master as you are to live in one house with you   barn how strange and yet how kind her words and actions are  and the effect they have on me is as strange  i feel desires i never knew before  i must be gone while i have power to go aside madam i humbly take my leave    mill you will not sure leave me so soon   barn indeed i must   mill you cannot be so cruel  i have prepared a poor supper at which i promised my self your company   barn i am sorry i must refuse the honor that you designed me  but my duty to my master calls me hence  i never yet neglected his service he is so gentle and so good a master that should i wrong him though he might forgive me i never should forgive my self   mill am i refused by the first man the second favor i ever stooped to ask  go then thou proud hardhearted youth  but know you are the only man that could be found who would let me sue twice for greater favors   barn what shall i do  how shall i go or stay   mill yet do not do not leave me  i wish my sexs pride would meet your scorn  but when i look upon you  when i behold those eyes  oh spare my tongue and let my blushes speak  this flood of tears to that will force their way and declare  what womans modesty should hide   barn oh heavens she loves me worthless as i am her looks her words her flowing tears confess it  and can i leave her then  oh never  never  madam dry up those tears  you shall command me always  i will stay here for ever if you would have me   lucy so she has wheedled him out of his virtue of obedience already and will strip him of all the rest one after another till she has left him as few as her ladyship or my self aside   mill now you are kind indeed but i mean not to detain you always i would have you shake off all slavish obedience to your master  but you may serve him still   lucy serve him still  aye or he will have no opportunity of fingering his cash and then he will not serve your end i will be

barnwell and millwood at an entertainment barn what can i answer  all that i know is that you are fair and i am miserable   mill we are both so and yet the fault is in our selves   barn to ease our

blunt i own it is surprising  i dont know which to admire most her feigned or his real passion though i have sometimes been afraid that her avarice would discover her  but his youth and want of experience make it the easier to impose on him   lucy no it is his love to do him justice notwithstanding his youth he dont want understanding but you men are much easier imposed on in these affairs than your vanity will allow you to believe  let me see the wisest of you all as much in love with me as barnwell is with millwood and i will engage to make as great a fool of him   blunt and all circumstances considered to make as much money of him too   lucy i cannot answer for that her artifice in making him rob his master at first and the various stratagems by which she has obliged him to continue in that course astonish even me who know her so well    blunt but then you are to consider that the money was his masters   lucy there was the difficulty of it  had it been his own it had been nothing  were the world his she might have it for a smile  but those golden days are done  he is ruined and millwoods hopes of farther profits there are at an end   blunt that is no more than we all expected   lucy being called by his master to make up his accounts he was forced to quit his house and service and wisely flies to millwood for relief and entertainment   blunt i have not heard of this before how did she receive him   lucy as you would expect  she wondered what he meant was astonished at his impudence  and with an air of modesty peculiar to her self swore so heartily that she never saw him before  that she put me out of countenance   blunt that is much indeed but how did barnwell behave   lucy he grieved and at length enraged at this barbarous treatment was preparing to be gone and making toward the door showed a bag of money which he had stolen from his master  the last he is ever like to have from thence   blunt but then millwood   lucy aye she with her usual address returned to her old arts of lying swearing and dissembling  hung on his neck and wept and swore twas meant in jest till this easy fool melted into tears threw the money into her lap and swore he had rather die than think her false   blunt strange infatuation   lucy but what followed was stranger still as doubts and fears followed by reconcilement ever increase love where the passion is sincere so in him it caused so wild a transport of excessive fondness such joy such grief such pleasure and such anguish that nature in him seemed sinking with the weight and the charmed soul disposed to quit his breast for hers  just then when every passion with lawless anarchy prevailed  and reason was in the raging tempest lost  the cruel artful millwood prevailed upon the wretched youth to promise what i tremble but to think on   blunt i am amazed what can it be   lucy you will be more so to hear it is to attempt the life of his nearest relation and best benefactor    blunt his uncle whom we have often heard him speak of as a gentleman of a large estate and fair character in the country where he lives   lucy the same  she was no sooner possessed of the last dear purchase of his ruin but her avarice insatiate as the grave demands this horrid sacrifice  barnwells near relation and unsuspected virtue must give too easy means to seize the good mans treasure whose blood must seal the dreadful secret and prevent the terrors of her guilty fears   blunt is it possible she could persuade him to do an act like that he is by nature honest grateful compassionate and generous and though his love and her artful persuasions have wrought him to practice what he most abhors yet we all can witness for him with what reluctance he has still complied so many tears he shed over each offense as might if possible sanctify theft and make a merit of a crime   lucy it is true at the naming the murder of his uncle he started into rage and breaking from her arms where she till then had held him with well dissembled love and false endearments called her cruel monster devil and told her she was born for his destruction  she thought it not for her purpose to meet his rage with rage but affected a most passionate fit of grief  railed at her fate and cursed her wayward stars  that still her wants should force her to press him to act such deeds as she must needs abhor as well as he but told him necessity had no law and love no bounds that therefore he never truly loved but meant in her necessity to forsake her  then kneeled and swore that since by his refusal he had given her cause to doubt his love she never would see him more unless to prove it true he robbed his uncle to supply her wants and murdered him to keep it from discovery   blunt i am astonished what said he   lucy speechless he stood but in his face you might have read that various passions tore his very soul often he in anguish threw his eyes toward heaven and then as often bent their beams on her then wept and groaned and beat his breast at length with horror not to be expressed he cried thou cursed fair have i not given dreadful proofs of love what drew me from my youthful innocence to stain my then unspotted soul but love what caused me to rob my gentle master but cursed love what makes me now a fugitive from his service loathed by my self and scorned by all the world but love what fills my eyes with tears my soul with torture never felt on this side death before why love love love and why above all do i resolve for tearing his hair he cried i do resolve to kill my uncle   blunt was she not moved it makes me weep to hear the sad relation   lucy yes with joy that she had gained her point  she gave him no time to cool but urged him to attempt it instantly he is now gone if he performs it and escapes there is more money for her if not he will never return and then she is fairly rid of him   blunt it is time the world was rid of such a monster    lucy if we dont do our endeavors to prevent this murder we are as bad as she   blunt i am afraid it is too late   lucy perhaps not  her barbarity to barnwell makes me hate her  we have run too great a length with her already  i did not think her or my self so wicked as i find upon reflection we are   blunt it is true we have all been too much so  but there is something so horrid in murder  that all other crimes seem nothing when compared to that  i would not be involved in the guilt of that for all the world   lucy nor i heaven knows  therefore let us clear our selves by doing all that is in our power to prevent it i have just thought of a way that to me seems probable  will you join with me to detect this cursed design   blunt with all my heart  how else shall i clear my self he who knows of a murder intended to be committed and does not discover it in the eye of the law and reason is a murderer   lucy let us lose no time  i will acquaint you with the particulars as we go   scene v a walk at some distance from a country seat barnwell a dismal gloom obscures the face of day either the sun has slipped behind a cloud or journeys down the west of heaven with more than common speed to avoid the sight of what i am doomed to act since i set forth on this accursed design wherever i tread methinks the solid earth trembles beneath my feet  yonder limpid stream whose hoary fall has made a natural cascade as i passed by in doleful accents seemed to murmur murder the earth the air and water seem concerned but that is not strange the world is punished and nature feels the shock when providence permits a good mans fall  just heaven then what should i be for him that was my fathers only brother and since his death has been to me a father who took me up an infant and an orphan reared me with tenderest care and still indulged me with most paternal fondness  yet here i stand avowed his destined murderer  i stiffen with horror at my own impiety  it is yet unperformd  what if i quit my bloody purpose and fly the place going then stops  but whether o whether shall i fly  my masters once friendly doors are ever shut against me and without money millwood will never see me more and life is not to be endured without her  she is got such firm possession of my heart and governs there with such despotick sway  aye there is the cause of all my sin and sorrow  it is more than love it is the fever of the soul and madness of desire  in vain does nature reason conscience all oppose it the impetuous passion bears down all before it and drives me on to lust to theft and murder  oh conscience feeble guide to virtue who only shows us when we go astray but wants the power to stop us in our course  ha in yonder shady walk i see my uncle  he is alone  now for my disguise  plucks out a vizor this is his hour

melancholy clouds my spirits my imagination is filled with gashly forms of dreary graves and bodies changed by death  when the pale lengthened visage attracks each weeping eye  and fills the musing soul at once with grief and horror pity and aversion  i will indulge the thought the wise man prepares himself for death by making it familiar to his mind  when strong reflections hold the mirror near  and the living in the dead behold their future selves how does each inordinate passion and desire cease or sicken at the view  the mind scarce moves  the blood curdling and chilled creeps slowly through the veins  fixed still and motionless like the solemn object of our thoughts  we are almost at present  what we must be hereafter till curiosity awakes the soul and sets it on inquiry    scene
