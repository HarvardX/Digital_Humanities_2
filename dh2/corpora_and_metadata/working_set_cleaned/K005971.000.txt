esquire souths message and letter to mrs bull    john bull in his senses chap i mrs bulls vindication of the indispensable duty of cuckoldom incumbent upon wives in case of the tyranny infidelity or insufficiency of husbands being a full answer to the doctors sermon against adultery john found daily fresh proofs of the infidelity and bad designs of his deceased wife amongst other things one day looking over his cabinet he found the following paper  it is evident that matrimony is founded upon an original contract whereby the wife makes over the right she has by the law of nature to the concubitus vagus in favor of the husband by which he acquires the property of all her posterity but then the obligation is mutual and where the contract is broken on one side it ceases to bind on the other where there is a right there must be a power to maintain it and to punish the offending party this power i affirm to be that original right or rather that indispensable duty of cuckoldom lodged in all wives in the cases abovementioned no wife is bound by any law to which she her self has not consented all oeconomical government is lodged originally in the husband and wife the executive part being in the husband both have their privileges secured to them by law and reason but will any man infer from the husbands being invested with the executive power that the wife is deprived of her share and that which is the principal branch of it the original right of cuckoldom and that she has no remedy left but preces and lacrymae or an appeal to a supreme court of judicature no less frivolous are the arguments that are drawn from the general appellations and terms of husband and wife a husband denotes several different sorts of magistracy according to the usages and customs of different climates and countries in some eastern nations it signifies a tyrant with the absolute power of life and death in turkey it denotes an arbitrary governor with power of perpetual imprisonment in italy it gives the husband the power of poison and padlocks in the countries of england france and holland it has quite a different meaning implying a free and equal government securing to the wife in certain cases the liberty of cuckoldom and the property of pinmoney and separate maintenance so that the arguments drawn from the terms of husband and wife are fallacious and by no means fit to support a tyrannical doctrine as that of absolute unlimited chastity and conjugal fidelity  the general exhortations to chastity in wives are meant only for rules in ordinary cases but they naturally suppose the three conditions of ability justice and fidelity in the husband such an unlimited unconditiond fidelity in the wife could never be supposed by reasonable men it seems a reflection upon the ch  ch to charge her with doctrines that countenance oppression  this doctrine of the original right of cuckoldom is congruous to the law of nature which is superior to all human laws and for that i dare appeal to all wives it is much to the honor of our english wives that they have never given up that fundamental point and that though in former ages they were muffled up in darkness and superstition yet that notion seemed engraven on their minds and the impression so strong that nothing could impair it  to assert the illegality of cuckoldom upon any pretense whatsoever were to cast odious colors upon the married state to blacken the necessary means of perpetuating families such laws can never be supposed to have been designed to defeat the very end of matrimony the propagation of mankind i call them necessary means for in many cases what other means are left such a doctrine wounds the honor of families unsettles the titles to kingdoms honors and estates for if the actions from which such settlements spring were illegal all that is built upon them must be so too but the last is absurd therefore the first must be so likewise what is the cause that europe groans at present under the heavy load of a cruel and expensive war but the tyrannical custom of a certain nation and the scrupulous nicety of a silly queen in not exercising this indispensable duty of cuckoldom whereby the kingdom might have had an heir and a controverted succession might have been avoided these are the effects of the narrow maxims of your clergy that one must not do evil that good may come of it  the assertors of this indefeasible right and jus divinum of matrimony do all in their hearts favor gallants and the pretenders to married women for if the true legal foundation of the married state be once sapd and instead thereof tyrannical maxims introduced what must follow but elopements instead of secret and peaceable cuckoldom  from all that has been said one may clearly perceive the absurdity of the doctrine of this seditious discontented hotheaded ungifted unedifying preacher asserting that the grand security of the matrimonial state and the pillar upon which it stands  founded upon the wifes belief of an absolute uncondition fidelity to the husbands bed by which bold assetion he strikes at the root digs the foundation a removes the basis upon which the happiness of  married state is built as for his personal reflections i would gladly know who are those wanton wives he speaks of who are those ladies of high stations that he so boldly traduces in his sermon it is pretty plain who these aspersions are aimed at for which he deserves the pillory or something worse  in confirmation of this doctrine of the indispensable duty of cuckoldom i could deduce the example of the wisest wives in all ages who by these means have preserved their husbands families from ruin and oblivion by want of posterity but what has been said is a sufficient ground for punishing this pragmatical parson  chap ii the two great parties of wives the devotos and the hitts the doctrine of unlimited chastity and fidelity in wives was universally espoused by all husbands who went about the country and made the wives sign papers signifying their utter detestation and abhorrence of mrs bulls wicked doctrine of the indispensable duty of cuckoldom some yielded others refused to part with their native liberty which gave rise to two great parties amongst the wives the devotos and the hitts though it must e owned the distinction was more nominal than eal for the devotos would abuse freedoms someimes and those who were distinguished by the name  hitts were often very honest at the same me there was an ingenious treatise came out with e title of good advice to husbands in which they  counseled not to trust too much to their wives ning the doctrine of unlimited conjugal fidelity d so to neglect family duty and a due watchfulness over the manners of their wives that the greatest security to husbands was a vigorous constitution good usage of their wives and keeping them from temptation many husbands having been sufferers by their trusting too much to general professions as was exemplified in the case of a foolish and negligent husband who trusting to the efficacy of this principle was undone by his wifes elopement from him  chap ii an account of the conference between mrs bull and don diego dismallo don diego is it possible cousin bull that you can forget the honorable maxims of the family you are come of and break your word with three of the honestest best meaning persons in the world esquire south frog and hocus that have sacrificed their interest to yours it is base to take advantage of their simplicity and credulity and leave them in the lurch at last   mrs bull i am sure they have left my family in a bad condition we have hardly money to go to market and no body will take our words for six pence a very fine spark this esquire south my husband took him in a dirty snottynosd boy it was the business of half the servants to attend him the rogue did bawl and make such a noise sometimes he fell in the fire and burnt his face sometimes broke his shins clambering over the benches often pissed abed and always came in so dirty as if he had been dragged through the kennel at a boardingschool he lost his money at chuckfarthing shufflecap and allfours sold his books pawned his linen which we were always forced to redeem then the whole generation of him are so in love with bagpipes and poppet shows i wish you knew what my husband has paid at the pastry cooks and confectioners for naples biscuit tarts custards and sweetmeats all this while my husband considered him as a gentleman of a good family that had fallen into decay gave him good education and has settled him in a good credible way of living having procured him by his interest one of the best places of the country and what return think you does this fine gentleman make us he will hardly give me or my husband a good word or a civil expression instead of plain sir and madam which though i say it is our do he calls us goody and gaffer such a one that he did us a great deal honor to board with us huffs and dings at such a rate because we will not spend the little we have left to get him the title and estate of lord strutt and then forsooth we shall have the honor to be his woollendrapers   d diego and would you lose the honor of so noble and generous an undertaking would you rather accept the scandalous composition and trust that old rogue lewis baboon   mrs bull look you friend diego if we law it on till lewis turns honest i am afraid our credit will run low at blackwellhall i wish every man had his own but i still say that lord strutts money shines as bright and chinks as well as esquire souths i dont know any other hold that we tradesmen have of these great folks but their interest buy dear and sell cheap and i will warrant ye you will keep your customer the worst is that lord strutts servants have got such a haunt about that old rogues shop that it will cost us many a firkin of strong beer to bring them back again and the longer they are in a bad road the harder it will be to get them out of it   d diego but poor frog what has he done on my conscience if there be an honest sincere man in the world it is that frog   mrs bull i think i need not tell you how much frog has been obliged to our family from his childhood he carries his head high now but he had never been the man he is without our help ever since the commencement of this lawsuit it has been the business of hocus in sharing our expenses to plead for frog poor frog says he is in hard circumstances he has a numerous family and lives from hand to mouth his children dont eat a bit of good victuals from one years end to the other but live upon salt herring sour crud and borecole he does his utmost poor fellow to keep things even in the world and has exerted himself beyond his ability in this lawsuit but he really has not wherewithal to go on what signifies this hundred pounds place it upon your side of the account it is a great deal to poor frog and a trifle to you this has been hocuss constant language and i am sure he has had obligations enough to us to have acted another part   d diego no doubt hocus meant all this for the best but he is a tenderhearted charitable men frog is indeed in hard circumstances   mrs bull hard circumstances i swear this is provoking to the last degree all the time of the lawsuit as fast as i have mortgaged frog has purchased from a plain tradesman with a shop warehouse and a countryhutt with a dirty fish pond at the end of it he is now grown a very rich country gentleman with a noblelanded estate noble palaces manors parks gardens and farms finer than any we were ever master of is it not strange when my husband disbursd great sums every term frog should be purchasing some new farm or manor so that if this lawsuit lasts he will be far the richest man in his country what is worse than all this he steals away my customers every day i have twelve of the richest and the best that have left my shop by his persuasion and whom to my certain knowledge he has under bonds never to return again judge you if this be neighbourly dealing   d diego frog is indeed pretty close in his dealings but very honest you are so touchy and take things so hotly i am sure there must be some mistake in this   mrs bull a plaguey one indeed you know and have often told me of it how hocus and those rogues kept my husband john bull drunk for five years together with punch and strong waters i am sure he never went one night sober to bed till they got him to sign the strangest deed that ever you saw in your life the methods they took to manage him i will tell you another time at present i will only read the writing  articles of agreement betwixt john bull clothier and nicholas frog linnendraper i that for maintaining the ancient good correspondence and friendship between the said parties i nicholas frog do solemnly engage and promise to keep peace in john bulls family that neither his wife children nor servants give him any trouble disturbance or molestation whatsoever but to oblige them all to do their duty quietly in their respective stations and whereas the said john bull from the assured confidence that he has in my friendship has appointed me executor of his last will and testament and guardian to his children i do undertake for me my heirs and assigns to see the same duly execused and performed and that it shall be unalterable in all its parts by john bull or any body else for that purpose it shall be lawful and allowable for me to enter his house at any hour of the day or night to break open bars bolts and doors chests of drawers and strong boxes in order to secure the peace of my friend john bulls family and to see his will duly executed  ii in consideration of which kind neighbourly office of nicholas frog in that he has been pleased to accept of the foresaid trust i john bull having duly considered that my friend nicholas frog at this time lives in a marshy soil and unwholesome air infested with fogs and damps destructive of the health of himself wife and children do bind and oblige me my heirs and assigns to purchase for the said nicholas frog with the best and readiest of my cash bonds mortgages goods and chattels a landed estate with parks gardens palaces rivers fields and outlets consisting of as large extent as the said nicholas frog shall think fit and whereas the said nicholas frog is at present hemmed in too close by the grounds of lewis baboon master of the science of defense i the said john bull do oblige my self with the readiest of my cash to purchase and enclose the said grounds for as many fields and acres as the said nicholas shall think fit to the intent that the said nicholas may have free egress and regress without let or molestation suitable to the demands of himself and family  iii furthermore the said john bull obliges himself to make the countryneighbours of nicholas frog allot a certain part of yearly rents to pay for the repairs of the said landed estate to the intent that his good friend nicholas frog may be eased of all charges  iv and whereas the said nicholas frog did contract with the deceased lord strutt about certain liberties privileges and immunities formerly in the possession of the said john bull i the said john bull do freely by these presents renounce quit and make over to the said nicholas the liberties privileges and immunities contracted for in as full manner as if they never had belonged to me  v the said john bull obliges himself his heirs and assigns not to sell one rag of broad or course cloth to any gentleman within the neighborhood of the said nicholas except in such quantities and such rates as the said nicholas shall think fit  signed and sealed john bull nic frog    the reading of this paper put mrs bull in such a passion that she fell downright into a fit and they were forced to give her a good quantity of the spirit of hartshorn before she recovered  d diego why in such a passion cousin considering your circumstances at that time i dont think this such an unreasonable contract you see frog for all this is religiously true to his bargain he scorns to hearken to any competition without your privacy   mrs bull you know the contrary read that letter  reads the superscription for lewis baboon master of the noble science of defense sir i understand that you are at this time treating with my friend john bull about restoring the lord strutts custom and besides allowing him certain privileges of parks and fish ponds i wonder how you that are a man that knows the world can talk with that simple fellow he has been my bubble these twenty years and to my certain knowledge understands no more of his own affairs than a child in swadlingcloaths i know he has got a sort of a pragmatical silly jade of a wife that pretends to take him out of my hands but you and she both will find your selves mistaken i will find those that shall manage her and for him he dares as well be hanged as make one step in his affairs without my consent if you will give me what you promised him i will make all things easy and stop the deeds of ejectment against lord strutt if you will not take what follows i shall have a good action against you for pretending to rob me of my bubble take this warning from  your loving friend nic frog     i am told cousin diego you are one of those that have undertaken to manage me and that you have said you will carry a green eag your self rather than we shall make an end of our lawsuit i will teach them and you too to manage   d diego for gods sake madam why so choleric i say this letter is some forgery it never entered into the head of that honest man nic frog to do any such think   mrs bull i cannot abide you you have been railing these twenty years at esquire south frog and hocus calling them rogues and pickpockets and now they are turned the honestest fellows in the world what is the meaning of all this   d diego pray tell me how you came to employ this sir roger in your affairs and not think of your old friend diego   mrs bull so so there it pinches to tell you truth i have employed sir roger in several weighty affairs and have found him trusty and honest and the poor man always scorned to take a farthing of me i have abundance that profess great zeal but they are damnable greedy of the pence my husband and i are now in such circumstances that we must be served upon cheaper terms than we have been   d diego well cousin i find i can do no good with you i am sorry that you will ruin your self by trusting this sir roger   chap iv how the guardians of the deceased mrs bulls three daughters came to john and what advice they gave him wherein is briefly treated the characters of the three daughters also john bulls answer to the three guardians i told you in my first part that mrs bull before she departed this life had blessed john with three daughters i need not here repeat their names neither would i willingly use any scandalous reflections upon young ladies whose reputations ought to be very tenderly handled but the characters of these were so well known in the neighborhood that it is doing them no injury to make a short description of them  the eldest was a termagant imperious prodigal lewd profligate wench as ever breathed she used to rantipole about the house pinch the children kick the servants and torture the cats and the dogs she would rob her fathers strong box for money to give the young fellows that she was fond of she had a noble air and something great in her mein but such a noisome infectious breath as threw all the servants that dressed her into consumptions if she smelt to the freshest nosegay it would shrivel and wither as it had been blighted she used to come home in her cups and break the china and the lookingglasses and was of such an irregular temper and so entirely given up to her passion that you might argue as well with the northwind as with her ladyship so expensive that the income of three dukedoms was not enough to supply her extravagance hocus loved her best believing her to be his own got upon the body of mrs bull  the second daughter born a year after her sister was a peevish froward illconditiond creature as ever was born ugly as the devil lean haggard pale with saucer eyes a sharp nose and hunchbackd but active sprightly and diligent about her affairs her illcomplexion was occasioned by her bad diet which was coffee morning noon and night she never rested quietly a bed but used to disturb the whole family with shrieking out in her dreams and plague them next day with interpreting them for she took them all for gospel she would cry out murder and disturb the whole neighborhood and when john came running down stairs to enquire what the matter was nothing forsooth only her maid had stuck a pin wrong in her gown she turned away one servant for putting too much oil in her sallad and another for putting too little salt in her watercruel but such as by flattery had procured her esteem she would indulge in the greatest crimes her father had two coachmen when one was in the coachbox if the coach swung but the least to one side she used to shriek so loud that all the street concluded she was overturned but though the other was eternally drunk and had overturned the whole family she was very angry with her father for turning him away then she used to carry tales and stories from one to another till she had set the whole neighborhood together by the ears and this was the only diversion she took pleasure in she never went abroad but she brought home such a bundle of monstrous lies as would have amazed any mortal but such as knew her of a whale that had swallowed a fleet of ships of the lions being let out of the tower to destroy the protestant religion of the popes being seen in a brandy shop at wapping and a prodigious strong man that was going to shove down the cupola of pauls of three millions of five pound pieces that esquire south had found under an old wall of blazingstars flying dragons and abundance of such stuff all the servants in the family made high court to her for she domineered there and turned out and in whom she pleased only there was an old grudge between her and sir roger whom she mortally hated and used to hire fellows to squirt kennel water upon him as he passed along the streets so that he was forced constantly to wear a surtout of oild cloth by which means he came home pretty clean except where the surtout was a little scanty  as for the third she was a thief and a common mercenary prostitute and that without any solicitation from nature for she owned she had no enjoyment she had no respect of persons a prince or a porter was all one according as they paid yea she would leave the finest gentleman in the world to go to an ugly pocky fellow for six pence more in the practice of her profession she had amassed vast magazines of all sorts of things she had above five hundred suits of fine clothes and yet went abroad like a cynderwench she robbed and starved all the servants so that no body could live near her  so much for johns three daughters which you will say were rarities to be fond of yet nature will show it self no body could blame their relations for taking care of them and therefore it was that hocus with two other of the guardians thought it their duty to take care of the interest of the three girls and give john their best advice before he compounded the lawsuit  hocus what makes you so shy of late my good friend there is no body loves you better than i nor has taken more pains in your affairs as i hoped to be saved i would do any thing to serve you i would crawl upon all four to serve you i have spent my health and paternal estate in your service i have indeed a small pittance left with which i might retire and with as good a conscience as any man but the thoughts of this disgraceful composition so touches me to the quick that i cannot sleep after i had brought the cause to the last stroke that one verdict more had quite ruined old lewis and lord strutt and put you in the quiet possession of every thing then to compound i cannot bear it this cause was my favorite i had set my heart upon it it is like an only child i cannot endure it should miscarry for god sake consider only to what a dismal condition old lewis is brought he is at an end of all his cash his attorneys have hardly one trick left they are at an end of all their chicane besides he has both his law and his daily bread now upon trust hold out only one term longer and i will warrant you before the next we shall have him in the fleet i will bring him to the pillory his ears shall pay for his perjuries for the love of god dont compound let me be damned if you have a friend in the world that loves you better than i there is no body can say i am covetous or that i have any interest to pursue but yours    d guardian there is nothing so plain than that this lewis has a design to ruin all his neighboring tradesmen and at this time he has such a prodigious income by his trade of all kinds that if there is not some stop put to his exorbitant riches he will monopolize every thing and no body will be able to sell a yard of drapery or mercery ware but himself i therefore hold it advisable that you continue the lawsuit and burst him at once my concern for the three poor motherless children obliges me to give you this advice for their estates poor girls depend upon the success of this cause    d guardian i own this writ of ejectment has cost dear but then consider it is a jewel well worth the purchasing at the price of all you have none but mr bulls declared enemies can say he has any other security for his clothing trade but the ejectment of lord strutt the only question then that remains to be decided is who shall stand the expenses of the suit to which the answer is as plain who but he that is to have the advantage of the sentence when esquire south has got possession of his title and honor is not john bull to be his clothier who then but john ought to put him in possession ask but any indifferent gentleman who ought to bear his charges at law and he will readily answer his tradesmen i do therefore affirm and i will go to death with it that being his clothier you ought to put him in quiet possession of his estate and with the same generous spirit you have begun it complete the good work if you persist in the bad measures you are now in what must become of the three poor orphans my heart bleeds for the poor girls   john bull you are all very eloquent persons but give me leave to tell you that you express a great deal of more concern for the three girls than for me i think my interest ought to be considered in the first place as for you hocus i cannot but say you have managed my lawsuit with great address and much to my honor and though i say it you have been well paid for it never was attorneys bill more extravagant and give me leave to say there are many articles which the most griping of your profession never demanded i have trusted you with the disbursing great sums of money and you have constantly sunk some into your own pocket i tell you i dont like that sinking why must the burden be taken off frogs back and laid upon my shoulders he can drive about his own parks and fields in his gilt chariot when i have been forced to mortgage my estate his note will go farther than my bond is it not matter of fact that from the richest tradesman in all the country i am reduced to beg and borrow from scriveners and usurers that suck the heart blood and guts out of me and what was all this for did you like frogs countenance better than mine was not i your old friend and relation have i not presented you nobly have i not clad your whole family have you not had an hundred yards at a time of the finest cloth in my shop why must the rest of the tradesmen be not only indemnified from charges but forbid to go on with their own business and what is more their concern than mine as to holding out this term i appeal to your own conscience has not that been your constant discourse these six years one term more and old lewis goes to pot if thou art so fond of my cause be generous for once and lend me a brace of thousands ah hocus hocus i know thee not a sous to save me from goal i trow look ye gentlemen i have lived with credit in the world and it grieves my heart never to stir out of my doors but to be pulled by the sleeve by some rascally dun or another sir remember my bill there is a small concern of a thousand pounds i hope you think on it sir and to have these usurers transact my debts at coffeehouses and alehouses as if i were going to breakup shop lord that ever the rich the generous john bull clothier the envy of all his neighbors should be brought to compound his debts for five shillings in the pound and to have his name in an advertisement for a statute of bankrupt the thoughts of it makes me mad i have read somewhere in the apocrypha that one should not consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous nor with a merchant concerning exchange nor with a buyer of selling nor with an unmerciful man of kindness etc i could have added one thing more nor with an attorney about compounding a lawsuit this ejectment of lord strutt will never do the evidence is crimp the witnesses swear backwards and forwards and contradict themselves and his tenants stick by him if it were practicable is it reasonable that when esquire south is losing his money to sharpers and pickpockets going about the country with fiddlers and buffoons and squandring his income with hawks and dogs i should lay out the fruits of my honest industry in a lawsuit for him only upon the hopes of being his clothier and when the cause is over i shall not have the benefit of my project for want of money to go to market look ye gentlemen john bull is but a plain man but john bull knows when he is ill used i know the infirmity of our family we are apt to play the booncompanion and throw away our money in our cups but it was an unfair thing in you gentlemen to take advantage of my weakness to keep a parcel of roaring bulleys about me day and night with huzzas and huntinghorns and ringing the changes on butchers cleavers never to let me cool and make me set my hands to papers when i could hardly hold my pen there will come a day of reckoning for all that proceeding in the mean time gentlemen i beg you will let me into my affairs a little and that you would not grudge me very small remainder of a very great estate   chap v esquire souths message and letter to mrs bull the arguments used by hocus and the rest of the guardians had hitherto proved insufficient john and his wife could not be persuaded to bear the expense of esquire souths lawsuit they thought it reasonable that since he was to have the honor and advantage he would bear the greatest share of the charges and retrench what he lost to sharpers and spent upon countrydances and puppetplays to apply it to that use this was not very grateful to the esquire therefore as the last experiment he was resolved to send signior benenato master of his foxhounds to mrs bull to try what good he could do with her this signior benenato had all the qualities of a fine gentleman that were fit to charm a ladys heart and if any person in the world could have persuaded her it was he but such was her unshaken fidelity to her husband and the constant purpose of her mind to pursue his interest that the most refined arts of gallantry that were practiced could not seduce her loyal heart the necklaces diamond crosses and rich bracelets that were offered she rejected with the utmost scorn and disdain the music and serenades that were given her sounded more ungratefully in her ears than the noise of a screech owl however she received esquire souths letter by the hands of signior benenato with that respect which became his quality the copy of the letter is as follows in which you will observe he changes a little his usual style  madam the writ of ejectment against philip baboon pretended lord strutt is just ready to pass there wants but a few necessary forms and a verdict or two more to put me in the quiet possession of my honor and estate i question not but that according to your wonted generosity and goodness you will give it the finishing stroke an honor that i would grudge any body but your self in order to ease you of some part of the charges i promise to furnish pen ink and paper provided you pay for the stamps besides i have ordered my steward to pay out of the readiest and best of my rents five pounds ten shillings a year till my suit is finished i wish you health and happiness being with due respect  madam your assured friend south   what answer mrs bull returned to this letter you shall know in my third part only they were at a pretty good distance in their proposals for as esquire south only offered to be at the charges of pen ink and paper mrs bull refused any more than to lend her barge to carry his counsel to westminster hall  finis books sold by j morphew near stationers hall law is a bottomlesspit exemplified in the case of the lord strut john ball nicholas frog and lewis baboon who
