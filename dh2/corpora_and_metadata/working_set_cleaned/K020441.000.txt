tom jones  price one shilling and six pence  tom jones a comic opera as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  by joseph reed  the second edition  london printed for becket and de hondt in the strand and richardson and urquhart at the royal exchange  mdcclxix  preface it is needless to say the following opera is taken from fieldings celebrated novel of tom jones a production so replete with wit humor and character that it can never want admirers while the english language remains my extreme veneration for the memory of the trulywitty and ingenious novelist naturally led me to preserve as much of fielding throughout my opera as the nature of my plan would allow nay when it was thought necessary to shorten the piece lest it should be too long in representation i readily parted with my own to retain as much as possible of the invaluable original  i have made many material deviations from the novel both in point of fable and character i have stripped its hero of his libertinism to render him as i imagined more amiable and interesting and have metamorphosd parson supple into a country squire to avoid giving offense to the cloth the characters of western and honor i have divested of their provinciality lest the attention of the performers to the pronunciation of an uncouth and difficult dialect should produce an inattention to the more material business of the drama i have also endeavored to purge westerns character of its coarseness and indelicacy in conformity to the refined taste of the present age and of its jacobitism from an opinion that such political sect no longer exists as well as from a conviction that nothing of party should ever appear within the walls of a theater  while i was writing the last act of this opera which was in june      the french tom jones fell into my hands i found its plan so very confined and so materially different from mine that i could reap little or no benefit from it the only particulars of which i have availed myself from mons poinsinet are the hint of legitimating jones and the thought which gave rise to my second air i have quoted the lines from which i received advantage in the latter instance  que les devoirs que tu mimposes triste raison ont de rigueur tu gemis sophie and tu noses tinterroger sur ta douleur quand sous tes doigts naissent les roses les epines sont dans ton coeur

jones runs in your head   so mr jones runs in my head what is mr jones to me   hon nothing maam he is not a proper match for you to be sure with your fortune you may command one of the greatest lords of the land therefore you will not certainly stoop to marry a beggar and a foundling   so i dont know what you mean by taking these liberties with mr jones the misfortune of his birth is not his crime   hon maam if it was a disgrace mr jones has a great many people that carry their heads very high to keep him in countenance  well he is one of the sweetest gentlemen that ever trod on shoeleather every body likes him all the neighborhood for five miles round would run through fire and water for him  if i were in your clothes and he loved me as much as i believe he loves you    so loves me honor i dont understand you   hon maam i may be mistaken it is true because as the man says we can be sure of nothing in this world but death and taxes however i could tell you something that looks very like it   so ay pray what is that honor   hon he came into the room as i was sitting at work and what should be upon the table but the muff you gave me and my gentleman whips his hands into it la mr jones you will spoil it says i but he still kept his hands in it and kissed it and mumbled it and kissed it  for my part i never saw such kisses in my life as he gave it   so when was this   hon let me see  it was the day after i dreamt that i was married to sir timothy tipple  last thursday  ay it was on thursday  but that is not all neither  yesterday as you were playing on the harpsichord he was in the next room and looked melancholy  says i what is the matter mr jones a penny for your thoughts  hussy says he starting up as from a dream what can i be thinking of when that angel your mistress is playing  but i am afraid youre offended maam   so no no  proceed   hon then squeezing my hand  he squeezed so hard that i thought he would have forced the blood out of my fingerends  oh mrs honor says he how happy will that man be  and then he sighed  upon my faith his breath is as sweet as a nosegay  but for heavens sake maam dont speak of this for he gave me a guinea never to mention it however as i did not swear it it is only a promise and what signifies a promise  air set by mr arnold at court where true breeding abounds they never let promises bind em in country in cities in towns it is likewise the mode not to mind em to promises never give trust of truth they are seldom the token the old proverb says a pyecrust and a promise were made to be broken  so honor if you will never mention this affair again i will not be angry with you it may come to my fathers ears and he would be displeased at mr jones though i really believe he meant no harm   hon harm maam i am positive sure he meant no harm  yes honor says he i am neither such a coxcomb nor such a villian as to look upon her in any other light but as my goddess and as such i will always worship and adore her while i have breath  this was all maam so you plainly see he meant no harm   so well well let me hear no more of this  i will take a walk in the garden  takes up a muff lord what an odious muff is

witnesses of our weakness  air set by mr arnold that passion which harrows the soul by reason we strive to remove but reasons too weak to control a passion so powerful as love then why this vain war with desire resistance but doubles the smart the more i oppose the fierce fire it rages the more in my heart  enter honor with a muff hon here it is maam gives it to sophia   so thank you dear honor  i will wear it again instead of it you may take the lutestring night town   hon maam i am very much obliged to you  exit soph sighing and kissing the muff a lutestring nightgown for an old muff  to be

come and tear it in pieces   so runs and snatches the muff i would not have it torn in pieces for a thousand pounds   jon o the enchanting angel   was a thousand pounds it was hardly ever worth a thousand farthings  but i know you say this by way of contradiction youre like your mother for that   so would i could be like her in every thing for she was one of the worthiest women upon earth   was why there was not a worse wife in all christendom than she made she would sit you sulk sulk sulking from days end to days end and all only because her father forced her to marry me she had no more affection for me to the hour of her death than if i had been an egyptian mummy or a russian bear  sophia bursts into tears and exit ay this is always madams way when i talk about her mother  but we

this author elucidates the affair of continental connexions in a most masterly manner and his reasoning upon the national debt and internal and external taxation is unanswerable  brother your servant i want to have a little talk with you  nay you need not go mr supple it is nothing but what may be mentioned in your presence   was well what is it about sister   mrs was pray have not you observed something very extraordinary in your daughter of late   was not i   mrs was nor you mr supple   sup not i madam   mrs was gentlemen i am absolutely astonished at your blindness   was why is there any thing the matter with the girl   mrs was yes i think there is and of much consequence too   was if any thing be the matter acquaint me with it at once for you know i love her more than my own soul   mrs was nay nay the disorder is not so very dangerous  i believe gentlemen you are both pretty well convinced  you more especially mr supple  that i know the world   sup not one person on the whole globe knows it so well as yourself   was that is a damned  i know what aside   mrs was nay now cousin that is going rather too far the globe you know is of very extraordinary circumference and there are undoubtedly persons on it some few persons who perhaps may exceed  at least equal me in that particular  well i promise you i was never more deceived in my life if my niece be not    was what what   mrs was most desperately in love   was how in love fall in love without asking me leave i will disinherit her i will turn her out of doors   mrs was this is so like you always in a passion before you know why   was zounds dont i know    mrs was you know nothing nothing in the world there is scarce a less intellectual being in the creation  suppose now she should have fixed upon the very person whom you yourself would wish i hope you would not be angry then   was no no no that makes a wide difference if she only marries the man i would have her she may love any body she pleases   mrs was brother i must compliment you on the increase of your understanding for this is positively the most sensible expression that ever escaped you  i will disclaim all knowledge of the world if the person my niece has chosen be not the very person you would choose for her   was but who is he   mrs was nay even find that out your self you who are so profound a politician  in your own opinion  can be at no great loss that judgment which can penetrate into the cabinets of princes and discern the secret springs which move the statewheels in all the political machines in europe can surely very easily find out what passes in the rude uninformd mind of a girl   was sister dont talk your courtgibberish to me i dont understand the lingo and moreover and besides you know i hate every thing that belongs to the court it is well for thee that you are a woman or i would have lent thee many a flick for talking to me so much courtnonsense i would have thrashd thy jacket for thee i promise thee   mrs was ay ay in that flicking and thrashing lies all your fancied superiority your bodies not your brains are stronger than ours it is with you as with the brute creation in general the greater your bulk and strength the smaller your intellects   was but prithee tell me what you mean about my daughter   mrs was hold a moment while i digest that sovereign contempt i have for your sex  there  now good politic sir with all your prodigious share of supposed sagacity what think you of  mr blisil   was blifil speaking together   sup blifil speaking together   mrs was ay blifil  dont you remember gentlemen she fainted away in the field about a month ago on seeing him lie breathless on the ground in consequence of some hostilities offered him by jones on account of a sarcastic sneer on his illegitimate birth when we came up to the scene of action did not you observe her look pale   sup yes as pale as a playhouseghost i perfectly remember   was before george now you mind me on it i remember it all i knew sophy was a good girl and wouldnt fall in love to make me angry  i was never more rejoiced in my life for nothing can lie so handy as the two estates they are as one may say joined in matrimony already and it would be a thousand pities to part them   sup so it would cousin   was and yet i cannot tell what to think on it for allworthy is such a queer chap that money has no effect on him   sup no effect on him then he must be made of different materials from the rest of mankind  air peggys mill that gold is an idol all people adore their practice evinces most clearly even patriots themselves often grasp at this ore their country scarce loving so dearly let the prelate against riches employ tongue and pen be his eloquence ever so charming only think of his lordships full coffers and then  you will sneer at both preacher and sermon  was but what would you have me do sister   mrs was since you condescend to ask my advice you may propose the match to allworthy yourself there is no indecorum in the proposals coming from a parent king alcinous offers in popes odyssey his daughter to ulysses   was king alcinous offers pope odyssey his daughter ulysses   mrs was brother your ignorance provokes me to smile   was allworthy is gone to visit a sick tenant and will call in his return  suppose i mention the matter   mrs was do so do so and desire him to bring blifil to dine with us tomorrow   was odd rabbit it if allworthy should refuse the match i shall be for lending him a flick as sure as the devils in london for i cannot bear to have my girl slighted   sup dont be afraid of that the match is too advantageous to be refused   mrs was brother do you suppose mr allworthy has more contempt for money because he professes more you would make a fine plenipo at a general congress you would negotiate with these machiavels the french with great dexterity   was i am sure i could make as good a negotiator as you or any political old woman in the nation though we have a great many of them   mrs was you negotiate yes for a few acres of land or a stack of hay   sup here is a quarrel abrewing i had best march exit   was before you women set up for managing state affairs you should learn the needful art of keeping a secret   mrs was i insist on it that we keep secrets better than you hecreatures   was in your intrigues i grant you there you have the advantage of us  no no sister though the folks at the head of affairs are no great conjurers yet they are rather wiser than to trust an old woman with their secrets ha ha ha   mrs was sir youre both a brute and a blockhead and if you had the least spice of intellects or goodmanners you would scorn to use a gentlewoman of my acknowledged abilities in this preposterous manner  notwithstanding your horselaugh it is my happiness to be universally regarded as a phenomenon in the political hemisphere and as a nonpareil in the knowledge of the world  wiser than trust a woman with their secrets  sir i beg leave to tell you there are persons of the first distinction  yes of the very first distinction in the political world who have not thought it beneath their dignity to trust me ay me sir with the most important secrets  and let me tell you further sir i have had the honor of being closetted with a primeminister and consulted on an expedition before it has been communicated to either king or council   was closetted with a primeminister i am afraid sister there has been something more than politics in the case   mrs was how dare you have the effrontery to make so scurrilous and indelicate an innuendo to a woman of my irreproachable character a woman who instead of studying personal embellishments has taken so much pains in adorning her head   was yes yes you do take pains enough to adorn your head you build it up to a monstrous height indeed ecod i cannot help laughing whenever i look at it  air the women attempted some few years ago their lovers to charm with a small head but now in their noddles as bumpy they show as if the whole carcass was all head this fashion the sex of admirers will rob their conquests they certainly push ill in striving to charm with a bolsterdout nob as large as a winchesterbushel exit mrs was was there ever so affronting a savage  wiser than trust a woman with their secrets  he has no more breeding  were it not for his daughter i would depart like an offended ambassador without taking leave   enter sophia reading come hither sophy  what book is that let me see it child  heloisa to abelard  i thought it was something on love  you blush child  ah sophy sophy i know what passes in that little heart of yours more than you imagine  do you think i dont know the reason of your overacting all that friendship for mr blifil the other day  so heavens am i discovered aside   mrs was nay you need not blush it is a passion which both i and your father approve  come constitute and appoint me of your privy council and i will guaranty to you the peaceable possession of your adonis  dont sigh my dear but out with it all  no reserve i conjure you  the affair is already on the carpet and your father is going to have a private audience with mr allworthy in order to propose the match and will invite the heirpresumptive of your affections to dine with us tomorrow   so tomorrow my dear aunt  fetching her breath you frighten me out of my senses   mrs was oh my dear you will soon come to yourself for he is a most charming young fellow   so i must own i dont know another man that seems to have so many good qualities   mrs was yes yes he has a great many indeed i dont wonder at your loving him   so so brave   mrs was and yet so gentle   so so witty   mrs was yet so inoffensive   so so humane so sprightly  speaking both together   mrs was so civil so  speaking both together my dear there is no getting in a word with you   so what signifies the circumstance of his birth when compared with such qualifications   mrs was his birth pray what circumstance is there in the least derogatory to the birth of mr blifil   so mr blifil   mrs was mr blifil ay of whom else have we had this conference   so good heaven of mr jones i thought   mrs was jones and is it possible you can think of allying yourself to illegitimacy the blood of the westerns could never submit to such contamination  you are the first yes miss western you are the very first of your name since the landing of julius caesar that ever entertained so grovelling a thought the female westerns have been proverbially called the dianas of the age since the conquest  and you to defile a stream of blood which has flowed with such purity for so many hundred  centuries   so my dear aunt dont put yourself in so violent a rage   mrs was fall in love with one of spurious origin i thought miss the pride of your family would have restrained such monstrous inclinations  love indeed is well enough in tradespeoples daughters chambermaids and such lowbred reptiles but in a woman of family it is the most ridiculous thing upon earth to the praise of the present nobility be it spoken there is hardly any such thing as love to be met with in our right honorable matches   so but madam    mrs was and you to think of disgracing yourself and family by so vulgar so preposterous a passion  i will to your father this instant and inform him of the grossness the depravity of your affection   so kneeling alas my dear madam    mrs was it is in vain to importune me the match is resolved upon and nothing can nor shall prevent it   air van maldere so dearest aunt attend my prayer let your indignation cease these stern looks my bosom tear have some pity on a niece from this hard this cruel stroke your loved darling kindly save the sad sentence o revoke or you doom me to the grave  mrs was it is all to no purpose  your solicitation is totally inadmissible   so rising but madam you will surely give me time to get the better of my disinclination to mr blifil   mrs was it would be fine politics indeed to protract a siege when the enemys army is at hand and in danger of relieving the town as your heart is in so critical a situation i will do all i can to hasten the match and put your honor out of the care of your family  i shall not acquaint your father with your hopeful passion but if you ever speak to this spurious swain any more he shall know the whole i would therefore advise you to evacuate your heart of its attachment to so inadequate a pretender as jones and turn your thoughts wholly on the intended alliance between you and mr allworthys heirapparent exit   enter honor hon bless me maam what makes you look so sad   so alas honor my father and aunt have resolved on a match between me and mr blifil   hon lord forbid even poor as i am i would scarce have him myself for i cannot abide him  however one comfort is that they cannot force you whether you will or no to marry him  dear maam do not sigh so   so yes i must be sacrificed to familyviews  tormenting thought   air mr bach thirst of wealth too often bewitches the deluded parents heart but can worldly pomp or riches real happiness impart loves the sweetest dearest pleasure to the human heart conveyed those who give up love for treasure quit the substance for the shade exit hon i would not tell her that mr jones was in the garden for fear of offending her  poor soul he is walking by the canal step by step with his arms across and so thoughtful walks as describd i am in a peck of fears and troubles lest he should be throwing himself in  and yet i think i need not be afraid on it for hanging and drowning for love is almost out of fashion  this match with blifil will be a terrible affair to my poor mistress for if love has not already got hold of her little heart i am hugely mistaken  for my part i cannot blame her for liking so charming a man as mr jones  air had i quite clear in land a year full twenty thousand pound and did surpass the fairest lass that ever trod the ground though dukes and lords with stars and swords should court while courtings good for him alone i would slight each don i wish i may die but i would he is in truth a wellmade youth and of the sweetest mein whoever his wife she will lead a life as happy as a queen no courtly dame need think it shame to wed if he should woo no swain i know could charm me so i wish i may die if i do  runs off singing scene a garden jones jon there can be no hopes of her fathers consent and mr allworthy would never pardon an attempt to marry her without it  nay i could scarce pardon myself conscience teaches me that to repay the friendships of hospitality by this worst kind of robbery is to be the meanest the basest of all robbers  yet is there not a great difference between clandestinely marrying a friends daughter from a motive of love and doing it from a sordid motive of interest  certainly  but then her father would disclaim her and shall i whose sole support flows from mr allworthys unmerited bounty involve her in my distress her who has been brought up with such tenderness elegance and delicacy  that that has determined me  no no no let me not make her unhappy however miserable i may be myself  i must think no more of her  air dr arne what pity that nature has cast between us this distance in life when nearness in temper and taste has formed us for husband and wife sold hymen my passion befriend how sweet were each conjugal kiss such raptures our loves would attend that angels might envy my bliss enter sophia miss western your most obedient  this is an unexpected pleasure indeed   so the fineness of the weather has tempted me out  here is a heavenly afternoon and the reflection of the sun upon the water makes the canal appear remarkably beautiful  i fancy mr jones you have some little shuddering when you see that water   jon shuddering my dear madam why   so you cannot have forgot though it is so long ago your plunge into the canal when the bough broke as you were climbing the tree to recover your little namesake   jon i assure you madam the concern which you felt for the loss of your bird will always appear to me the highest circumstance of that boyish adventure   so upon my word mr jones your gallantry had very nearly cost you your life   jon madam if i have any reason to reflect with sorrow it is that the water was not a little deeper   so sure you cannot be in earnest this affected contempt of life is only an excess of your complaisance you would endeavor to lessen the obligation of having ventured it twice on my account  you know it was last year in danger when you broke your arm by leaping off your horse to prevent mine from throwing me  you have escaped twice but beware the third time looks at him very languishingly   jon oh miss western can you desire me to live can you wish me so ill   so indeed mr jones i  i  i dont wish you ill i dont indeed   jon madam you wish me ill if you wish me to live for life begins to be insupportable  your caution comes too late the mischief is already done   so nay now i dont understand you   jon my dear miss western i would not be understood  i know not what i say  meeting you here so unexpectedly i have been unguarded i have uttered that which i had resolved everlastingly to bury in this bosom  pardon me most angelic creature if i have said any thing to offend you   so mr jones i will not affect to misunderstand you but if you have any regard for me let me make the best of my way into the house  i wish i may be able to support myself thither   jon i must first entreat your forgiveness of that which love has forced from me entirely against my will   so you have my forgiveness mr jones fortune not sophia is your enemy

into play and swelled the expenses of life even dowerless beauty could sway each youth in the choice of a wife but now such a chargeable train of wants has the conjugal state that women should only be

our own affairs and leave those of the grand duke to some other time   mrs was then prithee make haste for we have yet above a column and a half to go through  what do say brother i am as impatient to be gone as a vigilant general is to steal a march of the enemy  come dispatch dispatch   was as blifil is in the house suppose he and sophy should have a meeting immediately   mrs was that requires some consideration  looking on the gazette why  a  yes  no  certainly  by no means   was mimicking her yes  no  certainly  by no means  the devils in the woman to be sure it is confounded hard that you will not give a body a direct answer  nay what signifies my talking  you cannot hear a syllable while you have have that damned gazette in your hand unless i speak as loud as a thunderclap speaking very loud   mrs was with surprise brother   was i ask if they may not as well have a meeting immediately   mrs was who have a meeting   was zounds sophy and blifil   mrs was bless me how you

my situation i can never marry this man  shall i then turn rebel against a fathers authority and violate one of the strongest obligations that nature has imposed on us i shudder at the thought   air set by mr arnold duty is natures strongest law a tie that all should have in view a debt of gratitude love awe to every tender parent due by heaven it is stamped upon our frames in polished minds it shines the most the wretch that dutys bond disclaims must be to every virtue lost sits down in a musing posture and yet methinks duty cannot demand the sacrifice of my own happiness surely neither

fortunes of both families but compass a most desirable point the expulsion of jones  the marriage must be hurried on as fast as possible i begin to have some ugly fears about dowling it is very lucky

observe the queens affairs will receive great benefit from the strength of the emperor   sup i hope you will now indulge me with an audience on our own affairs   mrs was then make it your audience of
