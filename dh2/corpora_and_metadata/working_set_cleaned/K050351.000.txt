some considerations on the reasonableness and necessity of increasing and encouraging the seamen  founded on the gracious expressions in their favor contained in his majestys speech from the throne  with some proposed schemes for the effectual performing it without prejudice either to the navy or the commerce  never made public before  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane mdccxxviii price one shilling  preface a proposal so evidently calculated for the public as this is seems to want no preface and should have none but for that dreadful principle of uncharitableness which rages among some people who search for evil in every thing offered by a hand they do not like and seek not to be served or pleased but to find fault  let such know that the author of this tract thus acting without gain or reward equally satisfied in his own sincere endeavor for the public interest whether accepted or rejected and wholly neglecting anyother testimonial depends upon time and truth for his vindication  what is here offered is upon a point his majesty has declared to be important and experience has showed has been always difficult that difficulty was the spring of these thoughts and his majestys speech the spirit that gave them motion and the author cannot doubt but his end being sincerely the same the endeavor will at least give no offense  he could have gone farther in schemes for accomplishing the great work of encouraging seamen but he is no projector and desires not to be officious  some considerations on the reasonableness and necessity of increasing and encouraging the seamen chap i a state of the seamens case whether their numbers are decreased or not and whether they are under discouragements or not what those discouragements are and by what ways their grievances may be redressed  the subject of this tract though it will be handled in a new and different manner from what has been done before is not new in itself nor is the end and design of it new though the methods proposed will be so many attempts have been made as well in this age as in the last in behalf of the poor seamen or at least said to be so and much fruitless unsuccessful pains has been taken to show us the necessity of entering into some just measures for their increase and encouragement but they have indeed been fruitless and unsuccessful because they have been weak and unperforming  however these frequent attempts are a concurrence of testimonies to the importance of the subject and serve to let us see that it has all along been looked upon as a thing the nation greatly wanted that it was well worth the consideration of those that had the prosperity of their country at heart and that it would be a singular service to the public to find if possible a remedy for a thing which was so sensible a grievance to the whole nation and yet so difficult to be redressed  but in all the attempts or essays made on this subject at least such as have been made public i have observed they have rather run out into long exclamations upon the grievance itself crying out against the oppression of the seamen the frauds committed by their officers the violence of impressing landmen instead of sailors tearing them in an injurious manner from their families their trades and employments to carry them on board the ships of war where they are useless ignorant untractable and rather burdensome than serviceable likewise the impressing seamen who are really such in an illegal manner as particularly taking them out of merchantships after protections granted them and while those ships lay upon demorage and at the expense of victuals and wages to the ruin of the voyage both to merchants and owners these and many other oppressions and injuries to the seamen and to the merchants things really great and of consequence in themselves are the main subject of these complaints and we find them frequently enlarged upon in former writings very emphatically  but the deficiency lies here that in all that has been said on those heads the complaints take up the whole or the main of their discourses with perhaps a warm recommendation to the public or to the parliament to take it into their serious consideration but very few if any of all those labored pieces at least that i have met with enter into the grand question how and which way these things shall be remedied what specific may be proposed for the effectual redress of the grievance or in a word how or which way the seamen shall be increased or encouraged and this defect we shall now endeavor to supply  it is most certain that as to encourage the seamen is to increase them so by the discouragements which they have met with the numbers of them have been very much decreased and diminished and that not only at this time but in former reigns insomuch that the public has been made sensible of the scarcity of seamen by the difficulty of raising them on any sudden emergence which difficulty has been such that no undertaking of importance and which required extraordinary expedition could be entered upon till a sufficient number of men could be procured which was always a work of time  this frequently retarded the preparations in a most remarkable manner as in the time of the dutch wars during the reign of king charles ii and gave the dutch sometimes opportunity to appear armed upon our coast and insult our ports before our fleets were able for want of seamen to go out to sea and not to look back so far the very same defect gave the french the like advantage against us several times during the late war as particularly at the engagement off of beachy in the year    0 or thereabout and on several other occasions which it is needless to repeat  nor is the increase and encouragement of seamen merely as seamen the whole substance of the thing proposed but the encouragement of them as his majesty expresses it in his speech that they may he invited not compelled to enter into the service of their country this is the point in hand as to the merchants service it is a thing by itself and may be spoken of apart but the public service i say is the point before me and for which the seamen are to be both increased and encouraged and for the bringing of which effectually to pass this tract is made public  in all the former essays of this kind mentioned above this has been pretended and we have often been made to expect it by flourishing titles and boasting preambles but little has been offered to make it practicable every body allowed it was a necessary and useful work that it ought to be done that the public occasions called for it that justice to the poor seamen required it and that in a word it was almost every bodys concern to put their helping hands to such a work if it was in their power to do any thing toward it but whenever they came to consider as the house terms it of ways and means to bring it to pass they could say very little to the purpose it proved a long perplexed case to enter upon the debate of on the writers side and a dry barren subject on the readers side so that in short the world began to be sick of reading their tedious calculations and most people thought they knew little of the matter  in consequence of this as it often happens in knotty and perplexed schemes all the proposals that i have yet seen or heard of left the case just where they found it or rather as it is said of job and his comforters they darkened counsel with words without knowledge they said little but what had been said before and the world seemed not one jot the wiser for all their projects the grievance run on in the old road of confusion and disorder and the poor seamen were but just where they were  0 or  0 years ago besides groaning under additional abuses and impositions violences and injuries as well private as public  during these hardships the numbers of seamen visibly declined and those that were left were very hardly and not without the utmost reluctance brought into the public service and about as well as a little before the time of the late revolution it was a difficulty not easy to be got over to raise seamen to man  0 or  0 men of war and not at all without time  king william was very sensible of this and found the inconveniences of it in the very first equipment after the revolution some of the seamen fled from the service in public resentment and on party reasons some listened to french allurements and took pay in the navies of the enemy many fled abroad and kept out in the merchants service because of the advance of pay some one way some another and some too many indeed unhappily turned pirates  several proclamations were published to invite them home but to little purpose some threatening them with punishment if they continued abroad in foreign service but all with very little effect at length they thought of a method since worn out and threadbare if you will pardon me that word i mean of giving a bountymoney to the seamen by way of advance to engage them to come in at first it answered the end pretty well and abundance of seamen bit at the bait i will not say were caught upon the hook but they were brought into the service by it  but as this was but a temporary thing the seamen began to make light of it and that perhaps more than they ought to have done so that in a few years the government found bounties and little advances upon the first entrance of seamen did not fully answer the end and the want of seamen was greatly detrimental to the service every year and especially at the first sitting out of the fleets the service calling for more men every year than other for several years together  it is true that the public at length employing so exceeding great numbers of seamen as well for winter as summerservice and as well in the transport service as in the men of war the number increased as it were by the consequence of the service so that the war itself might be said to breed up its own seamen also the regiments of marines serving long on board assisted to this increase and the soldier serving always on board the fleet became so acquainted with the sea and with the proper business of sailors that in few years they dropped off from the regiments got their discharges of their officers and entered themselves before the mast and it was particularly observed that at the end of the war when those regiments were broke and disbanded almost all the men turned sailors and entered themselves on board the man of war or merchant ships as they could get employment  besides this among the great number of vagrant unsettled people who entered into the service by virtue of the several acts of parliament made in those reigns abundance of them proving diligent and applying themselves to the work of which they understood nothing before became able seamen and increased the number of the general tarfraternity so that at last the number of seamen seemed to be sufficient to the service at least the ships were more easily manned than before  had not this been the case how could england have sustained the loss of so many thousand seamen as must necessarily have dropped off during the continuance of that tedious and to the sailors fateaguing war i make no doubt but during the wars with france in the two reigns of king william and queen anne above  0000 english seamen went to the bottom by battle disease and disaster and if other people who pretend to understand it may judge i am very much within compass in my calculations  it is true trade suffered great losses and convulsions during those reigns and in particular met with great obstruction so that as the navy royal employed many thousands of seamen more than ever before trade most certainly employed fewer ships and consequently fewer men hence the gross of the seamen were then employed and to the end of that war in the royal navy  but as we have lived to see those wars ended and a glorious pacific interval succeeding the navy royal some squadrons excepted laid up and trade beginning to extend itself abroad as we shall see in the sequel of this work this has again employed scattered and dispersed the men those very men who in their castles and wooden walls were able to hush and defye the world are now squandred up and down in private business in all the known parts of the globe and that so as not to be easily if ever collected again into one body so that the number of our seamen especially as to the public service is greatly diminished and decreased  some of the several articles which have thus decreased the numbers of seamen and by which it is become so difficult to find men for the public service are as follows    the rate of wages continuing low in the public service and beginning with the peace to fall also in the merchant service has caused the seamen to seek abroad for service where they could have better wages or more constant employment    to which must be added the advantages offered by foreign princes and powers at the same juncture of time to invite our seamen into their service particularly the czar or emperor of russia and the king of spain the former has as i am assured great numbers of english seamen and the latter of irish and scots always in their service    the tempting profits of going upon the account so our sailors call that wicked trade of turning pirates in which horrid employment however scandalous many thousands of our seamen have engaged since the late war most of them being of the ablest seamen and best artists that were to be found among them and by which besides the numbers that remain abundance have been lost to their country by shipwreck by battles by the gallows by starving and other distresses natural to those desperate adventures so that this also has been a great cause of the decrease of the numbers of seamen among us and will continue to be so unless some remedy may be found out to reduce them and restore them to the service and interest of their country  but this leads me also to a popular and more acceptable way of calculating this deficiency of numbers among our seamen and that is that our trade is happily increased and extended since the prosperous reign of his present majesty and his royal predecessor by which the merchants of great britain maintain and employ an extraordinary number of seamen more than ever was called for by trade before so that at the same time that the royal navy ceases to employ marines and raw men by which to increase the number the merchants require more men by many thousands not only than they did during the war but than ever they did before the war in the times of the most profound tranquillity of affairs this renders the number of seamen less in regard to the service whether they are numerically fewer in tale or no for as every number is great or small comparatively so it is here if there were  00000 seamen in england yet if the demand for them calls for more they are then few compared to that demand or compared to the service they are demanded for though their number was more than had been ever known before  this increase of our demand for seamen is the present case and it is indeed in itself a very considerable article if the fact be true and of that i shall speak presently by itself i say it is very considerable for though our seamen were not diminished or decreased by any of the occasions mentioned above yet if the demand for seamen and especially the demands of trade which lie in several distant and remote places are increased the number at hand for the public service of their country is less in proportion to the occasion than it was before for example  if the increase of our commerce and shipping is evident more seamen are consequently wanting to carry on that commerce and man those ships so that trade employing the men and the merchants giving better wages than the king which by the way is a fault they will be more easily supplied and the public service be in greater want of hands than before though the number of seamen were the same  it would indeed require a long excursion here to demonstrate that trade is so increased in great britain and that the merchants do call for and entertain more seamen than they did not only during the late war but in the times of the profoundest peace yet something must be said to it else we shall be said to beg the question which in a thing of such importance i can by no means admit but the digression shall be very short  i think it must be allowed that since the late war there is a happy increase of commerce carried on by the subjects of great britain in several parts of the world and by which great numbers of seamen are called for more than were before not only in time of war but even in times of the most settled peace for example    the greenland fishery is a fair open and confessed addition to our trade and by which a considerable number of seamen are employed where not a man was employed before and more are like to be called for every year as that trade goes on    the white fishery at newfoundland since by the late peace the possession of that island was conceded to the english is very considerably increased and besides the numbers of vessels and of able seamen who remain upon the spot all the winter to carry on the salmon fishing on shore and the banking fishery in the spring we are assured there are above  00 sail of ships yearly employed there and by that trade more than ever were before by both which articles we may allow  000 seamen to be yearly wanted more in trade than were before even in time of the most established tranquillity    the like addition is visible to our english fishing on the northern coast of america the coast of accadia and the north shores of new england most of which were possessed or at least disturbed before by the french whereas now the british and newenglish fishing vessels ships and seamen are fully and freely employed on all those coasts and drive a very considerable trade with the fish they take to spain and italy in which places no english vessels or but few were employed before likewise more ships in proportion are employed by them to fetch salt for that fishery    the trade of our colonies is visibly increased and consequently their shipping as particularly the addition of the french part of the island of st christopbers being now become english is so increased in its produce and by that in its inhabitants and trade that they send near as many ships and as many hogsheads of sugar yearly to england as the island of barbados itself and must of necessity employ so many the more sloops and ships to furnish them with provisions from the colonies on the continent than they did before and in all those vessels the greater number of seamen are also annually employed where few were employed before    the visible increase of the jamaica trade and of the number of ships employed in it within a few years past this cannot be denied the south sea commerce by the assiento is also a farther increase of it most of that trade being carried on from africa to the spanish west indies by way of jamaica i leave that to be adjusted by the merchants and by any such as have lived upon the island any time and knew what number of ships were formerly employed in it some who are fully acquainted with the trade of jamaica assure me upon a serious enquiry into this part that there are above  00 sail of ships yearly and most of them ships of force which are constantly employed in the trade between great britain and jamaica including such ships as go by the way of madera with wines and by the way of africa with negroes more than were usually employed in that trade before not including in this number the great number of ships and sloops employed between that island and the colonies on the north part of america upon the continent whose chief business is carrying provisions of all kind  n b we had an account printed here lately of between forty and fifty sail of ships come to jamaica in about two months upon these accounts only one small vessel of them of forty ton coming directly from england  it might be to the purpose also to show how our trade is increased to almost all our other colonies in america and especially to new england and carolina since the encouragement given to the bringing naval stores tar turpentine rice and such like things from thence of which especially the tar and rice very little was imported in former times  also we might mention the east india trade in which instead of five or six ships abroad at a time there are now forty to fifty ships constantly abroad together and though the ships are not quite so large yet they carry very near as many men and a great many more are employed in the country on the ships made use of from one factory to another  the sum of all this is to demonstrate that there are without doubt more seamen called for in trade and employed by the merchants on board their ships than were before and that as those are made use of in remote and distant places in the world they may at least be reckoned as so many lost men to the public service because they cannot be recalled and restored to the service upon any sudden emergence and indeed not at all without giving a deep and sensible blow to our commerce and weakening the intrest of trade in general  any proposals then for the increase or encouragement of seamen ought to be supposed calculated for such an increase as shall bring up the number of seamen to be equal to the demand as well of the public as of the commerce otherwise to encourage the seamen and not so to increase their number is doing nothing but encouraging them to quit the merchants service and enter into the kings service which as to the nation in general may be said to be like a man taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another with this addition too that it wounds one part to heal another for trade and the public in this article are like a body under two contrary operations where if you heal one disease you revive another so that still the patient is oppressed on one hand or other  but to increase the number of seamen to such a degree that there shall always be a sufficient supply for all the services which may call for them whether for trade or for defense whether for peace or war that taking them on this side should not lessen them on that and that every want might be supplied this would be the true and i may say the only effectual way of increasing them  but who is sufficient for such an undertaking and how shall we find a scheme equal to the difficulty if there is not a sufficient number of seamen to supply every exigence whether of trade or war then when the demand lies on one hand the other must suffer by the dead weight running against it if the navy royal is to be manned immediately embargoes are laid presswarrants are issued out the nation is rummagd for seamen by which it is alleged that abundance of injurious violence is made use of to bring them in out of the merchants service and so trade suffers on the other hand if in time of peace trade calls out for seamen the poor sailors are fully employed and carried away to all parts of the world and every skippers demand is supplied while his majestys navy is left naked and liable to be insulted for want of hands  and who shall reconcile these contraries or join these extremes there seems to be an insuperable difficulty in it for if you will increase the hands you must find them work or maintain them idle  the seamen are but one species and are wanted but upon two extraordinary occasions in peace the king has no occasion for them the merchants must employ them or they starve in war the king must have them or the service is starved and if the king takes them the merchant stands still and the trade starves if they are increased to a number equal to both peace and war then unless you have always a war the seamen are too many for the merchants and if they are not equal to both then in time of war the merchants are too many for the seamen because the government will be served and takes them by force  this makes a kind of a struggle between trade and the government the government uses force and takes the seamen by impress and arrest the merchants use a force also though of a different kind and that is the force of persuasion i mean the powerful persuasion of money giving higher wagers and as they are always in a condition to outbid the public they leave it to the seamen to avoid the impress and keep out of the hands of the government as well as they can and they do not generally speaking want stratagems to secure themselves for all men will serve those they can get most money by  now to reconcile all these difficulties is the case before us i have indeed seen very little offered toward it in the world the thing seems to have something impracticable in it the kings speech with all duty and regard to his majestys person and expressions mentions indeed the importance of it but recommends it to his people to consider of the method it can be no offense i hope to his majesty or to the parliament to make an essay at that without doors which his majesty himself recommends as a thing of the utmost importance and well worth their consideration within doors  to speak then to that first which his majesty first mentions viz the increase of the seamen i must observe that to increase the number of seamen without finding them employment would be to bring a rentcharge upon the nation like a workhouse full of poor with nothing for them to do  how to have a number of seamen sufficient for war and trade together seems to me to be the question and the answer seems to be as natural viz that it is an inconsistency in itself that it cannot be done that as in time of war the public entertains and employs fifty or sixty thousand seamen and in time of peace none at all that is to say very few how is it possible trade should either have men enough in time of war or not too many in time of peace  even his majestys speech does not propose it the king recommends it to his parliament to consider of ways to encourage the seamen so that they may willingly and by choice enter into the service of their country and without being forced in but with humblest submission to his majesty i would ask leave to propose a difficulty here from whence must they come to enter into the service of their country they must either be in employment before or out of it  if they are out of business and refuse or decline the public service they are in a fault and deserve punishment or to say no more deserve to be brought in by force for the seamen as they are a people necessary to the safety of the public are as it were actually the governments servants by the nature of the thing and it is upon that foot that they can be impressed by warrant as physicians and surgeons may be commanded by authority to perform the duty of their profession and may not only be obliged to it but punished for refusing it  on the other hand if they are in employment it must be in the service of private persons that is to say in the merchants service in the collieries the fisheries the coasting or some other trade which requires their labor and gives them good pay  to prevail with or persuade the sailors to quit this business and enter freely into the service of their country there seems to be but one way that i can see no encouragement but money better wages and less work will weigh with any of them and i doubt it is hard to find any other medium and this must fall heavy upon the merchant because what is gained by the navy i doubt must be lost by the trade and you take with the one hand what you give with the other  the proposal to increase the number of seamen seems to point at bringing more and greater numbers of seamen into the class to breed up or introduce more than are ordinarily so brought up to the sea of which i shall say something very particular in its place  his majestys speech seems to intimate that the case is difficult and therefore offers at a medium by joining the parts together to increase them and to encourage them by increasing their number the navy may be sure of a supply on an exigence and by encouraging them that number might be so disposed of that they might not starve one another or be a burden to the nation and thus indeed his majesty has as it were led us by the hand to the remedy however difficult  having thus touched upon the two main heads viz increase of the number of seamen and encouraging them to enter into the service of their country i come to take them a little in pieces and state the case between them all    i would state the case between the seamen and the public and enquire if possible whether the seamen are at present under any hardships with respect to the public service what those hardships are and what redress can be thought of to do justice and right between them and their country    i would state the case between the navy service and the commerce and enquire whether it is not possible to do something for the increase of the seamen which may be consistent with the public service and yet be not fatally injurious to the seamen themselves or to the trade  n b pray take it with you as you go that i say not fatally prejudicial for i allow it is impossible but trade must suffer but the business is to have trade duly considered and its interest regarded so that trade may suffer as little as may be and yet the public service may be duly attended and perhaps i may find out some way to reconcile these difficulties  a skilful surgeon being called to a difficult operation in the course of his profession is careful first of the patients safety that is the main article to preserve which his business is to go on in a regular manner with his work and perform the necessary part according to art  but after this his great concern is to put the patient if possible to no extremities he knows he must bear a great deal of pain loss of blood and decay of strength but his care is to put him to as little pain as he can consistent with the cure be it the amputation of a member the openings and incisions of lythotomy the cuttings and scarifications needful in mortifications gangreens etc or any other desperate cases  in like manner with respect to the seamen in case of a war the royal navy must be manned perhaps an invasion is threatened or the enemy is fitting out a powerful fleet we are not to stand debating about right and wrong the seamen must be had you must take them wherever you can find them in such cases trade may be a great sufferer but now as trade is an important article and no wise government shows themselves unconcerned about it or willing to oppress and injure the merchant in their trade where it can be avoided so it is an enquiry of just concern to us all to see what can be done in such cases of extremity to serve the government and yet to oppress and injure trade and the merchant as little as possible  and why may not some happy medium be found out for this critical case let every man cast his mite into the chest who knows but something to the purpose may be said where you do not expect it even perhaps where you do not desire to find it  chap ii a farther state of the seamens case with an enquiry whether it is not possible to do something for the increase of the seamen which may be consistent with the public service and yet not fatally injurious to the seamen themselves or to the trade  before i enter too far into the debate as i have stated it i desire to make a needful explanation of terms that i may not be misunderstood stumble at the threshold and open the door to the cavils and impertinencies of the times  in order to this i lay it down as a postulatum that when i say the seamen do labor under hardships in the public service i am not to be understood as if i thought they were injured used ill oppressed wronged or anywise injuriously treated in consequence of the service they may indeed be used ill oppressed wronged and injuriously treated by this or that particular officer or in this or that particular ship and i may take the freedom to speak of that part too in its place but i am now speaking of the hardships suffered by the seamen in general and by the mere natural consequence of the service in general and these may be called hardships i hope without offense because though it may be in the power of the public to remove some of those hardships yet we cannot complain of them as the act and deed of the present administration or lay them to the charge of any particular person for example    the seamen employed in the public service are in the same condition with respect to their pay and other provisions which they were in  0 or  0 years ago whereas they are not in the same condition with respect to subsisting on that pay as they were in at that time and if this difference is such that they cannot really subsist on their pay at this time though they could subsist on it at that time of not so well then they are under more hardships than the seamen were  0 or  0 years ago  we are told how true i cannot particularly learn or know how to enquire that the pay of the english seamen on board the royal navy in the reign of king henry viii was after the rate of seven shillings to nine shillings per month that afterward in queen elizabeths time the rate was raised up to eleven shillings and afterward to thirteen shillings per month i refer the enquirer to the proper registers of those times by which any mistake in those particulars may be rectified though it is not material if it was not just so much to a shilling or two more or less the fact in the gross is that their wages was considerably less and that is enough to my purpose  but it is answered and i allow the answer to be good that if the sailor was as well able to live and subsist his family furnish himself with clothes etc with eleven to thirteen shillings per month then as he was with twentythree shillings per month in king charles the seconds time then queen elizabeth gave as good wages as king charles ii but then by the same rule it must necessarily follow that if the wages had continued at the same standard of queen elizabeths pay to the time of charles ii the way of living and the subsistence of the poor men and their families being raised and made different as we know they were the seamen would have been under a hardship that must have been unsufferable since it is a known maxim in business of all kinds that the pay of the laboring poor whether seamen or landmen must always bear a proportion to the rate of living that is to say to the price of provisions  to bring this down to the present case the seamen in england have here an evident disadvantage especially those of them who serve in the royal navy and it must necessarily be a great discouragement to the service itself as well as to the seamen their pay in the royal navy is not to call it small no more now than it was as far back as the reign of king charles ii namely twentythree shillings per month for able seamen and eighteen shillings per month for the inferior sort that is ablebodied but unexperienced men and the times being changed and the rate of provisions and other necessaries for the subsistence of families being raised and that to a very great degree this pay is less sufficient to their maintenance than it formerly was especially to such of them as have families on shore to support and those indeed are the men who are the most to be depended upon for the service these are anxious for their wives and children carefully save and reserve their wages for their supply and these merit on that account the encouragement i am speaking of  now the support and subsistence of these families is greatly lessened since the times mentioned above when they had twentythree shillings per month wages as well as now by the exceeding dearness of housekeeping and of almost all necessary things for a family above what it formerly was  this advance of the price of provisions clothing and almost all necessary things is too evident to be disputed the causes of it at least some of them are known and felt by us all and many poor families groan i do not say repine under the weight of them such as the taxes and funds established on those taxes and by which they are bound down upon us for many years upon coals candles soap malt salt leather etc the new customs and imposts upon imported commodities and particularly such as are useful in families such as oil linen fruit sugar spice tobacco brandy etc the additional excises upon beer ale malt spirits and other liquors the first of these are things necessary to their families at home and the last to the poor men themselves when on board the men of war most of which taxes and duties and others not named are of modern standing and were not known or so much as named in the said times of king charles ii when yet the wages of seamen was as great the same as it is now  the case of the poor seamen seems harder in these particulars than that of any other class of the people from the nature of their employment which is always abroad other poor are not separated from their mother soil these labor in a comfortless unproducing element the poor seamen neither sow or reap breed or feed plant or gather so that they have no assistance from the product of the earth as the poor landmen generally have the sea yields nothing toward the maintenance or support of life but fish and salt the smallest article in an englishmans food and which will go but a very little way in his family all he has he must buy with his money and so many necessary kinds of his supply being thus heavily loaded with taxes those taxes fall harder upon him than upon any other class of the poor whatever  the poor cottager and labourer can glean his corn brew his beer raise his poultry keep a cow upon the common and a hog in his yard can dig and trench in a little enclosure for his vegetables gather and cut his fuel on the heaths and in the woods but the poor seaman buys all with dead money gained at the hazard of his life and laid out with all the disadvantage imaginable things all discouraging enough and which render him an object of our just concern and as he is a useful necessary servant of his country his case not only moves our compassion but seems to claim that he should have all reasonable helps to encourage his services and to keep him in heart that he may go on cheerfully in the important business he is bred up to  by these differences and disadvantages in their expenses if we may not say the seamen have a hardship we may at least allow they have a very great discouragement particularly they are straightened and kept low and poor by the increase of their expense having not at the same time any increase of pay and this may be assigned as a true reason or at least as one of the reasons why they are sometimes backward to enter into the service of their country when they are called upon to come in voluntier on any public occasions having not money wherewith to fit and furnish themselves out that is to say to supply themselves with clothes bedding and other necessaries to cover them in a cold climate or to comfort them in a hot and for want of which many seamen especially such as have been pressed into the service and on that account not entitled to the bounty of the government have suffered great extremities by the severities of the seasons and the inclemency of the climates either such as extreme cold or excessive heats as the service may have presented  this poverty and these hardships in the circumstances of the seamen has been partly the occasion that has moved the generous compassion of our princes on many occasions to publish bounties and promise money to be advanced to them for their supply to encourage them to come voluntarily in and enter themselves on board the royal navy and it has not been without its desired effect in part though not to such a degree as was at first expected the reasons for which we shall see farther into presently but in the mean time it may not be amiss to observe    that this very grant of bounty which if i mistake not was first directed by the late glorious king william a prince eminent for his knowledge and experience in the true methods of managing the marine service was a testimony to the truth of what i have alleged  viz the poverty and exigence of the seamen at their first entering into the service and that this exigence consisted as above in their want of money to furnish themselves with necessaries at their setting out    the exigence being proved as to the fact of it the justice of considering the poor seamen and bestowing a royal bounty for their encouragement seems to be tacitly acknowledged also or if we must not call it justice but rather a charity for the words bounty and justice seem to clash a little yet then the reasonableness of the charity seems evident and the distress moving so that it is as much almost as to acknowledge that there was a necessity to do something for them or that it could not be expected they would come voluntarily into the service  the effect indeed showed that this was the case for upon the publishing such a benevolence the seamen especially those of them as had kept off upon that very foundation began to come freely in and the navy felt the benefit of it by saving very much the expense of pressing for impressing seamen to the service that is as his majesty is pleased to express it compelling them by force and violence to enter into it is not only grievous to the seamen but very expensive as well as tedious to the public  it is expensive by the incident charges attending it employing officers and gangs of men to range about city and country to pick men up presssmacks or vessels to lie in the rivers and proper ports to receive the men when pressed attending the commissioners appointed to hear and redress grievances when men are impressed who by law ought not to be taken and the charge of maintaining such men till they are legally discharged by the commissioners sending sloops smacks and sometimes frigates to pick up men upon all the remotest coasts of great britain whose expenses are very considerable as well on board those vessels as on shore for the pressing work  add to all this the length of time which sometimes the capital ships are obliged to wait before they are ready for the service for want of their complement of men and sometimes the whole fleet has been delayed and the service interrupted for want of such and such ships whose assistance they could not safely want being sufficiently manned  all these things had their share among the reasons for granting the bountymoney to the seamen but to bring it all back to its true original all those reasons are first founded upon the necessitous circumstance of the seamen occcasiond as above by the disparity between their pay and their wants or if you will between the present circumstance of the poor men and their past  nor are the taxes mentioned above the only cause of the dearness of poor families subsistence we may appeal to experience whether it is not occasioned also by the real increase of people among us or the increase of commerce or from a greater cause than both  viz the luxurious way of living which custom and the pride of the age has introduced among us by which the consumption of provisions being increased the rate of provision rises by the mere consequence of that consumption but be it which it will if the fact is true the thing is the same let us appeal to experiences the rate of almost all sorts of provisions are and have been for many years past exceedingly advanced so that a family whether great or small whether rich or poor are not maintained fed or clothed upon the same terms and at the same expense as formerly they were  if this be the case then as the rate of wages to the poor ever did and we may say ever will rise or fall in proportion to the rate of provisions at the market if the poor seamans wages is but the same that it was before may he not be said to have a hardship in this  viz that as we say he has not neighbors fare he can gain no more and yet must spend much more than he did before  as to the wages of other laboring poor i believe it may be proved that almost in all kinds of labor the poor have raised their price upon us in the country or husbandrywork we find it so in laborers in journeymens wages of almost all kinds it is so and the works they finish are raised in proportion it would be too tedious to make the enquiry general in this place i appeal to the knowledge of tradesmen every one in their own way i appeal to the knowledge of gentlemen in the wages of their servants and in particular to the ladies in the wages of their maidservants cooks waitingwomen etc the advance of which is such that it is risen up almost to a common grievance  does it not seem somewhat hard that all our servants should have their wages advanced their support and subsistence considered but the poor seamen who we may say are the nations servants and indeed their best servants had no such advances made them in price however the necessaries of their subsistence are advanced and however heavy that advance may lie upon them  there are other discouragements upon the poor men besides these and which though not immediately respecting the government yet as they are in the power of the government to redress and that his majesty has been pleased to recommend the encouraging the seamen in general to the parliament i cannot but think it a dutiful concurrence with that recommendation and hope it will be so taken for a private hand to lay open some of those discouragements for the special cognizance of the house in order to pave the way to that encouragement and relief which the house may think fit to give them the poor seamen  one natural consequence of the disparity as above between the pay or wages of the seamen and their necessary expense for subsistence is that they are often something necessitous and generally speaking the seamen especially such as have families and serve in the navyroyal at    s per month with all the deductions and defalcations attending it are not very rich  if they were so before viz in the reign of king charles ii when    s would go so much farther in the providing for the food and clothes of a family than it will now it may be allowed that they must be so now nay if it must be allowed that all things necessary to life and the subsistence of a family are so exalted in price the poor seamen must be in the consequence just so much impoverished and reduced as that inequality amounts to  taking it for granted then that the seaman having a family to provide for while he serves in the navy is reduced as above let us enquire a little into some of the consequences of this poverty for there are many and those very discouraging  the first discouragement is touched at already namely declining the service withdrawing himself either into the merchants service or which is worse the devils service and turning pyrate plundering our ships and merchants and setting up for a sort of marine highwaymen to make his fortune by rapine or revolting from duty and entering into the service of the enemy  this scandalous employment has indeed recommended so many of them to the gallows that the numbers of them seem to wear out pretty much and they seem weary of it so that we may hope there are not so many of our seamen carried off that way as formerly the next discouragement which however i must place to the account of the first is that those seamen who though they may be poor and reduced yet are honest and willing to enter into the service of their country and willing at the same time to support and subsist their families are driven by their poverty to anticipate their pay by borrowing money beforehand either for furnishing themselves with necessaries at their setting out or for putting it into the hands of their wives for the support and subsistence of the family while they are abroad  in doing this they are not only exposed to the unhappy necessity of devouring their pay before they earn it or as they ordinarily call it eating the calf in the cows belly which is very discouraging in itself but they are farther exposed to the cruel exactions and extortions of those who thus advance money upon their pay who that security being so many ways precarious will not lend upon the ordinary consideration of legal interest and the poor borrowers being distressed for money are obliged to submit to the hard conditions by which cruelty or rather by which necessity the poor mens pay however small or insufficient of itself is lessened and rendered yet smaller to a degree which really is very affecting even but to relate so that if the pay itself is at best but ill able to support and subsist the family of a poor seaman it is much less equal to it when thus reduced perhaps one fourth or one third by usury and extortion and this exacted with the utmost rigor so that the poor seaman or his family when the ship comes to be paid off cannot receive one farthing of his pay till this loan is first wholly paid off and discharged the full powers for receiving the said pay being transferred from the poor wife or perhaps widow of that seaman whose life perhaps is lost in the service or under the weight of the discouragement itself for i verily believe the grief and oppression of mind which the poor seamen such of them as can think feel from the constant reflections on the hardships they suffer by such things as these kills as many as the shot and the swords of the enemy  but their discouragements do not end here the exactions as to interest as above are great but that is not all the abuses put upon them by the lenders go farther as first in taking powers from them for larger sums than their just debts whether principal or interest on pretense of security for the accidents which attend the loan of their money and secondly their taking powers for the whole pay absolutely leaving the poor borrower to apply not to the public but to the unmerciful creditor for the overplus in which case many times the lender proves insolvent and bankrupt more than the borrower and the poor seaman loses it all or if not the exactions for trouble pretended charges in attendance at the office expense in receiving and abundance of such like pretenses are brought into the account till the poor mans pay is quite devoured or reduced to so miserable a pittance as makes him desperate and consequently miserable  again when all these defalcations are allowed and given up yet the poor man is left to wait entreat and perhaps at last to sue for the balance and sometimes if the landlord keeps a public house as often is the case is drawn in to spend the balance in drunkenness and excesses and receives the last payment in extravagant reckonings long unjust scores and such methods as is usual among such people to the utter ruin of the morals of the poor seamen as well as of their families  it may be true that the poor men themselves some for want of a just principle and some made desperate and exasperated by these violences and abuses do sometimes act the unfair part and do enter into double engagements upon their pay pledging it more than once for money affirming though falsely that it was not engaged or pledged before so as it may be called mortgaging the same effects to different persons granting false powers and making fraudulent wills and fraudulent assignments of their pay to particular persons when the same pay has been assigned and disposed of to other persons before  this i say may be true and i doubt does too often happen nor is this unfair practice of some seamen the least of the causes of the rest being imposed upon by the lenders of money as above who considering the hazards they run of the seamens integrity as well as of their lives for if the borrower dies or runs from the service the debt is lost insist upon it that they ought to have the greater premium as a consideration for the risque as well as for the loan and by this way of reasoning they pretend to satisfy their consciences in their exactions and extortions upon as well those who are honest as those who are dishonest  but notwithstanding all this the complaint of the discouragement which the seamen lie under in the particulars above stands good and it is certainly well worth the consideration of the public to redress them the ill conduct of some of them is far from a just reason why justice should not be done to the rest and i make no doubt but were the general discouragements of the whole body removed the knavery would be the less among the rest as we shall see immediately  besides when the parliament shall be pleased to take the poor seamens case into their consideration and apply suitable remedies to the discouragements mentioned above they will never want ways and means to prevent all those frauds of such seamen as are dishonest which as we shall see in its place may be done without the least difficulty and without injury to the borrower or the lender nor can the house be at a loss to prevent the oppressions and extortions of the lenders by which the poor and honest part of the seamen are so abused and discouraged of which i shall also speak in the course of this work for it is not designed to make this work a mere clamor of grievances without giving a due prospect of the proper means to redress them that would be to write a kind of a satyr upon the public management of the navy which is indeed no part of the business before me or of my design  but i go on to the detail of the seamens discouragements another of them is the horrid practice of forging and counterfeiting the powers and assignments of the seamen for receiving their wages by which the poor men are defrauded of the full reward of their most faithful services and when they have worn out a tedious summer and perhaps a winter or two also in all the fateagues of service too many to reckon up have born the excessive heat the storms and tempests the diseases and distempers of contrary and unhealthy climates and the hazards of enemies and come home in expectation of receiving their wages find themselves robbed their wages taken up and received by the help of perjury and forgery and by those worst sort of thieves the pretenders to right when they neither had any power to claim by or real debt to pretend to it from and which is worse know not who the plunderer has been or where to look for or enquire after him  who can describe in language moving like the thing it self the grief the agonies of the soul of the poor injured creature and of his starving family who after the hardships they have suffered the poor man abroad and the poor wife and children at home in a long starving expectation of the return of the ship run in debt to all that would trust them on the credit of the poor mans labor and the certainty of his pay find themselves after all thus cut off at the very hour of their greatest expectations yet those things we see often done in a manner too vile to express  some of these creatures have been detected and as often as they are it will be acknowledged they have been severely punished as far as our law directs if the law is defective and the punishment is neither equal to the crime or sufficient to deter others from such practice that is the misfortune of the country and in common with other cases it is but a little way from us and even upon the same island where it would be rewarded at the gallows which indeed i cannot but say i think it richly deserves but neither is that our business here  this practice also of counterfeiting powers and thereby receiving the poor seamens pay is attended with another piece of forgery viz forging of wills by which the poor families of a deceased seaman are defrauded of his pay after his death this has been a practice so frequent and has been so much harder to detect than the other that the wicked contrivers of it have had but too much encouragement in carrying on the horrid trade so that when a ship or a fleet comes into harbor they have no more to do but get a sight of the ships musters and see who are dead getting their names and if possible a sight of their handwriting or the knowledge whether they were able to write or no and immediately they forge a last will and testnment for the deceased make themselves executors and then claiming a debt from the deceased receive the money as entitled to it in satisfaction of their pretended debt  i need not add that this likewise is among those grievances of seamen which are most easy to be redressed the parliament with the breath of their mouth are able to put an effectual stop to all those practices a clause of five lines is sufficient that is to say it is done with the greatest ease imaginable and it is in order to that relief that i take the freedom to mention it in this place and at a time when the seamen have the happiness of seeing their case recommended to the parliament from the throne  after what has been said thus briefly and perhaps with rather too much backwardness and caution lest it should give offense and so do the seamen harm rather than good and after what his majesty has been pleased to say from the throne of the great importance of the thing in general i flatter my self with the belief that none will say the seamen do not want encouragement in order to bring them to enter freely and willingly and without force and violence into the service of their country nor can it be said with justice to the poor men that they are not at present under these hardships and discouragements their numbers are greatly diminished and the difficulties of bringing them into service are increased and which is still worse many of them are by these things irretrievably dispersed and scattered into the remotest parts of the world and into the service of almost all the christian powers and even some heathen and mohammedan powers as well their princes as their merchants from whence it is far from an easy task to recover them and bring them back  it has been alleged though i am loath to say much of it here that many of our seamen run from the service in circumstances which render their return hopeless for that in so many words they dare not come home and this not only as deserters from the service for that an act of oblivion would take off but as debtors having borrowed money on their pay or otherwise run into debt at or before their entering into the service and not willing or not able to pay cannot appear again in the service for fear of a jail the service being no protection against an arrest  some have suggested that the seamen having been thus basely drawn in by the moneylenders mentioned above to make over their whole pay for the loan of but a little money and being visibly oppressed by the avarice and extortion of those wicked people taking advantage of their necessity and making them acknowledge more debt than they owe have in mere revenge for that usage run from the service forfeited their pay and in a manner banished themselves for ever from their native country because they abhorred to be imposed upon in so gross a manner thus punishing themselves to the last degree on purpose to avoid paying such an unjust demand  i will not take upon me to affirm this part though i doubt the truth of it might too easily be proved from the acknowledgment of those who have actually done so but this i venture to say that though the practice cannot be justified in the seamen themselves however provoked by the ill usage of those extortioners yet it also shows that those abuses of the seamen are together with the injustice and avarice of it a very great discouragement to the poor men and by consequence an injury to the public service seeing every thing that assists to diminish the number of seamen banish them from the service and scatter them abroad in foreign and remote countries so as that they are lost to their country is so far a public grievance and besides its being criminal in it self as all such illegal practices are is criminal also in its consequences as it is an injury to the public and indeed a calamity to their country  it is true the seamen that act thus are not to be justified by any means on the contrary they are offenders in several denominations as acting unjustly to their creditors whatever they can say of their extortion as the occasion or pretense of it for an injury received does by no means justify an injury done nor does their extorting more than is their due discharge the debtor in point of conscience from paying what was really due but the right and wrong of the question is not before us here the present business is whether this is the case or no and whether by this extortion and avarice on one hand the seamen being made desperate do fall upon those unjust desperate methods to defraud the lenders on the other hand or no if the affirmative is true then they both concur to obstruct the service and so far both are offenders and it is worth while for the legislature to enter into measures to prevent the practice for all just governments choose rather to prevent crimes than punish them the main end and intent of laws is to deter men from offenses not to leave them at liberty to commit them though at the price of the penalty that would be to suppose the crime lawful to him that is willing to run the risque of the punishment a principle fit for a highwayman or a smuggler to act upon not for men of conscience and honesty  there are many other hardships and discouragements which the poor seamen often complained of formerly some occasioned by the cheats and frauds of their officers as in particular the allowance of their provisions as to quantity and sometimes in the quality also especially in such provisions as are added to the ships stores abroad where the laying in such provisions is of course left to the prudence and discretion of the captain or pursers or the agent of the victualling abroad but these things are past nor have been complained of for some years  it is not the business much less the design of this work to arraign the kings officers of mismanagement or to make this account a charge upon any body  besides the abuses of officers are no part of our case they are punishable if the fact be proved by the laws as well as by their superior officers and the seamen have an open door to make their complaint after they come home to recommend such things therefore to the parliament is to trouble the house with what they ought not to be troubled with unless redress could not be obtained in the ordinary way  chap iii of the immediate redress which presents itself for these evils and of the proper means to increase and encourage the seamen so as to have sufficient numbers always ready as well for the service of the public as for the support of trade and service of the merchant  you have seen as distinctly as the narrow compass of this work will admit some of the reasons of the seamens dispersing and scattering themselves into foreign remote and distant parts of the world their wilfully banishing themselves as it were from their own country and their running headlong into pyracies and other desperate services by all which their numbers are exceedingly diminished and abundance of them irretrievably lost as to the service of their sovereign  it remains according to his majestys gracious recommendation to his parliament to find a remedy if possible for these evils that the seamen may be encouraged their numbers increased and they may be invited not brought by force and violence to enter into the service of their country  i am far from crowding the heads of the town with projects the unperforming schemes of our projectors and pretenders those quacks and mountebanks of the state are my aversion as they have been the ministrys burden in all our late reigns they have often perplexed this very case but never as i have yet seen advanced one step toward its effectual cure and redress  but i remember a long and intricate proposal once offered to the public in the reigns of king william and queen anne which went so far as to be thought worth considering of by his royal highness prince george then highadmiral and to be laid before a committee of parliament i shall give a summary of the scheme because it was new and thought at first to be practicable but it is too long to repeat all the particulars  the proposal was   to form all the seamen or seafaringmen into a body and enter them all into the immediate service and pay of the government so that they were all at once the governments hired servants their names and abode always registered and books kept distinctly in every port by the customer or collector of the port so that there should be no charge of new offices and officers to eat out their countrys treasure by unnecessary salaries  for the encouragement and effectual supply of trade and navigation whether for the merchantships coasters or fishery they should always be supplied with good and able seamen from the customhouse the collector having no more to do than to send a summons to the men to their dwelling knowing always by their books who was abroad and who was at home with orders what ships to go on board of and where and one port to borrow and lend to another as numbers were found over or wanting  for encouragement of the seamen to be always at hand the government was supposed to allow them halfpay when out of employ and traveling pay to return home when unshipd or to go to the port when shipped where the ship should lie  that the current pay of the seamen from the government being at that time    s per month when on board the kings ships the merchants should pay to the government    s per month for every able seaman which was the ordinary pay the merchant gave at that time and was not thought grievous for it was raised to  0 s per month and higher as the war made men scarce that by this overplus of pay in the merchants service the government would be able to pay all the halfpay to the seamen out of employment  also out of the same fund hospitals should be provided for taking care of poor sick seamen and a chest erected for allowances to such as were maimed whether their maims were received in the service of the public or of the merchant  also hospitals to relieve at least if not to maintain the widows and infant children of such seamen as died abroad in service as well in merchant ships as in the royal navy others to be left to the parishes  all the malechildren of seamen so deceased to be bred up by the said hospital to the age of    years and then entered into pay in proportion to their age and to be shipped as occasion presented  commanders of merchant ships and other officers in proportion to their commands and to the burden of their ships to be obliged to take such boys as their proper servants and to take care to instruct them in the art of navigation and to allow them pay after the age of fifteen years such as shall be adjusted  the rest of this proposal is indeed too large to insert it here but the proposer shows fully the advantages to the merchants by removing all the difficulties in getting men in abating the expense of victuals and wages while in port waiting till they are fully manned and on many other accounts  also the advantages to the government that a certain number of these seamen while out of employ and in halfpay should be always at hand for doing the necessary works belonging to the navy cleansing the docks yards harbors etc  and for the increase of the number of seamen the government should entertain all such ablebodied landmen as were desirous to enter into the marineservice whose halfpay should be proportioned to their usual pay at sea and should notwithstanding their halfpay be at liberty to work for themselves at any time when the public service did not call for them either abroad or at home  that every merchantship entertaining ten seamen and upwards should be obliged to take one such ablebodied landman at the rate of  0 s per month the government to pay the same men    s per month by which means the ablebodied landmen may be supposed in about two years service to be sufficiently inured to the sea and to be entertained as able seamen  this proposal in all its parts of which i have a copy though too long to insert it here was so far thought practicable that it was as last declined only upon some scruples about liberty and compulsion which some nice people who have got over all these difficulties in other cases not less dangerous pretended to raise  upon this foot i say it was laid aside not rejected and had the prince lived a little longer would i believe have been brought to be practicable in which case there would always have been a sufficient number of seamen on every occasion as well for private service as public for the growing number of landmen upon the encouragement of a halfpay with liberty to work for their own account while out of service would always have given you a supply of seamen for any emergency and yet their number would not have been a burden to the public  i have mentioned this because as i take the increasing the number of able seamen to be one of the greatest difficulties before us as it shocks our adjustment of numbers and makes that number in time of war be as much too numerous for trade in a time of peace as the number to be spared in a time of peace is too small to man out the royal navy in time of war  but by this method the number in general would be ekd out and greatly enlarged and the ways and means taken by the government to support the supernumerary or extraordinary men will be doing that without a burden which would otherwise be an intolerable weight upon them  the proposal enters into some very just calculations of the number of seamen in england a point so very nice that the most critical in what they call political arithmetic have been able to do nothing in it that we may depend upon he judged that including the transport service and the extraordinary number of vessels just then employed in the service there were not less than  0000 seamen at that time in the government pay which notwithstanding he shows they could not reasonably be thought so yet because a given number must in all such cases be the basis of just calculations he supposes to be near one half of all the seamen in england that is to say employed by the navy and by the commerce of england so that he states the number in general to be   0000 seamen  from this number he inferrs and for this reason i mention it that upon such a general enrolling of seamen there being one man in ten allowed to be entertained who he calls according to the language of the navy ablebodied landmen there would then be   000 such landmen always in service or on the list and these being supposed to be transmitted from the class of landmen to that of able seamen in the space of every two years that very article would supply all the incidents of mortality by disaster among the able seamen allowing the nursing up of boys the children of seamen to go on in its ordinary course for a succession to the general fund of seamen as it is already  i must confess this scheme for the increase of seamen seems the most fitted for practice of any i have yet met with because it provides a fund for the support of the supernumerary list without burthening the country and lays a foundation for the supply of the navy upon any sudden emergencies in so easy certain and expeditious a manner as would make the naval power of england very terrible in the world for by this method whatever exigence of sudden service might present the english would be able to man out a formidable fleet in a shorter time than any other nation in the world for the government would be supposed to have always  0000 seamen at home or so near call the coasting navigation included that they might be all shipped in fourteen days time at farthest and that without hurry without violence without fail and without expense  i forbear to enlarge upon this scheme because as i have said it may be called a project and is not i doubt likely to be attempted and perhaps would require some more than ordinary application to be reduced to practice especially at first but i cannot quit it without acknowledging that if it might be set on foot it seems to me to be a scheme the most likely to answer all the ends as well of increasing as of encouraging the seamen of england and the most capable of improvement of any i ever met with  but i must take a little notice of the schemes and projects for this work which have been accepted by our superiors and have been reduced to practice some even of these we have found cautiously speaking unperforming or at least insufficient such as hospitals for sick and wounded seamen which during the late war were found necessary to be erected in several places i mean temporary hospitals on shore as well as hospital ships  these were very useful indeed and it was an encouragement to the seaman to see provision made for him in case of accident whether by wounds or other disease but i say this is only temporary and these all cease with the war nor is this any thing at all to the increasing the numbers of the seamen or encouraging them in the sense now proposed that is to say to come in without pressing  the next and great project which made indeed a great noise for a while was that of registring the seamen by name in books and an office for that purpose to be kept at a great expense and for which the seamen themselves were to pay but what has this done for them more than entitling them to an hospital which with submission they were entitled to parochially before which though it was not an equal provision in the state and magnificence of the thing or in the plenty and convenience of it yet it may without offense be said to be a superior provision for the poor as well seamen as others to any other of that kind in the world  it is true and it has been often boasted abroad that there are many more and greater hospitals for maintenance of the poor in spain italy france and portugal than there are in england as the misericordia at naples which they tell us has  00000 crowns a year revenue another at seville and several others at madrid besides innumerable others but this might be effectually answered by telling them that we have above  000 hospitals in england besides all the hospitals of private endowment every parish being the poor mans hospital in which he has a legal right by inheritance to be maintained and that therefore no poor man in england can be said to starve if the parishofficers do their duty  but not to lessen the advantage to the seamen of their claim to a retreat in the royal hospital of greenwich which the register is said to entitle them to nor to lessen the value of that glorious foundation itself yet it may be added that still in the main this straitens the circumstances of the poor seamans family whose pay though not large before is yet made so much less by the allowances which he was obliged to make out of it toward this hospital besides all those other deductions made before such as to the surgeon to the chaplain to the chest at chatham etc all which may be said to assist in reducing the pay of the seamen and this at a time when the support and maintaining his family is heavier upon him than ever it was upon his forefathers the seamen of the past ages  his majesty has indeed recommended the hospital of greenwich to the consideration of his parliament and i will not doubt but ways and means may be found out to make that foundation yet more extensive and more capable of relieving the distressed seamen i will for once suppose it were as i believe it might be made an universal support so that all the decayed and invalid seamen of england scotland and ireland were to have their assistance from it when they came to want it  but i do not see much of the immediate influence this will have on the present encouragement of seamen or on the increase of their number for    the hospital does nothing that i know of for them till they come to be old and decayed or wounded and disabled and it is a great matter to do that and were our seamen a generation of people that looked so far before them as from youth and strength to age and infirmity and from sound and whole limbs to wounds and disasters things which they have as much reason to think of as most men it might be of some more weight with them than i doubt it is but it does not seem to belong much to the character of an english seaman to think much especially of such remote things and therefore we cannot say that part is so much of an encouragement as in the nature and reason of the thing it ought to be    the hospital is concerned principally in taking care of seamen out of the service not in it and of seamen past service not encouraging them to the service it is the seamens interval between the sea and the grave where he is made comfortable to himself when he is good for nothing to any body else nor is this undervaluing the hospital in the least it is a very great article in itself and well worth the charity of a christian nation to take care of the latter days of those poor men who have spent their strength and prime in the most useful service of their country  but though the hospital of greenwich were in its utmost designed perfection it does not seem to reach the present case or indeed to be much concerned in it it is the bringing men into the service not the sending them out of it that is the present enquiry  the introduction of seamen is chiefly by breeding them up from childhood on board the ships bringing them up to the sea as an employment or trade and it is chiefly done by our colliers coasters fishingboats wherries keels lighters and all the small craft of homenavigation the merchant ships indeed carry some such as cabbinboys chiefly by the captain and some officers are allowed to take boys but these are few  as the seamen at least threefourths of them are thus bred to the business from their most early time it can hardly be suggested that the benefit of an hospital for their latest time is any part of their consideration or is of weight in their choice of the employment so that this can have no great share in a proposal for increasing the numbers of seamen that must be a work of a different nature and would well employ the care of a parliament and indeed of any one else that can assist the public in an affair of such consequence  to bring it into as narrow a compass as i can i see but two ways by which the numbers of seamen can be increased i mean such as the public can concern itself in for as for the parishchildren and the children of distressed families on or near the seacoast it is the natural consequence of their situation they flow as naturally into the seaservice whether for war or trade as the rivers run into the ocean but to do something in a public way is to bring such men or such boys into and up for the service of the sea which could not or would not be done before  for the parliament to direct sending such to sea as would of course go there without that direction is doing nothing or nothing to the purpose which is all one and is below the dignity as well as the wisdom of parliament to be concerned in but the increase which may be thought to come with such an authority as that of the parliament may be supposed to be some of these or such like    some measures to be taken to bring up for this service all that unhappy swarm of young vagrant boys who at present are the burden not of this city only but of all the towns in england and who seem to be brought up for the devil that is for the gallows for they generally learn to be first beggars then thieves and if they are early transported it is a mercy in their fate which they have great reason to be thankful for  no law that i can think of could be established upon a more true christian foundation it is the height of charity and the most shining virtue of a private man and the most glorious of a nation for it snatches a breed of imps as they may many of them be called out of the clutches of the devil out of the very jaws of eternal destruction whose fate is summed up in few words thus that they are born beggars bred thieves and dye criminals  nor would the number of them be inconsiderable it is scarce credible what a black throng they are many of them indeed perish young and dye miserable before they may be said to look into life some are starved with hunger some with cold many are found frozen in the streets and fields some drowned before they are old enough to be hanged  how noble a foundation would an hospital be equal in magnitude to that of greenwich or chelsea to receive the whole body of these miserables to feed cloth govern and teach them from the age of about five to fourteen and then send them out civilized instructed bred up to good letters and good manners into the kings service or into the merchants service as occasion should present i say no more here the parliament or the government if they espouse such a proposal know well enough how to improve upon it and a small payment to be made where i humbly think it would be no burden to the king or to the commerce would raise a sufficient fund to endow and support it  such a step as this would raise a succession of able seamen and in a few years would come to remit a thousand or perhaps two or three thousand sturdy youths every year into the general class of english seamen and it were easy to entail that supply upon the navy by way of preference to all other service by entailing some little payment upon them from the house as often as the navy giving a public call they shall come cheerfully in and enter themselves for the service of their country i could enlarge very agreeably upon such a proposal as this and upon the many ways which it may be improved and made useful to the public but i have not room for it here  as this scheme would help to supply the navy with bred seamen or mariners brought up to the sea from their childhood so another would bring a supply of ablebodyed landmen into the service equivalent to what is contained in the scheme mentioned above by which poor men wanting employment might be entertained in the service of their country and brought in by time and experience to serve as able seamen  the only difficulty in either of these proposals is how the government shall find business for any considerable number of men in time of peace and if that time of peace should last long as sometimes has been the case what use shall be made of them  to this might be answered very directly the government are obliged to keep a very considerable number of men always at work in naval affairs though it were a time of continued settled and lasting peace and may keep more than they do now and were i intending to make this tract a book of schemes i could lay such ways open to the public view as would convince every reader there is no difficulty in it nor any charge but what the things themselves should supply but as i have said above that i am no projector so i shall not pretend to lead my superiors in matters wherein they are so abundantly sufficient to themselves  this is certain that  000 to  000 ablebodyed landmen might with ease be employed in the home affair of the navy such as in docks yards guardships ropewalks repairing building and on every occasion of service be transferred to the navy with advantage it would perhaps be thought impertinent for an author without doors to tell the gentlemen in his majestys service how and in what manner unexperienced and raw men such as by the usage of the navy are called landmen are to be fitted for the sea service by those several employments about the kings yards and docks which yet do not immediately denominate them to be seamen it is enough to say that those employments do so much qualify them as to make them handy at the work knowing in the terms and ready at many particulars of the sea service and they are with much the less difficulty enured to the sea and made capable of every part of the duty of a seaman and if other men are two years in ripening up or finishing for the degree of an able seaman such men will in one year be equal to them  thus the kings service will be its own nursery and the navy be in a manner sufficient to itself or at least as far as such yearly increase would contribute to it  i could here also propose measures for the increase of seamen by the method mentioned above of obliging the merchantships to take always a certain number of such ablebodyed landmen on board every voyage they went paying as is usual for raw unexperienced seamen the public paying an additional sum to eke out their pay but those schemes are too tedious for this work i must go on  chap iv of the several ways and means for encouraging seamen to enter into the public service  as i have given some specificks for the increasing of seamen being the first head mentioned in his majestys speech it remains to speak of their encouragement which though mentioned last is indeed the most important and most extensive part of the grievance though it may perhaps admit of the plainest and easyest remedies  it is in a few words expressed thus the contrary to those things which have been enumerated as discouraging to the seamen and in which they are said to be under hardships and disappointments are the just measures for their encouragement this is speaking plain and to the purpose  i have seen a proposal in print and by an able hand too for an addition to the smallness of their pay if as is said above by reason of the difference between the rate of things necessary to the support of a family the seaman is under hardship and discouragement and is not able to live as the seamen formerly could then it may be properly said his pay is not so sufficient to him as it formerly was for if it is not so equal to his expense though it may not be less in quantity yet it is less in effect to give the seamen what they cannot subsist upon though it be the same specific pay which they had before yet it is not the same in the language of wages because the poor men cannot live as they did before provisions necessary being advanced in price their money will not go so far as it did before neither in buying them food or fuel meat drink or clothes  it is not my business to enter into a calculation of the proportions in the difference of the money between    s per month forty years ago and    s per month now nor am i making a demand for the seamen i am rather stating their circumstances and laying the poor seamen at the foot of the parliaments goodness to consider their condition and to encourage them as is the usual terms of a petition in such manner as to the honorable house in their great wisdom shall seem meet in short i am only laying open the fact namely that the seamen are under some disadvantages from the proportion of their pay to the manifest difference in the way of living occasioned by the dearness of provisions taxes etc as enumerated above  as far as their discouragements lie in this particular of their pay so far an addition of their wages would be an encouragement that is certain whether the parliament will think fit to encourage them by that addition or by what other method is not my business  but i cannot refrain earnestly recommending to the legislature the second head of discouragement under which the seamen suffer the abuses and injuries mentioned in our second chapter page     viz first the exactions of usury and extortion lending money to the poor seamen upon their growing wages and taking exorbitant interest on pretense of the risque they run of the sailors honesty besides taking assignments and powers to receive their whole pay and leaving the sailors to get the overplus how they can and sometimes not at all    the forging false powers and taking up the poor mens pay without any legal right so defrauding the poor men of their pay after it being so dearly earned at the expense or at least the hazard of their lives  both these evils call aloud to the legislature for redress and both are most easy to be redressed the first by establishing an office of loan from the government by which the seamen may be allowed to borrow money of the government itself at a reasonable interest as the south sea company gave leave to the owners of stock to borrow money upon it of the company which loan upon their pay may be well secured by only keeping a current account for every seaman between their growing pay and the credit given them in which case the seamen would be saved from usury and extortion and their families be relieved instead of ruined by the loan whether it can be just to prohibit the poor men borrowing money upon the security of their pay without some such medium as this for their supply i dare not determine without doors the legislature will no doubt consider that part when it comes before them  but if this method is not taken and yet the seamen left at liberty as reason and necessity seem to me to dictate to borrow then the frauds of the lenders and their extortions on the poor borrowers may yet effectually be prevented by a register of powers which if duly kept as has been often proposed no counterfeit powers could be made use of nor any person receive the pay or wages of a seaman but those who had a legal claim to it nor receive more of it than they had a right to so the seaman could not be abused or the lenders defrauded of their right  this registring of powers like registring of mortgages would also put an end at once to the frauds of that scandalous sort of people the sollicitors who go about to help people to their wages to get it received for them and pretend to bring it to them but much oftener conceal their having received it and cheat the poor men that labored for it  while these things are doing for the safety of the seamans property and to secure him from the cruelty and extortion the frauds and exactions of lenders of money and sollicitors there remains another clause on the governments side which i shall but mention and recommend it to authority as a piece of justice to his majestys service namely whether some restraint may not justly be laid on the commerce that is on the merchants service that private men masters owners of ships merchants etc should not give more pay to the seamen than the king or at least be limited to a certain rate  it is certain trade can have no injury by this for whatever pay is given to the seamen in time of scarcity of men though given by the masters and owners is all levied upon the trade and that with an increase by advancing the price of freight this was evident in the late war when fraights of ships were raised from  0 s per ton from spain and portugal to   l from   l per ton from our colonies to    and    or    l per ton and in others to a certain rate on the weight of the goods not the bulk all which was done on pretense of the advance of pay to the seamen whose wages were raised from    s per month to  0 and    s afore the mast and in proportion for carpenters coopers cooks and other officers to the great obstruction of the public service and no less to the loss and damage of the commerce in general  a due restraint upon this part would be no hardship upon the seaman but would make the service of the public and of the merchant more indifferent to him than it was before nor would it be any damage to the merchant and would also be an advantage to trade in general to conclude all out of this embryo may be brought forth a seaborn creature which might out of its own bowels effectually supply the public all that it could be out of pocket for the proposed advance of wages to the seamen and yet trade be so far from suffering that the merchants would bless the proposal and think themselves good gainers by the payment but this is not my business it is enough that i have started this thought into the world the public does not want more able heads to work it into shape and make it as it is abundantly capable of being the best scheme of its kind that has yet been laid before them  finis
