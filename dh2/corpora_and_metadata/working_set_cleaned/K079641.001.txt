observations on the mountains and lakes of cumberland and westmoreland  observations relative chiefly to picturesque beauty made in the year      on several parts of england particularly the mountains and lakes of cumberland and westmoreland  vol i  by william gilpin m a prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in newforest near lymington  london printed for r blamire strand mdcclxxxvi  to the queen madam as your majesty condescended to look into the following papers when they were in manuscript i hoped you would not think it presumption in me to ask your royal permission to present them to you in their more improved state and it gave me peculiar pleasure to ask this permission through the mediation of a lady whose very respectable character and revered age then bowing under one of the severest of gods dispensations the king and your majesty took under your protection and with an amiable attention perhaps unequalled in the annals of royalty have made that protection much less valuable even in it is bounty than in that easy grace which accompanies it and which in the same moment confers and annihilates the obligation  that your majestys may be long preserved to enjoy the elegant amusement of the polite arts which you are so ready to encourage and the heartfelt satisfaction of the sublimest virtues which you thus exemplify is the sincere prayer of  madam your majestys most respectful most obedient and very humble servant william gilpin  preface the following observations on various scenes of english landscape were written about thirteen years ago they were at first thrown together warm from the subject each evening after the scene of the day had been presented and in a moment of more leisure were corrected and put into form  but merely for the amusement of the writer himself who had not in truth at that time the least idea of their being able to furnish amusement to any body else a few only of his friends saw them one of them however saw them with so partial an eye that he thought proper to mention them to the public masons memoirs of gray p      this raised the curiosity of many and laid the author under the necessity of producing his papers to a wider circle but still without any design of publishing them a sense of their imperfections and of the many difficulties in which such a work would engage him prevented any intention of that kind  among others who desired to see them was the late duchess dowager of portland a lady of whose superior character the world is well informed having seen them soon after they were written and a second time after an interval of seven or eight years her grace pressed the author to print them most obligingly offering to facilitate an expensive publication by contributing largely to a subscription tho the author chose to decline that mode of publication yet the duchesss persuasion was among his principal inducements to prepare his papers for the public the presswork was about half completed at the time of her graces death  but tho this work has been thus flattered and has received considerable improvements both from the author himself during the many years it has lain by him and from several of his ingenious friends yet still he offers it to the public with apprehension  his apprehension is first grounded on the inadequate time he had to employ in making observations on the several landscapes he has described no one can paint a country properly unless he has seen it in various lights the following descriptions are faithful copies it is hoped of each scene under the circumstances in which it appeared at the time it was described but he who should see any one scene as it is differently affected by a lowering sky or a bright one might probably see two very different landscapes he might not only see distances blotted out or splendidly exhibited but he might even see variations produced in the very objects themselves and that merely from the different times of the day in which they were examined the summit of a mountain for instance which in a morning appears round may discover when enlightened by an evening ray a double top rocks and woods take different shapes from the different directions of light while the hues and tints of objects on which their effect in a great measure depends are continually changing nay we sometimes see in a mountainous country especially a variation of light alter the whole disposition of a landscape in a warm sunshine the purple hills may skirt the horizon and appear broken into numberless pleasing forms but under a sullen sky a total change may be produced the distant mountains and all their beautiful projections may disappear and their place be occupied by a dead flat all the author could do to obviate difficulties of this kind was to specify in general under what kind of light and weather the several landscapes he saw were exhibited  in his views of lakescenery indeed which form the principal part of the following work he has less cause to fear and offers his observations with more confidence among these scenes he rested some time and tho he saw each scene but once yet as he spent near a week among them he saw so much of their varieties that he could make allowances for the effects of light and weather and could speak of them in general with more precision  he is under another apprehension from the variations which time as well as weather produces in scenery even the wild features of nature suffer continual change from various causes  enclosures  canals  quarries  buildings  and above all from the growth or destruction of timber and if the wild scenes of nature suffer change how much more may we expect to observe it in the improvement of particular places which are professedly altering with the taste or fancy of their owners few of these scenes continue long the same the growth of trees and shrubs is continually making changes in them even in a natural course it is probable therefore that many of the embellished scenes described in the following work are now totally changed and that the author has rather exhibited a history of the past than a representation of the present thirteen or fourteen years bring a shrub to perfection after that period if the knife be not freely used a shrubbery from mere natural causes will of itself decay  lakescenery it is true is less subject to change the broader the features are the less they will vary water which makes the grand part of this kind of scenery remains unaltered by time and the rocks and mountains which inviron the lake are as little subject to variation as any of the materials of landscape can be wood is the only feature which can have suffered any considerable change in this indeed great devastation has been made in several of the northern lakes especially in that of keswick  those beautiful scenes produced formerly great quantities of valuable timber which adorned the banks of the lake and enriched it is lofty skreens but after the rebellion of the year      these lands together with all the other estates of the unfortunate earl of derwentwater were forfeited to the crown and were given by george i to increase the endowment of greenwichhospital the trustees of which immediately sold and cut down almost all the timber  before this depredation the lake of keswick was a glorious scene no one however now remembers it in it is splendour since that time it has suffered little change yet some it has suffered two woods neither of them inconsiderable on the two opposite sides of the lake one belonging to the derwentwater estate the other to lord egremont have been destroyed the author uses the word destroyed because of the barbarous method of cutting timber which prevails in the northern counties in the south of england the proprietor sends an experienced surveyor into his woods who marks such timber as is fit for the axe leaving all the young thriving trees behind the wood therefore if fenced soon rears again its ancient honors and becomes a perennial nursery in the north it is otherwise there the merchant agrees for the wood altogether as it stands and the proprietor for the sake of a present advantage suffers him to lay the whole flat nothing but a copse springs up in its room and all succession of timber is prevented this has operated among other causes in the general destruction of timber in the northern counties  the author believes the lake of keswick has suffered these two last mentioned depredations since the following remarks were made but as he is informed the underwood has increased considerably and has in many parts added some degree of richness to the mountains and promontaries around the lake he is not apprehensive that any changes in so short an interval can in any material way affect his descriptions it is true there will ever be a great difference between the grandeur of a wood and the poverty of a copse and on the spot it will be evident enough but in all the distances of these extensive views it will not so easily be observed  another ground of the authors apprehension is that he may be thought too severe in his strictures on scenes of art the grand natural scene will always appear so superior to the embellished artificial one that the picturesque eye in contemplating the former will be too apt to look contemptuously on the latter this is just as arrogant as to despise a propriety because it cannot be classed with a cardinal virtue each mode of scenery has it is station a wild forest scene contiguous to a noble mansion would be just as absurd as an embellished one in the midst of a forest  a house is an artificial object and the scenery around it must in some degree partake of art propriety requires it convenience demands it but if it partake of art as allied to the mansion it should also partake of nature as allied to the country it has therefore two characters to support and may be considered as the connecting thread between the regularity of the house and the freedom of the natural scene these two characters it should ever have in view  under this regulation the business of the embellished scene is to make every thing convenient and comfortable around the house  to remove offensive objects and to add a pleasing foreground to the distance if there be no distance it must depend the more on it is own beauties but still in every circumstance it must well observe it is double character and discover as much of the simplicity of nature as is consistent with it is artificial alliance if the scene be large it throws off art by degrees the more it recedes from the mansion and approaches the country  it is true we cannot well admit the embellished scene among objects purely picturesque it is too trim and neat for the pencil which ever delights in the bold free negligent strokes and roughnesses of nature  abhorring in it is wild sallies the least intrusion of art  or however allowing only the admission of such objects as have about them the carelessness the simplicity and the freedom of nature such in a particular manner are ruins objects indeed of a more formal kind as buildings and shipping are suffered  sometimes for the sake of contrast  and sometimes for the pleasing ideas they excite but as objects of picturesque beauty we utterly reject them till they have deposited all their square formalities the building must be thrown into perspective the ship foreshortened and it is sails varied before they must presume to attract the notice of the picturesque eye  the embellished scene has still more of this formal mixture but tho it is not enough marked with the bold free characters of nature to be purely picturesque it is still under it is proper regulations a very beautiful species of landscape it has beauties peculiar to itself and if it astonish us not with grandeur and sublimity it pleases with symmetry and elegance  in the body of his book the author has ventured to call the embellished scene one of the peculiar features of english landscape see page    but we must still lament that this beautiful mode of composition is oftener aimed at than attained it is double alliance with art and nature is rarely observed with perfect impartiality ambitious ornaments generally take the lead and nature is left behind  where little improprieties offend they are readily passed over but where the offense against nature becomes capital it is not easy to repress indignation  in so extensive a tour as the following pages contain it must be supposed that a variety of very disgusting scenes of this kind would occur  scenes in which nature was forced  in which she was arrayed in alien beauties  or overloaded with tawdry ornaments in truth such scenes often did occur but the author however severe he may be thought has endeavored to proceed on principles which he hoped could not reasonably give offense he studiously checked all severity of criticism where the improver still enjoyed his scene it would have hurt him to have disturbed the innocent tho perhaps tasteless amusements of any one tho he should not have chosen to speak sentiments not his own yet he could always be silent or look aside where he did not wish to examine but where the improver of the scene was dead especially when his works were published by being thrown open to curiosity the author thought himself at perfect liberty all such scenes he considered as fair game he has without scruple therefore remarked freely upon them and has endeavored to point out the many strange errors and absurdities to which an inattention to nature has given birth  quorum velut aegri somnia vanae finguntur species ut nec pes nec caput uni reddatur formae    but even here he has avoided all general unmarked censure which he considers as the garb of slander he has always accompanied his criticisms with reasons and if the reason have no force the criticism falls of course  it may be objected perhaps that the author has wrought up many of his descriptions in the following work higher than the simplicity of prosaic language may allow simplicity no doubt is the foundation of beauty in every species of composition but the simplicity of a familiar letter differs from the simplicity of history and the simplicity of a poem from the simplicity of both  that is one work may be more highly colored than another and wrought up with warmer language and a greater variety of images now the following work at least the descriptive parts of it approach as near the idea of poetic composition as any kind of prosaic writing can do it is the aim of picturesque description to bring the images of nature as forcibly and as closely to the eye as it can and this must often be done by highcolouring which this species of composition demands by highcolouring is not meant a string of rapturous epithets which is the feeblest mode of description but an attempt to analize the views of nature  to open their several parts in order to show the effect of a whole  to mark their tints and varied lights  and to express all this detail in terms as appropriate and yet as vivid as possible in attempting this if the language be forced and inflated no doubt it is the just object of criticism but if tho highly colored it keep within the descriptas vices operisque colores it may be hoped it will escape censure  the author fears too he may be called on to apologize for the many digressions he has made but if in this point he has erred he has erred with his best judgment whether his work be considered as didactic or descriptive as in fact it is intended to be a species between both he thought it wanted some little occasional relief traveling continually among rocks and mountains hills and valleys and remarking upon them he feared might be tedious and therefore when any observations anecdote or history grew naturally from his subject he was glad to take the advantage of it and draw the reader a little aside that he might return to the principal object with less satiety this too is poetic license what in argument would be absurd in works of amusement may be necessary if any of these digressions however should appear forced  out of place  or unconnected with the subject for them he wishes to apologize  the author hopes no one will be so severe as to think a work of this kind tho a work only of amusement inconsistent with the profession of a clergyman he means not to address himself to the lax notions of the age to which he is no way apprehensive of giving offense but he should be sorry to hurt the feelings of the most serious how far field sports and a variety of other diversions which may be proper in some stations are quite agreeable to the clerical one is a subject he means not to discuss yet surely the study of nature in every shape is allowable and affords amusement which the severest cannot well reprehend  the study of the heavens  of the earth  of the field  of the garden it is productions fruits and flowers  of the bowels of the earth containing such amazing stores of curiosity  and of animal life through all it is astonishing varieties even to the shell and the insect among these objects of rational amusement may we not enumerate also the beautiful appearances of the face of nature  the ground indeed which the author has taken that of examining landscape by the rules of picturesque beauty seems rather a deviation from nature to art yet in fact it is not so for the rules of picturesque beauty we know are drawn from nature so that to examine the face of nature by these rules is no more than to examine nature by her own most beautiful exertions thus shakespeare  there is an art which does mend nature  change it rather but that art itself is nature  the author however hopes he should not greatly err if he allowed also the amusements furnished by the three sisterarts to be all very consistent with the strictest rules of the clerical profession the only danger is lest the amusement  the fascinating amusement  should press on improperly and interfere too much with the employment  in a little work of the picturesque kind observations on the river wye and several parts of south wales  which the author printed about three years ago he gave several drawings under the character of portraits rather induced by the partiality of his friends than his own judgment he was sensible that sketches taken in the hasty manner in which those were taken could not pretend to the accuracy necessary in portrait he endeavored however to guard his readers against considering them as such by saying they meant only to give some idea of the general effect of a scene but in no degree to mark the several picturesque and ornamental particulars of which it is composed but he himself thought and so he doubts not did the public that this was an insufficient apology for they were certainly not accurate enough to give even the general effect of a scene  in the drawings presented in this work he has followed more his own judgment except a few he has given nothing that pretends to the name of portrait sensible that the hasty drawings he made in this tour which were certainly made without any intention of publication did not deserve it indeed mr faringtons prints render any other portraits of the lakes unnecessary they are by far in the authors opinion the most accurate and beautiful views of that romantic country which he has seen the fall of lodoar and the view of derwentwater with the mountain of skiddaw as a background from brandelow woods are particularly fine  the principal drawings which are preserved in the following work are of two kinds  one kind is meant to illustrate and explain picturesque ideas this indeed may be considered among the most useful aids of the pencil intellectual ideas it cannot reach but picturesque ideas are all clothed in bodily forms and may often be explained better by a few strokes of the pencil than by a volume of the most labored description  the other sort of drawings is meant to characterize the countries through which the reader is carried the ideas are taken from the general face of the country not from any particular scene and indeed this may perhaps be the most useful way of conveying local ideas for a portrait characterizes only a single spot the idea must be relinquished as soon as the place is passed but such imaginary views as give a general idea of a country spread themselves more diffusely and are carried in the readers imagination through the whole description  but whatever becomes of their utility they are beyond all doubt the most picturesque kind of drawings portraits may be faithful but they are rarely in every part beautiful the distance may be fine  the ruin may be elegant yet will there always be some awkwardness in one part or other which you would wish to remove but truth forbids if you are determined to call nothing a portrait but what is exactly copied from nature you must take it as it is good and bad and make the best of it  the fact is you may often find a beautiful distance remote objects tho sometimes awkward do not always strike the eye with their awkwardnesses the obscurity occasioned by the intervening medium softens each line or tint that is harsh or discordant but as the landscape advances on the eye the deformity grows more apparent and on the foreground objects are so magnified that it is very rare indeed if they do not in some part offend their features become then so strong that if they be not beautiful they are disgusting  on the other hand he who works from imagination  that is he who culls from nature the most beautiful parts of her productions  a distance here and there a foreground  combines them artificially and removing every thing offensive admits only such parts as are congruous and beautiful will in all probability make a much better landscape than he who takes all as it comes and without selecting beauties copies only what he sees presented in each particular scene  but you wish for the representation of some particular scene it is truth you desire and not fiction  who objects but even here you must allow a little to the imagination or your scene will probably never please what is it that you admire is it the spot you stand on or is it the grandeur of some lake  a cove of mountains  an enriched distance  the windings of a noble river  or some other exhibition which is in fact much to be admired this noble scene whatever it is you wish to see set off to the best advantage in order therefore to give this advantage to the part you admire you must allow your artist to take some liberty with the ground he stands on which is evidently not the part you admire and probably abounds with deformities  it is not meant to give him license instead of liberty of the grand exhibition before him which is the portrait you want he must take a faithful copy if it present any striking deformity it is not a subject for the pencil it should be relinquished but if it be pure in all it is parts the foreground should be made equal to it yet nothing should be introduced alien to the scene presented such alterations only your artist should make as the nature of the country allows and the beauty of composition requires trees he may generally plant or remove at pleasure if a withered stump suit the form of his landscape better than the spreading oak which he finds in nature he may make the exchange  or he may make it if he wish for a spreading oak where he finds a withered trunk he has no right we allow to add a magnificent castle  an impending rock  or a river to adorn his foreground these are new features but he may certainly break an illformed hillock and shovel the earth about him as he pleases without offense he may pull up a piece of awkward paling  he may throw down a cottage  he may even turn the course of a road or a river a few yards on this side or that these trivial alterations may greatly add to the beauty of his composition and yet they interfere not with the truth of portrait most of these things may in fact be altered tomorrow tho they disgust today the road and the river it is true keep their station but the change you desire is so trifling that the eye of truth can never be offended tho the picturesque eye may be exceedingly gratified there is a very beautiful scene on the banks of the tay near perth which in composition is correctly picturesque except only that the river forming two parallel lines with the sides of the picture enters the foreground at right angles so offensive a form could not but injure the beauty of any landscape would the truth of portrait be injured in painting this subject if trees were planted to hide the deformity or a small turn given to the river to break it is disgusting regularity  the author means not however to offer the portraits and illustrations he has here given as perfect examples of the principles he has laid down it is a difficult matter for any artist at least who does not claim as a professional man to reach his own ideas what he represents will ever fall short of what he imagines with regard to figures particularly the author wishes to premise that the rules laid down in the beginning of the second volume page    etc are here little observed those remarks were chiefly intended for works in a larger style figures on so small a scale as these are not capable of receiving character they are at best only what he calls picturesque appendages  besides the representations here given have again sustained a loss by going through a translation in so rough and unmanageable a language as that of brass and aquafortis the mode of etching chosen is the newly invented one of aquatinta which is certainly the softest and comes the nearest to the idea of drawing but this species of etching itself tho even managed by a masterly hand is subject to great inconveniences especially when a large number of prints are taken from one plate it is impossible to make lights graduate as they ought  to keep distances pure  and to give those strong characteristic touches to objects which may be done with a brush in drawing unavoidable defects however the candid will excuse and may rest assured that the author took all the pains he could by correcting the proofs to make

volume observations on several parts of england especially the lakes etc section i before we make any observations on the picturesque beauty of particular places it may not be amiss to take a slight view of those great features on which picturesque beauty in landscape so much depends  almost the whole of the western coast of england is mountainous and rocky and as it approaches the sea it is often scooped into large bays and inlets environed by promontories  on the eastern side the coast consists chiefly of low flat sandy shores from the mouth of the thames as far as scarborough in yorkshire where the coast first becomes rocky at this point it deviates so much from the general character it has thus far maintained that the river derwent which rises very near the sea instead of entering it directly retires from it and joins the humber at the distance of forty miles  from scarborough the eastern coast assumes the character of the western and is more or less rocky as far as the tweed  the southern coast lying between countries of such different characters participates of both  such is the general idea of the great boundaries of england  if we leave the coast and take a view of the internal parts of the country we find the southern counties much varied with hill and dale the western rather approach the mountainous character almost the whole of wales is in that style of landscape but in the midland and eastern parts we scarce find any elevation that deserves to be mentioned they are generally level till we arrive near the center of the island  in derbyshire the first mountainous country begins there the high lands forming themselves by degrees into a chain of mountains direct their course toward the northwest they first divide lancashire from yorkshire then entering westmoreland they spread themselves over the whole of that county and a part of cumberland again contracting themselves into a chain and forming the limits between cumberland and northumberland they continue their course northward and enter scotland  it is in the various parts of this vast combination of mountains to which we may add those of wales where the admirers of the beautiful and sublime in english landscape are chiefly gratified  there is another grand feature that may be noticed in the internal parts of england and that is the vast beds of chalk which are found in various parts  a chalky soil has indeed not so great an effect on the picturesque form of a country as rocks and mountains and yet it is effect is not inconsiderable it generally produces a peculiar style of landscape  an impoverished kind without the grandeur of the rocky country or the cheerful luxuriance of the sylvan it runs out commonly into wide diffusive downs swelling into frequent elevations these are it is usual characters where the chalk approaches nearest the surface but as it runs at various depths it has of course in many places very little effect on landscape in the lower grounds where the rains through a succession of ages have washed the soil from the higher you see often a very luxuriant vegetation  the great central patria of chalk if i may so phrase it seems to be in the contiguous parts of berkshire wiltshire dorsetshire and hampshire from this vast bed three principal ridges of it extend  the first leaving berkshire crosses the thames and running northward through buckinghamshire enters bedfordshire and ends about dunstable beyond which chalk is never found  a second running eastward occupies great part of surrey and turning near dartford to the southeast continues in that direction forming high grounds till it meet the sea abruptly at dover  the third great ridge takes a more southerly course occupying a vast tract near eighty miles in length tho scarce any where above four miles broad which is known by the name of the southdowns of sussex portsdown may be considered as a branch of this ridge  besides these three great ridges it appears in a few other detached parts but very rarely  similar remarks might be made with some accuracy on the effects which other soils have on landscape but as these effects are not so striking i wish not to appear refined i shall only observe in general that the variety and intermixture of soils and strata in this island are very great  from whatever cause it proceeds certain i believe it is that this country exceeds most countries in the variety of it is picturesque beauties i should not wish to speak merely as an englishman the suffrages of many travelers and foreigners of taste i doubt not might be adduced  in some or other of the particular species of landscape it may probably be excelled switzerland may perhaps exceed it in the beauty of it is wooded valleys germany in it is riverviews and italy in it is lakescenes but if it yield to some of these countries in particular beauties i should suppose that on the whole it transcends them all it exhibits perhaps more variety of hill and dale and level ground than is any where to be seen in so small a compass it is rivers assume every character diffusive winding and rapid it is estuaries and coastviews are varied of course from the form and rockiness of it is shores it is mountains and lakes tho they cannot perhaps rival as i have just observed some of the choice lakes of italy  about tivoli especially where the most perfect models of this kind of landscape are said to be presented are yet in variety i presume equal to the lakescenery of any country  but besides the variety of it is beauties in some or other of which it may be rivalled it possesses some beauties which are peculiar to itself  one of these peculiar features arises from the intermixture of wood and cultivation which is found oftener in english landscape than in the landscape of other countries in france in italy in spain and in most other places cultivation and wood have their separate limits trees grow in detached woods and cultivation occupies vast unbounded common fields but in england the custom of dividing property by hedges and of planting hedgerows so universally prevails that almost wherever you have cultivation there also you have wood  now although this regular intermixture produces often deformity on the nearer grounds yet at a distance it is the source of great beauty on the spot no doubt and even in the first distances the marks of the spade and the plough the hedge and the ditch together with all the formalities of hedgerow trees and square divisions of property are disgusting in a high degree but when all these regular forms are softened by distance  when hedgerow trees begin to unite and lengthen into streaks along the horizon  when farmhouses and ordinary buildings lose all their vulgarity of shape and are scattered about in formless spots through the several parts of a distance  it is inconceivable what richness and beauty this mass of deformity when melted together adds to landscape one vast tract of wild uncultivated country unless either varied by large parts or under some peculiar circumstances of light cannot produce the effect nor is it produced by unbounded tracts of cultivation which without the intermixture of wood cannot give richness to distance  thus english landscape affords a species of rich distance which is rarely to be found in any other country  you have likewise from this intermixture of wood and cultivation the advantage of being sure to find a tree or two on the foreground to adorn any beautiful view you may meet with in the distance  another peculiar feature in the landscape of this country arises from the great quantity of english oak with which it abounds the oak of no country has equal beauty nor does any tree answer all the purposes of scenery so well the oak is the noblest ornament of a foreground spreading from side to side it is tortuous branches and foliage rich with some autumnal tint in a distance also it appears with equal advantage forming itself into beautiful clumps varied more in shape and perhaps more in color than the clumps of any other tree the pine of italy has it is beauty hanging over the broken pediment of some ruined temple the chestnut of calabria is consecrated by adorning the foregrounds of salvator the elm the ash and the beech have all their respective beauties but no tree in the forest is adapted to all the purposes of landscape like english oak  among the peculiar features of english landscape may be added the embellished garden and parkscene in other countries the environs of great houses are yet under the direction of formality the wonderworking hand of art with it is regular cascades spouting fountains flights of terraces and other achievements have still possession of the gardens of kings and princes in england alone the model of nature is adopted  this is a mode of scenery entirely of the sylvan kind as we seek among the wild works of nature for the sublime we seek here for the beautiful and where there is a variety of lawn wood and water and these naturally combined and not too much decorated with buildings nor disgraced by fantastic ornaments we find a species of landscape which no country but england can display in such perfection not only because this just species of taste prevails no where else but also because no where else are found such proper materials the want of english oak as we have just observed can never be made up in this kind of landscape especially nor do we any where find so close and rich a verdure an easy swell may every where be given to ground but it cannot every where be covered with a velvet turf which constitutes the beauty of an embellished lawn  the moisture and vapoury heaviness of our atmosphere which produces the rich verdure of our lawns gives birth also to another peculiar feature in english landscape  that obscurity which is often thrown over distance in warmer climates especially the air is purer those mists and vapors which steam from the ground at night are dispersed with the morningsun under italian skies very remote objects are seen with great distinctness and this mode of vision no doubt has it is beauty as have all the works and all the operations of nature  but at best this is only one mode of vision our grosser atmosphere which likewise has it is seasons of purity exhibits various modes some of which are in themselves more beautiful than the most distinct vision  the several degrees of obscurity which the heaviness of our atmosphere gives to landscape may be reduced to three  haziness mists and fogs  haziness just adds that light gray tint  that thin dubious veil which is often beautifully spread over landscape it hides nothing it only sweetens the hues of nature  it gives a consequence to every common object by giving it a more indistinct form  it corrects the glare of colors  it softens the harshness of lines and above all it throws over the face of landscape that harmonizing tint which blends the whole into unity and repose  mist goes farther it spreads still more obscurity over the face of nature as haziness softens and adds a beauty perhaps to the correctest form of landscape mist is adapted to those landscapes in which we want to hide much to soften more and to throw many parts into a greater distance than they naturally occupy  even the fog which is the highest degree of a gross atmosphere is not without it is beauty in landscape especially in the mountainscenes which are so much the object of the following remarks when partial as it often is the effect is grandest when some vast promontory issuing from a cloud of vapor with which all it is upper parts are blended shoots into a lake the imagination is left at a loss to discover whence it comes or to what height it aspires the effect rises with the obscurity and the view is sometimes wonderfully great  to these natural features which are in a great degree peculiar to the landscape of england we may lastly add another of the artificial kind  the ruins of abbeys which being naturalized to the soil might indeed without much impropriety be classed among it is natural beauties  ruins are commonly divided into two kinds castles and abbeys of the former few countries perhaps can produce so many as this island for which various causes may be assigned the feudal system which lasted long in england and was carried high produced a number of castles in every part king stephens reign contributed greatly to multiply them and in the northern counties the continued wars with scotland had the same effect many of these buildings now fallen into decay remain objects of great beauty  in the ruins of castles however other countries may compare with ours but in the remains of abbeys no country certainly can  where popery prevails the abbey is still entire and inhabited and of course less adapted to landscape  but it is the mode of architecture which gives such excellence to these ruins the gothic style in which they are generally composed is i apprehend unrivalled among foreign nations and may be called a peculiar feature in english landscape  many of our ruins have been built in what is often called the saxon style this is a coarse heavy mode of architecture and seldom affords a beautiful ruin in general the saxon prevails most in the northern counties and the gothic in the southern tho each division of the kingdom affords some instances of both and in many we find them mixed  what we call saxon architecture seems to have been the awkward imitation of greek and roman models what buildings of roman origin were left in england were probably destroyed by the ruthless saxon in his early ravages afterward when alfred the great having established government and religion turned his view to arts we are told he was obliged to send to the continent for architects in what species of architecture the buildings of this prince were composed we know not but probably in a purer style than what we now call saxon as alfred lived nearer roman times and perhaps possessed in his own country some of those beautiful models which might have escaped the rage of his ancestors even now amidst all that heaviness and barbarism which we call saxon it is not difficult to trace some features of roman origin among the ruins of brinkburnabbey between rothbury and warkworth in northumberland we discover in some parts even roman elegance  this species of architecture is supposed to have continued till the time of the crusades when a new style of ornament at least fantastic in the highest degree began to appear it forms a kind of composite with the saxon and has been called by some antiquarians the saracenic tho others disallow the term many ruins of this kind are still existing  the english architect however began by degrees to strike out a new mode of architecture for himself without searching the continent for models this is called the gothic but for what reason it is hard to say for the goths who were never in england had been even forgotten when it was invented which was about the reign of henry ii it is besides found no where i believe but in england except in such parts of france as were in possession of the english  in this beautiful species of architecture the antiquarian points out three periods  when it first appeared the round saxon arch began to change into the pointed one and the short clumsy pillar began to cluster but still the saxon heaviness in part prevailed salisburycathedral which was finished about the year    0 is generally considered as a very pure specimen of the gothic in it is first and ruder form  by degrees improvements in architecture were introduced the eastwindow being enlarged was trailed over with beautiful scrawlwork while the clusteredpillar began to increase in height and elegance and to arch and ramify along the roof in short an entire new mode of architecture purely british was introduced the grandeur of the roman  the heaviness of the saxon  and the grotesque ornament of the saracenic were all equally relinquished an airy lightness pervaded the whole and ornaments of a new invention took place the cathedral of york and part of canterbury among many others are beautiful examples of this period of gothic architecture  about the time of the later henrys the last period began to obtain in the architecture of which the flat stone roof and a variety of different ornaments were the chief characteristics of this enriched style kings college chapel in cambridge and henry viis at westminster are two of the most elegant examples the flat stone roof is generally even at this day considered as a wonderful effort of art it is said that sir christopher wren himself could not conceive it he would say tell me where to place the first stone and i will follow it with a second  this style is generally considered as the perfection of gothic architecture i own it rather appears to me the decline of the art the ornaments so affectedly introduced and patched on as the rose and portcullis in kings college chapel have not in my eye the beauty of the middle style in which every ornament arises naturally from the several members of the building and makes a part of the pile itself nor has the flat roof with all it is ornaments in my opinion the simplicity and beauty of the ribbed and pointed one  abbeys formerly abounded so much in england that a delicious valley could scarce be found in which one of them was not stationed the very sites of many of these ancient edifices are now obliterated by the plough yet still so many elegant ruins of this kind are left that they may be called not only one of the peculiar features of english landscape but may be ranked also among it is most picturesque beauties  sect ii may   th      in the following tour we meant to travel the western road through oxfordshire warwickshire staffordshire cheshire and lancashire into westmoreland and cumberland where we proposed to make the lakes and mountains the chief objects of our attention and to return through yorkshire derbyshire leicestershire and northamptonshire  we crossed first into the great bath road through kingston in surrey over hounslowheath which is a dead flat together with the country around it you seem to be always in the center of a circle of four or five miles in diameter this flat is a little relieved by a view of the towers of windsorcastle rising at the distance of three or four miles on the left but it is no very considerable object from the road  about the twentyfourth stone the eye begins to get a little out of the circle breaking from it into the country but it can yet make only short excursions  the first striking scenery is the woodybank of taplow which hanging over the thames and crowned with cliefdenhouse seated loftily among the highest woods makes a grand appearance  on the road toward henly the views which may be called first distances are not unpleasing they consist of little knolls in various shapes covered with beech  the new road down henlyhill is a noble work from the lower grounds when the work was new and the chalk was continually shivering from the top it had the whimsical appearance of a vast sheet of water  henly lies pleasantly at the bottom of woody hills on the banks of the thames but the chalk bursting every where from the soil is disagreeable when a white spot has a meaning as in a wicket or a seat if it be only a spot it may often have a good effect but when it forces itself on the eye in large unmeaning patches it never fails to disturb the landscape  from henly we still continued among woody hills but they became more detached and unpleasing before we reached nettlebed the road passed through a beechengrove which lasted about a mile and on our leaving it we were presented with extensive distances these roads have all been made at a great expense as they are frequently cut through chalky hills  from bensington the rising grounds on the left along the thames at a second distance give some little beauty to the offskip as far as dorchester from thence to oxford the country grows more flat and unpleasant running sometimes into common fields and sometimes into barren wastes  the village of nuneham through which the road passes was built by lord harcourt for his cottagers and with that regularity which perhaps gives the most convenience to the dwellings of men for this we readily relinquish the picturesque idea indeed i question whether it were possible for a single hand to build a picturesque village nothing contributes more to it than the various styles in building which result from the different ideas of different people when all these little habitations happen to unite harmoniously and to be connected with the proper appendages of a village  a winding road  a number of spreading trees  a rivulet with a bridge  and a spire to bring the whole to an apex  the village is complete  nunehamhouse stands a little out of the london road about six miles from oxford the old familyseat of stantonharcourt where pope and gay led the muses is now a deserted ruin it is situation was vile compared with that of the present house which commands from a rising ground an extensive prospect over all the intervening flat as far as the towers of oxford in another direction it overlooks the windings of the thames toward abingdon these grand views terminated by the berkshire hills and other rising grounds compose the distance and are presented from different places around the house particularly from a terrace which extends at least a mile the accompaniment also of noble trees on the foreground sets off the distant scenery to great advantage  one of the most striking features in these scenes is the parish church which was dedesigned by mr stuart in the form of a grecian temple of the ionic order  we are the less able however to speak with any precision of the beauty of these scenes as a wet evening prevented our examining them as we could have wished  the house is fitted up usefully and elegantly as if intended rather for comfort than ostentation the pictures seem in general a wellchosen collection but we had neither time nor light to examine them thoroughly  and yet this is not so disadvantageous a circumstance as it may appear a distinction may be made between the furniturepicture and the cabinet one the furniturepicture should have it is full effect as a whole the composition especially the distribution of light and the harmony of coloring should be well understood these things will give it value by pleasing the eye in a transient unexamined view tho it may not so well bear a nicer scrutiny  and indeed in forming a judgment of such a picture a cursory eye may form the best it is not under the fascination and delusion which the detail of a studied picture may throw over it but judges freely of it is general effect at the same time a picture which does not thus forcibly strike the eye at once may yet well reward an accurate examination and indeed may be in itself a more valuable picture the parts may be more excellent the expression the grace the drawing and local coloring but whatever excellences such a picture may possess if it do not please at sight it seems fitter for a painters chamber or a curious cabinet than for a saloon or a drawing room  among the pictures in this collection which particularly pleased the eye at sight were two beggars by murillo  some figures representing night by castelli  a landscape by daker and another by ruisdael  here are two or three histories by poussin which having turned black with age leave us to regret that so able a master tho he was never perhaps an excellent colourist should have been so little acquainted with the nature of colors the flemish school in general seem to have had the best preparations but it might yet perhaps be useful in painting if the nature of pigments could be brought more to a certainty and that the painter like the apothecary had a sound dispensatory to direct his practice  to enter into an examination of the several buildings chapels halls libraries pictures and gardens of oxford would have engaged us in too great a work we left oxford therefore behind and proceeded to woodstock  the road still continues through a flat country it may be called a kind of cultivated dreariness  the heaviness and enormity of blenheimcastle have been greatly criticized perhaps too severely we may be too much bigoted to greek and roman architecture in the following observations on greek and roman architecture i am much indebted to mr lock  it was adapted often to local convenience under an italian sun for instance it was of great importance to exclude warmth and give a current to air the portico was well adapted to this purpose  a slavish imitation also of antique ornaments may be carried into absurdity when we see the skulls of oxen adorning a heathen temple we acknowledge their propriety but it is rather unnatural to introduce them in a christian church where sacrifice would be an offense  we are fettered also too much by orders and proportions the ancients themselves paid no such close attention to them our modern code was collected by average calculations from their works by sansovino particularly and palladio but if these modern legislators of the art had been obliged to produce precedents they could not have found any two buildings among the remains of ancient rome which were exactly of the same proportions  i would not by any means wish to shake off the wholesome restraint of those laws of art which have been made rules because they were first reasons all i mean is to apologize for vanburgh for tho it may be difficult to please in any other form of architecture than what we see in daily use yet in an art which has not nature for it is model the mind recoils with disdain at the idea of an exclusive system the greeks did not imagine that when they had invented a good thing the faculty was exhausted and incapable of producing another where should we have admired at this day the beauty of the ionic order if after the doric had been invented it had been considered as the ne plus ultra of art and every deviation from it is proportions reprobated as barbarous innovations vanburghs attempt therefore seems to have been an effort of genius and if we can keep the imagination apart from the five orders we must allow that he has created a magnificent whole which is invested with an air of grandeur seldom seen in a more regular style of building it is very defects except a few that are too glaring to be overlooked give it an appearance of something beyond common and as it is surrounded with great objects the eye is struck with the whole and takes the parts upon trust what made vanburgh ridiculous was his applying to small houses a style of architecture which could not possibly succeed but in a large one in a small house where the grandeur of a whole cannot be attempted the eye is at leisure to contemplate parts and meets with frequent occasion of disgust  this immense pile stands in the middle of an extensive park the situation is in general flat a lawn proportioned to the house spreads in front and at the distance of about half a mile meets an abrupt valley which winds across the park the sides of this valley are shagged with wellgrown wood at the bottom ran once a penurious stream over which directly opposite to the castle is thrown a magnificent bridge consisting of a single arch intended chiefly to make an easy communication between the two sides of the valley  about half a mile beyond this arch is reared a triumphal column which tho much criticized i own gives me no offense but rather seems to carry on the idea of grandeur the top is crowned with the statue of the duke of marlborough and the pedestal is inscribed  not indeed with the tersness of a roman altar  but with the less classical tho more honorable detail of an act of parliament granting the manor of woodstock to the duke for his eminent services  all this scenery before the castle is now newmodelled by the late ingenious mr brown who has given a specimen of his art in a nobler style than he has commonly displayed his works are generally pleasing but here they are great  about a mile below the house he has thrown across the valley a massy head which forms the rivulet into a noble lake divided by the bridge which now appears properly with all the grandeur of accompaniments into two very extensive pieces of water brown himself used to say that the thames would never forgive him what he had done at blenheim and every spectator must allow that on entering the great gate from woodstock the whole of this scenery the castle the lawn the woods and the lake seen together makes one of the grandest bursts which art perhaps ever displayed  the scenery below the bridge is the most beautiful part the water here takes the form of a bay running up into a wooded country and several light skiffs at anchor impress the idea the bay appears totally landlocked and the ground falls easily into it in every part  behind the house the improved grounds consist in mr browns usual style of a belt as it is called incircling a portion of the park in this part grandeur gives way to beauty except where the walk traverses the side of the bay here the great idea is still extended and the banks of the wye scarce exhibit more romantic scenes than are here displayed in the level plains of oxfordshire the walk carried us along the side of one woody precipice severed from another by an expanse of water which no english river could furnish  of this situation every advantage is taken which could add variety to grandeur in one part the opposite woody shore is seen alone spreading before the eye in a vast profusion of woody scenery in another part it appears accompanied with the lake and sometimes it is only received in catches through the woods of the foreground which are generally composed of lofty oak  in the midst of these great ideas the scene was not improved by several little patches of flowers and flowering shrubs artificially disposed and introduced which showed the hand of art to have been straying where the imagination would wish to be engrossed by the grand exhibition of simplicity and nature  where if art ever dared to tread twas with unsandald feet printless as if the place were holy ground but when we saw these scenes the work was new time has now probably blended all these littlenesses into an harmonious mixture with the grander parts the merest shrub may be a companion to the oak without offense the offense arises only from the artificial disposition  in the house our curiosity was chiefly confined to the pictures  those of reubens especially whose works are here in greater excellence and profusion than in any collection in england many days would be insufficient to examine them fully we had time only to mark their general effect  reubenss family by himself consisting of three figures as large as the life is a labored piece and yet full of spirit the composition coloring and harmony of the whole are excellent i should not scruple my suffrage in ranking this as the first familypicture in england the chaste simplicity of the cornaro family in northumberlandhouse by titian perhaps might be excepted i have examined with great attention the famous familypicture at wilton in that celebrated work the parts are fine some of them extraordinarily so but the whole is illmanaged here the eye is not engrossed by any particular but is filled and satisfied with the whole and yet may range with pleasure over the parts  the silenus also is a finished piece and a very noble effort of rubenss genius when let loose among ideal beings in which it delighted  the holyfamily seems either to be damaged or to have wanted reubenss last hand it is flat and possesses little of the masters fire except in the old womans head  the andromeda by rubens is a very fine figure  lot leaving sodom is a noble work also by the same master in the coloring of this picture there is a peculiar glow in composition it is less happy  sect iii from woodstock we proceeded to chapelhouse in our way to warwick  our first stage was barren of beauty lord shrewsburys on the right which appears to stand at the end of an extensive plantation and has much the air of a noblemans mansion continues long in view and is almost the only object that engages the eye but the uniformity of the woods at a distance is displeasing  from chapelhouse the road leads through a hilly unpleasant country the hills are neither clothed with wood nor varied with broken ground  but are mere heavy lumps of earth and the whole a barren prospect i mean barren only in a picturesque light for it affords good pasturage and is covered with herds of cattle and a beautiful breed of sheep with silken fleeces and without horns  and yet among these hills the valleys are sometimes pleasing long compton consisting of a number of thatched cottages winds pleasantly along the bottom of one of them and the situation of mr sheldons at westonpark seems agreeable  as we enter warwickshire near shipston upon stour the hills diminish into rising grounds and a bleak country changes into a woody one the soil changes also from a deep clay into a gravelly red loam sprinkled with beautiful pebbles the road leads generally through pleasant lanes leaving on the right the village of keinton and edgehill where the unfortunate charles first tried his success in arms  as we approach warwick the country becomes so flat that the towers of the castle make little appearance at a distance  warwick contains many beautiful objects the church is an elegant gothic structure a considerable part of it was lately burnt but it is rebuilt with great symmetry  connected with the church is a curious chapel decorated in the richest gothic taste it is the repository of many of the chiefs of the house of warwick among them lies under a splendid monument the celebrated dudley earl of leicester  the sessions house and the townhouse are both elegant buildings especially the former  the priory situated rather without the town is capable of being made a pleasing scene little of the old structure remains and what is left is converted into a dwelling house it stands more elevated than monastic buildings usually did the ground falling from it tho gently in almost every direction it is precincts contain about six or seven acres circumscribed by a skreen of lofty wood beyond this the towers of warwick castle and other objects are under command  we can only however admire the beauty of the objects and the little advantage that has been taken of them  but the great ornament of warwick is the castle this place celebrated once for it is strength and now for its beauty stands on a gentle rise in the midst of a country not absolutely flat the river avon washes the rock from which it is walls rise perpendicularly you see it is grand foundation to most advantage from the windows of the great hall from which you look down a considerable height upon the river  this noble castle having appeared in the different capacities first of a fortress and afterward of a countyjail was at last converted by it is proprietor the earl of warwick into a habitable mansion the old form is still preserved at least it may be every where traced and each addition is in symmetry with what is left  the old entrance is still in use a bridge is thrown over the ditch and leads into the inner area of the castle through a grand turrited gate this gate is placed in the middle of a curtain at the extremities of which stand two round towers known by the names of guys and caesars  on entering this venerable gate and surveying from it is inner arch the area or court of the castle which contains about an acre you see the groundplot and plan of the whole fortress  on the left is the habitable part in front rises a woody mount probably artificial where formerly stood the citadel part of which still remains the area itself is covered with turf and surrounded by a broad gravel walk as a coachring and the whole is encompassed by a wall adorned with the ruins of towers and other mural projections which being shattered in many places and covered with ivy catch little breaks of light and often make a picturesque appearance  the house is grand and convenient the rooms spacious and comfortable some of the offices particularly the kitchen are hewn out of the solid rock on which the castle is founded  the garden consists only of a few acres and is laid out by brown in a close walk which winds toward the river and somewhat awkwardly reverts into itself taking no notice except in one single point of the noble pile it invests  the armor and tilting spear of the celebrated guy earl of warwick a rib of the dun cow and other monuments of the prowess of that hero are shown at the porters lodge these remains tho fictitious no doubt are not improper appendages of the place and give the imagination a kind of tinge which throws an agreeable romantic color on all the vestiges of this venerable pile  from warwick we proposed to take a view of kenelworthcastle which lies between it and coventry the country is flat and woody  kenelworthcastle is one of the most magnificent piles of ruin in england in the days of it is prosperity we find it often taking a military part but in it is ruins we see little of a military air it is light and ornamental members in general mark it rather as a peaceful mansion  this castle is mentioned in history i believe as early as the reign of henry i it was then private property but it is owner taking an unsuccessful part in a civil war it fell into the hands of the crown in which it continued till the time of elizabeth who gave it to her favorite the earl of leicester this nobleman profuse and magnificent to the last degree is said to have expended sixty thousand pounds on this single pile a sum enormous in those days here he resided almost in regal state  after the civil wars of charles the first the pride of this noble mansion was humbled it is owner was a favourer of the royal cause and cromwell in revenge tore it in pieces and set every thing to auction that could be severed from the walls these rapacious hands left it in a state from which it never recovered yet even still it is a splendid ruin  from it is situation it borrows little the eminence it stands on is too gentle to command an extensive view and the country in it is neighborhood is too barren of objects to furnish a rich one  the plan of the castle is very magnificent the area or walledcourt consists of seven acres one third of which is occupied by the ruin but of all this superb pile nothing remains entire the form of no chamber can well be traced except perhaps that of the great banquetinghall which made a principal part of that range of building which formed the center of the pile among other fragments stand the ruins of two massy square dissimilar towers known by the names of caesars and leicesters these seem to have resisted the shocks of time longer than any of the other parts but they have at length given way one side of leicesters tower having fallen in has laid open the whole internal structure  yet magnificent as these ruins are they are not picturesque neither the towers nor any other part nor the whole together unless well aided by perspective and the introduction of trees to hide disgusting parts would furnish a good picture tho the variety of shattered staircases fractured segments of vaulted roofs and pieces of ornamented windows afford excellent studies for a painter  this grand mass of ruin is now making hasty strides to a total dissolution another century will probably bring it all to the ground  unless it is noble owner lord hyde reach out a hand to save it the stone of which it is constructed is brown beautiful to the eye but of a friable nature the touch of time crumbling it imperceptibly away  in solemn silence sheds the venerable ruin to the dust yet not always in solemn silence about seven years ago a large fragment of leicesters tower fell down at midnight and alarmed the neighborhood far and wide with it is noise and last winter an abutment of the banqueting hall fell in and crushed a number of farming utensils which were deposited under it  such is the present state of a structure which two hundred years ago was second to none in england every room says an old author describing it on the spot was spacious and highroofed within and every part seemly to the sight by due proportion without in the daytime on every side glittering with glass at night transparent by continual brightness of candle fire and torch light  but now in ossians plaintive language it is walls are desolate the gray moss whitens the stone the fox looks out from the window and rank grass waves round it is head  when we saw these ruins the area which produces a rich verdure was grazed by a herd of cattle these were a great addition to the scene and reminded us of some of berghems best pictures in which cattle and ruins adorn each other  the ground on the outside of the castle was formerly floated tho it is now entirely drained the lake spread round the southern western and northern sides extending on the whole through the space of two miles beyond it lay the park on the north side was the garden hanging on the bank between the castlewall and the water it contained only an acre and was joined to the park by a bridge the left arm of the pool northward says the author i have just quoted has my lord adorned with a beautiful bracelet of a fairtimbered bridge fourteen feet wide and six hundred feet long railed on both sides and strongly planted  the garden was laid out as we may easily suppose according to the taste of that day terrace above terrace in every mode of expensive deformity but the lake seems to have had some elegance indeed water sweeping round in the shape in which this is described must be beautiful in some degree it is surface could not like land be injured by art the extremities of it would be generally hid and it would be continually unfolding itself round the magnificent object which it encompassed tho it is probable it is banks were as trim and neat as the spade and the line could make them  one of the most memorable particulars of the history of this castle is an entertainment which was given here by the earl of leicester to queen elizabeth the tradition of this grand festivity still lives in the country and we have hardly any thing equal to it on record an account of it was published by one langham a person then in office about the court and present at the time i have already quoted from this work and shall add a part of the account he gives of her majestys reception from which an idea may be conceived of the gallantry of the whole entertainment  on the  th of july      in the evening the queen approaching the first gate of the castle the porter a man tall of person and stern of countenance with a club and keys accosted her majesty in a rough speech full of passion in meter aptly made for the purpose and demanded the cause of all this din and noise and riding about within the charge of his office but upon seeing the queen as if he had been struck instantaneously and pierced at the presence of a personage so evidently expressing heroical sovereignty he falls down on his knees humbly prays pardon for his ignorance yields up his club and keys and proclaims open gates and free passage to all  immediately the trumpeters who stood on the wall being six in number each an eight foot high with their silvery trumpets of a five foot long sounded up a tune of welcome  these armonious blasters maintained their delectable music while the queen rode through the tiltyard to the grand entrance of the castle which was washed by the lake  here as she passed a moveable island approached in which sat inthroned the lady of the lake who accosted her majesty in well penned meter with an account of the antiquity of the castle and of her own sovereignty over those waters since the days of king arthur but that hearing her majesty was passing that way she came in humble wise to offer up the same and all her power into her majestys hands  this pageant was closed with a delectable harmony of hautbois shalms cornets and such other loud music which held on while her majesty pleasantly so passed into the castlegate  here she was presented with a new scene several of the heathen gods had brought their gifts before her which were piled up or hung in elegant order on both sides of the entrance wildfowl and dead game from sylvanus god of the woods baskets of fruit from pomona sheaves of various kinds of corn from ceres a pyramid adorned with clusters of grapes gracified with their vineleaves from bacchus and ornamented at the bottom with elegant vases and goblets fish of all sorts disposed in baskets were presented by neptune arms by mars and musical instruments by apollo an inscription over the gate explained the whole  her majesty having graciously accepted these gifts was received into the gates with a concert of flutes and other soft music and alighting from her palfrey which she always rode single she was conveyed into her chamber and her arrival was announced through the country by a peal of cannon from the ramparts and a display of fireworks at night  here the queen was entertained nineteen days and it is recorded that the entertainment cost the earl a thousand pounds a day each of which was diversified with masks interludes hunting music and a variety of other amusements the queens genius seems to have been greatly consulted in the pomp and solemnity of the whole perhaps too it was consulted when the classical purity of these amusements relaxed and gave way as we find it sometimes did to boxing bearbaiting and the buffoonery of the times  among other compliments paid to the queen in this gallant festival the great clock which was fixed in caesars tower was stopped during her majestys continuance in the castle that while the country enjoyed that great blessing time might stand still  sect iv from kenelworthcastle we proceeded to coventry the intervening country is flat  the tower of coventry church is a beautiful object but constructed of the same kind of mouldering stone which we took notice of in the ruins of kenelworth and which indeed is better adapted to a decayed than to a complete pile the ornamental parts of this tower are just in that state which one would wish in a ruin they possess a sort of rich mutilation every part is in some degree defaced and yet the whole so perfect as to leave room for the imagination to put all together in a ruin this is enough but where the parts are entire we require the ornaments to be so too  as we leave coventry we find a red gravelly clay covering a brown rock which bursting here and there from the soil often makes a picturesque foreground the lanes are close and the country woody  between coventry and birmingham lies lord aylsfords an ancient seat but now under the hands of improvement the house is rebuilding and the grounds are taking a new form under the taste of mr brown who seems to be doing all that a situation with but few advantages will allow the house stands in the midst of a scene rather flat a rill running near it is changed into a river an elegant approach is conducted over it by a handsome bridge and a belt winding about two miles is the circumference of the pleasure ground but the country affords few objects to enrich either a foreground or a distance  the rest of the road to birmingham leads at first through an open country which afterward becomes woody and close and more pleasant as we approach the town  the buildings which you see scattered about the landscape near birmingham are in great profusion and generally of a reddish hue for the country is populous and the houses are built of a kind of brick which has a peculiar red cast  this tint predominating in a country as it does here is very unpleasing  near birmingham we went to see boltons hardware manufactory it is a town under a single roof containing about seven hundred work people but notwithstanding it is a scene of industry utility and ingenuity it is difficult to keep the eye in humor among so many frivolous arts and check it is looking with contempt on an hundred men employed in making a snuff box  from birmingham we left the great road and passed through a pleasant country to the leasowes and hagley which lie within a few miles of each other in our way we had a sweet ride through an oakwood at smithwick  few places had raised our expectations more than the leasowes so great a lover of nature as mr shenstone appears to be in his writings could not possibly one would imagine deviate from her in any of the operations of his genius i shall give the reader a slight sketch of the scene and then make a few general observations  we entered the grounds which contain about an hundred acres by a wicket near the bottom of a lane which leads to the house we should have been carried first into the higher parts where we might have had a view of the whole at once we should then have seen that it is what is properly called an adorned farm and should have taken that idea along with us the fields lie about the house and a walk leads you round them  we entered however below the house and were carried first into a narrow woody valley from which emerging we had a pleasant opening into the country about halesowen  from this view we dip into a woody bottom where we find melibeuss seat a sequestered spot proper for the noontide retreat of a shepherd and his flock  from hence we penetrate another wood and come suddenly on a long succession of waterfalls fourteen of them seen through an irregular vista of trees the scenery is whimsical but amusing  having thus traversed the lower grounds the path leads into the higher and we begin now to discover that it is carrying us round the whole here we have distant views bounded by the wrekin in shropshire  from these grounds the path makes a sudden dip to a sequestered vale where mr shenstone has dedicated an urn to the memory of a beloved lady from hence it rises again in a troublesome zigzag into the lovers walk which terminates oddly enough in the temple of pan with more propriety it might have led to the temple of hymen  from hence we descend again through hanging fields quite unadorned to the most finished scene of the whole it is a grove ornamented at the upper end by a cascade from which the stream plays in irregular meanders among the trees and passing under a romantic bridge forms itself into a small lake this whimsical spot is dedicated i think with some impropriety to virgils genius and is one of those ambiguous passages which we are at a loss whether to blame or to commend from hence we pass again into the lane where we at first entered  tho mr shenstone has on the whole shown great taste and elegance and has diversified his views very much and been particularly happy in that most agreeable mode of design affixing some peculiar character to each scene yet in some things he has perhaps done too much and in others not enough  in the use of water he has been too profuse he collects it only from a few springs which ouze from his swampy grounds it was a force therefore on nature to attempt either a river or a lake a cascade or a purling rill should have satisfied his ambition besides like the water of all swamps the water of the leasowes wants brilliancy frothed by a fall or quick descent the impurities of it are less observed in gentle motion they are striking but in a lake they are offensive it was ridiculous to see naiads invited by inscriptions to bath their beauteous limbs in crystal pools which stood before the eye impregnated with all the filth which generates from stagnation  he has done too much also in adorning his grounds so profusely with urns statues and buildings which are commonly the most expensive and the least beautiful parts of improvement in the adorned farm at least they are improper decorations  with his inscriptions in which many people say he has done too much also i own i was pleased when inscriptions are wellwritten and properly adapted as these generally are they raise some leading thought and impress the character of the scene in stronger ideas than our own  in other things mr shenstone has perhaps done too little  he might have thrown down more of his hedges or if that had been inconvenient he might at least have concealed his enclosures more in plantations his path on the higher grounds is in general too open and his foregrounds are often regular fields this regularity might have been disguised the distances too would have appeared to more advantage if they had been seen sometimes over a wood and sometimes through an opening in one or occasionally through interstices among the boles of the trees  but mr shenstones great deficiency lay in not draining and cleaning his grounds if he had made his verdure richer tho at the expense of his buildings he had shown a purer taste but shenstone was poor and with a little of that vanity which often attends poverty he chose rather to lay out his money on what made the most show than on what would have been most becoming from what he has done however it is easy to conceive what he could have done if he had had a country suited to his ideas and a fortune sufficient to adorn it  i cannot leave these scenes without remarking the peculiar beauty of his rocks and cascades  of all manufacturers those of rocks are commonly the most bungling how often are we carried in the improvements even of people of taste to see a piece of rockscenery consisting perhaps of half a dozen large stones they neither give us any idea of what they are intended to represent nor are they probably suited to the country in which they are introduced in our attempts to improve if we do more than just adorn what nature has done by planting and giving a little play to the ground we err to aim at changing the character of a country is absurd where nature discourages it is vain to attempt she  scorns control she will not bear one beauty foreign to the spot or soil she gives thee to adorn it is thine alone to mend not change her features  mr shenstone however has succeeded the best in his rock scenery because he has done the least he pretends only just to fret his streams and break his cascades and it would be invidious not to own that his cascades rocks and streams are all as exact copies of nature as we any where find  on leaving mr shenstones a very few miles brought us to hagley the evening was fine and we saw it in all it is glory yet we left it disappointed the plan of hagley if there be any is so confused that it is impossible to describe it there is no coherency of parts one scene is tacked to another and any one might be removed without the least injury to the rest  a work of art be it what it may house picture book or garden however beautiful in it is underparts loses half it is value if the general scope of it be not obvious to conception even the wild scene of nature however pleasing in itself is still more pleasing if the eye is able to combine it into a whole  but obscurity in the general plan is not the only objection we made to hagley it is formal in many of it is parts the view at the entrance is particularly unpleasing consisting of a lawn rising from the house closed at the upper end with a regular semicircle of wood and adorned in the middle by an obelisk  many of these scenes also are minute and trifling the perspective view at the palladian bridge and the reverse from the rotunda are below criticism such also is the stream conveyed in a channel little wider than a drill through the extent of a noble lawn some pains too have been taken to make it gurgle as it runs mr shenstone wrought in miniature and tho he rarely trifles diminutive beauties were in part accommodated to his scheme but lord lyttelton wrought on a larger scale his ideas should have enlarged with it his pencil should have scorned the little touches of trifling exactness and he should have considered that his piece both consisted of nobler objects and was to be seen at a greater distance  added to these defects there is a want also of variety the sides of the hills are all planted and the valleys are all lawns through a succession of these recesses you are carried from one lawn you enter another with little variation of the idea the same thought is repeated over and over  cingentibus ultima sylvis purus ab aboribus spectabilis undique campus   it would however be invidious not to confess that some of these lawns considered as independent parts are very beautiful  thompsons seat exhibits a noble display of scenery you look across a spacious valley of a mile in extent the whole a pasture winding at both ends from the eye the opposite bank which conducts the sweep is hung with wood at one end of the valley is a distant view into the country terminated by the malvern hills at the other the woody bank is adorned by a modern ruin which stands well but is an object too minute for the scene one large round tower with an underpart or two would have had a better effect at a distance than such a quantity of wall and other trifling parts which have been contrived to answer some purpose of utility whereas the only character such a ruin has to support is that of being the distant ornament of a scene with which it is utility if it have any should coincide if it does not answer this end the cowhouse or the keepers lodge or whatever it is should occupy some less distinguished station here it only shows us that there should have been something which we do not find  on the whole tho there are certainly many very beautiful views in these extensive gardens yet we may easily conceive the same variety of ground the same profusion of wood and the same advantages of water tho in this point the deficiency is greatest might have been so combined as to produce a much nobler whole  it may be added however that only the common round of the garden has been here criticized the rides in the park are very extensive and as they are less dressed they may perhaps be more beautiful the temple of theseus stands very happily is a handsome object and has as grand an effect as any thing of the kind can have  the house is a good modern pile but wants a dignity of situation suitable to the capital of such extensive dominions  sect v from lord lytteltons we proposed to visit mr ansons near wolsleybridge our rout led through stourbridge wolverhampton and penkridge the country is rich and woody but affords little that is picturesque in many parts it is much disfigured by a new canal which cuts it in pieces  one of the most beautiful objects in nature is a noble river winding through a country and discovering it is mazy course sometimes halfconcealed by it is woody banks and sometimes displaying it is ample folds through the open vale  it is opposite in every respect is one of these cuts as they are called it is lineal and angular course  it is relinquishing the declivities of the country and passing over hill and dale sometimes banked up on one side and sometimes on both  it is sharp parrallel edges naked and unadorned  all contribute to place it in the strongest contrast with the river an object may be disgusting in itself but it is still more so when it reminds you by some distant resemblance of something beautiful  at penkridge we left the great road and deviated to the right over a wild heath to shuckborough the seat of mr anson  mr ansons improvements are nobly conceived making their object the whole face of a country it is a pity so generous a design had not been directed by a better taste his buildings are all on grecian and roman models and some of them very beautiful but they want accompaniments there is something rather absurd in adorning a plain field with a triumphal arch or with the lanthern of demosthenes restored to all it is splendour a polished jewel set in lead is ridiculous but above all the temple of the winds seated in a pool instead of being placed on a hill is illstationed as it is some time however since we saw the scenes of shuckborough they may now be greatly altered and improved the temple of the winds i fear must ever stand as it does  the house contains little worth notice it is furnished in a frippery sort of chinese manner there are few pictures of value the hall is adorned with the naval achievements of lord anson by scot in which the genius of the painter has been regulated by the articles of war the line of battle is a miserable arrangement on canvas and it is an act of inhumanity in an admiral to injoin it if the line of battle must be introduced it should be formed at a distance and the stress laid on some of the ships at one end of the line brought into action near the eye  the drawing room is hung with large ruins in distemper by dahl they are touched with spirit but the composition wants simplicity there is a rawness also and want of force in distemper tho it certainly gives a more pleasing surface for the eye to rest on than oilpainting which cannot be divested of the delusive lights of varnish  the windows of the room in which these pictures hang look toward a pile of artificial ruins in the park but mr anson has been less happy in fabricating fictitious ruins than in restoring such as are real  if a ruin be intended to take a station merely in some distant inaccessible place one or two points of view are all that need be provided for the construction therefore of such a ruin is a matter of less nicety it is a ruin in a picture  but if it be presented on a spot as this is where the spectator may walk round it and survey it on every side  perhaps enter it  the construction of it becomes then a matter of great difficulty  this difficulty arises first from the necessity of constructing it on as regular and uniform a plan as if it had been a real edifice not only the situation and general form of the castle or the abbey should be observed but the several parts should at least be so traced out that an eye skilled in such edifices may easily investigate the parts which are lost from the parts which remain there should always be the disjecta membra so that in constructing a ruin no part should be presented which the eye does not easily conceive must necessarily have been there if the whole had been complete  nor is the expense which attends the construction of such a ruin a trifling difficulty the picturesque ruin must have no vulgarity of shape it must convey the idea of grandeur and no ruins that i know except those of a castle or an abbey are suited to this purpose and both these are works of great expense  but you say a part only need be introduced it is true but if your scene be ample and you would introduce it in no other the part you introduce must be ample also a paltry ruin is of no value a grand one is a work of magnificence a gardentemple or a palladian bridge may easily be effected but such a portion of ruin as will give any idea of a castle or an abbey that is worth displaying requires an expense equal to that of the mansion you inhabit  there is great art and difficulty also in executing a building of this kind it is not every man who can build a house that can execute a ruin to give the stone it is mouldering appearance  to make the widening chink run naturally through all the joints  to mutilate the ornaments  to peel the facing from the internal structure  to show how correspondent parts have once united tho now the chasm runs wide between them  and to scatter heaps of ruin around with negligence and ease are great efforts of art much too delicate for the hand of a common workman and what we very rarely see performed  besides after all that art can bestow you must put your ruin at last into the hands of nature to adorn and perfect it if the mosses and lychens grow unkindly on your walls  if the streaming weatherstains have produced no variety of tints  if the ivy refuses to mantle over your buttress or to creep among the ornaments of your gothic window  if the ash cannot be brought to hang from the cleft or long spiry grass to wave over the shattered battlement  your ruin will be still incomplete  you may as well write over the gate built in the year      deception there can be none the characters of age are wanting it is time alone which meliorates the ruin which gives it perfect beauty and brings it if i may so speak to a state of nature  on laying all these difficulties together we see how arduous a matter it is to construct such a ruin as is to be seen on the spot when it is well done we allow that nothing can be more beautiful but we see every where so many absurd attempts of this kind that when we walk through a piece of improved ground and hear of being carried next to see the ruins if the master of the scene be with us we dread the encounter  from mr ansons we continued our rout to stone by wolsleybridge through the same kind of rich pleasant country and from thence in our way to newcastle we proposed to take a view of lord gowers but a shower of rain prevented us as far however as we could judge from a hasty glance the grounds about trentham are laid out with great simplicity and elegance the situation of the house is low before it lies an extensive lawn halfincircled with rising grounds along which the plantations sweep in one great varied line  from newcastle we took our rout to manchester in our road we wished for time to have visited the potteries of mr wedgwood where the elegant arts of old etruria are revived it would have been pleasing to see all these works in their progress to perfection but it was of less moment as the forms of all his tuscan vases were familiar to us  one great principle in the construction of a tuscan vase relates to the mode of setting on the handle it always rises from the vessel with which it is united and of which it makes a part the strength and beauty of the vessel depends so much on this principle that one would wonder how it should ever be overlooked and indeed i have sometimes observed it in the construction of some of our coarser jars for the sake probably of the strength which it adds to the handle but in general it is totally neglected and the handles of our modern vessels whether of clay or of metal tho some of them very costly instead of making a part of the vessels themselves are awkwardly fixed to them  at talkonthehill the views are extensive and beautiful on both sides the ground is well disposed and the landscape woody  as we descended the knolls and little depressions of the country which seen from the higher grounds were flat and undistinguished became now hills and valleys adding new modes of variety  we soon however left all this landscape behind and entered an unpleasant country but after we had passed holmschapel and a dreary common beyond it a beautiful scene opened in which we continued many miles the road often led through groves of oak and often through lanes imbowered with lofty trees which were beautiful in their natural simplicity beyond the improvement of art  the duke of bridgewaters works near manchester are very great we admire equally the grandeur of the conception and the skill of the execution in a painters eye indeed we have just seen that works of this kind are of little value  from worsleymills we took a barge to manchester but found little amusement in our voyage except that of exchanging a rough jolting motion over rugged pavements with that of gliding gently along the surface of a smooth canal  we were struck with one appearance indeed of a singular kind that of chapmoss which stretching on the right along the space of thirty miles held the eye in suspense through the shades of twilight whether it were land or water it is color spoke it one it is surface the other  from manchester around which the country is not unpleasant we pursued our rout to preston and lancaster great part of the road to bolton is beautiful the views about ringley where a considerable stream forces it is way between steep woody banks are very picturesque they were the more pleasing as we came upon them by accident having been obliged to leave the great road which some late floods had made impassable by carrying away a bridge  from bolton we ascended a height of four miles over a sort of cultivated mountain the country that lay stretched beneath on the left was softened without any intervening grounds into a blue distance when we descended the heights and entered it it wore a pleasing variegated form it was woody too and adorned with little rills every where working along the valleys  between charly and preston there is likewise much high ground which let us down like the heights of bolton into a pleasant scene rich flat and woody  as we approached preston the retrospect of waltonchurch over the windings of the ribble is very beautiful  from preston to garstang the country is unpleasant the ground is varied but it is deficient in wood and has not dignity to support itself without it  here first the mountains begin to rise and give us a prospect of the country before us but they yet assume no formidable features tinged with light azure they only skirted the horizon and at a great distance accompanied us in a lengthened chain on the left  as we approach garstang the castle tho ruined into a mere block and without beauty becomes an object where there is no other  from garstang to lancaster there is little change in the landscape it still continues bleak and unpleasant but as we now approached the mountains every object began to proclaim the rugged scenes into which we were entering the country we now traversed may be called a kind of connecting thread itself of an uncharacterized species striking us with no determined features it has neither the grandeur of the mountain scene nor the cheerfulness of the sylvan what wood there is is poor and shrivelled for we now skirted the bay of cartmel and the seaair having caught the trees had impoverished their foliage stinted their growth and destroyed their very form with unusual rigor  at a miles distance lancastercastle rises to view it is lofty situation it is massy towers and extensive buildings for it is connected with the church give an air of grandeur to it is appearance but as the parts are neither well shaped nor well combined it is but an indifferent object from any point on the spot the most beautiful part is a noble front which with it is other grand appendages afford sufficient matter for the curiosity of an antiquarian  on the other side of the town the river lune which is a noble piece of water when the tide is full sufficiently adorns the landscape  but here the lune is a busy noisy scene banked with quays covered with shipping and resounding with nautic clamor far otherwise is it is passage a few miles above through the vale of londsdale where quietly and unobserved it winds around projecting rocks  forms circling boundaries to meadows pastured with cattle  or passes through groves and thickets which in fabulous times might have been the haunt of woodgods in one part taking a sudden turn it circles a little delicious spot forming it into a peninsula called vulgarly the wheel of lune here once dwelt an ancient hermit where his eyes saw nothing nor wished to see any thing except the sweet vale in which he lived  from the castlehill or rather from the churchyard we had a very extensive view composed of the grandest objects along the meadows below the river lune now an estuary and adorned with a variety of coasting vessels lessening to the eye through it is several reaches hastens to the sea in a mile or two it enters the bay of cartmel which filled with the tide presents a noble extent of water ten or twelve miles across bounded by the mountains of furness which extend through vast space and then circling the head of the bay form many a shooting promontory and many a winding shore  this extension of wild country we looked at with regret knowing the many noble scenes it contained which we had not time to visit we were obliged to rest satisfied with forming imaginary pictures among the blue mists of the mountains our guide an unlettered swain pointed out in the broad dialect of his country the several spots  where the ruins of furnessabbey lay sequestered in a lowly vale  where far to the west peelcastle running boldly out into the water commanded the entrance of the bay  where deep beneath those purplish mountains the lake of coniston occupied a valley six miles in length  where holkerhall and bardsey and conished founded on the site of an ancient priory and many other places of renowned situation were all surrounded with scenes of grandeur and each as far as we could judge from our intelligence with scenes peculiar to itself  from lancaster in our rout to kendal the country every step becomes more characteristic high shelving grounds arise on the right and on the left at every opening we have different views of the bay of cartmel and of the mountains of furness the foreground is every where adorned with large detached stones which indicate the rocks we approach  a little beyond burton we left the great road and took a circuit of two or three miles to see the country about milthorp and levens  cartmelbay branches here into a creek on the eastern side of which lies milthorp a little coastingporttown and near it dalhamtower in a pleasant park defended by a hill from the seaair all around we have beautiful views consisting of woody foregrounds and of distances composed of different parts of this little estuary and it is appendant mountains  as we proceeded higher up the creek the views increased in beauty about levens a seat of the earl of suffolk there is a happy combination of every thing that is lovely and great in landscape it stands at the head of the creek upon the kenet a wild romantic stream which rushes into the tide a little below the house encompassed with hilly grounds is well screened from the pernicious effects of the seaair but we did not ride up to it the woods with which it abounds we were told grow luxuriantly and the views at hand are as pleasing as those at a distance are great which consist of a lengthened beach of sand along the creek and of whitbarrowcragg a rough and very picturesque promontory with other high lands shooting into the bay  among the beautiful objects of distance we consider a winding sandbeach especially when seen from a woody foreground it is hue amid the verdure of foliage is a pleasant chastising tint when the tide flows the sands change their appearance and take the still more pleasing form of a noble lake  levens is at present in a neglected state but is certainly capable of being made equal to almost any scene in england  from hence we proceeded to kendal situated in a wild unpleasant country which contains no striking objects and cannot be formed into any of those pleasing combinations which constitute a picture here and there a view may be found though but seldom the castle which is a mere ruin is in some situations especially near the bridge a good object  between kendal and ambleside the wood increases in grandeur but the scenery is still undetermined the whole is a sort of confused greatness  as we descend to the left we approach windermere where a different species of country succeeds the wild mountains which were so illmassed and of a kind so unaccommodating to landscape are left behind and the road dips into a lovely sylvan scene leading interchangeably through close groves under wooded hills and along the banks of the lake  sect vi we had now arrived on the confines of those romantic scenes which were the principal inducement to this tour here therefore we proposed to make some pause and pay a little more attention to the country than a hasty passage through it would allow  but to render a description of these scenes more intelligible and to show more distinctly the sources of that kind of beauty with which they abound it may be proper before we examine the scenes themselves to take a sort of analytical view of the materials which compose them  mountains  lakes  broken grounds  wood  rocks  cascades  valleys  and rivers  with regard to mountains it may be first premised that in a picturesque view we consider them only as distant objects their enormous size disqualifying them for objects at hand in the removed part of a picture therefore the mountain properly appears where it is immensity reduced by distance can be taken in by the eye and it is monstrous features losing their deformity assume a softness which naturally belongs not to them  i would not however be understood to mean that a mountain is proper only to close an extended view it may take it is station in a second or third distance with equal propriety and even on a foreground a rugged corner of it is base may be introduced tho it is upper regions aspire far beyond the limits of any picture  having thus premised the station which a mountain properly occupies in landscape we shall now examine the mountain itself in which four things particularly strike us  it is line  the objects which adorn it is surface  it is tints  and it is light and shade  the beauty of a distant mountain in a great measure depends on the line it traces along the sky which is generally of a lighter hue the pyramidal shape and easy flow of an irregular line will be found in the mountain as in other delineations the truest source of beauty  mountains therefore rising in regular mathematical lines or in whimsical grotesque shapes are displeasing thus burnswark a mountain on the southern border of scotland thorpcloud near dovedale in derbyshire especially when seen from the garden at ilam and a mountain in cumberland which from it is peculiar appearance in some situations takes the name of saddleback all form disagreeable lines and thus many of the pointed summits of the alps are objects rather of singularity than of beauty such forms also as suggest the idea of lumpish heaviness are disgusting  round swelling forms without any break to disincumber them of their weight  indeed a continuity of line without a break whether it be concave straight or unequal will always displease because it wants variety unless indeed it be well contrasted with other forms the effect also of a broken line is bad if the breaks are regular  the sources of deformity in the mountainline will easily suggest those of beauty if the line swell easily to an apex and yet by irregular breaks which may be varied in a thousand modes it must be pleasing  and yet abruptness itself is sometimes a source of beauty either when it is in contrast with other parts of the line or when rocks or other objects account naturally for it  the same principles on which we seek for beauty in single mountains will help us to find it in a combination of them mountains in composition are considered as single objects and follow the same rules if they break into mathematical or fantastic forms  if they join heavily together in lumpish shapes  if they fall into each other at rightangles  or if their lines run parrallel  in all these cases the combination will be more or less disgusting and a converse of these will of course be agreeable  having drawn the lines which mountains should form let us next fill them up and vary them with tints  the objects which cover the surface of mountains are wood rocks broken ground heath and mosses of various hues  ovid has very ingeniously given us the furniture of a mountain in the transformation of atlas  jam barba comaeque in sylvas abeunt juga sunt humerique manusque quod caput ante fuit summo est in monte cacumen ossa lapis fiunt  his hair and beard become trees and other vegetable substance his bones rocks and his head and shoulders summits and promontories  but to describe minutely the parts of a distant object for we are considering a mountain in this light would be to invert the rules of perspective by making that distinct which should be obscure i shall consider therefore all that variety which covers the surface of distant mountains as blended together in one mass and made the stratum of those tints which we often find playing upon them  these tints which are the most beautiful ornaments of the mountain are of all colors but the most prevalent are yellow and purple we can hardly consider blue as a mountaintint it is the mere color of the intervening air  the hue which naturally invests all distant objects as well as mountains the late dr brown author of the estimate in a description which he printed of the lake of keswick very justly calls these tints the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains they are rarely permanent but seem to be a sort of floating silky colors  always in motion  always in harmony  and playing with a thousand changeable varieties into each other they are literally colors dipped in heaven  the variety of these tints depends on many circumstances  the season of the year  the hour of the day  a dry or a moist atmosphere the lines and shapes of mountains features strongly marked are easily caught and retained but these meteorforms this rich fluctuation of airy hues offer such a profusion of variegated splendour that they are continually illuding the eye with breaking into each other and are lost as it endeavors to retain them this airy coloring tho in sunshine it appears most brilliant yet in some degree it is generally found in those mountains where it prevails  in the late voyages round the world published by dr hawksworth we have an account of the great beauty of the coloring observed on the peak of teneriffe it is appearance at sunset says the author was very striking when the sun was below the horizon and the rest of the island appeared of a deep black the mountain still reflected his rays and glowed with a warmth of coloring which no painting can express  the rays of the sun which are the cause of all color no doubt produce these tints to the eye yet we must believe there is something peculiar in the surfaces of some mountains which dispose them to reflect the rays with such variety of tints on many mountains these appearances are not observable and where the surface is uniform the tint will be so likewise the effect in question says mr lock remarking on this passage is very familiar to me i saw it almost every evening in savoy when the sun shone it is only on the tops of the highest mountains that the effect is perfect mount blanc being covered with the purest snow and having no tint of it is own was often of the brightest rosecolour  having thus given the mountain a line filled it with objects and spread over it a beautiful assemblage of tints it remains lastly to throw the whole into light and shade  he who would study light and shade must repair to the mountains there he will see their most magnificent effects  in every object we observe a double effect of illumination that of the parts and that of the whole in a building the cornices the pilasters and other ornaments are set off in the language of art with light and shade over this partial effect are spread the general masses it is thus in mountains  homer who had a genius as picturesque as virgil tho he seems to have known little of the art of painting was struck with two things in his views of mountains  with those cavities and projections which abound upon their surfaces  and with what he calls their shadowing forms of the former he takes notice when he speaks of a single mountain of the latter when he speaks of mountains in combination under the first idea he speaks of mount olympus which he calls  or many vallied il        now it is plain that in both these cases he was pleased with the effect of light and shade in one the partial effect is marked in the other the general  the cavities which he observed and which are seen only from their being the deep recesses of shade together with the rocks and little projections which are visible only from catching a stronger ray of light contribute to produce the partial effect  that richness and variety on the sides of distant mountains which would otherwise be a display of flat fatiguing surface the objects themselves are formless and indistinct yet by presenting different surfaces for the light to rest on the rich and variegated effect here mentioned is produced  the grand masses are formed by one mountains overshadowing another  by the suns turning round some promontory  or by the transverse position of mountains in all which cases the shadow falls broad and deep  sweeps over all the smaller shades to which it still under the second he speaks of that chain of mountains which separate phthia from the southern parts of greece     many shadowing mountains intervene il       gives a deeper tinge and unites the whole in one great effect  it is an agreeable amusement to attend these vast shadows in their slow and solemn march over the mountains  to observe how the morning sun sheds only a faint catching light upon the summits of the hills through one general mass of hazy shade  in a few hours how all this confusion is dissipated  how the lights and shades begin to break and separate and take their form and breadth  how deep and determined the shadows are at noon  how fugitive and uncertain as the sun declines till it is fires glowing in the west light up a new radiance through the landscape and spread over it instead of sober light and shade all the colors of nature in one bright momentary gleam  it is equally amusing to observe the various shapes which mountains assume through all this variety of illumination rocks knolls and promontories taking new forms appearing and disappearing as the sun veers round whose radiance like varnish on a picture if i may use a degrading comparison brings out a thousand objects unobserved before  to these more permanent effects of illumination may be added another species which arises from accident  i mean those partial flitting shades which are occasioned by floating clouds these may sometimes produce a good effect but they contribute as often to disturb the repose of a landscape to painters however they are of great use who are frequently obliged by an untoward subject to take the advantage of every probability to produce an effect  sect vii having thus considered the chief circumstances which occur in distant mountains let us now enlarge our view and take in the lake which makes the next considerable part of this romantic country  the fen the pool and the lake would present very different ideas tho magnitude were out of the question  the fen is a plashy inundation formed on a flat  without depth  without lineal boundary  of ambiguous texture  half water  and half land  a sort of vegetable fluid  the pool is a collection of the soakings of some common or the reservoir of the neighboring ditches which deposit in it is ouzy bed the soil of the country clay or mud and give a correspondent tinge to the water  in some things the fen and the pool agree they both take every thing in and let nothing out each of them is in summer a sink of putrefaction and the receptacle of all those unclean misshapen forms in animal life which breed and batten in the impurities of stagnation where putrefaction into life ferments and breathes destructive myriads   very different is the origin of the lake it is magnificent and marble bed formed in the caverns and deep recesses of rocky mountains received originally the pure pellucid waters of some rushing torrent as it came first from the hand of nature  arrested it is course till the spacious and splendid basin was filled brimfull and then discharged the stream unsullied and undiminished through some winding vale to form other lakes or increase the dignity of some imperial river here no impurities find entrance either of animal or of vegetable life  non illic canna palustris nec steriles ulvae naec acuta cuspide junci     from the brisk circulation of fluid through these animated bodies of water a great master of nature has nobly styled them living lakes  speluncae vivique lacus  and indeed nothing which is not really alive deserves the appellation better for besides the vital stream which principally feeds them they receive a thousand little gurgling rills which trickling through a thousand veins give life and spirit to every part  the principal incidents observable in lakes are their line of boundary  their islands  and the different appearances of the surface of the water  the line of boundary is very various sometimes it is boldly broken by a projecting promontory  sometimes indebted by a creek  sometimes it undulates along an irregular shore  and sometimes swells into a winding bay in each of these circumstances it is susceptible of beauty in all it certainly deserves attention for as it is a line of separation between land and water it is of course so conspicuous a boundary that the least harshness in it is discernible i have known many a good landscape injured by a bad water boundary  this line it may be further observed varies under different circumstances when the eye is placed upon the lake the line of boundary is a circular thread with little undulation unless when some promontory of more than usual magnitude shoots into the water all smaller irregularities are lost the particular beauty of it under this circumstance consists in the opposition between such a thread and the irregular line formed by the summits of the mountains  but when the eye is placed on the higher grounds above the level of the lake the line of boundary takes a new form and what appeared to the levelled eye a circular thread becomes now an undulating line projecting and retiring more or less according to the degree of the eyes elevation the circular thread was indebted for it is principal beauty to contrast but this like all other elegant lines has the additional beauty of variety  and yet in some cases the levelled eye has the advantage of the elevated one the line which forms an acute angle from the higher situation may be softened when seen from the water into an easy curve  the islands fall next under our view these are either a beauty or a deformity to the lake as they are shaped or stationed  if the island be round or of any other regular form or if the wood upon it be thick and heavy as i have observed some planted with a close grove of scotch fir it can never be an object of beauty at hand it is a heavy lump at a distance a murky spot  again if the island however beautifully shaped or planted be seated in the center of a round lake in the focus of an oval one or in any other regular position the beauty of it is lost at least in some points of view  but when it is lines and shape are both irregular  when it is ornamented with ancient oak rich in foliage but light and airy  and when it takes some irregular situation in the lake then it is an object truly beautiful  beautiful in itself as well as in composition it must however be added that it would be difficult to place such an object in any situation that would be equally pleasing from every stand  the surface of the lake offers itself last to observation the several incidents which arise here are all owing to the sky and the disposition of the water to receive it is impression  that the sky is the great regulator of the color of the water is known to all artists olli caeruleus supra caput astitit imber noctem hyememque ferens et inhorruit unda tenebris and again jamque rubescebat radiis mare et athere ab alto aurora in roseis fulgebat lutea bigis   the effect indeed holds universally as water in all cases exposed to the sky will act as a mirror to it  in the darkness of a brooding storm we have just seen the whole body of the water will be dark inhorruit unda tenebris  in clear and windy weather the breezy ruffled lake as thomson calls it is a shattered mirror it reflects the serenity but reflects it partially the hollow of each wave is commonly in shadow the summit is tipped with light the light or shadow therefore prevails according to the position of the waves to the eye their lubricity is lost more or less they all flow cum gurgite flavo but the lake like spencers fountain which sprang from the limpid tears of a nymph  is chaste and pure as purest snow ne lets her waves with any filth be dyed   refined thus from every obstruction it is tremblingly alive all over the merest trifle a frisking fly a falling leaf almost a sound alarms it  that sound which from the mountain previous to the storm rolls over the muttering earth disturbs the flood and shakes the forestleaf without a breath   this tremulous shudder is sometimes even still more partial it will run in lengthened parallels and separate the reflections upon the surface which are lost on one side and taken up on the other this is perhaps the most picturesque form which water assumes as it affords the painter an opportunity of throwing in those lengthened lights and shades which give the greatest variety and clearness to water  there is another appearance on the surfaces of lakes which we cannot account for on any principle either of optics or of perspective eye and at a distance when the summits of the waves agreeably to the rules of perspective appear in contact the whole surface in that part will be light  but when the sky is splendid and at the same time calm the water being then a perfect mirror will glow all over with correspondent tints unless other reflections from the objects around intervene and form more vivid pictures  often you will see a spacious bay screened by some projecting promontory in perfect repose while the rest of the lake more pervious to the air is crisped over by a gentle ripple  sometimes also when the whole lake is tranquil a gentle perturbation will arise in some distant part from no apparent cause from a breath of air which nothing else can feel and creeping softly on communicate the tremulous shudder with exquisite sensibility over half the surface in this observation i do little more than translate from ovid  exhorruit aequoris instar quod fremit exigua cum summum stringitur aura   no pool no riverbay can present this idea in it is utmost purity in them every crystalline particle is set as it were in a socket of mud when there is no apparent cause in the sky the water will sometimes appear dappled with large spots of shade it is possible these patches may have connection with the bottom of the lake as naturalists suppose the shining parts of the sea are occasioned by the spawn of fish but it is more probable that in some way they are connected with the sky as they are generally esteemed in the country to be a weathergage the people will often say it will be no hayday to day the lake is full of shades  i never myself saw this appearance o i might be able to give a better account of it but i have heard it so often taken notice of that i suppose there is at least some ground for the observation tho after all i think it probable these shades may be owing only to floating clouds  from this great variety which the surfaces of lakes assume we may draw this conclusion that the painter may take great liberties in point of light and shade in his representation of water it is in many cases under no rule that we are acquainted with or under rules so lax that the imagination is left very much at large  on the subject of lakes i have only farther to add that many bodies of water under this denomination are found upon the summits of lofty mountains in this situation they are commonly mere basins or reservoirs and want the pleasing accompaniments which adorn the lower lakes lakes of this kind are a collection of springs and discharge themselves generally from their elevated stations in cascades  sect viii we have now made a considerable advance toward a landscape the sky is laid in a mountain fills the offskip and a lake with it is accompaniments takes possession of a nearer distance nothing but a foreground is wanting and for this we have great choice of objects  broken ground  trees  rocks  cascades  and valleys  in a distance the ruling character is tenderness which on a foreground gives way to what the painter calls force and richness force arises from a violent opposition of color light and shade richness consists in a variety of parts and glowing tints in some degree richness is found in a distance but never united with force for in a distance tho the lights may be strong and the parts varied yet the shades and tints will ever be faint and tender  in the mean time this opposition on the foreground violent as it is must always be subject to the ruling masses of light and shade and coloring which harmonize the whole  the effect of this harmony is breadth or repose it is opposite is flutter and confusion  it appears therefore that the management of foregrounds is a matter of great nicety in them a very contradiction must be reconciled breadth and repose which consist in uniting the parts must be made to agree with force and richness which consist in violently breaking them and what adds to the difficulty the eye brought thus on the spot is hurt by the minutest defect whereas at a distance an irregular dash of the pencil if it be not one thing may be conceived to be another obscurity is there a source of beauty  hence it is that many great masters who can throw a distance into a pleasing confusion and give it the effect of nature have failed in exercising their art on a foreground  having premised thus much with regard to foregrounds in general let us now examine the foregrounds which are presented to us in this very picturesque country  broken grounds are the first objects of our attention here they abound in every shape the painter will easily find either some rough knoll whose parts are ample  the sloping corner of a hill perhaps worn by a mountaintorrent  a rugged road winding through the chasm of a rifted promontory  or some other part of nature equally grand and picturesque  if he choose to adorn his foreground with wood and who does not he will find it in some parts of this country in a tolerable style of greatness but in general the old timber is decayed or cut down and that sort of wood encouraged which is the most profitable  such wood as in a course of time is turned into charcoal it has in some degree the effect of better trees in a distance but it is very deficient when we call for an ancient oak to give the foreground ground a grandeur equal to the scene  when we want the magnificence of it is shadowing form to mantle over the vacant corner of a landscape  when we wish it to hide some heavy promontory or to scatter a few loose branches over some illshaped mountainline  when it is massy foliage is necessary to give depth to shade  it is twisted bole covered with gray moss to oppose the vivid green in it is neighborhood  or lastly it is warm autumnal tint to contrast the colder hues of distance in all these cases a deficiency of forestwood is sometimes regretted in the scenery before us but not often and where it is the loss is easily supplied by other objects among which rocks are the principal and these when ornamented with wood tho of a smaller size have generally the effect of the most luxuriant foliage  rocks differ in surface general form and color  the rock naturally wears that smooth weatherbeaten surface which time gives it through a succession of ages but rocks firm as they are are subject to change springs undermine them torrents wash the earth from around them frosts loosen them and sometimes they are torn by storms and earthquakes under these circumstances when large masses fall away the rock exhibits a fractured surface which in general has a better effect than the smooth one nature in these instances may be said to retouch her compositions the fractured parts are larger and sharper and better adapted to receive either smart catching lights or a body of light and shade  an humble imitation of the surfaces of fractured rocks is sometimes exhibited in large coals they may at least assist the imagination of a painter  with regard to the general form of rocks both species the smooth and the fractured have equal variety both have their bold projections  both hang alike over their bases  are rifted into chasms  and shoot sometimes into horizontal and sometimes into diagonal strata  the natural color of rocks is either gray or red we have of each kind in england and both are beautiful but the gray rock which is the common species in this scenery makes the finer contrast with the foliage either of summer or of autumn  i call red and gray the natural colors of rocks but more properly they are the ground only of a variety of tints these tints arise from weeds mosses and lychens of various kinds which uniting together on the surface of a rock often make a rich and very harmomonious assemblage of coloring and the painter who does not attend to these minutiae we are considering foregrounds loses half the beauty of his original  among these lychens the white species is the least pleasing when mixed with other tints it may form an agreeable contrast and even when it borrows no aid of this kind if it be sparingly and happily introduced it may add a beauty to the natural color of the gray rock by giving it the brilliancy of a few sharp touches but when it prevails and spreads like a bald leprous scab over a whole surface it is mealy hue is very disgusting unless it be thrown into shadow or supported by some mass of foliage or other vivid tint in contact with it  besides the species of rocks just described there is another called the cragg which conveys the idea of a rock roughly pounded with these shattered fragments whole sides of mountains are often covered down which they appear continually to shiver this species is very inferior to the former it wants that breadth of surface which gives dignity to an object in a distance indeed which melts the fragments into one mass the effect is good but in the situation in which we are now considering rocks as the appendages of a foreground the cragg is meanly circumstanced  the cascade which is the next object of our observation may be divided into the broken and the regular fall  the first belongs most properly to the rock whose projecting fragments impeding the water break it into pieces  dash it into foam  and give it all the spirit and agitation which that active element is capable of receiving  happy is the pencil which can seize the varieties and brilliancy of water under this circumstance  in the regular fall the water meets no obstruction but pours down from the higher grounds to the lower in one splendid sheet  each kind has it is beauties but in general the broken fall is more adapted to a small body of water and the regular to a large one the small body of water has nothing to recommend it but it is variety and bustle whereas the large body has a dignity of character to maintain to fritter it in pieces would be to destroy in a degree the grandeur of it is effect were the niagara thus broken at least if some considerable parts of it were not left broad and sheety it might be a grand scene of confusion but it could not be that vast that uniform and simple object which is most capable of expressing the idea of greatness  as there are few considerable rivers in the romantic country we are now examining the most beautiful cascades which are innumerable are generally of the broken kind the regular falls of which also there are many are objects of little value tho they are sometimes four or five hundred feet in height yet they appear only like threads of silver at a distance and like mere spouts at hand void both of grandeur and variety  and yet in heavy rains some of them must be very noble if we may judge from their channels which often show great marks of violence  but i was never fortunate enough to see any of them in these moments of wildness  these two kinds of cascades the broken and the regular may be combined if the weight of water be small it is true it will admit only the broken fall but if it be large it may with propriety admit a combination of both and these combinations may be multiplied into each other with endless variety  the regular fall admits also another mode of variety by forming itself into what may be called the successive fall in which the water instead of making one continued shoot falls through a succession of different stories of this kind are many of the mountaincascades in this country which are often very beautiful especially where the stages are deranged and the water seeks it is way from one stage to another  this is the species of cascade which was the great object of imitation in all the antiquated waterworks of the last age our forefathers admired the successive fall and agreeably to their awkward mode of imitation made the water descend a regular flight of stonestairs  before we conclude the subject of cascades it may be observed that as in other objects of beauty so in this proportion must be a regulating principle i shall not be so precise as to say what is the exact proportion of an elegant cascade nor is it necessary the eye will easily see the enormity of disproportion where it exists in any great degree and that is enough thus when a mountaincascade falls four or five hundred feet and is perhaps scarce two yards broad every eye must see the disproportion as it will also when the whole breadth of some large river falls only two or three feet both would be more beautiful if their falls held a nearer proportion to their quantities of water  the last species of foregrounds are valleys let it be observed that the terms vale and valley denote universally through this work the greater and smaller scenes of the same kind i consider valley as the diminutive of vale  with regard to which it must be remarked first that narrow contracted valleys only are meant the open valley must class itself among objects of distant scenery  it must secondly be remarked that even contracted valleys are not purely of the nature of foregrounds but participate of distance one sidescreen must necessarily be a little removed if you would give your scenery the advantage of perspective  these things being premised we may consider the valley as a species of foreground the ingredients of which spencer has given us in very few words through woods and mountains wild they came at last into a pleasant dale that lowly lay betwixt two hills whose high heads over placed the valley did with cool shade overcast through midst thereof a little river rolled these ingredients admit great variety in composition the sides of the valley may be high or low rocky or woody smooth or full of jutting promontories and these variations again may play into each other with a thousand interchanges  when we find a concurrence of beautiful circumstances in these scenes  when their sides are well proportioned and picturesquely adorned  and especially when they are so fortunate as to open on a rich distance a lake bounded by a rocky mountain or any other interesting object they form a landscape of a very pleasing kind  the rivers also with which these valleys scarce ever fail of being adorned have the same variety as the hills and may now and then be introduced very happily to assist the foreground they are pure chrystalline streams  generally rapid  generally sparkling over beds of pebbles  often tumbling and foaming over the ledges of rocks  and forming through the whole of their course a continuation of little bustling cascades  nearly allied to the contracted valley is what in this country is called a gill in others a dell it is a narrow cleft winding between two rocky precipices and overgrown with wood which closes at the top and almost excludes the day through the bottom foams a torrent you hear it sounding in it is fall from one rocky stage to another but it is rarely visible  these romantic spots are generally impervious when they are a little more open so as to allow a narrow footpath to stray among them they are the most beloved haunts of solitude and meditation and of all the parts of this delightful scenery afford the most refreshing refuge from noontide heat  such were the scenes the poet panted after when they drew from his soul oppressed by the languor of a summersun that ardent aspiration  o quis me gelidis in vallibus haemi sistat et ingenti ramorum protegat umbra   how intimately acquainted with these scenes he was his own very accurate descriptions show  densis hunc frondibus atrum urget utrimque latus nemoris medioque fragosus dat sonitum saxis et torto vertice torrens dat sonitum says this accurate observer of nature remarking in that expression that the torrent was an address to the ear not to the eye  the contracted valley we have seen may open to a distance but a view into the gill furnishes only a foreground it can only consist of some little sequestered recess  a few twisted boles  a cascade sparkling through the trees  or a translucent pool formed in the cavity beneath some rock and just large enough to reflect the hanging wood which over shadows it and yet even on this contracted scale we have many a beautiful landscape  for nature here has with her living colors formed a scene which ruisdael best might rival crystal lakes over which the giantoak himself a grove flings his romantic branches and beholds his reverend image in the expanse below if distant hills be wanting yet our eye forgets the want and with delighted gaze rests on the lovely foreground    sect ix we have now examined the materials of which the magnificent scenery of this country is composed  the distant mountain  the lake  and the foreground but a few general observations on these materials as united in composition may perhaps throw some new and picturesque lights on the whole  in many countries much grander scenes are exhibited than these  mountains more magnificent and lakes more extensive yet it is probable there are few in which the several objects are better proportioned and united with more beauty  in america the lakes are seas and the country on their banks being removed of course to a great distance can add no accompaniments  among the smaller lakes of italy and switzerland no doubt there are many delightful scenes but the larger lakes like those of america are disproportioned to their accompaniments the water occupies too large a space and throws the scenery too much into distance  the mountains of sweden norway and other northern regions are probably rather masses of hideous rudeness than scenes of grandeur and proportion proportion indeed in all scenery is indispensably necessary and unless the lake and it is correspondent mountains have this just relation to each other they want the first principle of beauty  the value of lakescenery arises rather from the idea of magnificence than of variety the scene is not continually shifting here as on the banks of a winding river the lake is so vast that it stands still as it were before the moving eye nor is this attended with satiety a quick succession of imagery is necessary in scenes of less grandeur where little beauties are easily scanned but scenes like these demand contemplation these rich volumes of nature like the works of established authors will bear a frequent perusal contemplation adds to their value  in the mean time with all this magnificence and beauty it cannot be supposed that every scene which these countries present is correctly picturesque in such immense bodies of roughhewn matter many irregularities and even many deformities must exist which a practiced eye would wish to correct mountains are sometimes crowded  their sides are often bare when contrast requires them to be wooded  promontories form the waterboundary into acute angles  and bays are contracted into narrow points instead of swelling into ample basins  in all these cases the imagination is apt to whisper what glorious scenes might here be made if these stubborn materials could yield to the judicious hand of art  and to say the truth we are sometimes tempted to let the imagination loose among them  by the force of this creative power an intervening hill may be turned aside and a distance introduced  this illshaped mountain may be pared and formed into a better line  to that on the opposite side a lightness may be given by the addition of a higher summit  upon yon bald declivity which stretches along the lake may be reared a forest of noble oak which thinly scattered over the top will thicken as it descends and throw it is vivid reflections on the water in full luxuriance  the line of the water too which perhaps is straight the imagination will easily correct it will bring forward some bold promontory or open some winding bay  it will proceed even to the ornaments of art on some projecting knoll it will rear the majesty of a ruined castle whose ivyed walls seem a part of the very rock on which they stand on a gentle rise opening to the lake and half incircled by woody hills some mouldring abbey may be seated and far beyond may appear distant objects under some circumstance of picturesque illumination the forest darkening round and glittering spire  thus the imagination will assist those scenes which tho replete with beauties beyond it is power to create may contain deformities which it might wish to remove it corrects one part of nature by another and composes a landscape as the artist composed his celebrated venus by selecting accordant beauties from different originals scarce any single archetype is sufficiently correct any other idea of improving nature is absurd and can be adopted only by men of false taste who imagine they improve her by an addition of heterogeneous decorations  as to the improvement of such vast scenes as these it is in every shape except by a little planting beyond all power of art i cannot therefore be understood to suggest improvement here all we get by imagining how such a country as this might be improved is merely a little practice in the rules of picturesque composition  we may remark further that the power which the imagination has over these scenes is not greater than the power which they have over the imagination no tame country however beautiful however adorned can distend the mind like this awful and majestic scenery the wild sallies of untutored genius often strike the imagination more than the most correct effusions of cultivated parts tho the eye therefore might take more pleasure in a view considered merely in a picturesque light when a little adorned by the hand of art yet i much doubt whether such a view would have that strong effect on the imagination as when rough with all it is bold irregularities about it when beauty and deformity grandeur and horror mingled together strike the mind with a thousand opposing ideas and like chemical infusions of an opposite nature produce an effervescence which no harmonious mixtures could produce  surely there is a hidden power that reigns mid the lone majesty of untamed nature controuling sober reason  were a lover of nature placed abruptly in the midst of such scenes as these the effect might be too strong and in this instance as in others he might discover the weakness of his first progenitor in whom on viewing suddenly a grand landscape we are told so deep the power of those ingredients pierced even to the inmost seat of mortal sight that adam now enforced to close his eyes sank down and all his spirits became in tranced   but nature which brings out the sun through the medium of twilight has in this case also provided for the weakness of the visual nerve these grand scenes are gradually introduced the idea grows imperceptibly to maturity the great stones of yesterday become rocks today hills in a few stages are converted into mountains and we see now and then the glimpse of a lake before the eye is filled with the whole vast splendid surface of it  if the imagination be thus fired by these romantic scenes even in their common state how much more may we suppose it wrought on when they strike us under some extraordinary circumstance of beauty or terror  in the tranquillity of a calm or the agitation of a storm  some scenes particularly of the sylvan kind are perhaps best suited to a calm they receive their principal beauty from the richness of the objects which is improved by cheerful and splendid lights  other scenes less enriched by objects are meagre in a calm and glaring sunshine a bright hemisphere only renders their poverty more apparent to such scenes a storm which produces sublime ideas by heaving clouds and bursting lights gives an adventitious consequence and leads the eye in it is pursuit of objects to the grandeur of the effect  but there are some scenes in nature which are adapted to both circumstances  none more than the scenery of lakes  none perhaps so much  during five days which we spent among the lakes we saw one of them only and that but once under the circumstance of a perfect calm  when there was neither wind to ruffle nor cloud to obscure the resplendency of the surface  when we saw the poets description literally translated   silet arduus ether tum zephyri posuere premit placida aequora pontus   if an artificial mirror a few inches long placed opposite to a door or a window occasions often very pleasing reflections how noble must be the appearance when an area of many leagues in circumference is formed into one vast mirror and this mirror surrounded by a combination of great and beautiful objects the majestic repose of so grand so solemn and splendid a scene raises in the mind a sort of enthusiastic calm which spreads a mild complacence over the breast  a tranquil pause of mental operation which may be felt but not described soothing each gust of passion into peace all but the swellings of the softened heart that waken not disturb the tranquil mind   when the mind has a little recovered it is tone from the general impression of such a scene it feels a new pleasure in examining more minutely the several picturesque ingredients which produced it  the stillness and purity of the air  the strong lights and shades  the tints upon the mountains  the polish of the lake  and above all the reflections displayed upon it is bosom when  spread into a liquid plain it stands unmoved pure as the expanse of heaven  and to the fringed bank with osiers crowned it is crystal mirror holds    other adventitious circumstances of less value in themselves but in union very picturesque add new life and beauty to so still a scene  groups of cattle in various parts driven by the heats of noon along the shores of the lake  and fishingboats extending their nets in dotted circles and forming tremulous reflections from their flaccid sails  when we take a view of such a glorious scene in all it is splendour we regret that it should ever be deformed by the rough blasts of tempest and yet i know not whether under this latter circumstance it may not have a still greater power over the imagination every little idea is lost in the wild uproar and confusion of such a scene  nor is it in this disturbed state less an object of picturesque beauty the sky floating with broken clouds  the mountains half obscured by driving vapors and mingling with the sky in awful obscurity  the trees straining in the blast  and the lake stirred from the bottom and whitening every rocky promontory with it is foam are all objects highly adapted to the pencil  in the midst of the tempest if a bright sunbeam should suddenly break out and in shakespeares language light up the storm the scenery of an agitated lake thus assisted by the powers of contrast affects both the imagination and the eye in a still greater degree some broad mountainside catching a mass of light produces an astonishing effect amidst the leaden gloom which surrounds it perhaps a sunbeam halfsuffused in vapor darting between two mountains may stretch along the water in a lengthened gleam just as the skiff passes to receive the light upon it is swelling sail while the seagull wheeling along the storm turns it is silvery side strongly illumined against the bosom of some lurid cloud and by that single touch of opposition gives double darkness to the rising tempest  compared with such scenes how inanimate do the subjects of canaletti appear  how flat his square canals and formal streetperspective when opposed to spreading lakes and sweeping mountains  the puny labors of men to the bold irregular scenery of nature nor can we help regretting the loss of such pictures as might have been produced if canalettis free pencil had been thrown loose in such a country as this  but these scenes are not only superior to the subjects of canaletti but to those of a greater master the younger vanderveld seaviews tho grander in some respects are on the whole inferior to the views before us their great deficiency is the want of variety in their accompaniments one species of them indeed and but one is superior to the utmost efforts of the lake  the segment of some landlocked bay which in a storm especially is a noble subject the waters are more agitated and form bolder swells which of course receive grander effects of light here too instead of the dancing skiff we are presented with the terrors of shipwreck the beacon also seated on a bleak eminence marks the coast with peculiar danger while the distant porttown discovered by a gleam of light under the shadowing cliff makes the scene still more affecting by the exclusion of hope within sight of security  i have only farther to observe in general on the scenes of this romantic country that they are subject to violent convulsions of various kinds every thing here is in the grand style the very elements when they do mischief keep in unison with it and perform all their operations with an air of dignity  upon some of the mountains particularly on crossfell a blast called in the country a helmwind will sometimes arise suddenly of a nature so violent that nothing can withstand it is force the experienced mountaineer as he traverses those wild regions foreseeing it is approach throws himself flat upon the ground and lets it pass over him it is rage is momentary and the air instantly settles into it is former calm  these hurricanes are not uncommon in other mountainous countries mr misson particularly speaking of the mountains near inspruck tells us that the winds often force their way through their hollow parts as if through pipes and raise such furious hurricanes as will sometimes root up not only trees but even rocks  the lake too is subject to something of the same kind of emotion which the inhabitants of the country call a bottomwind often when all is calm and resplendent around as the boat is plying it is steady way the boatman will descry at a distance happy that it is so a violent ebullition of the water he will see it heave and swell forced upwards by some internal convulsion and suffering all the agitation of a storm but as soon as the confined air has spent it is force the agitated surface immediately subsides  of these bottomwinds also we meet with frequent accounts particularly in some of the sweedish lakes which are very subject to them  something of this kind seems to have given spencer an idea which he introduces in his idle lake the waves come rolling and the billows roar outrageously as they engaged were but not one puff of wind there did appear   often also a vast body of water collected in the entrails of a mountain it is said will force a way through it is side and rushing down the declivity take it is course through the valley where it is not uncommon to see the marks of it is devastation  the same effects are sometimes produced by waterspouts which in countries like these are collected as at sea and fall upon mountains  the avalanche or fall of snow is common here too as in other mountainous countries inundations also are occasioned by it is sudden melting  but the fall of cliffs and large fragments of mountains loosened by rain and frost produces one of the greatest scenes of terror which belongs to this romantic country and to which we are chiefly indebted for that variety of fractured rock and broken ground which are among it is greatest ornaments virgil has given us a description of this kind in great perfection qualis in euboico baiarum litore quondam saxea pila cadit   ruinam prona trahit penitusque vadis illisa recumbit miscent se maria and nigrae attolluntur arenae tum sonitu prochyta alta tremit durumque cubile inarime jovis imperiis imposta typhaeo the immediate effect is first described miscent se maria and nigrae attolluntur arenae after a solemn pause the grand echoes and distant repetitions lengthened out from the rocky scenery around are nobly introduced tum sonitu prochyta alta tremit  durumque cubile inarime jovis imperiis imposta typhaeo   having thus collected a few of those general ideas with which the scenery of this country abounds we shall now illustrate them in a tour through some of it is most romantic parts  sect x ambleside is an ordinary village but delightfully seated a cove of lofty mountains half incircles it on the north and the lake of wynander opens in front near the shores of which it stands  the ground between it and the mountains which are at least two miles distant is various broken and woody a mountaintorrent about half a mile from the village forms a grand cascade but it was so overgrown with thickets that we had no point of view to see it from but the top which is the most unpicturesque we could have  from this fall the stream rushes along a narrow valley or gill luxuriantly adorned with rock and wood and winding through it about a mile emerges near the head of the lake into which it enters this gill was so overgrown with wood that it appeared almost impervious but if a path could be carried through it and the whole a little opened it might be made very beautiful a scene in itself so pleasing with a noble cascade at one end and an extensive lake at the other could not fail to strike the imagination in the most forcible manner  from ambleside we set out for bowness to take a view of the lake part of the road we had traversed the day before from kendal and were a second time amused by the woody landscape it afforded and it is sudden interrupted openings to the lake before the whole burst of that magnificent scene was presented  from the higher grounds above bowness we had an elevated view of it is whole extent  windermere or winanderwater as it is sometimes called extends from north to south about twelve or fourteen miles in breadth it rarely exceeds two and is seldom narrower than one the southern end winds a little toward the west the northern and westtern coasts are wild and mountainous  the eastern and southern are more depressed in some parts cultivated in others woody opposite to bowness the lake is divided into two parts by a cluster of islands one of which is larger than the rest  bowness is the capital porttown on the lake if we may adopt a dignified style which the grandeur of the country naturally suggests it is the great mart for fish and charcoal both which commodities are largely imported here and carried by land into the country it is harbor is crowded with vessels of various kinds some of which are used merely as pleasureboats in navigating the lake  in one of these we embarked and standing out to sea made for the great island which we were informed was a very interesting scene  we soon arrived at it and landing at the south end we ordered our boat to meet us at the north point meaning to traverse it is little boundaries  a more sequestered spot cannot easily be conceived nothing can be more excluded from the noise and interruption of life or abound with a greater variety of those circumstances which make retirement pleasing  the whole island contains about thirty acres it is form is oblong it is shores irregular retiring into bays and broken into creeks the surface too is uneven and a sort of little appennine ridge runs through the middle of it falling down in all shapes into the water  like it is great motherisland the southern part wears a smoother aspect than the northern which is broken and rocky  formerly the whole island was one entire grove at present it is rather bare of wood tho there are some large oaks upon it  one of it is greatest beauties arises from that irregular little appennine just mentioned which extends from one end to the other this circumstance hides it is insularity by connecting it with the continent in every part except on the high grounds you stand in an amphitheatre composed of the noblest objects and the lake performing the office of a sunk fence the grandeur of each part of the continent is called in by turns to aid the insignificance of the island  the oblong form also of the lake gives the island another great advantage on both it is sides the opposite shores of the continent are little more than half a mile distant but at the northern and southern points there is a large sheet of water the views therefore as you walk round are continually changing through all the varieties of distance which are still farther improved by a little degree of obliquity in the position of the island  he who should take upon him to ornament such a scene as this would have only to conduct his walk and plantations so as to take advantage of the grand parts of the continent around him  to hide what is offensive  and amidst a choice of great and picturesque scenes to avoid showing too much as he would have at all times an exuberance of water he should not be ostentatious in displaying it it would be a relief to the eye sometimes to exclude it wholly and to introduce a mere sylvan scene with distant mountains rising above it a transient glance of the water with some wellchosen objects beyond it would often also have a good effect and sometimes a grand expansion of the whole  thus the objects around tho unmanageable in themselves might be brought under command by the assistance of an insular situation  with regard to the ornamenting of such a scene an elegant neatness is all the improver should aim at amidst these grand objects of nature it would be absurd to catch the eye with the affected decorations of art the simple idea he would desire to preserve is what the place itself suggests a sequestered retreat the boundaries should in a great measure be thicket  on the eastern coast especially which is opposed to the only cultivated part of the country and if there be any thing in that part worth giving to the eye it might be given through some unaffected opening  for thickets the wild wood of the country would abundantly suffice it grows luxuriantly and would soon produce it is effect  the middle parts of the island with a few clumps properly disposed might be neat pasturage with flocks and herds which would contrast agreeably with the rough scenery around  the house at present stands too formally in the middle of the island it might stand better near the southern promontory the air of this sweet retreat is said to be very pure since this view of windermere island was taken it has been under the hands of improvement the proprietor i have been told spent six thousand pounds upon it with which sum he has contrived to do almost every thing that one would wish had been left undone it is now in other hands which may probably restore it is beauty   this island belonged formerly to the philipsons a family of note in westmoreland during the civil wars two of them an elder and a younger brother served the king the former who was the proprietor of it commanded a regiment the latter was a major  the major whose name was robert was a man of great spirit and enterprise and for his many seats of personal bravery had obtained among the oliverians of those parts the appellation of robin the devil  after the war subsided col briggs a steady friend to the usurpation residing at kendal under the double character of a leading magistrate for he was a justice of the peace and an active commander held the country in awe this person having heard that major philipson was at his brothers house on the island in windermere resolved if possible to seize and punish a man who had made himself so particularly obnoxious with this view he mustered a party which he thought sufficient and went himself on the enterprise how it was conducted my authority dr bourns hist of westmoreland does not inform us  whether he got together the navigation of the lake and blockaded the place by sea or whether he landed and carried on his approaches in form neither do we learn the strength of the garrison within nor of the works without tho every gentlemans house was at that time in some degree a fortress all we learn is that major philipson endured a seige of eight or ten days with great gallantry till his brother the colonel hearing of his distress raised a party and relieved him  it was now the majors turn to make reprizals he put himself therefore at the head of a little troop of horse and rode to kendal where col briggs resided here being informed that the colonel was at prayers for it was on a sunday morning he stationed his men properly in the avenues and himself armed rode directly into the church it is said he intended to seize the colonel and carry him off but as this seems to have been totally impracticable it is rather probable that his intention was to kill him on the spot and in the midst of the confusion to escape whatever his intention was it was frustrated for briggs happened to be elsewhere  the congregation as might be expected was thrown into great confusion on seeing an armed man on horseback enter the church and the major taking the advantage of their astonishment turned his horse round and rode quietly out but having given an alarm he was presently assaulted as he left the church and being seized his girths were cut and he was unhorsed  at this instant his party made a furious attack on the assailants and the major killing with his own hand the man who had seized him clapped the saddle ungirthed as it was upon his horse and vaulting into it rode full speed through the streets of kendal calling to his men to follow him and with his whole party made a safe retreat to his asylum in the lake  the action marked the man many knew him and they who did not knew as well from the exploit that it could be nobody but robin the devil  such are the calamities of civil war after the direful effects of public opposition cease revenge and private malice long keep alive the animosity of individuals  sect xi having thus taken a view of a place abounding with so many beauties we found our bark waiting for us at the northern point and setting sail instead of returning to bowness we stood for ambleside we could have wished to navigate the whole lake but it was too great an undertaking for measured time and we contented ourselves with going in quest of the beauties of it is northern division  as we left the island the scene opening on every side we found ourselves surrounded with objects of great magnificence  on the western coast ran a continuous range of craggy mountains thinly scattered over with trees which had formerly overspread it it is a part of furnessfell the whole of which we had before seen in one vast combination of distant mountains bounding our view over the bay of cartmel the part we now saw stretches about two leagues along the lake  on the eastern side we passed several small islands some of which were wellwooded others were mere rocks with low twisted trees bursting from their crevices all of them probably worth visiting if our time had allowed through the openings of these islands we had partial views of the eastern coast till having advanced further through this little archipelago into the body of the lake the whole eastern skreen opened to the eye  this side tho less magnificent than the mountains of furness on the left contains however more variety it is broken into hills some of which are cultivated and others covered with wood  but on the whole neither of these sidescreens is an object purely picturesque the western shore is great indeed but it is an unvaried mass of heavy greatness the eastern is broken too much and wants both unity and grandeur when we rode through it in the morning it made an admirable foreground in almost every part but we now found it less qualified as a distance  the sidescreens however are the least essential parts of this vast scene the front is the capital part  that part on which the eye immediately settles it consists of that immense body of barrier mountains which separate the two counties of cumberland and westmoreland appearing in this view to be drawn up in a sort of tumultuary array mountain beyond mountain as far as the eye could reach  as we advanced in our voyage this great division of the lake from the islands to it is northern point tho really oblong assumed the form of a vast circular basin and the rough mountains arising round it appeared from so splended an area with new grandeur indeed contrast gave an additional force to the character of each  this great scene however surveyed thus from a center was rather amusing than picturesque it was too extensive for the painters use a small portion of the circle reduced to paper or canvas could have conveyed no idea and a large segment would have exceeded all the powers of the pallet  it is certainly an error in landscapepainting to comprehend too much it turns a picture into a map nothing is more delusive than to suppose that every view which pleases in nature will please in painting in nature the pleasure arises from the eyes roaming from one passage to another and making it is remarks on each in painting as the eye is there confined within certain limits it arises from seeing some select spot adorned agreeably to the rules of art and the painter who wishes to make a pleasing composition must not include more than he can thus adorn his foreground and his distance must bear a proportion to each other which cannot be the case if he include a vast compass for as he can only take in a certain quantity of foreground the removed parts of his picture should bear a proper proportion to it wellmanaged exceptions may be found yet still in general the rule is good  but although the whole of the amphitheatre we are now surveying was in it is full dimensions no subject for a picture yet it exhibited many parts which as distances were purely picturesque and afforded an admirable collection of mountain studies for a painter i speak particularly of the front skreen in which the lines of the mountains were beautiful and various  the intersections also of those lines  the promontories with the deep shades they projected  and above all the mountain coloring which was the most splendid we had ever seen airy tints of vivid yellow green and purple we could prismatically separate bright spots of effulgence also appeared which could not well be denominated of any color yet all tho displayed in such rich profusion were blended with such nice harmony and tempered so modestly by the gray mistiness of distance that gorgeous as these hues were there was not a single color that glared or was out of place   for who can paint like nature can imagination boast amidst it is gay creation hues like here is or can it mix them with that matchless skill and lose them in each other we had now made a considerable progress in our voyage the sidescreen on the left kept still the same distance but the mountains in front as we approached them began now to separate into near and distant grounds and the rocks and woods which in the painters language adhered before now broke away in a variety of projections tho still overspread with soft coloring and tender shadow  as we approached nearer this softness of coloring took a more vivid hue and the promontories and rocks continued still projecting to the eye with new force of shade while the mountains which ranged behind began more and more to retire the length of the lake tho it affected the nearer grounds made no change in the distant mountains so that the comparative distance between the foreground and them was now much greater than it had been  an appearance of this kind is beautifully described by virgil when aeneas came in sight of italy he first saw a hazy appearance of hills and low land  procul obscuros colles humilemque videmus italiam    on a nearer approach he discovered the temple of minerva which being seated on high ground seemed as if it stood on a promontory hanging over the sea   templum apparet in arce minervae but as he came close in with the land the rocks took their proper form and the temple retreated to a distance   gemino demittunt brachia muro turriti scopuli refugitque a litore templum as we approached the end of the lake the promontories and rocks assumed new height and almost hid the mountains which continued to retire beyond them while the form of the nearer grounds began also to vary the water which a little before seemed in contact with the rocks appeared now to wash a meadow beyond which the rocks formed a first distance  the scenery put us in mind of berghem who often chose a meadow with a rock behind it to relieve his cattle his rock is generally left plain and simple almost without a single varying tint a mere mass of tender shadow while the cattle are touched with infinite force and spirit we saw the picture realized berghems imagination could not have formed a better background nor a more beautiful group such combinations are pleasing in life in painting and in poetry   on the grassy bank some ruminating lie while others stand half in the flood and often bending sip the circling surface in the middle rears the strong laborious ox his honest front which incomposed he shakes and from his side the troublous insects lashes with his tail returning still amid his subjects safe slumbers the monarchswain his careless arm thrown round his head on downy moss reclined here lay his scrip with wholesome viands filled there listening every noise his faithful dog through the meadow at the bottom of the rocky ground two rivers the bratha and the rotha wind their way and uniting before they meet the lake enter it with a full but quiet stream and furnish it with large supplies  the rotha takes it is rise from mountains about twelve miles distant and forms the two lakes of grasmer and rydal before it enter windermere  the bratha rises from the pike of langdale in a mountainous and rocky country and after a turbulent course buries at length all it is inquietude in the peaceful waters of the lake where it is name is no more remembered  our boatmen having conveyed us a considerable way up these united streams landed us on the meadows within half a mile of ambleside  before we leave this grand expanse of water i cannot forbear remarking a few circumstances that relate to it  in the first place we admired it is extraordinary brightness it is all over nitidis argenteus undis the eye can see distinctly in smooth water through a medium of at least a dozen yards and view the inhabitants of it is deep recesses as they play in shoals and  sporting with quick glance show to the sun their waved coats dropped with gold   how far the transparency of water is an addition to a scene i cannot take upon me to say most of the lakes in scotland which i saw are of a mossytinctured hue and yet had their full effect in landscape  as a detached object however the transparent lake is incomparably the most beautiful i should suppose also that the more brilliant the water is the more brilliant are the reflections  among the great variety of fish which inhabit the extensive waters of this lake the char is the most remarkable it is near twice the size of a herring it is back is of an olivegreen it is belly of a light vermilion softening in some parts into white and changing into a deep red at the insertion of the fins  a parcel of char just caught and thrown together into the luggagepool of a boat makes a pleasant harmony of coloring the green olivetint prevails to which a spirit is here and there given by a light blush of vermilion and by a strong touch of red if a fin happen to appear these pleasing colors are assisted by the bright silvery lights which play over the whole for nothing reflects light more beautifully than the scales of fish  char are caught only in the winterseason when twenty dozen in a day are sometimes taken by a single boat in summer they retire to the rocky caves below some of which are said to be unfathomable nor do they breed in any lake in which such deep recesses are not found  the charfishing is a very profitable branch of trade to the proprietors of the lake the whole area of it is divided into five districts an invisible line crosses the surface from crag to crag  a limit which the fisherman correctly knows but tho the space of each fishery is nearly equal yet the produce is otherwise the fish running in shoals sometimes in one part of the lake and sometimes in another  when the farmer rents land he can judge of his bargain by the surface when he rents water he must take his chance  but fish are not the only inhabitants of this lake innumerable flights of waterfowl frequent it is extensive plain the naturalist may declare their names and classes the painter has only to remark the variety of forms in which they appear  sometimes sitting in black groups upon the water rising and sinking with the waves at other times in the air circling the lake in figured files or with hesitating wing seizing some station on it is banks or surface  with regard to these minute appendages of landscape let me only suggest that birds should never be introduced upon the wing near the eye quick motion of any kind represented is an absurdity and the longer you look the more absurd it becomes but at a little distance the motion of a bird appears so slow that the eye will endure a degree of improbability in the representation of it  i have only to add that this magnificent piece of water suffers little change in appearance from seasons but preserves the dignity of it is character under all circumstances seldom depressed and as seldom raised above it is ordinary level  even in the most violent rains when the country is drenched in water when every rill is swelled into a river and the mountains pour down floods through new channels the lake maintains the same equal temper and tho it may spread a few yards over it is lowest shores which is the utmost it does yet it is increase is seldom the object of observation nor does the severity of the greatest drought make any considerable alteration in it is bounds once it is recorded it rose seven feet in perpendicular height it is boundaries would then certainly appear enlarged but this was a very uncommon case  but if it be not raised by rains it is often greatly agitated by winds of all the lakes of this country none lies so exposed through the whole length of it to sudden squalls as this nor does any piece of fresh water in the whole island perhaps emulate the grandeur of a disturbed ocean so much it is of course navigated with great caution whenever there is a tendency to stormy weather many accidents have shown the necessity of this caution but one made such an impression on the country as a century cannot efface several people in the neighborhood of bowness having been attending a fair at hawkshed a town on the other side of the lake had embarked in the evening on their return home but before this little voyage could be performed so violent a storm arose that their boats foundered and no fewer than fortyseven persons perished this account is taken from dr bourns hist of westmoreland it is probable these people might all have perished together in the ferry boat   sect xii from ambleside we proposed to set out for keswick being obliged for want of time to leave one scene behind us which we wished much to visit  that of furnessabbey but the loss was in a great measure made up and our curiosity satisfied by the accounts and drawings of mr john smith this artist has had a principal hand in etching the drawings which accompany these observations  an ingenious young painter who had been studying the ruins on the spot  furnessabbey lies about twenty miles from ambleside beyond those mountains which range on the western side of windermere it is situated in a beautiful valley in the midst of a wide open cultivated country which rises every where in large swells but is no where diversified by any objects of picturesque beauty in so inanimate a scene we are surprised to find a valley of so different a structure adorned with rock and wood through which winds a rapid stream  at the entrance of this scene stands the village of dalton from whence the valley winding about four miles in one large sweeping narrow curve opens on a rich view of cartmelbay  about a mile within the valley in the widest part stands the abbey it seems to have been constructed in a good style of gothic architecture and has suffered from the hand of time only such depredations as picturesque beauty requires the entire plan of the abbeychurch and a large fragment of it still remain the tower in the center which seems never to have been lofty is perforated with large arches at the end of the western aile stand the ruins of a low simple tower where the bells of the abbey are supposed to have hung and from the south aile projects a building which is called the chapter house the cloisters are continued in the same direction one wall of which and all the internal structure are gone at the end of the cloisters arises a very rich and picturesque fragment which is called the school  round the whole runs an irregular wall which crossing the valley in two places and mounting it is sides makes a circuit of about two miles in many parts it is hid with trees or shrubs in some parts where it is discovered it is beautiful and in very few disgusting  in this wall are two gates one to the north and the other to the west which seem to have been the only outlets of the place that to the north has been the great entrance the other has more the appearance of a postern with a porters lodge  the proprietor of this noble scene is lord george cavendish who is a faithful guardian of it and i am informed takes care to prevent any further depredations  from ambleside we set out for keswick which is about eighteen miles farther north  we were now about to enter the middle and most formidable part of that vast chain of mountains which i have before mentioned as the barrier between cumberland and westmoreland and which promised from a distant view to present us with a great variety of very grand scenery our mornings voyage on the smooth expanse of the lake aided our present expedition with all the powers of contrast  but before we enter these majestic scenes it may be necessary to premise a distinction between a scene of mountains and a mountain scene  mountainous countries most commonly present only the former the objects are grand but they are huddled together confused without connection and the painter considers them only as studies and forms them into pictures by imaginary combinations  we sometimes however see a mountainous country in which nature itself has made these beautiful combinations  where one part relates to another and the effect of a whole is produced this is what i call a mountain scene  of this latter kind is almost the whole road between ambleside and keswick the mountains are naturally combined into scenes which if not in all parts purely picturesque are in all parts marked with the great lines of composition tho often on too wide a scale for imitation  the first object of our attention on leaving ambleside was rydalhall the seat of sir michael le fleming it stands on a rising lawn on the north and east it is sheltered by lofty mountains in front toward the south it commands a noble distance consisting of the extensive vale of windermere bounded by the lake the mountain on the north called rydalcragg rising close behind the house is high and rocky that on the east is of inferior size but is covered with wood between these mountains runs a narrow wooded valley through which a considerable stream falling down a quick descent along a rocky channel forms a succession of cascades  one of these tho but a miniature is so beautiful both in itself and in it is accompaniments as to deserve particular notice  it is seen from a summer house before which it is rocky cheeks circling on each side form a little area appearing through the window like a picture in a frame the water falls within a few yards of the eye which being rather above it is level has a long perspective view of the stream as it hurries from the higher grounds tumbling in various little breaks through it is rocky channel darkened with thicket till it arrive at the edge of the precipice before the window from whence it rushes into the basin which is formed by nature in the native rock the dark color of the stone taking still a deeper tinge from the wood which hangs over it sets off to wonderful advantage the sparkling luster of the stream and produces an uncommon effect of light it is this effect indeed from which the chief beauty of the scene arises in every representation truly picturesque the shade should greatly overbalance the light the face of nature under the glow of noon has rarely this beautiful appearance the artist therefore generally courts her charms in a morning or an evening hour when the shadows are deep and extended and when the sloping sunbeam affords rather a catching than a glaring light in this little exhibition we had an admirable idea of the magical effect of light picturesquely distributed  on leaving rydal we entered a vast chasm between two mountains which may properly be called a portal to the scenes we approached  on passing it we were presented with a grand scene of mountains adorned by a lake called rydalwater on the left not indeed adequate to the greatness of the surrounding objects but of such beauty as immediately to fix the eye in the midst of it is a rocky island covered with wood the little river rotha winding round a promontory enters it on the north  leaving these scenes we ascended a very steep hill from the summit of which was displayed a prospect of desolation in a very dignified form it was an amphitheatre of craggy mountains which appeared to sweep round a circumference of at least thirty miles tho in fact perhaps it did not include half that space but great objects naturally form a wide scale of mensuration  the soul involuntarily shuddered at the first aspect of such a scene  at the distant part of it lay grasmerlake which being so far removed from the eye seemed only a bright spot at the bottom of the mountains  to this lake the road directly led a nearer approach presented us with some beautiful views on it is banks tho on the whole it is principal merit consisted in refreshing the eye with a smooth expanse of water in the midst of such a variety of rough mountainscenery as we skirted it is limits it seemed larger than that of rydal and tho it appeared like a spot at a distance became now the principal feature of this vast vale  from hence the road led us into another amphitheatre wild and immense like the former but varied greatly in the shapes of the mountains which were here more broken and irregular shooting in many places into craggy summits and broken points  and yet even these wild scenes covered as they are with craggs and scarce furnishing the least tint of vegetation are subject to rights for which none but the hard inhabitant would think it worth his while to contend you see every where their bare and barren sides marked with partitionwalls  stones without mortar laid upon each other crossing at right angles and running down steeps and along precipices where the eye can scarce conceive they could have any foundation all these partitions of desolation as they may be called have their inhabitants each maintaining a few stunted sheep which picking the meagre tufts of grass which grow under the sheltered sides of craggs and stones earn like their owners a hard subsistence  at the conclusion of this immense amphitheatre into which we last entered we found an exit equal to the scene  another grand mountaingap or portal through which the road carried us up another steep mountain  at the top we paused and looking back on the scenes we had left were presented with a view which wholly filled the imagination  it was a retrospect of the amphitheatre we had passed but in a style still grander than the prospect of it it was more strongly marked with the great outlines of composition and was of course more a whole  a wide vale thrown by perspective into a circular form lay before the eye here also the distant part seemed occupied by the lake of grasmer but a greyish mist left the idea ambiguous beyond the lake arose various mountains which bounded it and still beyond these appeared the blue heads of other mountains those which formed the sidescreens of the vale advancing forward from the distant mountains beyond the lake approached the eye in a grand sweep by the easy gradations of perspective the promontories and recesses of the more removed parts were marked by a faint shadow till by degrees both the sidescreens growing boldly on the eye were lost behind the two cheeks of the craggy portal which with the road between them formed a foreground equal to the scene the whole view is entirely of the horrid kind not a tree appeared to add the least cheerfulness to it  with regard to the adorning of such a scene with figures nothing could suit it better than a group of banditti of all the scenes i ever saw this was the most adapted to the perpetration of some dreadful deed the imagination can hardly avoid conceiving a band of robbers lurking under the shelter of some projecting rock and expecting the traveller as he approaches along the valley below  nothing however of this kind was ever heard of in the country the depredations of foxes are the only depredations to which the cottages in these valleys are exposed our postilion pointed to a rugged part on the summit of a rocky mountain on the left which he told us was the great harbor of these animals here they bred from hence they infested the country and to this inaccessible asylum they retreated in the hour of alarm  after we left the two amphitheatres just described we met with nothing very interesting till we came to the celebrated pass known by the name of dunmailraise which divides the counties of cumberland and westmoreland  the history of this rude monument which consists of a monstrous pile of stones heaped on each side of an earthen mound is little known it was probably intended to mark a division not between those two northern counties but rather between the two kingdoms of england and scotland in elder times when the scottish border extended beyond it is present bounds and indeed this chain of mountains seems to be a much more natural division of the two kingdoms in this part than a little river in a champaign country like the esk which now divides them it is said this division was made by a saxon prince on the death of dunmail the last king of cumberland who was here slain in battle  but for whatever purpose this rude pile was fabricated it has yet suffered little change in it is dimensions and is one of those monuments of antiquity which may be characterized by the scriptural phrase of remaining to this very day  the entrance there are three passages over this chain of mountains into cumberland this by ambleside is the wildest and most picturesque a second by brough over stainmore is dreary rather than wild and a third by shap is both into cumberland presents us with a scene very strongly marked with the sublime grander tho less picturesque than the amphitheatre we had passed it is a vista of mountains pursuing each other if i may so phrase it through an easy descent of not less than six or seven miles and closed at the distant end by wyburnlake a considerable piece of water  this scene is great in all it is parts and in it is general composition the mountains of which the sidescreens of this vista are formed fall generally in easy lines and range at the distance of a mile and a half or two miles from each other but it is difficult to ascertain a distance of this kind for as the mntain rises gradually from it is base we cnot easily fix where it begins it is enough to observe that through the whole immensity of the view before us there appeared no disproportion  among the mountains which compose this magnificent scene there is one on the right of superior grandeur stretching near a league and a half in one vast concave ridge this mountain is known by the name of helvellin with which three mountains only through this vast region dispute the point of altitude  crossfell  grasmer  and skiddaw the inhabitants of it is invirons give it universally for helvellin but i believe it is no where else treated with such respect  besides the general grandeur of this view there is a wonderful variety in the shapes of the several mountains which compose it natures vistas are never formed by rule and compass whenever she deviates toward a regular shape she does it with that negligent air of greatness which marks sublimity of genius no attention to trifles characterizes her scenes her very regularities discover those strong touches of contrast that range of imagination which destroys every idea of sameness  of all the rude scenery we had yet visited none equalled this in desolation the whole is one immensity of barrenness the mountains are universally overspread with craggs and stones which are sometimes scattered carelessly over their surfaces and sometimes appear shivering in cascades of crumbling fragments down their sides helvellin through all it is space is one entire pavement nor is the view disfigured by the abundance of this more ordinary species of rock see page  0   in it is vastness the parts coalesce and become a whole  the fractured rock so beautiful in itself is calculated rather for smaller pictures here it would be lost  these vast regions whose parts are thus absorbed in the immensity of a whole have the strongest effect on the imagination they distend the mind and fix it in a kind of stupor  these lonely regions where retired from little scenes of art great nature dwells in awful solitude    we now approached the lake of wyburn or thirlmer as it is sometimes called an object every way suited to the ideas of desolation which surround it no tufted verdure graces it is banks nor hanging woods throw rich reflections on it is surface but every form which it suggests is savage and desolate it is about two miles in length and half as much in breadth surrounded by barren mountains and precipices shelving into it in all directions  a joyless coast around a stormy lake  and to impress still more the characteristic idea of the place the road hanging over it ran along the edge of a precipice  one peculiar feature also belongs to it about the middle of the lake the shores on each side nearly uniting are joined by an alpine bridge i did not observe any picturesque beauty arising from this circumstance but rather a formality at least from the stand where i viewed it a communication however of this kind rather increases the romantic idea  beyond wyburnlake we deviated into a mere scene of mountains nature seemed to have aimed at some mode of composition which she had left unfinished but it was difficult to conceive what species of landscape she meant a valley or a woody recess a barren scene or a cultivated one there was a mixture of all  this miscellaneous passage however did not continue long it appeared only a short interruption of the grand vista from which we had deviated at the lake of wyburn and into which we now returned nature however seemed to have spent her force in her first effort which was greatly superior to the second  the thickets among these mountains and indeed many other parts of the country are frequented by the wildcat which mr pennant calls the british tiger and says it is the fiercest and most destructive beast we have he speaks of it as being three or four times as large as the common cat we saw one dead which had been hunted on the day we saw it and it seemed very little inferior if at all to the size he mentions  by this time we approached keswick and from the descent of castlehill at about two miles distance had an extensive view of the whole country around that celebrated scene of romantic beauty  before us lay a plain many leagues in circumference divided into two large portions each of which is floated by a lake derwentwater overspreads the nearer and bassenthwait the more distant surrounding the whole rises a vast circular chain of mountains and towering over them all on the eastern side of the isthmus stands the mountain of skiddaw we had heard too much of this mountain to meet it properly it has none of those bold projections and shaggy majesty about it which we expected to have seen in this king of mountains it is a tame inanimate object except at such a distance as smooths the imbossed work of all these rich fabrics and where it is double top makes it a distinguished object to mark and characterize a scene  but if the mountain disappointed us the scene over which it presided went beyond our imagination  this rich extensive view was aided when we saw it by all the powers or more properly the resplendency of light and shade the morning had been fine but in the afternoon the clouds began to gather threatening rain a heavy sky overspread the higher and middle regions of the air with all the solemnity of gloom dropping it is dark mantle to the skirts of the horizon just as we arrived at the brow of the hill with the scenery of the two lakes and their accompaniments before us the setting sun burst forth in a glow of splendour  if a common sunset often gives a beautiful appearance even to an ordinary landscape what must have been the effect of an uncommon one on such a landscape as this  a sunset not merely a flood of splendour but contrasted by the fullest depth of shade here we had the beauties of the little summer house scene on the most extensive scale the effect was astonishing the whole was a scene of glory  but a scene of glory painted by the hand of nature tho every part glowed with transcendent luster the whole was in nicest harmony but it was a transitory vision while we gazed it faded and in a few moments nothing was left but the great outlines  the grand composition of the scene we should have stood over it even thus in rapture if we had not just seen what a splendid addition it was capable of receiving  we have a grand picture from the pencil of a great master of the close of such an evening  as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds ascending while the north wind sleeps overspread heavens cheerful face the louring element scowls over the darkened landscape snow or shower if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his evening beam the fields revive the birds their notes renew and bleating herds attest their joy that hill and valley ring but miltons ideas i think in general are rather musical than picturesque we have the same picture by an inferior master tho a better colourist  thus all day long the full distended clouds indulge their genial stores  till in the western sky the downward sun looks out effulgent from amid the flush of broken clouds gay shifting to his beam the rapid radiance instantaneous strikes the illumined mountain through the forest streams glows on the lake and in a yellow mist spreads over the bright interminable plain here we have all the resplendency of light but not a sufficient balance of shade milton gives the balance in the other scale if thomson had introduced like milton the louring element scowling over his darkened landscape his resplendent tints would have had their full force and the effect had been complete  keswick is the first town we meet with on our entrance into cumberland and tho a place of no consequence is however much superior to ambleside between the two places there is a great resemblance keswick stands at the northpoint of derwentwater which is the very point that ambleside occupies on windermere but the situation of ambleside is more romantic as it stands more in the middle of that chain of mountains which separates the two counties at keswick the roughnesses of the country are wearing off for in a few miles beyond it this great barrier ends  here we resolved to fix our headquarters for a few days and from thence to visit such of the neighboring lakes and mountains as had been most recommended to our notice  keswick lake map of keswick lake  sect xiii on the  th of june we set out on horseback which i mention as it is the only conveyance the road will admit on an expedition into borrodale a wild country southwest of keswick our road led along the lake of derwent which was the first object we surveyed  but before we examined the particulars of this grand scene we took a general view of the whole from it is northern shore which is the only part unblockaded by mountains this is the isthmian part which joins the valley of derwentwater with that of bassenthwait it was easy from the higher grounds of this isthmus to obtain the station we desired  the lake of derwent or keswicklake as it is generally called is contained within a circumference of about ten miles presenting itself in a circular form tho in fact it is rather oblong it is area is interspersed with four or five islands three of which only are of consequence lords island vicars island and st herberts island but none of them is comparable to the island on windermere in point either of size or beauty  if a painter were desirous of studying the whole circumference of the lake from one station st herberts island is the spot he should choose from whence as from a center he might see it in rotation i have seen a set of drawings taken from this stand which were hung round a circular room and intended to give a general idea of the boundaries of the lake but as no representation could be given of the lake itself the idea was lost and the drawings made but an awkward appearance  lords island had it is name from being the place where once stood a pleasurehouse belonging to the unfortunate family of derwentwater which took it is title from this lake the ancient manorhouse stood on castlehill above keswick where the antiquarian traces also the vestiges of a roman fort but an heiress of derwentwater marrying into the family of the ratcliffs the familyseat was removed from keswick to dilston in northumberland  as the boundaries of this lake are more mountainous than those of windermere they of course afford more romantic scenery but tho the whole shore except the spot where we stood is incircled with mountains they rarely fall abruptly into the water which is girt almost round by a margin of meadow  on the western shores especially on the eastern the mountains approach nearer the water and in some parts fall perpendicularly into it but as we stood viewing the lake from it is northern shores all these marginal parts were lost and the mountains tho in fact they describe a circle of twenty miles which is double the circumference of the lake appeared universally to rise from the waters edge  along it is western shores on the right they rise smooth and uniform and are therefore rather lumpish the more removed part of this mountainline is elegant but in some parts it is disagreeably broken  on the eastern side the mountains are both grander and more picturesque the line is pleasing and is filled with that variety of objects brokenground  rocks  and wood which being well combined take from the heaviness of a mountain and give it an airy lightness  the frontscreen if we may so call a portion of a circular form is more formidable than either of the sides but it is line is less elegant than that of the easternscreen the fall of lodoar which adorns that part of the lake is an object of no consequence at the distance we now stood but in our intended ride we proposed to take a nearer view of it  of all the lakes in these romantic regions the lake we are now examining seems to be most generally admired it was once admirably characterized by an ingenious person the late mr avison organist of st nicolas at new castle upon tyne who on his first seeing it cried out here is beauty indeed  beauty lying in the lap of horror we do not often find a happier illustration nothing conveys an idea of beauty more strongly than the lake nor of horror than the mountains and the former lying in the lap of the latter expresses in a strong manner the mode of their combination the late dr brown who was a man of taste and had seen every part of this country singled out the scenery of this lake for it is peculiar beauty in a letter to lord lyttelton quoted above  and unquestionably it is in many places very sweetly romantic particularly along it is eastern and southern shores but to give it preeminence may be paying it perhaps as much too high a compliment as it would be too rigorous to make any but a few comparative objections  in the first place it is form which in appearance is circular is less interesting i think than the winding sweep of windermere and some other lakes which losing themselves in vast reaches behind some cape or promontory add to their other beauties the varieties of distance and perspective some people object to this as touching rather on the character of the river but does that injure it is beauty and yet i believe there are very few rivers which form such reaches as the lake of windermere  to the formality of it is shores may be added the formality of it is islands they are round regular and similar spots as they appear from most points of view formal in their situation as well as in their shape and of little advantage to the scene the islands of windermere are in themselves better shaped more varied and uniting together add a beauty and contrast to the whole  but among the greatest objections to this lake is the abrupt and broken line in several of the mountains which compose it is screens especially on the western and on part of the southern shore which is more remarkable than on any of the other lakes we have little of the easy sweep of a mountainline at least the eye is hurt with too many tops of mountains which injure the ideas of simplicity and grandeur great care therefore should be taken in selecting views of this lake if there is a littleness even amidst the grand ideas of the original what can we expect from representations on paper or canvas i have seen some views of this lake injudiciously chosen or taken on too extensive a scale in which the mountains appear like haycocks  i would be understood however to speak chiefly of the appearance which the lines of these mountains occasionally make when we change our point of view the mountainline changes also and may be beautiful in one point tho it is displeasing in another  having thus taken a view of the whole lake together from it is northern point we proceeded on our rout to borrodale skirting the eastern coast along the edge of the water the grand sidescreen on the left hung over us and we found it as beautifully romantic and pleasing to the imagination when it is rocks precipices and woods became a foreground as it appeared from the northern point of the lake when we examined it in a more removed point of view  nor do these rocky shores recommend themselves to us only as foregrounds we found them every where the happiest stations for obtaining the most picturesque views of the lake the inexperienced conductor showing you the lake carries you to some garish stand where the eye may range far and wide and such a view indeed is well calculated as we have just seen to obtain a general idea of the whole but he who is in quest of the picturesque scenes of the lake must travel along the rough sidescreens that adorn it and catch it is beauties as they arise in smaller portions  it is little bays and winding shores  it is deep recesses and hanging promontories  it is garnished rock and distant mountain these are in general the picturesque scenes which it affords  part of this mountain is known by the name of ladysrake from a tradition that a young lady of the derwentwater family in the time of some public disturbance escaped a pursuit by climbing a precipice which had been thought inaccessible  a romantic place seldom wants a romantic story to adorn it  detached from this continent of precipice if i may so speak stands a rocky hill known by the name of castellet under the beetling brow of this natural ruin we passed and as we viewed it upwards from it is base it seemed a fabric of such grandeur that alone it was sufficient to give dignity to any scene we were desired to take particular notice of it for a reason which shall afterward be mentioned  as we proceeded in our rout along the lake the road grew wilder and more romantic there is not an idea more tremendous than that of riding along the edge of a precipice unguarded by any parapet under impending rocks which threaten above while the surges of a flood or the whirlpools of a rapid river terrify below  many such roads there are in various parts of the world particularly among the mountains of norway and sweden where they are carried along precipices of such frightful height that the trees at the bottom assume the azure tint of distance and the cataracts which roar among them cannot even be heard unless the air be perfectly still these tremendous roads are often not only without rail or parapet of any kind but so narrow that travelers in opposite directions cannot pass unless one of them draw himself up close to the rock in some places where the precipice does not afford footing even for this narrow shelf or where it may have foundered a cleft pine is thrown across the chasm the appalled traveller arriving at the spot surveys it with dismay  return he dare not  for he knows what a variety of terrors he has already passed  yet if his foot slip or the plank on which he rests give way he will find his death and his grave together and never more be heard of  but here we had not even the miniature of these dreadful ideas at least on the side of the lake for in the steepest part we were scarce raised thirty or forty feet above the water  as we edged the precipices we every where saw fragments of rock and large stones scattered about which being loosened by frosts and rains had fallen from the cliffs above and show the traveller what dangers he has escaped  once we found ourselves in hands more capricious than the elements we rode along the edge of a precipice under a steep woody rock when some large stones came rolling from the top and rushing through the thickets above us bounded across the road and plunged into the lake at that instant we had made a pause to observe some part of the scenery and by half a dozen yards escaped mischief the wind was loud and we conceived the stones had been dislodged by it is violence but on riding a little further we discovered the real cause high above our heads at the summit of the cliff sat a group of mountaineer children amusing themselves with pushing stones from the top and watching as they plunged into the lake  of us they knew nothing who were screened from them by intervening thickets  as we approached the head of the lake we were desired to turn round and take a view of castellet that rocky hill which had appeared so enormous as we stood under it it had now shrunk into nothing in the midst of that scene of greatness which surrounded it i mention this circumstance as in these wild countries comparison is the only scale used in the mensuration of mountains at least it was the only scale to which we were ever referred in countries graced by a single mountain the inhabitants may be very accurate in their investigation of it is height the altitude and circumference of the wrekin i have no doubt is accurately known in shropshire but in a country like this where chain is linked to chain exactness would be endless  by this time we approached the head of the lake and could now distinguish the full sound of the fall of lodoar which had before reached our ears as the wind suffered indistinctly in broken notes  this waterfall is a noble object both in itself and as an ornament of the lake it appears more as an object connected with the lake as we approach by water by land we see it over a promontory of low ground which in some degree hides it is grandeur at the distance of a mile it begins to appear with dignity  but of whatever advantage the fall of lodoar may be as a piece of distant scenery it is effect is very noble when examined on the spot as a single object it wants no accompaniments of offskip which would rather injure than assist it they would disturb it is simplicity and repose the greatness of it is parts affords scenery enough some instruments please in concert others you wish to hear alone  the stream falls through a chasm between two towering perpendicular rocks the intermediate part broken into large fragments forms the rough bed of the cascade some of these fragments stretching out in shelves hold a depth of soil sufficient for large trees among these broken rocks the stream finds it is way through a fall of at least an hundred feet and in heavy rains the water is every way suited to the grandeur of the scene rocks and water in opposition can hardly produce a more animated strife the ground at the bottom also is very much broken and overgrown with trees and thickets amongst which the water is swallowed up into an abyss and at length finds it is way through deep channels into the lake we dismounted and got as near as we could but were not able to approach so near as to look into the woody chasm which receives the fall  having viewed this grand piece of natural ruin we proceeded in our rout toward the mountains of borrodale and shaping our course along the southern shores of the lake we came to the river derwent which is a little to the west of the lodoar  these two rivers the lodoar and the derwent furnish the chief supplies of derwentwater but those of the latter are much ampler the lodoar accordingly is lost in the lake while the derwent first giving it is name to it retains it is own to the sea    on passing this river and turning the first great promontory on our left we found ourselves in a vast recess of mountains we had seen them at a distance from the northern extremity of the lake they were then objects of grandeur but now they had assumed their full majestic form surrounding us on every side with their lofty barriers and shutting out in appearance every idea of an escape wild and various beyond conception were their shapes but they participated rather of the desolate than of the fantastic idea from the bottom of the lake indeed they formed too great a combination of pointed summits but here all these grotesque shapes disappeared the summits receded far behind and we only saw the bursting rocks and bold protuberances with which the sides of these enormous masses of solid earth are charged many of them are covered like the steeps of helvellin with a continued pavement of craggs  the winding of the derwent was the clue we followed in our passage through these regions of desolation an aperture between the mountains brought us into another wild recess where a similar scene opened diversified from the first only by some new forms or new position or varied furniture of the incumbent mountains  as we doubled one promontory another unfolded and we found ourselves not in what appeared at first a recess of mountains but in a narrow winding valley the scenes of which by quick transitions were continually shifting this valley so replete with hideous grandeur is known by the name of the straits of borrodale  in the middle of one of the recesses of the valley lies an enormous stone which is called in the country bootherstone massy rocks of immense size rent from mountains are every where found but this stone appears to be of a different kind it does not seem to have been the appendage of a mountain but itself an independent creation it lies in a sort of diagonal position overshadowing a space sufficient to shelter a troop of horse  not far from hence arises a woody hill called castellcragg which is also detached from the scenery around it on the summit of this hill stood formerly a fortress supposed to be of roman origin intended to guard this avenue into the country after it had been relinquished by the romans it was occupied by the saxons and after their day it was given with all the lands about borrodale by one of the lords of derwentwater to the monks of furness by these religious it was still maintained in it is military capacity which is perhaps a singular instance of the kind but as the scots in those days made frequent irruptions even thus far into the country and as the monks had great possessions to defend in the valley of borrodale where one of their principal magazines was established the holy fathers thought it proper to adopt this uncommon measure besides their tythecorn they amassed here the valuable minerals of the country among which salt produced from a spring in the valley was no inconsiderable article  we had now traveled three or four miles in this winding valley which as we advanced began to assume a softer form the hills became clothed with verdure and the little recesses of the valley shaded with wood these recesses also which were before shut up and confined by rocky barriers now opened in different shapes and many of them were pleasantly varied with wooded hillocs while the stony banks of the derwent began to change into meadows scanty indeed but affording pasturage for a few cattle and a pleasant tint of verdure as a contrast with the rocky scenery in it is neighborhood  we were now in that part of the valley which is properly called the valley of borrodale  a large circular recess consisting of much broken ground and except where the valley still pursues it is course surrounded by lofty mountains from which pour innumerable rills and torrents tho little interesting in the scene as objects of picturesque beauty  in this deep retreat lies the village of rosthwait having at all times little intercourse with the country but during half the year almost totally excluded from all human commerce  here the sons and daughters of simplicity enjoy health peace and contentment in the midst of what cityluxury would call the extreme of human necessity stealing their whole dominion from the waste repelling winterblasts with mud and straw their scanty patches of arable land and these cultivated with difficulty and their crops lateripening and often a prey to autumnal rains which are violent in this country just give them bread to eat their herds afford them milk and their flocks clothes the shepherd himself being often the manufacturer also no dye is necessary to tinge their wool it is naturally a russetbrown and sheep and shepherds are clothed alike both in the simple livery of nature  the procuring of fuel is among their greatest hardships in most parts of the world this article is sought either in pits or on the surface of the earth here the inhabitants are obliged to get it on the tops of mountains which abounding with mossy grounds seldom found in the valleys below supply them with peat the difficulty lies in conveying it from such immense heights in doing this they have recourse to a strange and dangerous expedient tho similar to the modes of conveyance which necessity dictates in other mountainous countries they make their peat into bundles and fasten it upon sledges on each of which a man sits and guides the machine with his foot down the precipice we saw many tracks along the sides of mountains made by these sledges several of which were four or five hundred feet high and appeared from the bottom almost perpendicular  after a long and fatiguing morning we refreshed ourselves at the village of rosthwait on eggs and milk and they who cannot be satisfied with such a meal in a mountainous country must carry their larder with them  sect xiv from rosthwait the valley pursues it is course toward the east and losing again it is milder features grows every step more wild and desolate after a march of two miles farther we came to the village of satterthwait still more entrenched in mountains than rosthwait itself here in the depth of winter the sun never shines as the spring advances his rays begin to shoot over the southern mountains and at high noon to tip the chimney tops of the village that radiant sign shows the cheerless winter to be now over and rouses the hardy peasant to the labors of the coming year  a little beyond this scene of desolation the derwent on whose banks we still continued rushes down a long declivity between two mountains at the fall of lodoar the higher level comes abruptly upon the lower here the two levels are united by a gradual descent the streams of course taking the same modes of precipitation as the land the lodoar forms a perpendicular fall and the derwent a declivous one but the fall of the derwent is more singular and is the only one of the kind perhaps in the country  and here i cannot help remarking the singular character of this mountainstream there is not perhaps a river in england which passes through such a variety of different scenes what wild romantic channel it shapes before it enter the vale of borrodale is to us unknown there first we commenced our acquaintance with it it is passage through that mountainchasm is marked with objects not only great in themselves but rarely to be found elsewhere in such interesting combinations  from a mountainstream it soon assumes a new character and changes into a lake where it displays the wonders we have just seen  from hence emerging it again becomes a river but soon forms the lake of bassenthwait of form and dimensions very different from that of keswick  contracting itself again into a river it puts on a character entirely new hitherto it has adorned only the wild rough scenes of nature all these it now relinquishes  rocks  lakes  and mountains and enters a sweet delightful country where all it is accompaniments are soft and lovely among other places it visits the noble and picturesque ruins of cockermouthcastle under the walls of which it glides  from hence it passes to the sea which many streams of greater consequence never meet under their own names but are absorbed by larger rivers while the derwent after all the astonishing scenes it has adorned adds to it is other beauties those of an estuary  in this last part of it is course it visits workingtonhall one of the grandest and most beautiful situations of the country besides it is hanging woods and sloping lawns it is remarkable for having been the first prisonhouse of the unfortunate mary of scotland after she had landed within the dominions of her rival here the derwent becomes navigable and forms the best natural harbor in cumberland  i have often thought that if a person wished particularly to amuse himself with picturesque scenes the best method he could take would be to place before him a good map of england and to settle in his head the course of all the chief rivers of the country these rivers should be the great directing lines of his excursions on their banks he would be sure not only to find the most beautiful views but would also obtain a complete system of every kind of landscape he would have no occasion to keep so close to the river he pursued as not to deviate a little for the sake of a beautiful scene castles and abbeys this plan would almost universally comprehend for most of them are seated either on rocks or knolls projecting into rivers or in some sweet valley which opens to them bridges of course it would include which make a pleasing species of scenery mountains and lakes i need not mention the former produce rivers and the latter are produced by them it would also include seacoast views many of which are very interesting when the estuary opens to some beautiful winding shore with views of distant country  i once attempted to analyze the thames in this way but i was obliged to divide so magnificent a subject indeed it naturally divided itself into three parts  from oxford to windsor  from windsor to london  and from london to the sea an imperial river like the thames must be navigated at least it is two lower divisions but inferior rivers are best examined by an excursion along their banks  we left the derwent in it is declivous course between two mountains one of them under whose shadow the torrent pours is called eaglescragg as it is tremendous rocks are the chief habitation of these birds and seem to be considered by them as a sort of castle which from time immemorial they have possessed it is a common species of traffic in this country to supply the curious with young eagles in the taking of which the inhabitants are very expert they observe the nests from the bottom and judging of the age of the young birds they catch the opportunity when the old eagles are abroad and let themselves down by ropes from the summits of the cliffs we saw one which had been just taken it was only six weeks old and was nearly of the size of a turkeyhen it seemed to have acquired already a full share of ferocity and screamed violently if we offered to touch it  many large birds we saw amongst these mountains sailing about the air which we imagined to be eagles but one of our company being a naturalist bad us observe their tail feathers if their tails were forked they were of the buzzard species the tail of the eagle is circular  among the anecdotes we heard in this country of eagles one was rather curious  an eagle was seen at a distance to pounce it is prey which it carried in a perpendicular ascent aloft into the air and hanging dubious for some time it was at length observed to descend in the same direct line and it is fall as it approached seemed attended with an odd tumbling motion the cause was soon discovered it fell stone dead on the ground and a weasel which it had carried up and which had had the address to kill it is adversary in the air being now at liberty ran away  we had accompanied the valley of borrodale as far to the east as eaglescragg it stretches also to the west tho in a more broken and abrupt form  somewhat further on this side than eaglescragg lies on the other rise those mountains where the celebrated blacklead mine is wrought i could not help feeling a friendly attachment to this place which every lover of the pencil must feel as deriving from this mineral one of the best instruments of his art the freest and readiest expositor of his ideas we saw the site of the mine at a distance marked with a dingy yellow stain from the ochery mixtures thrown from it is mouth which shiver down the sides of the mountain  during the periodical season of working it for it is opened only once in seven years many people pick up a comfortable subsistence from the scraps of blacklead which escape amongst the coarser strata these are honest gains but a late prolific genius in fraud took a very indirect method of possessing a share of this rich mineral a part of the mountain contiguous to the mine was his property here at the expense of great labor he sank a shaft which he carried diagonally till he entered the mine where with subterraneous wickedness he continued his depredations for some time undiscovered at length his fraud was brought to light and he was tried at carlisle the peculiarity of his case had no precedent he saved his life but a law was obtained by the proprietors of the mine to defend their property from such indirect attacks for the future  the sun was now declining and it was too late to take a nearer view of the mine nor indeed did it promise more on the spot than it discovered at a distance besides the beauties of watenlath had been so strongly represented to us that we were resolved to go in quest of those scenes in preference to any other  watenlath is that tract of mountainous country itself surrounded by mountains still higher which coming boldly forward breaks down abruptly from the south upon the vale of keswick the stream which forms the fall of lodoar adorns first the scenes of watenlath  which way to watenlath said one of our company to a peasant as we left the vale of borrodale that way said he pointing up a lofty mountain steeper than the tiling of a house  to those who are accustomed to mountains these perpendicular motions may be amusing but to us whose ideas were less elevated they seemed rather peculiar and yet there is something unmanly in conceiving a difficulty in traversing a path which we were told the women of the country would ascend on horseback with their panniers of eggs and butter and return in the night to move upwards keeping a steady eye on the objects before us was no great exercise to the brain but it rather gave it a rotation to look back on what was past  and to see our companions below clinging as it appeared to the mountains side and the rising breasts and bellies of their horses straining up a path so steep that it seemed as if the least false step would have carried them rolling many hundred yards to the bottom  we had another apprehension that of mistaking our way if a mist had suddenly overspread the mountain which is a very common incident we might have wandered all night for we had not the precaution to take a guide the question we asked of the peasant at the bottom of the mountain which way to watenlath we found was a very improper one we should have asked in what direction we were to seek it for way there was none except here and there a blind path which being itself often bewildered of course served only to bewilder us the inhabitants pay little attention to paths they steer along these wilds by landmarks which to us were unknown  at length however after a painful perpendicular march of near two miles and many a breathing pause which our horses required we gained the top here we expected at least to be rewarded by an amusing prospect over the neighboring country but in this too we were disappointed we found ourselves in the midst of a bog with still higher grounds around us so that after all our toil we had a view only of a vile circumscribed waste  it was our business now to get out of this unpleasant scene as soon as we could which was a matter of no great difficulty an easy and short descent on the other side of the mountain brought us quickly to watenlath here our labors were amply rewarded we fell into a piece of scenery which for beauty and grandeur was equal if not superior to any thing we had yet seen  the first object we found was a small lake about two miles in circumference through which flows the lodoar and after a course of three miles farther forms that noble cascade which we had seen in the morning at the head of derwentwater  the accompaniments of this river from the lake of watenlath to it is fall make the scenery of which we came hither in quest  it is a valley so contracted that it affords room for little more than the river and a path at the bottom while the mountains on each side are so perpendicular that their summits are scarce more asunder than their bases it was a new idea many mountains we had seen hanging over the sides of valleys but to be immured through a space of almost three miles within a chasm of rifted rocks for that was in fact the idea presented by the scene before us was a novel circumstance tho we had now been two or three days the inhabitants of mountains  the form of this valley was very different from the valley of borrodale the one led us through a winding rout the other is nearly a vista each has it is mode of grandeur the valley of borrodale has more variety but this is certainly the more majestic scene the whole is only one vast effort in point of immensity indeed it yields to the vista at the entrance into cumberland it is not so vast a whole but being contracted within a smaller compass we examine it is limits with more ease and with regard to the grandeur and variety of the several objects it loses nothing as we stood under the beetling cliffs on each side they were too near for inspection their harsh features wanted softening but we had noble views of them all in order both in prospect and retrospect not only the design and composition but the very strokes of natures pencil might be traced through the whole scene every fractured rock and every hanging shrub which adorned it was brought within the compass of the eye each touch so careless and yet so determined so wildly irregular and yet all conducing to one whole  when we arrived at the close of the valley the grandeur of the scene increased it opened into an amphitheatre the area of which like the valley that led to it was contracted scarce containing the circumference of a mile but the mountains which environed it were grand and beautiful  in most of the scenes we had passed we were obliged to look for contrast in the different modes of desolation but here barrenness was contrasted with all the tints of vegetation the mountains in front and on the left were covered with wood which mantled from the top to the bottom those on the right were barren yet broken so variously as even in themselves to make a contrast we admire the ruins of a roman amphitheatre but what are the most magnificent of the works of art compared with such an amphitheatre as this were the colosseum itself brought hither and placed within this area the grandeur of the idea would be lost and the ruin magnificent as it is would dwindle into the ornament of a scene  at the entrance of the amphitheatre another bright mountaintorrent joins the lodoar from the east and forms it into a more considerable stream with increased velocity the ground growing every step more declivous it now pours along with great rapidity and throwing itself into the thickest of the woods which close the scene disappears the imagination pursues it is progress it is roar is heard through the woods and it is plain from the sound that it suffers some great convulsion but all is close impervious rocks and thickets intervene and totally exclude the sight  we indeed had been behind the scenes and knew we were at that instant upon the summit of the fall of lodoar but the imagination of a stranger would be held in stimulating suspense the grandeur of the sound would proclaim the dignity of the fall and his eye would wish to participate of what his ear alone could inadequately judge  tho we had seen the fall of lodoar from the bottom we had a curiosity to see how it appeared from the top and dismounting we contrived by winding round the thickets and clinging to the projections of the rocks to get a dangerous peep down the abyss there was nothing picturesque in the view but something immensely grand we stood now above those two cheeks of the chasm through which the water forced it is way and which in the morning when seen from the bottom appeared towering to a great height and were the most interesting parts of the view but amidst the greatness of the objects which now surrounded them they were totally lost appearing less than warts upon those vast limbs of nature to which they adhered  in our passage through the valley of watenlath we met with many fragments of rocks in which the several component strata were very strongly marked in some they could not have been more regularly formed by a rule and chissel and in a few whose softer lamina the weather had decayed as perfect cornices remained as art could have produced  having taken a view of all this scenery and the evening beginning now to close we thought it time to put a stop to our curiosity and return to keswick from which we were about four miles distant in the morning we rode alone the edge of the lake but as we were now upon the higher grounds we were obliged to make a compass round the mountains  these desolate grounds are very little inhabited we heard of a design to introduce goats among them with a view to make keswick as celebrated for drinking goatswhey as several of the mountainous parts of scotland in some places indeed where there are valuable woods the goat might be a pernicious inmate but in many places as we rode the bare and craggy sides of hills seemed capable of feeding nothing else frequent little plots of herbage grow every where among the rocks inaccessible to any other animal even sheep on many of these sloping shelves could find no footing all this pasturage therefore is lost for want of goats to brouze it  in a picturesque light no ornament is more adapted to a mountainous and rocky country than these animals their colors are beautiful in those particularly of a darker hue often playing into each other with great harmony but among these animals as among all others the pied are the most unpleasing in which opposite colors come full upon each other without any intervening tint  the shagginess of the goat also is as beautiful as the colors which adorn him his hair depending in that easy flow which the pencil wishes to imitate  his actions are still more pleasing it would add new terror to a scene to see an animal brouzing on the steep of a perpendicular rock or hanging on the very edge of a projecting precipice virgil seems to have looked at these attitudes of terror with delight  ite capellae non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo   sect xv in our rout to borrodale we passed through the eastern and southem parts of that mountainous country which bounds the lake of derwent  in our next expedition we proposed to view the western  from keswick we mounted the hills on the northwest of the lake and on the other side fell into the valley of newlands which we traversed from end to end it was a lovely scene totally different from the rude valleys we had yet met with the mountains in general on this side of the lake wear a smoother form than those either on the east or on the south of this smoothness of feature in the higher grounds the lower participate the mountain valleys we had hitherto seen were wild rocky and desolate but here the idea of terror was excluded the valley of newlands was even adorned with the beauties of luxuriant nature we traveled through groves which were sometimes open and sometimes close with a sparkling stream the common attendant of these valleys accompanying us through the whole scene  having been amused with this sweet scenery about three miles we entered another valley or rather a mountain recess called the valley of gascadale i call it a recess because it is soon terminated by a mountain running athwart which denies any further passage instead therefore of entering gascadale we were obliged to climb the hill which forms one of it is sides and from the summit we had a view not only of gascadale but of many other mountain recesses all which participate more or less of the smoothness of the high grounds in their neighborhood some of them were scooped and hollowed into very beautiful forms in which wood alone was wanting  the valley of gascadale had nothing to recommend it but novelty it was a scene wholly new in this rugged country a deep mountain recess environed on every side except the entrance by smooth sloping hills which are adorned neither with wood nor rock nor broken ground but sweep down from side to side with the greatest regularity we scarce remembered to have seen in any place an operation of nature more completely formal at the head of this recess is a grand cascade we supposed it to be no great object of beauty as it was probably void of all accompaniments but it is poverty was hid beneath a veil the clouds which were gathering upon the mountains and sweeping along the valleys began to intercept our view every thing was wrapped in obscurity when we stood even on the summit of the cascade we could only hear the torrent roar but could not obtain the least glimpse of it tho no object intervened the whole valley of gascadale smoaked like a boiling caldron and we got our ideas of it only by catches as the volumes of clouds dispersed at intervals into purer air  but what we lost in one respect by the grossness of the atmosphere we gained in another tho it is probable some views were obscured which might have pleased as it is equally probable that many of those disgusting features with which we might have been presented were softened and rendered more agreeable to the eye  here indeed the misty hue was in general laid on with too full a pencil the face of nature was rather blotted out than obscured the whole view was in that state which thomson so well describes  no more the mountain fills the eye with great variety but in a night of gathering vapor from the baffled sense sinks dark and dreary thence expanding wide the huge dusk gradual swallows up the plain vanish the woods the dim seen river seems sullen and slow to roll the misty wave   among the beautiful appearances of fogs and mists their gradually going off may be observed a landscape takes a variety of pleasing hues as it passes in a retiring fog through the different modes of obscurity into full splendour  there is great beauty also in a fogs partially clearing up at once as it often does and presenting some distant piece of landscape under great radiance when all the surrounding parts are still in obscurity the curtain is not entirely drawn up it is only just raised to let in some beautiful transient view and perhaps falling again while we admire leaves us that ardent relish which we have for pleasing objects suddenly removed  some very beautiful ideas of this kind were displayed on the summits of gascadale tho the mountains around us and the contracted valleys in our neighborhood were all so much absorbed in the dark atmosphere of clouds and vapors we could discover in catches through their thinner skirts the vale of keswick at a distance overspread with serenity and sunshine  the mountain over which we passed is called in the language of the country a hawse or stoppage in passing from one district to another the valley being closed and no other way left this hawse tho not so steep as the mountain which led us to watenlath was of much longer continuance and in some parts carried us very near the edges of precipices but surrounded by fogs we kept the path before us and if there was danger we seldom saw it  as we began to descend we breathed a purer air and got a sight of the landscape before us it was a scene unlike what we had just passed but only as the botanist speaks a variety of the same genus corresponding entirely with the character of the country which we now traversed three broad mountains sloping into each other formed a tripartite valley centering in one point the surface of each mountain was smooth to it is very summit except that here and there a few large stones lay scattered about some of them fixed in the soil but none of them deserving the appellation of a rock through two of the divisions of this valley ran different streams each of them as unfringed and simple as the mountains they severed these streams uniting in the center formed a third the whole was a peculiar and novel scene but neither interesting nor picturesque  these smoothcoated mountains tho of little estimation in the painters eye are however great sources of plenty they are the nurseries of sheep which are bred here and fatted in the valleys  but the life of a shepherd in this country is not an arcadian life his occupation subjects him to many difficulties in the winter especially when he is often obliged to attend his flock on the bleak side of a mountain which engages him in many a painful vigil and when the mountains are covered with snow which is frequently the case his employment becomes then a dangerous one it seldom happens but that some part of his flock is snowed up and in preserving their lives he must often expose his own  after winding about two miles along the edge of one of these smooth mountains we dropped at once into a beautiful vale called the vale of butermer the bottom of which was adorned by a lake of the same name  this lake is small about a mile and a half in length and half a mile in breadth of an oblong form sweeping at one end round a woody promontory but this sweep is rather forced and from some points makes too acute an angle it is one of those lines which would have a better effect from a boat see page     a lower point would soften it is abruptness in other parts also the lines of this lake are rather too square the scenery however about it is grand and beautiful  on the western side a long range of mountainous declivity extends from end to end falling every where precipitately into the water at least it had that appearance to the eye tho on the spot probably a margin of meadow might shoot from the bottom of the mountain as we observed at keswick of the line which the summit of this mountain formed we could not easily judge as it was in a great measure hid in clouds  the eastern side of the lake is woody and contrasts happily with the western but the wood is of that kind which is periodically cut down and was not in perfection when we saw it  near the bottom of this lake is the loftiest cascade we had ever seen it hardly i think falls through a less descent than three or four hundred yards but it is an object of no beauty it is barren of accompaniments and appears at a distance like a white ribbon bisecting the mountain the people of the country alluding to the whiteness of it is foam call it sourmilkforce  the vale of butermer is rather confined in that part which the lake occupies below it extends a considerable way but our rout led us first above in quest of some rocky mountains which are supposed to be the highest precipices in the country these scenes which are known by the name of gatesgarthdale open at the head of the lake  here we found two valleys formed by a mountain on each side and one in the middle the right hand valley was soon closed by a hawse that on the left led directly to the scenes we sought  the transition here contrary to the usual process of nature is abrupt we had been traveling all the morning among mountains perfectly smooth and covered with herbage and now found ourselves suddenly among craggs and rocks and precipices as wild and hideous as any we had seen  gatesgarthdale into which we soon entered is indeed a very tremendous scene like all the valleys we had yet found it had a peculiar character it is features were it is own it was not a vista like the valley of watenlath nor had it any of the sudden turns of the valley of borrodale but it wound slowly and solemnly in one large segment it was wider also than either of those valleys being at least half a quarter of a mile from side to side which distance it pretty uniformly observed the rocky mountains which environed it keeping their line with great exactness at least never breaking out into any violent projections  the area of this valley is in general concave the sides almost perpendicular composed of a kind of broken craggy rock the ruins of which every where strew the valley and give it still more the idea of desolation    the river also which runs through it and is the principal supply of the lake is as wild as the valley itself it has no banks but the fragments of rocks no bed but a channel composed of rocky strata among which the water forces it is course it is channel as well as it is bank is formed of loose stones and fragments which break and divide the stream into a succession of wild impetuous eddies  a stream which is the natural source of plenty is perhaps when unaccompanied with verdure the strongest emblem of desolation it shows the spot to be so barren that even the greatest source of abundance can produce nothing the whole valley indeed joined in impressing the same idea fruitful nature making in every part of her ample range unremitting efforts to vegetate could not here produce a single germin  as we proceeded the grandeur of the valley increased we had been prepared indeed to see the highest precipices which the country produced such a preface is generally productive of disappointment but on this occasion it did no injury the fancy had still it is scope we found the mountains so overhung with clouds that we could form little judgment of their height our guide told us they were twice as high as we could see which however we did not believe from the observations we were able to make as the clouds at intervals floated past and discovered here and there the shadowy forms of the rocky summits a great height however they certaily were and the darkness in which they were wrapped gave us a new illustration of the grandeur of those ideas which arise from obscurity dark confused uncertain images mr burk very justly observes have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander passions than those which are more clear and determinate for hardly any thing can strike the mind with it is greatness which does not make some sort of approach toward infinity which nothing can do whilst we are able to perceive it is bounds but to see an object distinctly and to perceive it is bounds is one and the same thing a clear idea therefore is another name for a little idea on the sublime and beautiful part ii sect iv   the middle of the valley is adorned as these valleys in some part often are by a craggy hill on the top of which stands the fragment of a rock that looks in ossians language like the stone of power  the rude deity of desolation to which the scene is sacred  this valley is not more than six miles from the blacklead mines and would have led us to them if we had pursued it is course  having traveled about three miles in this dreary scene and having taken such a view as we could obtain of the bold enclosures which contained it we returned by the same rout we came threading the valley and skirting the lake along it is eastern coast till we arrived at the bottom of it here we fell into a country very different from that we had left  the vale of butermer which extends many miles below the lake is a wide variegated scene full of rising and falling ground woody in many parts well inhabited in some fruitful and luxuriant in all  here we found a village where we made a luxurious repast as usual on eggs and milk and met in the cheerful and healthy looks of the inhabitants new proofs of the narrow limits in which all the real wants of life are comprised  end of the first volume
