a short historical account of the several kinds of worms breeding in human bodies extracted from the writings of the most eminent authors  with a particular description of their symptoms and the most approved remedies for their expulsion  by m m  london printed by b mills and sold by j baker and t warner at the blackboy in paternoster row       a short historical account of the several kinds of worms breeding in human bodies etc chap i of the breeding of worms in human bodies that our bodies should become the prey of worms when they are returning to their original dust might be submitted to without regret but to be seized on before that time and even upon our very entrance on life that infant innocence should sustain the fate of the profane prometheus in having their tender bowels corroded by these intestine vultures is a condition exceedingly deplorable and yet so very frequent that it is almost always suspected in children on every disorder and not unjustly since as platerus observes few persons are free from worms and experience verifies the observation in the dissection of dead bodies  hippocrates has assured us that unborn infants are invaded by them and dolaeus in dissecting an infant which died as soon as born tells us he found a cluster of worms in its bowels  the physicians and philosophers of former ages had a very short and easy way of accounting for the generation of insects by supposing them bred of themselves out of some putrefying matter by the assistance of heat or motion  but this account is now justly rejected as extremely absurd and unreasonable by those who have been the least acquainted with the great and surprising discoveries of the modern philosophers who by the assistance of microscopes an advantage unknown to former ages have found that the minutest insects are furnished with all the parts that are necessary not only for life but also for the propagation of their several kinds as perfect as in larger animals and consequently are not produced at random but are the regular offspring of parents of the same kind no less than others  it is observable that natures wise author has given such a propension to those creatures who cannot bring up their progeny to lay their eggs in places proper to breed them thus flies commonly drop theirs in dead bodies pustles ulcers etc because in such tender parts their eggs may lie easy and find warmth sufficient to hatch them and afterward humidity and food for the nourishment of the animal an instance of this is related by mr de la cross in his memoirs p      a dutch woman had her leg swollen and glandulous about a span from the knee the chyrurgion who had it in cure to know the cause of the disease took off this glandulous body to the bigness of a nail washed it in brandy cut it and perceived therein a great many little worms whereupon having consulted mr leeuwenhoeck he affirmed they were come from the eggs which a fly had lain in the mortified part as he proved in the following manner he put these worms into a box with a piece of raw beef which was soon consumed by them as well as the glandulous body wherein they were hatched he fed them three several times and five days after viz july    he found his box empty but having looked carefully about the room he recovered some of these worms that would eat no more and were already grown to the length of ones nail he put them on a paper covered with a large glass and the next day in the morning he observed one of these worms shortened but increased a third part in bulk so that it had something of the shape of a tun in the evening he perceived four others in the same posture which from white became red  aug    the cods of these worms were all black he opened one of them whence he took out a perfect fly that was yet wet and motionless he observed that besides the cod this insect was wrapped up in a very thin membrane he opened this untimely fly and found a great quantity of eggs in its body  aug    all the flies enclosed in the glass were hatched and at the same time he perceived other flies against the glasswindows of his chamber which he had supposed to have come from those worms which he had not retrieved in feeding these infects most part died or fled away so that sept   he had but two left that were probably male and female for they laid     eggs some of which he caused to be hatched in less than    hours by carrying them in his pocket shut up in a box  the learned baglivi physician at rome in a letter to mr andry at paris writes thus concerning the breeding of worms the beginning and original of all animals and vegetables is from an egg for what else are the seeds of plants but eggs in which all the rudiments of the future plant are contracted as it were into a short compendium and those by virtue of the fermentation of the nutritive juice by the elastick power of the air and the double warmth one of the sun and the other of the central warmth of the earth the great mother of all are uncovered by little and little and their fetters being as it were loosed they grow and arrive in due time to such a bulk as great as is allotted to every sort of plant by the laws of nature  if all philosophers and physicians think thus concerning vegetables much more must they think so of living creatures not only of those that are called perfect but of the imperfect also which are commonly called insects for besides that there is the same equal order in all things and that all come from one principle and after a certain general circuit end all in one again insects by an admirable connection and construction of parts and by a more noble exercise of vital operations do not only in no wise give place to plants but far excel them  wherefore since no man says that plants rise from putrefaction they ought not in reason to deduce the original of insects and other baser animals from thence for it is a shame to philosophers and physicians in this most happy age of sciences wherein the causes of things are illustrated by experiments and solid precepts of the mathematics to ascribe to the fortuitous chance of putrefaction that which the constant and perpetual law of nature remaining in its seeds rules and directs  for it is not putrefaction that produces imperfect living creatures but the heat and fermentation of the things putrefying that makes fruitful the seeds of things spread all over the world if i may be allowed so to speak or rather it stirs up and revives the imperceptible parts of the future living creature in the egg and as it were inspires em with the first life in the same manner with the heat of the sun or that of brooding hens  what we have said of insects in general may be aptly applied to the worms bred in human bodies seeing they are not generated by putrefying humors but the worms eggs lying hid in the intestines are enlivened and brought forth by the same means  chap ii of the several kinds of worms bred in human bodies these pernicious animals differ greatly not only among themselves as to shape and other circumstances but also in respect of the several parts of the body they possess and whence they receive their denomination  thus the cephalic breed in the head where they occasion violent pains distractions and sometimes contagious distempers sennertus mentions a person afflicted with an headache violent to distraction when after seven days continuance and the patient almost dead with the pain a worm came out of his right nostril above a span long after which he soon recovered  mr andry says he knew a man who being cured of a venereal disease complained afterward of an unsufferable pain in his head for which his skull was trepand and a little short worm was found upon the duramater which being taken out the patient recovered a persect health  such another case is related by forestus only the worm he speaks of was black  hildsheim tells of a person who voided thirteen long worms alive and woolly like a caterpiller from his nostrils ears and mouth  c gemma reports of a matron dying of a pestilential fever whose head being opened there appeared abundance of worms both in the substance of the brain and between the coverings and also swarms of insects like bugs  but the account which f angelinus sent his friend is wonderful concerning a person who had an epidemical fever and was restless eight nights when upon his recovery he was troubled with an itching in his right nostril and soon after there came out of it a worm as long as ones little finger its body thick and red its head black and hard with two sharp arms like those of a scorpion six feet toward the head and some small ones toward the tail on which it walked very briskly it lived four days without food  kerckingius in his anatomical observations gives us the figure of an hairy horned worm which came out of the nostril of a woman at amsterdam on the   st of sept      which he kept alive till the  d of october without giving it any food and which is very remarkable it brought forth another worm before it died  a pestilential fever raged at beneventum and swept off abundance of people at length the physicians opening the head of one that died of it found a little live worm very short and all over red and having tried several things to kill it found nothing effectual but the decoction of radishes in malmsey wine which was no sooner poured on the worm but it died after which they administered the same remedy to all their patients and almost all recovered  schenckius also relates that in the year      and epidemical fever raged in ancona which caused a furious giddiness and death on the third or fourth day all the physicians of the place confessed they did not understand the disease and consequently knew not how to cure it a rich young man finding a periodical pain beginning in his head became apprehensive of being seized with the distemper and being frighted by the ingenuous acknowledgment of the physicians left the country and went to venice where calling for a consultation of the most learned physicians one of them asserted that a worm in the brain was the occasion of those periodical pains which were so violent in the paroxysm without disturbing his reason or memory that it seemed as if his head had been bored with an iron  they administered several things without effect so that he died in three days time after his arrival they opened his head and found on the right side under the piamater the head of a worm which by reason of the cold air immediately retired into the substance of the brain they then cut open the ventricles of the brain and traced out the worm which was all over red as long as ones forefinger the head black and pointed and the neck hairy  amatus lusit took a worm out of the inner corner of a girls eye twas half a span long white and alive when taken out  sometimes worms are found in the ear as in a girl of ten years old who was afflicted with the evil and had a violent pain in the right ear which suppurated from time to time and sometimes she became deaf mr andry after a fruitless application of several remedies suspected worms and applied an ointment for that purpose whereupon abundance of small worms came forth they were yellow long and very slender  kerkingius gives an account of five worms which came from a mans ear in the year      very much like hoglice  there are worms which breed under a crust that covers the surface of the teeth they are very small and have a round head marked with a black point the other part of their body being long and slender these worms corrode the teeth by degrees and occasion a stink but no violent pain they are called dentarii  even the liver has been observed to entertain these insects so casper bauhinus relates that in october      several small worms were found in the liver of a child of two years of age that died of the smallpox they were red round somewhat long and soft it seemed strange to several physicians who were present at the opening but it may be considered that there may be several accidents wherein the gall in the liver may be so much altered as to lose very much of its bitterness and thereby permit the ingendring of worms  they sometimes breed in the heart occasioning violent pains swoonings and sudden death thus sphererius writes that a florentine gentleman discoursing one day with a stranger in the great duke of tuscanys court dropped down dead on a sudden and his body being opened on suspicion of poison a live worm was found in the heart  the pleurisy has been often observed to be occasioned by worms gabucinus visited a maid seized with a pleurisy and observing her cold and hot reciprocally and in her hot fits one of her cheeks very red the other continuing pale suspecting worms he prescribed her a medicine for that purpose which brought away a great number of worms and thereupon the pleurisy left her  several ancient men as quercitan testifies defunct of pleurisies had their intestines full of large worms which he concluded the cause of that distemper  dr loss in his observations relates such a case of a youth about fourteen years of age of a thin and bilious constitution who in a very sharp winter having gotten cold was seized with a true pleurisy attended with a continual fever a pricking pain in his lest breast reaching to his throat a difficulty in breathing a violent cough and spitting of blood his body was by intervals cold and hot with a redness in his cheeks and a great restlessness about the fifth day of the disease being costive a glister of milk was injected which brought away five worms which were teretes wherefore with some alteration of the medicines which were before prescribed the following powder was exhibited  and scord card ben a j corallin ij ccc j rhabarb   sal centuar j dose ss  after which worms came away daily in all above thirty and he recovered  dr andry had so remarkable a case of this sort that it put him upon writing an entire book on the subject of worms the case was this on the  th of june school a young man about thirty years of age was seized with a fever great pain in his side spitting of blood and difficulty of breathing he began the cure by opening a vein and repeated the same the next day on the  d he sweated on the  th he seemed to be much better but from thence to the  th he had a delirium which went off the next morning the delirium not being preceded by the usual signs occasioned a suspicion of worms and finding withal a great many in his excrements by stool he prescribed a purging medicine the next morning which has been very successful in that case an hour after the taking it the patient found something stir in his body which motion continued two hours and determined in the issuing forth of a live worm or rather link of worms four else three inches in length being the cucurbitini which are particularly described p     sometimes we meet with em in the blood where they obstruct the orifice in bleeding so a surgeon at paris whilst he was bleeding a patient found the blood stop on a sudden and turning up the arm to find the cause he saw an horned worm as long as an earwig which burst out with violence along with the blood  such another accident is related by mr de la crose in his memoirs of mr du puy a french physician who being present at the bleeding of a lady his patient the blood after it had sprung out above two ounces stopped on a sudden and as he was looking for the cause of it he perceived an heterogeneous body that stopped the orifice whereupon taking the chirurgions forceps he drew out a worm as big as could come out of the incision  he accounts for its coming there in the following manner the egg of some flying insect had been swallowed by the patient in her food and being descended into the small guts went with the chile into the milky veins through all the pores of the filtrating glandules the heart lungs aorta till arriving at last to the extremities or the fingers it remained there among their small arteries and veins and was hatched out by the most convenient and natural heat of the blood and flesh having thus gotten the life and motion of a worm it swam for greater ease and room into the arm and following still the cherishing liquor wherein it was bred it came at length to the incision of the vein whence mr du pay extracted it  they have been often seen in the urine and of various kinds some like hoglice others like mites in cheese some like leeches others like grasshoppers of which last sort was that voided by count mansfield when he lay ill of a continual fever  vidius writes of one who after tedious pains in the kidneys discharged a small worm by urine its head was sharp and horned its back and belly broad and covered with an hard shell like a tortoise its color black but reddish on the belly  sennertus says he saw the whole substance of the kidneys of a dog wasted and only the outward skin left which was full of worms like earthworms  dr turberville in the philos trans no     p     gives an account of a gentlewoman who was much troubled with the falling sickness and discharged by urine a great number of short worms like millipedes two or three purges were prescribed her and still in every water that was brought the physician he found eight ten or more of those worms they appeared lively and full of motion and the fits continued daily at last he gave her oxymel helleboratum in tansy water which wrought well and was successful so that she had a complete cure  in the philos trans there is an account of one mr thomas dent who being afflicted with tumors on his tongue applied himself to one mrs french at leicester who in the presence of two aldermen of that town mr gibbs chaplain to the earl of derby and others pierced the parts tumifyd with a lancet and drew some blood and soon after with a small spatula and another instrument wherewith she opened the orifices she picked out five or six worms at a time she plainly showed them to the spectators as they came out of the flesh they were all alive and moved their heads somewhat lesser than ordinary maggots in less than eight days she took out of the tongue more than an hundred worms almost all of the same bigness except two very large ones which she said were of a cancerous production she took more than thirty out of the gums which last operation was her ordinary practice  mr de la crose in his memoirs p     gives an account of one sarah hastings who followed the same practice at holm in huntingdonshire and had attained to so great skill as to discern at first sight whether any person had worms great or small in his gums tongue or face these worms she affirmed to be the cause of rottenness of the teeth of pustules and many other putrefactions she drew them out of any part in three or four minutes with a goosequill cut like a pen she pierced the part so dexterously that the pain was almost insensible then she threw the extracted worms into a glass of clean water where they appeared to have a round and red head the rest of the body being white he there relates several extraordinary cures of that sort too large to insert here  but of all the parts the stomach and guts are the most usually infested with worms especially in children however before we enter upon a particular description of those which properly belong to these parts it may be convenient to entertain the reader with some histories of very strange animals excluded the stomach by vomiting the accounts are taken out of the philos transactions  the first is dr listers of a baker at york who in march       vomited up a worm of a very strange figure i found it  says the doctor in the blood which came up with it having caused it to be washed for the more careful examination of it much of the blood being clods of a kind of skinny and fleshy substance of this kind of blood there was about two pounds saved in the washing and this odd animal amongst it it was of a dark green color like an horseleech and spotted not unlike some of them i could not perceive when i found it any life or motion in it the girl who washed it had beaten off almost a fin and part of one of the forks of the tail and burst its belly yet it was regularly and curiously shaped in all its members the man imagined he drank it the summer before in pondwater whereof he was used to drink after sore labor in his calling this is certain he had about his stomach and right side a most exquisite and tormenting pain for at least four months which many times threw him into horrors and chilness ague like and indeed when he vomited this up he was the sickest man i ever saw not to die he also voided blood by stool several days  i am at a loss where to place this animal it not being like any thing i ever saw in nature it was about four inches long and in the thickest part three inches about it had three fins on a side all near the head and all of them were thick and fleshy but the forked tail was finny and transparent and to be extended it was placed horrizantally not as that of most if not all small fish and even newts and tadpoles or frogs in disguise in which particular it differs from all as well as in the fleshiness of the fins  besides this odd animal i found the head of another of a different shape but the like dark green color  i am apt to think we often eat and drink what is alive and it is certain some things will live on in our stomachs in spite of concoction as gutworms bred in us and perhaps in some children before they are born and yet i am of the mind that what was accidentally swallowed by us alive and that shall have the power to live on within us especially if it be young and tender and yet growing may have its shape and designed form so monstrously perverted as to appear to us quite another thing than naturally it is and this i take to be the case of this odd creature which might have been the spawn or embrio of a toad or newt  the skinny lumps of blood vomited up with it i think may be easily accounted for for this spawn or embrio of a toad or newt might well envenom the stomach or gut in which part or wrinckle soever it chanced to rest or stick first and cause an inflammation there and have it swelled or closed up within a tumor of its own making which in process of time might gather to this bigness and at length bursting in pieces come up together  familiar instances of this nature we see in fruits or wens which insects raise upon vegetables who by natural instinct know how to envenom a plant and compendiously provide both food and housing for their young so far dr lister  the next is no     p     of a girl at sheffield about eight months old who was seized with violent fits of vomiting which held her about a week and mr fisher being sent for and happening to say that wormwood was good for the stomach whilst he was gone to fetch some things proper for that occasion they in the mean time offered the child some wormwood ale which she took so greedily that she swallowed down a pint of it and at his return she vomited up in his presence three hexapodes i e worms with six feet all very active and nimble and the child soon recovered mr fisher carried them the same day to mr jessop who sent the account they killed one of them in trying experiments upon it but gave each of the other two the head of a shining atricapella a bird with black feathers on its head which in about five weeks time they eat up bones feathers and all except the extremities of the feathers and beaks then they gave them a piece of larus a seacob but that it seems did not agree so well with them for they died within two days after  the last account is dr listers the son of one not far from rippon about   years of age in feb      was afflicted with a great pain in his stomach and continual vomitings a powder was given him wherein was a small quantity of mercurius dulcis he thereupon vomited up several strange worms two of which were brought the doctor at york one dead the other alive till he put it into spirit of wine to preserve it in its true shape these worms were very caterpillars with fourteen legs viz six small pointed the eight middle stumps and the two hind ones claspers they were something more than an inch long of the thickness of a ducksquill thin haird or rather naked with brown annuli and black heads the same for kind that is often seen on plants these no doubt would in due time if the place had not hindered have shrunk into chrysaliss and changed into moths as also those mentioned by mr jessop in the preceding history would have changed into beetles  the proper inhabitants of these dark regions are of four sorts viz the teres the cucurbitini the taenia and the ascarides    of the teres or common long and round worm dr tyson has given a very curious anatomical description in the philos trans no     p     from whence i shall borrow a few observations though we are gravelled says the doctor in assigning how these sorts of worms should come first into the body yet being once there nothing is more plain than that they are propagated by an univocal generation there being in this sort so perfect a distinction or sexes male and female and the organs of each so curiously contrived so conspicuous and plain as show how solicitous nature is in preserving and propagating the meanest species  this worm which children are usually troubled with is usually a foot long the male generally less than the female its thickness about that of a wheat straw or goosequill at both extremes they grow narrow the mouth consists of three lips the anus of a transverse slit a little before the extreme point of the tail  in cutting through the muscles under the skin there issued out a copious ichor which is naturally discharged by some pores in the skin and makes a covering to the body which is often cast off and observed as a mucous matter in the stools of those who are troubled with them  in opening the cornua vteri of the female worm they were found turgid with a milky juice a little of which being placed on a small microscope was found to be nothing else but an infinite number of eggs though to the naked eye it appeared only as a fluid body  by comparing that small quantity i did observe and in which i could distinguish so many eggs with the whole quantity contained in both the cornua i cannot guess there could be fewer than ten thousand in each female worm which sufficiently accounts for that prodigious number of worms sometimes observed to be bred in animal bodies and were it not that the greatest part of the litter of this worm is usually carried forth by the faeces it could not be avoided but we should be devoured by such a multiparous enemy bred in our own bowels of whose pernicious effects some of the following instances are fatal proofs  dr preston in the philos trans p     no     relates that in dissecting a boy of nine years of age who died suddenly being seized with a fit of vomiting besides a great many other disorders of all the bowels they found a worm in the stomach about nine inches long and a line and a half broad  dr james burrows reports in the philos trans no     p     that in may or june   00 a laboring man of middle age at stanton seven miles from bury had for many days together so inordinate an appetite that he eat up an ordinary leg of veal roasted at a meal he would eat sowthistles and diverse other herbs as greedily during the time his bulimia lasted as the beasts that use such food and all he could get was little enough to satisfy his hunger till at length he voided diverse worms as long and as big about as a tobaccopipe after which his appetite declined by degrees till it came to the common rate of others  we have also an account in the same place of a dissection performed by the sieur soye in an hospital on the body of a servant maid about twenty six years of age who was from time to time seized with a bloody flux he found the colon and part of the mesentery ulcerated the mouth of which ulcer was so large that one might easily thrust in his fist at it and twas stopped with a clew of worms greater than it  dr loss in his book of observations writes that the son of sir lewis dive a child of a good constitution of body after an indisposition of two or three days attended with a dry cough and a restless condition especially in the night with continual cryings was at length seized with violent and continual convulsions whereof in three days he died in cutting open the body to discover the cause they were soon satisfied when they found the duodenum quite eaten through by a teres or long worm which was taken out alive  dr willis in his book of fevers tells us he knew one in an acute fever who was molested with continual swoonings till he vomited up a long round worm and thereupon his swoonings left him  examples of this kind are very numerous and it is no wonder to meet with this species in their proper soil but the account which dr lister has published in the philos trans is very surprising viz in april      a chyrurgion at york brought him about twenty worms which he had just taken out of an ulcerated ancle of a girl about eight years of age she had been in great misery some months and had been sent up to london where she was touched and dressed for the evil sometime after her return her pain continuing a young puppy was opened and applied to the sore the chyrurgion who took off the puppy found it to his great surprise full of worms at least sixty in number of the species of the teretes which children familiarly void from the guts they were between three and four inches long all about an equal bigness as of one brood something thicker than a ducksquill very sharp at both ends stiff and exactly round and yet could move and twist themselves visibly enough the leg was sound all but the ancle which was vastly swelled and the girl otherwise hearty and well colored    the taenia or tape worm so called from its resemblance to a tape or ribbon is broad and flat and white its thinness renders it diaphanous its length is very uncertain because its substance being very soft and tender it usually breaks off when it comes away so that it is very rare to find it entire the whole is probably the length of all the bowels that is seven times the length of the man but lying very much folded together takes up but little room it usually comes away piecemeal seven or eight foot long sometimes nineteen twenty three thirty forty five foot of it has been found broke off at a time it grows gradually smaller toward the tail which terminates in a very small and long part like an hair in its widest part its breadth is about that of ones forefinger  spigelius tells us of a woman who voided at several times several pieces of this wormy whereof two were extraordinary long the first that came away was two yards and a half long containing the tail part of the worm but wanting the extreme part of the tail perhaps unknowingly broke off by the patient before part of it hanging out of the anus her sister drew it forth so far but tired with its prodigious length she broke it off with her nails this piece in that part where it was fresh broke off was as broad as ones little finger and became narrower gradually as it approached the tail its substance was soft throughout white bloodless like a membrane of the guts another piece that came away about a year after was eight foot long and the breadth of ones middlefinger the joints were larger and thicker the incisures wider and the sides more jagged  fabricius gives a description of the like sort of worm which a woman of twenty years of age voided upon taking a purging medicine which was twenty spans long one of the extremes was as slender as a thread the other broad  the same author relates the following history  a lady at lausanne in france very subject in her youth to palpitations of the heart and after a sort of purge she used to take she voided sometimes very long pieces of worms after she was married and began to have children her palpitations left her only she was troubled with a lienteria during which she voided downwards several pieces of worms some six some nine others ten spans long every time she voided these pieces she felt the worms break in her bowels one day after taking her remedy she voided a piece of worm seven else long and a few days after another piece without perceiving as before that any thing broke from which time she became perfectly well all the pieces put together would make above twenty else  olaus borrhicius tells us that a patient of his has voided eight hundred foot of this worm in several pieces and that hitherto he has not met with the head for the patient declared that always in the voiding he perceived it break off  a suckingchild by the relation of casp wolphius brought forth a broad worm at least three else long    the cucurbitinj or spurious jointed tape worm vallisnerius an italian physician has published a very large and accurate description of this species of gutworms the result of his indefatigable industry from whom i have taken this account following anno   0  visiting a jewess twenty five years of age three months gone with child who like many of that nation was incident to broad worms which in her third or fourth month usually occasioned her to miscarry but when she was not with child they never gave her any disturbance she often voided by vomiting and stool many of these worms as well singly as linked together in the manner of a chain she had just discharged a very long chain of these worms besides several singly he separated without much pains many of these from each other in that part which was largest but observed they were very strictly joined together  every one of these consisted of a membranous soft white shining flexible and slippery matter the upper part smaller than the lower  in the upper side of each there arise two very small prominences which when pressed with the fingers feel like little horns or crooked thorns and are conspicuous by the microscope  by these they adhere firmly to the hinder part of the preceding worm in whose postick part are cavities fitted to receive these prominences  the lateral parts of these worms are rugged and out of their middle rises a kind of tet whose center is perforated with a very conspicuous opening and pours out sometimes a quantity of chyle sometimes clear water sometimes a yellow serum  their mouth is in the narrower and upper side between the two protuberances if it be objected that if the mouth be in this part they cannot receive nourishment by it adhering so closely to the preceding worm it is answered they being fed with a fluid matter chyle which penetrating every where easily enters that chink where the mouth is since the middle part is not so close as the jettings besides that when the worms adhere so close it is to preserve themselves when in danger of expulsion at other times they are more closely connected  these flat worms when single very much resemble in bigness and shape the seed of a gourd which in latin is called cucurbita whence they are called cucurbitini and being very numerous and adhering to each other so firmly in the manner aforesaid do form a chain of a surprising length which has been mistaken by several very eminent authors for an entire worm in particular the ingenious dr tyson and mr andry of france the former having given a very particular and large account of it in the philos trans no     p      mr andry in examining these worms very diligently with a microscope after cutting them open perceived them full of small globular bodies resembling that cluster of eggs usually found in carps these eggs are so numerous that the quantity taken up with the point of a pin though no bigger than a grain of dust would appear under a microscope an incredible pile of small eggs which sufficiently accounts for the vast number of these insects  they are found in persons of all ages  dr george francus saw a child one year three months old in the year      in good health and fleshy who though it sucked used to drink beer and water after he had voided several small worms upwards and downwards at length brought away a chain of cucurbitini three else long which would have been much longer if the frighted nurse had not broke it off instead of drawing it all out miscel curios  wagner relates of a soldier who was freed of such a chain of worms six else long and soon after of another longer than the former  examples of these worms are innumerable though many authors have set them down so confusedly that it is not possible to distinguish whether they are the genuine taenia described in the second article which is but one entire worm or this spurious sort consisting of a chain of cucurbitini  dr tyson mentions a person in london who has voided vast quantities of these worms for several years together but in several pieces two three four six or more yards long and says he had a piece by him of a great length voided by a young man upon the use of an emulsion of the cold seeds it was twenty four foot long and consisted of five hundred and seven joints or worms in thickness about that of an halfcrown the person dragged it from himself not without frightful apprehensions that guts and all were coming out  these chains of worms lie convoluted in several places and are sometimes as long as all the guts and sometimes vastly exceed that length  these worms have been found sometimes included in a bag which has been mistaken by several for a large worm the jewess beforementioned upon a time imagining a large piece of her bowels coming from her though she felt no pain being frighted at it she sent for her physician who was himself at first surpised at it this substance was like a doubled rowler close in every part composed of a thick smooth shining transparent and mucilaginous membrane two thumbs broad above a yard long it was hollow and contained within it a numberless quantity of cucurbitini not linked together but every one separate their bigness was various they were all alive and moved freely  this bag seems to be formed mostly of a concressible humor in the intestines after the same manner as polypuss in the heart and arteries and is increased by a glewy matter cast out by these worms from their lateral orifices  the teretes also or long and round worms are sometimes found involved in such a bag    the last species of worms usually found in the intestines are the ascarides they are very small and round full of vivacity and motion their habitation is in the lowest part of the intestines where they provoke a continual itching and occasion sometimes most direful symptoms dr curteis in his treatise on the recovery of health gives us the following example  a boy about twelve years of age was so extremely afflicted with such formidable symptoms as were imputed to the effect of witchcraft what gave birth to so general a conjecture were the extraordinary convulsions rolling screaming violent beating himself etc by frequent paroxisms all which soon disappeared and the mystery was at an end upon his liberally taking the aethiops mineral and purging and thereupon voiding an almost incredible number of worms of different sizes and especially of these ascarides whereupon the patient was rescued from his imagined witchcraft and a very poor old woman from worse than hanging who was suspected of being the occasion  several examples of this sort of worms might be produced out of authors but this is sufficient for a specimen  chap iii the signs of worms from mr andry the signs of worms are common or particular  the common signs show the genius and the particular the species that is when the common meet we say there are worms and when we find particular signs we may say not only that there are worms in general but that those worms are of such a particular sort  the common signs are fiery sparkling eyes livid cheeks cold sweats in the nights abundance of spittle drivelling from the mouth in sleep great drowth in the daytime dryness of the tongue and lips a stinkingbreath grating of the teeth in sleep a constant looseness with whitish excrements frothy urine sometimes white sometimes obscure but for the most part thick and muddy  frequent vomitings and convulsionfits are sometimes signs of worms that is when the vomitings throw up nothing but what has been eaten and the convulsions are without foaming at the mouth  sometimes they rise in their sleep and move their lips as if they were eating to know if these symptoms are from worms observe if they are eased by abstinence for they that have worms cannot fast without finding themselves tormented not by hunger for many times they have no appetite but by twitchings and tearings caused by the various motions of the worms in search of food  a dry cough is very often a sign of worms by this forestus knew that a little girl who had been six months ill of a quartanague was troubled with worms he prescribed her medicines accordingly which brought away five worms and her ague thereupon left her  a stinkingbreath is very often a sign so brassavolus visiting an old man eighty years of age who seemed to lie a dying knew by his breath that he was troubled with worms he thereupon directed him some vermifuges which scoured away five hundred worms and cured him  raging hunger many times proceeds from worms when it is accompanied with extreme leanness though the party eat much thus a boy about twelve years of age  says forestus had kept his bed for several months and was dried almost to a skeleton without feeling any other illness than a slight pain in his belly near his navel the physician was at first a little at a stand to find out the distemper the cause of which he could not imagine for the child eat very well though to no purpose his urine was of a good consistency and color though somewhat crude and waterish but the pain of his belly together with his extraordinary hunger caused him to suspect worms therefore for several days twice a day he ordered a glass of the decoction of hyssop marjoram fennel fumitory centaury and wormwood with oxymel syrup of fumitory and honey of roses this medicine every time he took it caused him to void a great number of worms and perfectly cured him  the particular signs differ according to the species of worms  the signs of long and round worms are tensions of the belly with hardness and pain itching of the nose corrosion of the guts hiccoughs a palpitation in sleep waking with sudden startings or shrieks an unequal pulse intermitting fevers of which the party will have three or four fits without any certain order the eyes hollow and sometimes red the cheeks sometimes glowing red and sometimes of a lead color sometimes they want a stomach and vomit after eating they have fevers accompanied with cold in the extreme parts of the body these signs never meet altogether but sometimes one sometimes another  the signs of ascarides are a continual itching in the fundament causing faintings and sometimes swoonings the itching proceeds from the motion of these worms and the quick sense of the part where they lie  the signs of the taenia or tape worm are lassitude and faintings after meat frequent numbness and dullness in the daytime which cause an heaviness above the navel though these may proceed from other causes  the signs of the cucurbitini are little bodies like the seeds of cucumers or melons found in the excrements i suppose they are the young brood not yet linked together both hippocrates and aristotle mention these as certain signs to which may be added shifting pains of the liver accompanied with great fluxes of spittle pains in the stomach succeed those of the liver by intervals and sometimes attended with tedious pains in the back  some observations from baglivi when children are observed to rub their bellies very much it is a sign of worms especially if they are often gripped  very often it happens that persons are suddenly and without any apparent cause or signs of any other distemper reduced to the extremest danger like the assault of an apoplexy with coldness of the extreme parts a creeping pulse which is most commonly a sign of worms as is also the hiccough swooning and sometimes a sudden madness in such a case we ought to suspect worms and to prescribe accordingly  bleeding by drops in continual fevers from the nostrils is sometimes a sign of worms as very judicious authors have asserted  whenever there is the least cause to suspect worms by no means defer the administration of remedies for they often occasion sudden death to grown persons as well as to children or infants  whatever distemper children are troubled with worms are always to be suspected for either they immediately increase the disease or by reason of its continuance the seeds of worms are hatched into life and fill the bowels with that pestiferous vermin  chap iv of the remedies for the destroying of worms and they are    external applications as fomentations cataplasms ointments plasters all which are not a little beneficial for as dr fuller observes worms do so securely burrow and entrench themselves in the foldings and cavities of the bowels as to escape and elude the impression of purging or other medicines for which reason outward applications are very useful to disturb them from their lurking places and so expose them to the attacks of internals which may destroy and expel them    internal administrations which by a specific quality disturb and kill them the forms of these are various as liquors syrups powders bolusses pills etc whereof some are purgative others not in the use of which dr andry recommends the following observations  that the best time to take them is in the wain of the moon he confesses he looked upon this at first as an idle fancy but that his experience convinced him of his mistake  that in the administration of remedies for the worms there ought to be due intermissions lest being too vigorously attacked they should retire into the cavity of the gutcolon where they would be very much out of the reach of medicines  as for glisters they are observed to be very useful and they are of two general kinds sweet and bitter  the latter are of great efficacy against the ascarides which as dr fuller observes are a small but an almost invincible nation for though you should wash away all by one glister yet a new and numberless offspring will quickly discover themselves being produced of the seed of the former deposited in the rectum so that twill not be sufficient to have expelled the parents unless their posterity be also vigorously prosecuted and destroyed this may be done if after the ascarides disappear we do not presently desist but repeat these bitter injections for some time once in two or three days at first and afterward once a week  but for the teretes or long and round worms these bitter injections are by no means proper so long as they are brisk lively and agile and inclined to get up into the stomach or small guts lest being driven upon those parts they should occasion a great deal of mischief there but after the use of other medicines which have made them sickly and thrust them down the exhibition of such glisters may be very seasonable and successful  the sweet glisters made of milk sugar etc are convenient before the use of the bibber ones when the worms are lurking in the small guts where by gnawing and tearing the bowels they excite violent pains in the belly for the worms take to the milk being pleasant and agreeable to them and so leave off preying on the bowels and are also enticed out of their burrows and following the agreeable liquor are disposed to come away by stool  a view of some of the most celebrated remedies dr simon paulis worm powder which expelled a

worms the quicksilver communicating its virtue without changing the color or taste of the liquor  the aethiops minerable has been generally obserd to have very happy effects dr harris in his treatise of childrens diseases relates an extraordinary cure performed by that medicine as follows  j p a boy of thirteen years of age was so pined away with a consumption by worms as it proved that he was more like a skelaton than a living person his eyes hollow his nose sharp and his bones only covered with skin he became senseless and so weak that he could scarce crawl from one side of the room to the other with the swiftness of a snail all his excrements by urine and stool fell involuntarily from him by taking the foresaid medicine twice a day for some time and gently purging every fourth day without rhubarb he voided a great many worms and recovered perfectly well  such whose curiosity leads them to enquire more fully after instances of this nature may consult the elaborate works of dr nicholas andry and dr daniel clerc who have treated very largely on this subject  an appendix concerning the first original of worms it has been already observed in the preceding treatise that even unborn infants are not always free from worms which vallisneri an italian physician endeavors to account for in the following manner  the chyle says he appointed for the nourishment of the infant is first prepared in the stomach of the mother and rendered more perfect and pure by the digestions and glands of the bowels now since the intestines are the general seat of worms and the fetus is for several months nourished by this chyle the seeds of worms which are in the mothers bowels mixing with the flower of the chyle are by the usual passages carried along to the membranes which involve the fetus by this means it may be easily guessed how the infant may receive this verminous progeny into its own bowels but if it happen that the mother be either entirely free or having worms they should not happen to spawn during the time of her being pregnant then indeed the infant will not be infested with them in this manner but if this infant should happen to be suckld by another woman who has worms her milk may furnish the child with a colony of these insects since milk differs not from chyle and is conveyed from the bowels to the breasts  but whence it may be demanded have this mother or nurse these worms which they thus communicate to the child it is answered they have also received them in the manner aforesaid and that they have been so conveyed down through all ages from the beginning of the world and the first parents of mankind  and indeed since the seeds of things none excepted were created at the beginning of the world all sorts of insects part of folded insert page

those worms which inhabit the bowels of mankind are never found elsewhere it must be inferred that their seeds were originally implanted in the body of the first man or woman  at this rate twill be objected all persons must necessarily be possessed with these insects or else their succession might fail  it is supposed that the seeds or eggs of worms may lie a long time within every mans body and these sometime or other as occasion offers be produced into life which without such occasion would have remained unchanged thus in a certain ancient person the eggs of the tapeworm were hatched not till after the fifty fifth year of his age at which time he began to be molested with that kind of worm either because the juices of his bowels had never before gotten that quality which was requisite to vivify those eggs or because the place was not rightly disposed for that purpose but those that in this man were so slowly excluded may be much sooner in another even before his birth or in his childhood or youth according as circumstances may favor their production  again in many persons they may be never animated because there may be always wanting a suitable disposition of the humors or place to produce them just as the eggs of the vermis africanus for example though they may be lodged in the skin or flesh of every many yet this insect troubles none but africans indians and arabians not the inhabitants of the northern climates because the heat of africa or india promotes the vivification of these eggs which cannot be animated in colder countries as on the other hand the seeds of the taenia by reason of the moisture of the climate are rendered fruitful amongst the hollanders which in india or africa because of the extreme dryness of those regions are unprolifick  this notion is confirmed by the observation of hemmersam who speaking of the vermis africanus says it is worth noting that those who only sail by guiney feel an itching in the skin chiefly in that of the arms and legs but most commonly in the thighs this itching certainly indicates the beginning motion of the vermis africanus excited by the heat of that country  every one knows how much heat and the fermentation of juices conduces to the production of animals  neither is the seeming uselessness of so many seeds consequent upon this notion any just objection when the same may be said of many other seeds whereof the much greater part is often lost and that loss not to be accounted of if we consider their infinite number  nor lastly ought we to object the often long continuance of these eggs in the body before they are vivifyd for as much as the seeds of several plants kept many years and afterward committed to the earth do germinate as readily as if they had been fresh and the ova of women advanced in years are often equally prolifick with those of younger women  these worms then may the objector further argue were created by god in the body of adam either before his fall or afterward but if we consider man as he was first created perfectly innocent it seems not probable that the just and good god would implant such foul vermin in his immaculate body and besides as that state of innocence was entirely free from all manner of diseases and possessed of a perfect happiness undisturbed by any disorder of body it were impossible he should have any worms in his bowels which we find by daily experience are the causes of innumerable disorders and even of death it self  nor can it easily be imagined how this filthy insect hatched and nourished in putrefaction could suit with that sweet manner of living directed by the light of pure reason void of all intemperance and its consequences which produce that putrid humor proper to receive and produce the eggs of worms  to have recourse to the divine prescience in this case viz that god foreseeing the apostasy of his creature prepared for his punishment would be very unreasonable since the suffering should by no means preceed the offense  if on the other hand we say that these worms were formed after the alteration of his nature by his disobedience to the divine command the difficulty will be yet greater for then twill follow that god began a new creation which is contrary to the tenor of the sacred scriptures which inform us that god before he created man produced all other creatures not excepting insects  to remove these objections it is asserted that before mans formation all other animals plants etc were created and that man was last formed out of the mud  that in this mud those worms which were a little before created were implanted and so entered in the composition of his body being probably designed by providence whilst he continued innocent to be very useful to him and to contribute to the perfection of his body and should he after lapse from his integrity become a punishment to him  now though this may seem strange that worms should any way conduce to the benefit and perfection of our bodies yet let us consider  that those machines which are selfmoving as watches etc are always esteemed more perfect and surprising the more they comprehend other machines equally curious within their structure and is not the world accounted more perfect by containing such an infinite variety of animals great and small honorable and base as they are called if any of its countries prove destitute of inhabitants are they not accounted unhappy and despicable why should not then our little world be esteemed more complete by being furnished with its proper inhabitants  nor would it be any injury to our first parent to suppose his body the receptacle of various and wonderful insects which whilst he continued innocent were so far from being pernicious to him that they rendered him more perfect and redounded to his honor they lived quietly and amicably with him and sed on the superfluities of indigested food only they exceeded not their just limits they abstained from preying on the bowels and did no injury to the walls of their enclosures but gently licking and cleansing their mansions they gratefully requited the benefit of their reception moreover if the fibers of the bowels were at any time become torpid or oppressed with too copious or excrementitious juices which might be detrimental to the body these might excite them to the brisker discharge of their functions in short they might be no ways noxious but very beneficial  but this felicity of adam proved but short for by rebelling against his maker the natures of all things were soon changed and then these worms also became the ministers of divine vengeance as well as lions tigers serpents and other destructive animals  finis books printed for j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row the history of the reign of king
