for the use of children  by i watts d d  matt xxi    out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou have perfected praise london printed for j buckland j f and c rivington t longman w fenner t field and e and c dilly mdcclxxvii  preface to all that are concerned in the education of children my friends it is an awful and important charge that is committed to you the wisdom and welfare of the succeeding generation are entrusted with you beforehand and depend much on your conduct the seeds of misery or happiness in this world and that to come are oftentimes sown very early and therefore whatever may conduce to give the minds of children a relish for virtue and religion ought in the first place to be proposed to you  verse was at first designed for the service of god though it has been wretchedly abused since the ancients among the jews and the heathens taught their children and disciples the precepts of morality and worship in verse the children of israel were commanded to learn the words of the song of moses deuteronomy xxxi     0 and we are directed in the new testament not only to sing with grace in the heart but to teach and admonish one another by hymns and songs ephesians v    and there are these four advantages in it  i there is a great delight in the very learning of truths and duties this way there is something so amusing and entertaining in rhymes and meter that will incline children to make this part of their business a diversion and you may turn their very duty into a reward by giving them the privilege of learning one of these songs every week if they fulfill the business of the week well and promising them the book itself when they have learnt ten or twenty songs out of it  ii what is learnt in verse is longer retained in memory and sooner recollected the like sounds and the like number of syllables exceedingly assist the remembrance and it may often happen that the end of a song running in the mind may be an effectual means to keep off some temptations or to incline to some duty when a word of scripture is not upon their thoughts  iii this will be a constant furniture for the minds of children that they may have something to think upon when alone and sing over to themselves this may sometimes give their thoughts a divine turn and raise a young meditation thus they will not be forced to seek relief for an emptiness of mind out of the loose and dangerous sonnets of the age  iv these divine songs may be a pleasant and proper matter for their daily or weekly worship to sing one in the family at such time as the parents or governors shall appoint and therefore i have confined the verse to the most usual psalm tunes  the greatest part of this little book was composed several years ago at the request of a friend who has been long engaged in the work of catechizing a very great number of children of all kinds and with abundant skill and success so that you will find here nothing that savours of a party the children of high and low degree of the church of england or dissenters baptized in infancy or not may all join together in these songs and as i have endeavored to sink the language to the level of a childs understanding and yet to keep it if possible above contempt so i have designed to profit all if possible and offend none i hope the more general the sense is these composures may be of the more universal use and service  i have added at the end some attempts of sonnets on moral subjects for children with an air of pleasantry to provoke some fitter pen to write a little book of them  may the almighty god make you faithful in this important work of education may he succeed your cares with his abundant grace that the rising generation of great britain may be a glory among the nations a pattern to the christian world and a blessing to the earth  contents song page   a general song of praise to god     praise for creation and providence     praise to god for our redemption     praise

heavenly king who reigns above the sky how shall a child presume to sing his dreadful majesty ii how great his power is none can tell nor think how large his grace not men below nor saints that dwell on high before his face iii not angels that stand round the lord can search his secret will but they perform his heavenly word and sing his praises still iv then let me join this holy train and my first offerings bring the eternal god will not disdain to hear an infant sing v my heart resolves my tongue obeys and angels shall rejoice to hear their mighty makers praise sound from a feeble voice song ii praise for creation and providence i i sing the almighty power of god that made the mountains rise that spread the flowing seas abroad and built the lofty skies ii i sing the wisdom that ordained the sun to rule the day the moon shines full at his command and all the stars obey iii i sing the goodness of the lord that filled the earth with food he formed the creatures with his word and then pronounced them good iv lord how thy wonders are displayed wherever i turn mine eye if i survey the ground i tread or gaze upon the sky v there is not a plant or flower below but makes thy glories known and clouds arise and tempests blow by order from thy throne vi creatures as numerous as they be are subject to thy care there is not a place where we can flee but god is present there vii in heaven he shines with beams of love with wrath in hell beneath it is on his earth i stand or move and it is his air i breathe viii his hand is my perpetual guard he keeps me with his eye why should i then forget the lord who is for ever nigh song iii praise to god for our redemption i blessed be the wisdom and the power the justice and the grace that joined in counsel to restore and save our ruined race ii our father ate forbidden fruit and from his glory fell and we his children thus were brought to death and near to hell iii blessed be the lord that sent his son to take our flesh and blood he for our lives gave up his own to make our peace with god iv he honored all his fathers laws which we have disobeyed he bore our sins upon the cross and our full ransom paid v behold him rising from the grave behold him raised on high he pleads his merit there to save transgressors doomed to die vi there on a glorious throne he reigns and by his power divine redeems us from the slavish chains of satan and of sin vii thence shall the lord to judgment come and with a sovereign voice shall call and break up every tomb while waking saints rejoice viii o may i then with joy appear before the judges face and with the blessed assembly there sing his redeeming grace song iv praise for mercies spiritual and temporal i whenever i take my walks abroad how many poor i see what shall i render to my god for all his gifts to me ii not more than others i deserve yet god his given me more for i have food while others starve or beg from door to door iii how many children in the street half naked i behold while i am clothed from head to feet and covered from the cold iv while some poor wretches scarce can tell where they may lay their head i have a home wherein to dwell and rest upon my bed v while others early learn to swear and curse and lie and steal lord i am taught thy name to fear and do thy holy will vi are these thy favors day by day to me above the rest then let me love thee more than they and try to serve thee best song v praise for birth and education in a christian land i great god to thee my voice i raise to thee my youngest hours belong i would begin my life with praise till growing years improve the song ii it is to thy sovereign grace i owe that i was born on british ground where streams of heavenly mercy flow and words of sweet salvation sound iii i would not change my native land for rich peru with all her gold a nobler prize lies in my hand than east or western indies hold iv how do i pity those that dwell where ignorance and darkness reigns they know no heaven they fear no hell those endless joys those endless pains v thy glorious promises o lord kindle my hopes and my desire while all the preachers of thy word warn me to scape eternal fire vi thy praise shall still employ my breath since thou have marked my way to heaven nor will i run the road to death and waste the blessings thou have given song vi praise for the gospel i lord i ascribe it to thy grace and not to chance as others do that i was born of christian race and not a heathen or a jew ii what would the ancient jewish kings and jewish prophets once have given could they have heard those glorious things which christ revealed and brought from heaven iii how glad the heathens would have been that worshipped idols wood and stone if they the book of god had seen or jesus and his gospel known iv then if this gospel i refuse how shall i ever lift up mine eyes for all the gentiles and the jews against me will in judgment rise song vii the excellency of the bible i great god with wonder and with praise on all thy works i look but still thy wisdom power and grace shine brightest in thy book ii the stars that in their courses roll have much instruction given but thy good word informs my soul how i may climb to heaven iii the fields provide me food and show the goodness of the lord but fruits of life and glory grow in thy most holy word iv here are my choicest treasures hid here my best comfort lies here my desires are satisfied and hence my hopes arise v lord make me understand thy law show what my faults have been and from thy gospel let me draw pardon for all my sin vi here would i learn how christ has died to save my soul from hell not all the books on earth beside such heavenly wonders tell vii then let me love my bible more and take a fresh delight by day to read these wonders over and meditate by night song viii praise to god for learning to read i the praises of my tongue i offer to the lord that i was taught and learnt so young to read his holy word ii that i am brought to know the danger i was in by nature and by practice too a wretched slave to sin iii that i am lead to see i can do nothing well and whither shall a sinner flee to save himself from hell iv dear lord this book of thine informs me where to go for grace to pardon all my sin and make me holy too v here i can read and learn how christ the son of god has undertook our great concern our ransom cost his blood vi and now he reigns above he sends his spirit down to show the wonders of his love and make his gospel known vii o may that spirit teach and make my heart receive those truths which all thy servants preach and all thy saints believe viii then shall i praise the lord in a more cheerful strain that i was taught to read his word and have not learnt in vain song ix the allseeing god i almighty god thy piercing eye strikes through the shades of night and our most secret actions lie all open to thy sight ii there is not a sin that we commit nor wicked word we say but in thy dreadful book it is writ against the judgmentday iii and must the crimes that i have done be read and published there be all exposed before the sun while men and angels hear iv lord at thy foot ashamed i lie upward i dare not look pardon my sins before i die and blot them from thy book v remember all the dying pains that my redeemer felt and let his blood wash out my stains and answer for my guilt vi o may i now for ever fear to indulge a sinful thought since the great god can see and hear and writes down every fault song x solemn thoughts of god and death i there is a god that reigns above lord of the heavens and earth and seas i fear his wrath i ask his love and with my lips i sing his praise ii there is a law which he has writ to teach us all that we must do my soul to his commands submit for they are holy just and true iii there is a gospel of rich grace whence sinners all their comforts draw lord i repent and seek thy face for i have often broke thy law iv there is an hour when i must die nor do i know how soon twill come a thousand children young as i are called by death to hear their doom v let me improve the hours i have before the day of grace is fled there is no repentance in the grave nor pardons offered to the dead vi just as the tree cut down that fell to north or southward there it lies so man departs to heaven or hell fixed in the state wherein he dies song xi heaven and hell i there is beyond the sky a heaven of joy and love and holy children when they die go to that world above ii there is a dreadful hell and everlasting pains there sinners must with devils dwell in darkness fire and chains iii can such a wretch as i escape this cursed end and may i hope whenever i die i shall to heaven ascend iv then will i read and pray while i have life and breath lest i should be cut off today and sent to eternal death song xii the advantages of early religion i happy the child whose tender years receive instructions well who hates the sinners path and fears the road that leads to hell ii when we devote our youth to god it is pleasing in his eyes a flower when offered in the bud is no vain sacrifice iii it is easier work if we begin to fear the lord betimes while sinners that grow old in sin are hardened in their crimes iv twill save us from a thousand snares to mind religion young grace will preserve our following years and make our virtue strong v to thee almighty god to thee our childhood we resign twill please us to look back and see that our whole lives were thine vi let the sweet work of prayer and praise employ my youngest breath thus i am prepared for longer days or fit for early death song xiii the danger of delay i why should i say it is yet too soon to seek for heaven or think of death a flower may fade before it is noon and i this day may lose my breath ii if this rebellious heart of mine despise the gracious calls of heaven i may be hardened in my sin and never have repentance given iii what if the lord grow wrath and swear while i refuse to read and pray that he will refuse to lend an ear to all my groans another day iv what if his dreadful anger burn while i refuse his offered grace and all his love to fury turn and strike me dead upon the place v it is dangerous to provoke a god his power and vengeance none can tell one stroke of his almighty rod shall send young sinners quick to hell vi then twill for ever be in vain to cry for pardon and for grace to wish i had my time again or hope to see my makers face song xiv examples of early piety i what blessed examples do i find writ in the word of truth of children that began to mind religion in their youth ii jesus who reigns above the sky and keeps the world in awe was once a child as young as i and kept his fathers law iii at twelve years old he talked with men the jews all wondering stand yet he obeyed his mother then and came at her command iv children a sweet hosanna sung and blessed their saviors name they gave him honor with their tongue while scribes and priests blaspheme v samuel the child was weaned and brought to wait upon the lord young timothy betimes was taught to know his holy word vi then why should i so long delay what others learnt so soon i would not pass another day without this work begun song xv against lying i o it is a lovely thing for youth to walk betimes in wisdoms way to fear a lie to speak the truth that we may trust to all they say ii but liars we can never trust though they should speak the thing that is true and he that does one fault at first and lies to hide it makes it two iii have we not known nor heard nor read how god abhors deceit and wrong how ananias was struck dead caught with a lie upon his tongue iv so did his wife sapphira die when she came in and grew so bold as to confirm that wicked lie that just before her husband told v the lord delights in them that speak the words of truth but every liar must have his portion in the lake that burns with brimstone and with fire vi then let me always watch my lips lest i be struck to death and hell since god a book of reckoning keeps for every lie that children tell song xvi against quarrelling and fighting i let dogs delight to bark and bite for god has made them so let bears and lions growl and fight for it is their nature too ii but children you should never let such angry passions rise your little hands were never made to tear each others eyes iii let love through all your actions run and all your words be mild live like the blessed virgins son that sweet and lovely child iv his soul was gentle as a lamb and as his stature grew he grew in favor both with man and god his father too v now lord of all he reigns above and from his heavenly throne he sees what children dwell in love and marks them for his own song xvii love between brothers and sisters i whatever brawls disturb the street there should be peace at home where sisters dwell and brothers meet quarrels should never come ii birds in their little nests agree and it is a shameful sight when children of one family fall out and chide and fight iii hard names at first and threatening words that are but noisy breath may grow to clubs and naked swords to murder and to death iv the devil tempts one mothers son to rage against another so wicked cain was hurried on till he had killed his brother v the wife will make their anger cool at least before it is night but in the bosom of a fool it burns till morninglight vi pardon o lord our childish rage our little brawls remove that as we grow to riper age our hearts may all be love song xviii against scoffing and calling names i our tongues were made to bless the lord and not speak ill of men when others give a railing word we must not rail again ii cross words and angry names require to be chastisd at school and he is in danger of hellfire that calls his brother fool iii but lips that dare be so profane to mock and jeer and scoff at holy things or holy men the lord shall cut them off iv when children in heir wanton play served old elisha so and bid the prophet go his way go up thou baldhead go v god quickly stopped their wicked breath and sent two raging bears that tore them limb from limb to death with blood and groans and tears vi great god how terrible are thou to sinners ever so young grant me thy grace and teach me how to tame and rule my tongue song xix against swearing and cursing and taking gods name in vain i angels that high in glory dwell adore thy name almighty god and devils tremble down in hell beneath the terrors of thy rod ii and yet how wicked children dare abuse thy dreadful glorious name and when they are angry how they swear and curse their fellows and blaspheme iii how will they stand before thy face who treated thee with such disdain while thou shall doom them to the place of everlasting fire and pain iv then never shall one cooling drop to quench their burning tongues be given but i will praise thee here and hope thus to employ my tongue in heaven v my heart shall be in pain to hear wretches affront the lord above it is that great god whose power i fear that heavenly father whom i love vi if my companions grow profane i will leave their friendship when i hear young sinners take thy name in vain and learn to curse and learn to swear song xx against idleness and mischief i how does the little busy be improve each shining hour and gather honey all the day from every opening flower ii how skilfully she builds her cell how neat she spreads the wax and labors hard to store it well with the sweet food she makes iii in works of labor or of skill i would be busy too for satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do iv in books or work or healthful play let my first years be past that i may give for every day some good account at last song xxi against evil company i why should i join with those in play in whom i have no delight who curse and swear but never pray who call ill names and fight ii i hate to hear a wanton song their words offend mine ears i should not dare defile my tongue with language such as theirs iii away from fools i will turn mine eyes nor with the scoffers go i would be walking with the wise that wiser i may grow iv from one rude boy that is used to mock they learn the wicked jest one sickly sheep infects the flock and poisons all the rest v my god i hate to walk or dwell with sinful children here then let me not be sent to hell where none but sinners are song xxii against pride in clothes i why should our garments made to hide our parents shame provoke our pride the art of dress did never begin till eve our mother learnt to sin ii when first she put the covering on her robe of innocence was gone and yet her children vainly boast in the sad marks of glory lost iii how proud we are how fond to show our clothes and call them rich and new when the poor sheep and silkworm wore that very clothing long before iv the tulip and the butterfly appear in gayer coats than i let me be dressed fine as i will flies worms and flowers exceed me still v then will i set my heart to find inward adornings of the mind knowledge and virtue truth and grace these are the robes of richest dress vi no more shall worms with me compare this is the raiment angels wear the son of god when here below put on this blessed apparel too vii it never fades it never grows old nor fears the rain nor moth nor mold it takes no spot but still refines the more it is worn the more it shines viii in this on earth should i appear then go to heaven and wear it there god will approve it in his sight it is his own work and his delight song xxiii obedience to parents i let children that would fear the lord hear what their teachers say with reverence meet their parents word and with delight obey ii have you not heard what dreadful plagues are threatened by the lord to him that breaks his fathers law or mocks his mothers word iii what heavy guilt upon him lies how cursed is his name the ravens shall pick out his eyes and eagles eat the same iv but those who worship god and give their parents honor due here on this earth they long shall live and live hereafter too song xxiv the childs complaint i why should i love my sports so well so constant at my play and lose the thoughts of heaven and hell and then forget to pray ii what do i read my bible for but lord to learn thy will and shall i daily know thee more and less obey thee still iii how senseless is my heart and wild how vain are all my thoughts pity the weakness of a child and pardon all my faults iv make me thy heavenly voice to hear and let me love to pray since god will lend a gracious ear to what a child can say song xxv a morning song i my god who makes the sun to know his proper hour to rise and to give light to all below does send him round the skies ii when from the chambers of the east his morning race begins he never tires nor stops to rest but round the world he shines iii so like the sun would i fulfill the business of the day begin my work betimes and still march on my heavenly way iv give me o lord thy early grace nor let my soul complain that the young morning of my days has all been spent in vain song xxvi an evening song i and now another day is gone i will sing my makers praise my comforts every hour make known his providence and grace ii but how my childhood runs to waste my sins how great their sum lord give me pardon for the past and strength for days to come iii i lay my body down to sleep let angels guard my head and through the hours of darkness keep their watch around my bed iv with cheerful heart i close my eyes since thou will not remove and in the morning let me rise rejoicing in thy love song xxvii for the lords day morning i this is the day when christ arose so early from the dead why should i keep my eyelids closed and waste my hours in bed ii this is the day when jesus broke the power of death and hell and shall i still wear satans yoke and love my sins so well iii today with pleasure christians meet to pray and hear the word and i would go with cheerful feet to learn thy will o lord iv i will leave my sport to read and pray and so prepare for heaven o may i love this blessed day the best of all the sevn song xxviii for the lords day evening i lord how delightful it is to see a whole assembly worship thee at once they sing at once they pray they hear of heaven and learn the way ii i have been there and still would go it is like a little heaven below not all my pleasure and my play shall tempt me to forget this day iii o write upon my memory lord the text and doctrines of thy word that i may break thy laws no more but love thee better than before iv with thoughts of christ and things divine fill up this foolish heart of mine that hoping pardon through his blood i may lie down and wake with god the ten commandments out of the old testament put into short rhyme for children exodus chap xx   thou shall have no more gods but me   before no idol bow thy knee   take not the name of god in vain   nor dare the sabbath day profane   give both thy parents honor due   take heed that thou no murder do   abstain from words and deeds unclean   nor steal though thou art poor and mean   nor make a wilful lie nor love it  0 what is thy neighbors dare not covet the sum of the commandments out of the new testament matt xxii    with all thy soul love god above and as thyself thy neighbor love our saviors golden rule matt vii    be you to others kind and true as you would have others be to you and neither do nor say to men whatever you would not take again duty to god and our neighbor love god with all your soul and strength with all your heart and mind and love your neighbor as yourself be faithful just and kind deal with another as you would have another deal with you what youre unwilling to receive be sure you never do out of my book of hymns i have here added the hosanna and glory to the father etc to be sung at the end of any of these songs according to the direction of parents or governors the hosanna or salvation ascribed to christ long meter i hosanna to king davids son who reigns on a superior throne we bless the prince of heavenly birth who brings salvation down on earth ii let every nation every age in this delightful work engage old men and babes in sion sing the growing glories of her king common meter i hosanna to the prince of grace sion behold thy king proclaim the son of davids race and teach the babes to sing ii hosanna to the eternal word who from the father came ascribe salvation to the lord with blessings on his name short meter i hosanna to the son of david and of god who brought the news of pardon down and bought it with his blood ii to christ the anointed king be endless blessings given let the whole earth his glory sing who made our peace with heaven glory to the father and the son etc long meter to god the father god the son and god the spirit three in one be honor praise and glory given by all on earth and all in heaven common meter now let the father and the son and spirit be adored where there are works to make him known or saints to love the lord short meter give to the father praise give glory to the son and to the spirit of his grace be equal honor done specimen of moral songs such as i wish some happy and condescending genius would undertake for the use of children and perform much better the sense and subjects might be borrowed plentifully from the proverbs of solomon from all the common appearances of nature from all the occurrences in civil life both in city and country which would also afford matter for other divine songs here the language and measures should be easy and flowing with cheerfulness with or without the solemnities of religion or the sacred names of god and holy things that children might find delight and profit together  this would be one effectual way to deliver them from the temptation of loving or learning those idle wanton or profane songs which give so early an ill taint to the fancy and memory and become the seeds of future vices  i the sluggard i it is the voice of the sluggard i heard him complain you have waked me too soon i must slumber again as the door on its hinges so he on his bed turns his sides and his shoulders and his heavy head ii a little more sleep and a little more slumber thus he wastes half his days and his hours without number and when he gets up he sits folding his hands or walks about sauntring or trifling he stands iii i passed by his garden and saw the wild brier the thorn and the thistle grow broader and higher the clothes that hang on him are turning to rags and his money still wastes till he starves or he begs iv i made him a visit still hoping to find he had took better care for improving his mind he told me his dreams talked of eating and drinking but he scarce reads his bible and never loves thinking v said i then to my heart here is a lesson for me that mans but a picture of what i might be but thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding who taught me betimes to love working and reading ii innocent play i a broad in the meadows to see the young lambs run sporting about by the side of their dams with fleeces so clean and so white or a nest of young doves in a large open cage when they play all in love without anger or rage how much may we learn from the sight ii if we had been ducks we might dabble in mud or dogs we might play till it ended in blood so foul and so fierce are their natures but thomas and william and such pretty names should be cleanly and harmless as doves or as lambs those lovely sweet innocent creatures iii not a thing that we do nor a word that we say should hinder another in jesting or play for he is still in earnest that is hurt how rude are the boys that throw pebbles and mire there is none but a madman will fling about fire and tell you it is all but in sport iii the rose i how fair is the rose what a beautiful flower the glory of april and may but the leaves are beginning to fade in an hour and they wither and die in a day ii yet the rose has one powerful virtue to boast above all the flowers of the field when its leaves are all dead and fine colors are lost still how sweet a perfume it will yield iii so frail is the youth and the beauty of men though they bloom and look gay like the rose but all our fond care to preserve them is vain time kills them as fast as he goes iv then i will not be proud of my youth or my beauty since both of them wither and fade but gain a good name by welldoing my duty this will scent like a rose when i am dead iv the thief i why should i deprive my neighbor of his goods against his will hands were made for honest labor not to plunder or to steal ii it is a foolish selfdeceiving by such tricks to hope for gain all that is ever got by thieving turns to sorrow shame and pain iii have not eve and adam taught us their sad profit to compute to what dismal state they brought us when they stole forbidden fruit iv often we see a young beginner practice little pilfring ways till grown up a hardened sinner then the gallows ends his days v theft will not be always hidden though we fancy none can spy when we take a thing forbidden god beholds it with his eye vi guard my heart o god of heaven lest i covet what is not mine lest i steal what is not given guard my heart and hands from sin v the ant or emmet i these emmets how little they are in our eyes we tread them to dust and a troop of them dies without our regard or concern yet as wise as we are if we went to their school there is many a sluggard and many a fool some lessons of wisdom might learn ii they dont wear their time out in sleeping or play but gather up corn in a sunshiny day and for winter they lay up their stores they manage their work in such regular forms one would think they foresaw all the frosts and the storms and so brought their food within doors iii but i have less sense than a poor creeping ant if i take not due care for the things i shall want nor provide against dangers in time when death or old age shall stare in my face what a wretch shall i be in the end of my days if i trifle away all their prime iv now now while my strength and my youth are in bloom let me think what will serve me when sickness shall come and pray that my sins be forgiven let me read in good books and believe and obey that when death turns me out of this cottage of clay i may dwell in a palace in heaven vi good resolutions i though i am now in younger days nor can tell what shall befall me i will prepare for every place where my growing age shall call me ii should i ever be rich or great others shall partake my goodness i will supply the poor with meat never showing scorn or rudeness iii where i see the blind or lame deaf or dumb i will kindly treat them i deserve to feel the same if i mock or hurt or cheat them iv if i meet with railing tongues why should i return them railing since i best revenge my wrongs by my patience never failing v when i hear them telling lies talking foolish cursing swearing first i will try to make them wise or i will soon go out of hearing vi what though i be low and mean i will engage the rich to love me while i am modest neat and clean and submit when they reprove me vii if i should be poor and sick i shall meet i hope with pity since i love to help the weak though they are neither fair nor witty viii i will not willingly offend nor be easily offended what is amiss i will strive to mend and endure what cannot be mended ix may i be so watchful still over my humors and my passion as to speak and do no ill though it should be all the fashion x wicked fashions lead to hell never may i be found complying but in life behave so well not to be afraid of dying a summer evening i how fine has the day been how bright was the sun how lovely and joyful the course that he run though he rose in a mist when his race he begun and there followed some droppings of rain but now the fair travellers come to the west his rays are all gold and his beauties are best he paints the sky gay as he sinks to his rest and foretells a bright rising again ii just such is the christian his course he begins like the sun in a mist while he mourns for his sins and melts into tears then he breaks out and shines and travels his heavenly way but when he comes nearer to finish his race like a fine setting sun he looks richer in grace and gives a sure hope at the end of his days of rising in brighter array some copies of the following

story how the jews abused their king how they served the lord of glory makes me angry while i sing ix see the kinder shepherds round him telling wonders from the sky where they sought him there they found him with his virgin mother by x see the lovely babe adressing lovely infant how he smiled when he wept the mothers blessing soothed and hushed the holy child xi lo he slumbers in his manger
