a circular letter to the several petitioning counties cities and towns addressed to their respective general meetings against the late proposition for a triennial election of representatives by granville sharp  second edition  to the gentlemen clergy freeholders and other inhabitants of the gentlemen the last general meeting of the county of york having adopted a proposition to shorten the duration of parliament to a term not exceeding three years the worthy gentlemen of your own committee may probably have been induced by the laudable desire of preserving unanimity with that respectable county to recommend the same proposition for your adoption be pleased therefore previously to consider whether it is probable that a majority of the freeholders etc of the yorkshire meeting did really mean to prefer triennial elections to the ancient legal usage and constitution of annual parliaments or whether they may not rather have been induced to postpone the open declaration of their loyal attachment to that ancient law for frequent parliaments viz every year once and more often if need be merely through a desire to preserve the unanimity of their own meeting by yielding a little for the present to the prejudices of a few particular gentlemen among them persons indeed of great worth and esteem in many respects and whose sentiments in general deserve the utmost attention and regard but who unhappily in this point are apt to conceive that annual elections and more often if need be would be attended with some inconveniences to themselves  you have undoubtedly in your own county also several worthy gentlemen of fortune to whom great respect is due from the people on account of their known independence and steady opposition to bad measures in general who nevertheless perhaps may entertain the same erroneous conceptions of frequent elections and therefore you can by your own feelings i mean your respect and esteem for such worthy men more easily judge of the effect which the same kind of laudable influence must necessarily have caused in the yorkshire meeting which is the best reason i believe that can be assigned for their having adopted that unconstitutional measure  you are therefore most earnestly requested to consider the following plain propositions  i that though great deference and respect be certainly due to such worthy and independent gentlemen as i have described yet your condescension to them ought to have some due limitation  ii that the bounds of the ancient parliamentary constitution of the kingdom ought surely to mark out the utmost extent of your compliance with the worthy part of the aristocratical interest  iii that if on the contrary your endeavors to preserve unanimity should carry you beyond these legal bounds you will really injure those very gentlemen whom you wish to oblige as well as the whole aristocratical interest the crown the lords the country gentlemen in general because there is but one true common interest which the fundamental laws of the constitution alone can preserve consider also  iv that unanimity is as baneful in a bad measure as it is salutary in a good one and  v that if any compliance in proceedings is to be made at all for the sake of unanimity it ought certainly to be made where a compliance is most due viz to the constitutional resolutions of a select body of intelligent gentlemen deputed to a national conference by freelyelected committees from a very considerable proportion of the counties and most populous cities and towns in england  to resolutions which were unanimously agreed upon by the said deputies and therefore a compliance for the sake of unanimity was most justly due to them and the more especially as it appears that they formed their conclusions by the fundamental laws and usages of the constitution the deputies in their memorial declare that shortening the duration of the sitting of parliament can only be done consistently with the constitution or with the best policy in any enlarged view by shortening it to the period of a year and this they farther explain in the words of the old statutes viz that a parliament should be holden once every year and more often if need be from whence it is manifest that the longest duration consistent with the constitution is the period of one single session even though two or more such sessions should be necessary in one or the same year the striking similarity also of this deputation in many respects to an ancient example of a national deputation from all the counties cited on this occasion by lord carysfort see page    of his lordships very judicious and loyal letter to the committee of the county of huntingdon from hoveden adds great weight to the resolutions in question as well as to the importance of that unanimity with which they were formed  vi that the members of the late deputation have unanimously declared in their memorial that annual parliaments are the ancient constitution of this kingdom and the birthright of englishmen and in the three last paragraphs of their memorial which are highly worthy your most careful attention have not only proved that the old laws requiring a parliament to be holden every year once and more often if need be meant a new parliament every year etc by the instances of writs issued two or three times in the same year for new elections but they also prove from the experience of former ages that these very frequent elections were not attended with any such inconveniences as the advocates for long parliaments commonly pretend but on the contrary recommend them as consistent with the greatest peace etc  the fact is say the deputies from the several petitioning counties etc during the whole of that reign king edw iii and for the first eighteen years of the following one writs were annually issued and in some instances two or three times in the same year for new elections till richard ii made himself absolute and various were the occasions in those times when the commons gave for answer to any new propositions of magnitude that they dared not agree without conference with their countries at what period then was it that the consent of the people was asked and obtained to so momentous a proposal as that of divesting them of their expected control over their representatives in fact of changing the terms on which the delegation had passed from their hands annual parliaments are therefore the ancient constitution of england and the birthright of englishmen  nor are they less beneficial in policy than unalienable in right in the language of ancient times before the prejudices of habit had thrown false colors over names and things they were ever described as consistent with the greatest peace and most peaceably conducted and in parliamentary records for more than two hundred years together from    hen iii till    edw iv we find not so much as one double return nor more than two or three instances of elections questioned on any ground  a circumstance surely most inviting when put in contrast with that multitude of perplexing enquiries which of late years has consumed so much time in committees to the great hindrance of the national business the plain reason is founded not in the time but in the nature of the thing the duration of the seat was not an object for a violent contest this will also dispel the objection arising from the probability of tumult and expensiveness to remove which it will farther contribute not a little if we would give attention to what passes now among those large bodies of electors who annually choose their corporate officers but the argument against corruption surmounts every thing else nothing can give so much assurance of defeating it as this limitation a seat for three years might induce a mans attention to a bribe he that sits but for one is very unlikely to experience such an offer or will certainly reject it if he would not wish to put all his future expectations to an imminent risque  when once the constitution of parliament is improved in these leading points every thing else that may appear to have its share in reformation must be subordinate in its class and must follow in its time and the more effectually to insure these we entreat you neither at the next or any future election to engage your support to any candidate before you are satisfied that he will give his assistance in parliament to the establishment of so much of these reforms as may not then be accomplished   and therefore you are desired to consider  vii that the yorkshire proposition for shortening the duration of parliaments to a term not exceeding three years is totally different from the shortening of duration explained and recommended by the said deputies as the ancient constitution of the kingdom and the birthright of englishmen and what is worse has been adopted without the least mention of that birthright in any saving clause to assert and preserve your just claim to it for a future time whereby it is manifest that the promoters of this triennial scheme have really been the first offenders against that desirable unanimity which the conference of deputies was intended to effect and therefore the cry of necessary unanimity by which alone that unconstitutional proposition is at present recommended deserves not the least attention what would you be unanimous against the ancient legal parliamentary constitution of the kingdom which the triennial scheme is manifestly calculated to supplant you ought never to forget  viii that the people have already been betrayed by a triennial parliament that the representatives of the people in a triennial parliament usurped the legislative authority of their constituents for a longer time than it was delegated and treacherously presumed without consulting their countries to prolong the duration of parliaments to the present unreasonable term of seven years whereby by they established the basis of that detestable system of corruption which has been the true source of all your present grievances and therefore be pleased to consider   ix that triennial parliaments as well as septennial are manifestly dangerous to the state and so grossly inconsistent with the ancient legal parliamentary constitution of this kingdom that the most essential laws and usages by which that constitution is declared and known are really suspended by them you cannot therefore without notorious disloyalty in the strictest sense of the word adopt the proposition for triennial parliaments so that you have a most ample excuse for not concurring with a few particular gentlemen whom you would otherwise wish to oblige viz that your compliance with them in this matter would exceed the constitutional bounds of condescension mentioned in the three first propositions and would really tend to subvert the peoples just right to more frequent elections  because it is manifest   x that the concession of a popular right made by the people themselves in their collective capacity at their several countymeetings is infinitely more binding upon them to exclude any future claim to the ceded right than the same concession would be if made merely by their representatives in parliament without the instruction or concurrence of the people and therefore you ought to be particularly thankful   xi that the people themselves the great body of constituents have never yet by any such concession betrayed that valuable birthright as the deputies call it the ancient law for annual parliaments it has too often been suspended indeed sometimes through the disloyalty of kings and lastly even by the disloyalty of parliament itself of which the tyrannical triennial and septennial acts are lamentable instances yet as the suspension of it has never been promoted by the requisition or instruction of the people at large their right to it remains entire the presumption and treachery of their representatives in consenting to the triennial and septennial acts cannot injure their just title to it because in both these instances the representatives presumed to act contrary to an established rule of parliament by adopting a new device which even affected a fundamental law of the kingdom without consulting their countries which the constitution absolutely requires in such an important case so that even that unwarrantable presumption of the representatives in neglecting to consult the people is the very circumstance which still preserves that fundamental and essential law as a part of the constitution and as a just right of the people which they are entitled to demand and resume whenever they shall be pleased to instruct their representatives for that purpose and to charge all persons with disloyalty and even treason to the constitution who shall dare to oppose them but if on the contrary the people themselves in their several countycourts or assemblies should be so inconsiderate or so depraved as to consent indiscriminately to the proposition for a triennial election without a saving clause to assert their birthright and reserve their title to more frequent elections which the yorkshire meeting has unwarily done know for a certainty   xii that in such an unhappy inattention to their own rights which i pray to god they may never be cursed with they would betray the constitution of the kingdom  they would betray a fundamental law of their ancestors which would mark their character with an eternal stain of disloyalty and as they may perhaps never have again so favorable an opportunity as the present of recovering their ancient birthright of annual elections it would probably be lost irretrievably lost for ever your new triennial representatives in such a case would most likely behave as former triennial representatives have heretofore done  betray and enslave you by another septennial system of corruption and what is worse you yourselves would most justly deserve it  but i hope better things of you and i trust also that you will excuse the severity of my expressions in this address as being prompted merely by an ardent zeal for your prosperity  old jewry april       0 granville sharp
