some objections humbly offered to the consideration of the hon house of commons relating to the present intended relief of prisoners  london printed for r walker at the whitehart without temple bar e nutt at the royal exchange and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster       price   d  some objections etc part i of the fraud made use of by insolvents to bring themselves within the reach of the acts of parliament with some limitations humbly offered to be considered of in order not to prevent an act of favor to real insolvents but to prevent the abuse of it by improper objects  it is no wonder if after so many petitions from the several prisons almost over the whole kingdom and such horrid cruelties and inhumanities as appears to have been practiced by some jailors especially by the warden of the fleet and his agents upon several unfortunate gentlemen who have fallen into their hands i say it is no wonder if a bill for relief of prisoners is become very popular  by how much the ill usage of the prisoners who are thus abused by the keepers of prisons shocks the tender and charitable part in every mans breast by so much the case of the prisoners even of those who have not been used ill prevails upon the public in favor of the grace desired  nor shall one word be said or one thought suggested in this tract in prejudice of the charitable intention of the house or any way to lessen the good and generous disposition of any person whatever whether in the legislature or out of it toward promoting so good a work  far less shall i take one step or speak one word that so much as looks like a plea for the cruelty and inhumanity of jaylors and prisonkeepers their conduct in most if not in all the jails in england calls aloud for a like inspection of authority and for justice upon the persons as well as a severe censure of the practices of the delinquents in order to have that rigid though necessary part of the law called imprisonment for debt be executed with humanity and with equity according to the natural rights of the unfortunate as men and according to their legal rights as englishmen which it is evident has not been observed hitherto  and to conclude this part least of all shall i say one word here in behalf of the persons at this time detected openly in the cruelties inhumanities and extortions which they have practiced upon the unhappy gentlemen who have fallen into their hands i do not see they merit the least favor from their country they have acted a dreadful part and they are in hands which i doubt not will have more mercy than they have shown to the miserable who have been under their power and though i shall not on the other hand prompt or push their misfortune yet this i may say without any prejudice or injury to them that i hope they shall have such justice as will effectually disable them and warn all others of that rough employment from the like practices  having laid down these postulata in order to prevent any prejudging my design in this work or raising a popular clamor as if it was intended to lessen the intended grace of the government or legislature and to prevent the deliverance of prisoners i shall with the more freedom lay down some difficulties which as they occur to me on this occasion shall be worth the consideration of the legislature not to lie as obstructions in the way of the intended bill as a reason sine qua non but that the parliament taking them into their hands and approving or disapproving them as they shall appear important may find out such proper remedies as to their great wisdom shall seem meet  having thus as i hope removed the prejudices which might lie against my present design i must also speak a word or two very briefly to remove if possible a popular objection at least as it is used in the mouths of some who are more particucularly concerned in that part namely that it is unchristian and inhuman and inconsistent with a generous nation abhorring cruelty as england professes to be to confine poor miserable people in prison for debt especially such as have nothing to pay  as to the latter part viz of confining people in prison who have nothing to pay i come readily into that part and in doing so i confirm what i have said above that i am not writing in order to intercept the intended grace of the parliament to the unfortunate the honest debtor willing to pay but unable and willing to pay as far as he is able and ready to give all reasonable satisfaction such as the parliament may direct that he is so unable is certainly an object recommending it self to the charity and compassion of the whole nation and whatever intervenes by the fraud of others these and these only are allowed to be the persons for whom the parliamentary grace which has been settled and extended in so many acts of parliament already passed has been intended  that very great numbers of fraudulent unqualifyd wicked and dishonest people have formerly received the benefit of the like grace by the help of false oaths unjust pretenses connivance of jailors bribery and corruption of many kinds has been loudly complained of and i doubt is much easier to prove than to prevent and not being willing as i have said to be any ways a hindrance to the relief of the honest and real objects of grace who are indeed within the intention of the act i cover all that part with saying better ten dishonest debtors escape than that one real object of the intended good should perish  yet i humbly propose it as a thing worthy the consideration of the british parliament whether it is any way probable that there can be such a number of miserable insolvents in one year and that of but the lowest class too namely not owing above  00 l to any one person and all actually prisoners as have presented themselves yearly to the magistrates to be discharged by the grace of parliament for these several years past  if it is true as common fame says it is that notwithstanding there was an act for delivering such prisoners but two years past there are at this time near ninety thousand such insolvents now on the books of the several jails in this kingdom i say if this is true is it rational to believe that these are all really and fairly prisoners within the intent and meaning of the intended grace  it would be a noble undertaking and in my opinion well worth the house of commons though it took up a good part of a session to find out some effectual means to separate between the sheep and the goats speaking of that allusion with due regard in this case and to discover expose and punish the frauds which are put upon the nation in this affair  it is true the people are despicable i mean the guilty the debts they lie for not large at least not to particular men and some may suggest that it is not worth notice but i reply the number is great surprizingly great and the injury to trade is very considerable nor is the matter small among tradesmen though the debts as above are not singly large for as many of these insolvents frequently fall within the compass of one and the same shopkeeper it very often falls heavy and as these fraudulent debtors boldly run into mens books with a dependence upon such acts of grace and with an evident design to cheat and defraud their creditors and this several times over such people are i think very far from being debtors who deserve compassion or within the intent and meaning of the parliamentary grace  likewise they are greatly injurious to trade in general as they ruin innocent tradesmen by their knavery many tradesmen having had thirty to fifty such insolvents discharged by one act though they were never put in prison or so much ar arrested at their suit or for any part of their debt  the usual practice of these people has been to run themselves into the tradesmens books as it is called in as many particular and different places as possible always taking care that it be for small sums within the usual restraint of the acts of grace and then when the expected favor is in prospect get themselves arrested and put in prison or turned over by habeas corpus so to be within the reach of the law and then all the other creditors who have never offered them the least violence are paid with a summons  others by corruption of jailors and by bribery have obtained those jailors to own them as prisoners in custody though not really so for a certain antedated time so as to be brought within the reach of the act  what perjury what forgery what foul things are practiced under this head deserves the inspection of the like authority as lately detected the frauds of the fleetprison a committee who are above the reach of fraud or corruption themselves and fully qualified to search those deeds of darkness to the bottom indeed it seems to be reserved to a house of commons and to them only  it was the saying of a known and judicious writer that no man ought to complain in print of any public grievance unless at the same time he proposed also the remedies i shall take the hint and offer something to the purpose in this case that i may dismiss it as i go i it would go a great way toward preventing this mischief if it was provided in the act that no insolvent should claim the benefit twice over it having been frequent to have them take new credit after their having been once discharged seeking out new places of abode and new creditors who upon a variety of pretenses they insinuate themselves so far into as to get credit with them their former circumstances not being known ii that none should claim the benefit of such an act who had run from their bail made escapes from officers or prisonkeepers upon their parole or that had committed any notorious fraud punishable by law or that had obtained credit upon promise and express conditions before two or more witnesses who shall attest the same not to claim or take the benefit of any such act of grace iii that none should claim such benefit who shall conceal any of their goods and effects from their creditors notwithstanding their having made affidavit as the law directs as in the case of a bankrupt   these provisos together with a new method to be taken to limit and restrain the prisonkeepers to prevent their keeping prisoners on their books after they have been discharged antedating their commitments and giving fraudulent certificates of their being prisoners when really they were not i say these methods and such as these under the farther direction and improvement of the legislature i persuade myself would go a great way to prevent the abuse of parliamentary grace and to make the future acts for relief of insolvents effectually and truly merciful and good and the honest poor prisoner nobody repining at his relief would be delivered the knavish designing debtor remaining as he ought to do where the law directs  this leads me to enter a little into the question so much insisted on by some viz that no man should be put in prison for debt  it is true that this doctrine has many advocates and some have pushed it so far as to think the contrary opinion cruel and unchristian but i shall enquire more particularly into it in the next part  in the mean time i take this occasion to repeat again what i hinted at before namely that this is so far from impeaching the common charity and the compassion of the british nation to prisoners that it prompts and recommends it by the mere nature of the thing for when i argue against the knavery of the debtor in making himself a voluntary prisoner on purpose to defraud and delude his creditors it naturally follows that the prisons should be purged from all such voluntary fraudulent people and those that remain would be the more real and unexceptionable objects of the national grace  when the prisoners were all really insolvent really miserable and that without any room to charge either them or the jailers and keepers with corrupt practices abusing the public mercy and the like the parliament would always be the more ready to pass acts for their relief as they should see cause so that this proposal is evidently calculated to encourage and prompt the mercy of the public to insolvents by removing all the just objections which now lie in the way and have so often obstructed it  part ii of the necessity of preserving to the creditor the right of arresting and imprisoning the person of his debtor and how the petty credit given in all retail trade and which is essential to the support of our whole commerce depends upon it  i believe it will not be called begging the question to lay it down as a foundation that as there is a greater trade carried on in england than in any other nation in europe so there is a larger personal credit given in trade here than in any other nation not in europe only but in the whole world  there are so many evidences of the first and so many authors have written on that subject that i need only refer my reader to them and the last is evident to every merchant now in trade who sees with the least observation what difference there is between the way of trading here and the like way of trading in foreign countries and between the credit given in either  some would make it a question though i think it is no question whether the greatness of our trade is the cause of giving this large credit or that the giving this large credit is the cause of the greatness of our trade  i say there is no room to debate this part the latter is evident to demonstration namely that the giving such large credit is the true spring of the greatness of our trade this appears by comparing the bulk of the trade in this kingdom with the bulk of our current stock in trade if no credit was given the trade could not go beyond the stock it is true it might go beyond the current coin because some trade may be carried on by barter or exchanging one kind of goods for another without the interposition of any medium which is money but no trade can go beyond the stock without credit because one value must always be delivered for another and they must be always equal too otherwise the exchange is not equal nor the payment complete  but in credit the case is quite different for here the seller delivers his goods which are a real value to the buyer on his note for payment or perhaps on his verbal promise either of which is an imaginary value only in a word the fame or reputation of a buyer is put into the scale of commerce with the real value and substance of the seller and the one is delivered for the other the account in the tradesmans ledger stands as a register of the case the buyer stands debtor on one side for the value of the goods sold and delivered to him against an open blank on the contrary side to be filled up to his creditor when he pays the money  by this strange thing called credit all the mighty wonders of an exalted commerce are performed a tradesman beginning with a thousand pound cash and a good character shall store his shop or warehouse with  000 l in goods and may trade for  0000 nay for  0000 l per annum and so long as he manages prudently pays currently and keeps up his reputation shall run almost what length he pleases in his trade so much greater a stroke in trade does his character furnish to him than his cash  upon the foot of this very article called credit as a private man may trade for  0000 l per annum with but  000 l stock so if the stock of the whoe trade of great britain be as some insist ten millions the trade may actually return a hundred millions of pounds sterling in a year an immense sum but not at all improbable to be true and perhaps within compass too  but to bring it down to the subject take the credit given in smaller articles i mean in retailing goods to the last consumer this is what i call petty credit and is the particular thing which fills our jails with insolvent prisoners even this petty credit is though small in the particular immensely great in the general and though it does not increase the stock of the retailer it certainly does increase his trade and causes him to sell a great deal more goods than otherwise he would find customers for  thus the wholesale dealer trusts or gives credit to the retailer and thereby increases his stock for credit in trade is stock in trade the retailer gives credit to the conumer and thereby increases his sale  now upon what foundation is all this credit given the retailer being a woollendraper trusts his neighbor with a suit of clothes how comes he to do it perhaps the man has no extraordinary character well but says the retailer he is a tradesman as well as i and he must pay me or he shall not be able to stand at his shop door or sit behind his counter for i will arrest him and make him pay me and upon this power of arresting the debtor and carrying him to prison or whether he is carried to prison or no the exposing him disgracing him and ruining his credit i say upon this is founded the freedom of the tradesman to trust him  if you destroy this power of coercion you destroy the credit in trade for if the man cannot be credited he cannot buy and if the tradesman cannot arrest him he will not sell  this particular case merits to be very well observed and there is more weight in it than perhaps appears at first view   i say if the buyer cannot be trusted he cannot buy that is to say he cannot buy at that time he will make shift for a while will wear his old clothes longer go without such or such fine things for himself or wife or children and abate in his expense because he has not money to buy and the shopkeeper will not trust him even the drunkard will abate his liquor if the alehouse or tavernkeeper will not admit him to score abundance of luxury and gaiety as well in food as fine things must abate for want of ready money whereas men will venture to buy if they have credit with the tradesman  to say let luxury and extravagance abate it will perhaps reform the town is to say nothing for the question does not lie that way it is not whether the luxury will abate but will our trade abate or not if the trade abates as it certainly will my argument is good    on the other hand if the buyer cannot buy the seller cannot sell then his stock lies dead on his hands the money for it and for which perhaps he has been trusted himself grows due and he cannot pay he had better sell and give some credit but he is afraid to do that because if his debtor refuses to pay he cannot force him to it in short he must trust or shut up shop and break and thus if a law should be made to prevent arresting the person of the debtor you at once destroy personal credit and ruin the tradesmen   i remember an attempt ignorantly made as it appeared afterward even by the tradesmen themselves to destroy this petty credit the shopkeepers mightily affected to write over their shopdoors no trust by retail but the consequence soon appeared to the opening their understandings for thousands of buyers who laid out their money freely and who though they might not always pay down upon the spot yet paid tolerably well went from their shops and bought where they knew they could be trusted  in a word any law which abates petty credit or trust by retail will be fatal to trade and would give such a blow to our commerce in general as it would be impossible for all our heads put together to retrieve  therefore if we will support trade we must encourage petty credit and if you will support petty credit you must not take away the security to the creditor the security of the tradesmans trusting his neighbor is the power he has by law to enforce his payment and of arresting and imprisoning the debtor if he fails or refuses the law is the tradesmans security and if you take away the law which is his security you take away his trade  what is the reason why in scotland and in other countries they have so little trade it is because you cannot enforce your demand of debt you cannot send the debtor to prison and therefore no man buys till he has money to pay if you will imprison the debtor you must allow him a maintenance or he will come out before your face  it may be true that there is some humanity in such a law but i cannot say there is any policy in it for it overthrows personal credit and that in effect sinks trade lessens the consumption of goods and ruins the tradesmen themselves i cannot but think it were much better to have an act of mercy every year to release poor insolvents upon reasonable conditions than not have it in the tradesmans power to imprison them when they do not pay for this mercy will not be so prejudicial to the particular creditors as the other would be to the general credit  it is our business to increase our trade to the utmost by all lawful methods nay wise men in commerce tell us some errors even in morality had better be winked at than the trade be ruined or than any general head of trade be impaired the meaning is that in some cases even our luxury or highliving i do not mean our drunkenness and vice is so essential to our trade that it were better continued than be entirely suppressed the trade would suffer so much  it must be confessed a set of sumptuary laws as they are called to reform our extravagancies in equipages and dress housefurniture and diet would effectually ruin our commerce starve and leave unemployd our poor and reduce the whole nation to a most deplorable condition of misery and distress  it would be the like in case of a stop to credit for it would be an abatement of the consumption in all sorts of goods as well our manufactures and home product as our importation from abroad for as the last consumer is the life of all if credit abates he abates his expense and buys less consequently trade declines and less is consumed by credit here that i may explain things as i go i must be understood to mean not public credit i have nothing to do with that part here but personal credit the ordinary credit given by one tradesman to another as well in wholesale dealing and merchandising as in retailing from the shopkeeper to his neighbors and customers and indeed chiefly the last for on that does the wholesale part depend  upon this foundation i build the consequences which i insist upon as above this trust by retail this petty credit entirely depends upon the right which every citizen thus selling his goods to his neighbor upon his word that is upon his personal credit has by law to sue arrest imprison and keep in prison his debtor if he delays or refuses to pay the money when it is due  if you take away this right you take away the credit for no man will sell his goods upon a faith which the debtor is not obliged to keep  it is a great mistake to say personal credit is given upon the honor and faith of the debtor the case is quite otherwise the credit is given to the law it is my being able to prosecute the debtor in a course of law and as we call it make him pay me that encourages me to trust him and therefore it is the ordinary enquiry of a tradesman when he would inform himself about a man he deals with not whether he be honest but whether he is able if you tell him he is a knave and will not pay any body if he can help it o says the tradesman i dont value that i am willing to get off the goods and if he is able i will venture for i know how to make him willing  nor does any part of this discourse to repeat it again tend in the least to prevent our tenderness to any of these debtors who are thus imprisoned if by disasters losses misfortunes or any visible accident they are rendered really poor and unable but that such should always be relieved and if the creditor be cruel and inexorable as some perhaps will always be the parliament will on all just occasions of which also they are the proper judges deliver such insolvents by acts of clemency and grace as they do now and no christian tradesman can i think repine at their commiserating and relieving unfortunate though otherwise honest insolvents  finis
