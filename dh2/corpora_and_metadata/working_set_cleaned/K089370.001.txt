pamela or virtue rewarded in a series of familiar letters from a beautiful young damsel to her parents now first published in order to cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the minds of the youth of both sexes  a narrative which has its foundation in truth and nature and at the same time that it agreeably entertains by a variety of curious and affecting incidents is entirely divested of all those images which in too many pieces calculated for amusement only tend to inflame the minds they should instruct  in two volumes  the third edition to which are prefixed extracts from several curious letters written to the editor on the subject  vol i  london printed for c rivington in st pauls churchyard and j osborn in paternoster row  m dcc xli  preface by the editor if to divert and entertain and at the same time to instruct and improve the minds of the youth of both sexes  if to inculcate religion and morality in so easy and agreeable a manner as shall render them equally delightful and profitable to the younger class of readers as well as worthy of the attention of persons of maturer years and understandings  if to set forth in the most exemplary lights the parental the filial and the social duties and that from low to high life  if to paint vice in its proper colors to make it deservedly odious and to set virtue in its own amiable light to make it truly lovely  if to draw characters justly and to support them equally  if to raise a distress from natural causes and to excite compassion from proper motives  if to teach the man of fortune how to use it the man of passion how to subdue it and the man of intrigue how gracefully and with honor to himself to reclaim  if to give practical examples worthy to be followed in the most critical and affecting cases by the modest virgin the chaste bride and the obliging wife  if toeffect all these good ends in so probable so natural so lively a manner as shall engage the passions of every sensible reader and strongly interest them in the edifying story  and all without raising a single idea throughout the whole that shall shock the exactest purity even in those tender instances where the exactest purity would be most apprehensive  if these embellished with a great variety of entertaining incidents be laudable or worthy recommendations of any work the editor of the following letters which have their foundation in truth and nature ventures to assert that all these desirable ends are obtained in these sheets and as he is therefore confident of the favorable reception which he boldly bespeaks for this little work he thinks any further preface or apology for it unnecessary and the rather for two reasons  st because he can appeal from his own passions which have been uncommonly moved in perusing these engaging scenes to the passions of every one who shall read them with the least attention and in the next place because an editor may reasonably be supposed to judge with an impartiality which is rarely to be met with in an author toward his own works  the editor  to the editor of the piece entitled pamela or virtue rewarded dear sir i have had inexpressible pleasure in the perusal of your pamela it entirely answers the character you give of it in your preface nor have you said one word too much in commendation of a piece that has advantages and excellencies peculiar to itself for besides the beautiful simplicity of the style and a happy propriety and clearness of expression the letters being written under the immediate impression of every circumstance which occasioned them and that to those who had a right to know the fair writers most secret thoughts the several passions of the mind must of course be more affectingly described and nature may be traced in her undisguised inclinations with much more propriety and exactness than can possibly be found in a detail of actions long past which are never recollected with the same affections hopes and dreads with which they were felt when they occurred  this little book will infallibly be looked upon as the hitherto muchwanted standard or pattern for this kind of writing for it abounds with lively images and pictures with incidents natural surprising and perfectly adapted to the story with circumstances interesting to persons in common life as well as to those in exalted stations the greatest regard is every where paid in it to decency and to every duty of life there is a constant fitness of the style to the persons and characters described pleasure and instruction here always go hand in hand vice and virtue are set in constant opposition and religion everywhere inculcated in its native beauty and cheerful amiableness not dressed up in stiff melancholy or gloomy forms on one hand nor yet on the other debased below its due dignity and noble requisites in compliment to a too fashionable but depraved taste and this i will boldly say that if its numerous beauties are added to its excellent tendency it will be found worthy a place not only in all families especially such as have in them young persons of either sex but in the collections of the most curious and polite readers for as it borrows none of its excellencies from the romantic flights of unnatural fancy its being founded in truth and nature and built upon experience will be a lasting recommendation to the discerning and judicious while the agreeable variety of occurrences and characters in which it abounds will not fail to engage the attention of the gay and more sprightly readers  the moral reflections and uses to be drawn from the several parts of this admirable history are so happily deduced from a crowd of different events and characters in the conclusion of the work that i shall say the less on that head but i think the hints you have given me should also prefatorily be given to the public viz that it will appear from several things mentioned in the letters that the story must have happened within these thirty years past that you have been obliged to vary some of the names of persons places etc and to disguise a few of the circumstances in order to avoid giving offense to some persons who would not choose to be pointed out too plainly in it though they would be glad it may do the good so laudably intended by the publication and as you have in confidence submitted to my opinion some of those variations i am much pleased that you have so managed the matter as to make no alteration in the facts and at the same time have avoided the digressive prolixity too frequently used on such occasions  little book charming pamela face the world and never doubt of finding friends and admirers not only in thine own country but far from home where thou may give an example of purity to the writers of a neighboring nation which now shall have an opportunity to receive english bullion in exchange for its own dross which has so long passed current among us in pieces abounding with all the levities of its volatile inhabitants the reigning depravity of the times has yet left virtue many votaries of their protection you need not despair may every headstrong libertine whose hands you reach be reclaimed and every tempted virgin who reads you imitate the virtue and meet the reward of the highmeriting though lowdescended pamela i am sir  your most obedient and faithful servant j b d f  to my worthy friend the editor of pamela sir i return the manuscript of pamela by the bearer which i have read with a great deal of pleasure it is written with that spirit of truth and agreeable simplicity which though much wanted is seldom found in those pieces which are calculated for the entertainment and instruction of the public it carries conviction in every part of it and the incidents are so natural and interesting that i have gone handinhand and sympathizd with the pretty heroine in all her sufferings and been extremely anxious for her safety under the apprehensions of the bad consequences which i expected every page would ensue from the laudable resistance she made i have interested myself in all her schemes of escape been alternately pleased and angry with her in her restraint pleased with the little machinations and contrivances she set on foot for her release and angry for suffering her fears to defeat them always lamenting with a most sensible concern the miscarriages of her hopes and projects in short the whole is so affecting that there is no reading it without uncommon concern and emotion thus far only as to the entertainment it gives  as to instruction and morality the piece is full of both it shows virtue in the strongest light and renders the practice of it amiable and lovely the beautiful sufferer keeps it ever in her view without the least ostentation or pride she has it so strongly implanted in her that through the whole course of her sufferings she does not so much as hesitate once whether she shall sacrifice it to liberty and ambition or not but as if there were no other way to free and save herself carries on a determined purpose to persevere in her innocence and wade with it throughout all difficulties and temptations or perish under them it is an astonishing matter and well worth our most serious consideration that a young beautiful girl in the low scene of life and circumstance in which fortune placed her without the advantage of a friend capable to relieve and protect her or any other education than what occurred to her from her own observation and little reading in the course of her attendance on her excellent mistress and benefactress could after having a taste of ease and plenty in a higher sphere of life than what she was born and first brought up in resolve to return to her primitive poverty rather than give up her innocence i say it is surprising that a young person so circumstanced could in contempt of proffered grandeur on the one side and in defiance of penury on the other so happily and prudently conduct herself through such a series of perplexities and troubles and withstand the alluring baits and almost irresistible offers of a fine gentleman so universally admired and esteemed for the agreeableness of his person and good qualities among all his acquaintance defeat all his measures with so much address and oblige him at last to give over his vain pursuit and sacrifice his pride and ambition to virtue and become the protector of that innocence which he so long and so indefatigably labored to supplant and all this without ever having entertained the least previous design or thought for that purpose no art used to inflame him no coquetry practiced to tempt or entice him and no prudery or affectation to tamper with his passions but on the contrary artless and unpractised in the wiles of the world all her endeavors and even all her wishes tended only to render herself as unamiable as she could in his eyes though at the same time she is so far from having any aversion to his person that she seems rather prepossessed in his favor and admires his excellencies whilst she condemns his passion for her a glorious instance of selfdenial thus her very repulses became attractions the more she resisted the more she charmed and the very means she used to guard her virtue the more endangered it by inflaming his passions till at last by perseverance and a brave and resolute defense the besieged not only obtained a glorious victory over the besieger but took him prisoner too  i am charmed with the beautiful reflections she makes in the course of her distresses her soliloquies and little reasonings with herself are exceeding pretty and entertaining she pours out all her soul in them before her parents without disguise so that one may judge of nay almost see the inmost recesses of her mind a pure clear fountain of truth and innocence a magazine of virtue and unblemished thoughts  i cannot conceive why you should hesitate a moment as to the publication of this very natural and uncommon piece i could wish to see it out in its own native simplicity which will affect and please the reader beyond all the strokes of oratory in the world for those will but spoil it and should you permit such a murdering hand to be laid upon it to gloss and tinge it over with superfluous and needless decorations which like too much drapery in sculpture and statuary will but encumber it it may disguise the facts mar the reflections and unnaturalize the incidents so as to be lost in a multiplicity of fine idle words and phrases and reduce our sterling substance into an empty shadow or rather frenchify our english solidity into froth and whipsyllabub no let us have pamela as pamela wrote it in her own words without amputation or addition produce her to us in her neat country apparel such as she appeared in on her intended departure to her parents for such best becomes her innocence and beautiful simplicity such a dress will best edify and entertain the flowing robes of oratory may indeed amuse and amaze but will never strike the mind with solid attention  in short sir a piece of this kind is much wanted in the world which is but too much as well as too early debauched by pernicious novels i know nothing entertaining of that kind that one might venture to recommend to the perusal much less the imitation of the youth of either sex all that i have hitherto read tends only to corrupt their principles mislead their judgments and initiate them into gallantry and loose pleasures  publish then this good this edifying and instructive little piece for their sakes the honor of pamelas sex demands pamela at your hands to show the world an heroine almost beyond example in an unusual scene of life whom no temptations or sufferings could subdue it is a fine and glorious original for the fair to copy out and imitate our own sex too require it of you to free us in some measure from the imputation of being incapable of the impressions of virtue and honor and to show the ladies that we are not inflexible while they are so  in short the cause of virtue calls for the publication of such a piece as this oblige then sir the concurrent voices of both sexes and give us pamela for the benefit of mankind and as i believe its excellencies cannot be long unknown to the world and that there will not be a family without it so i make no doubt but every family that has it will be much improved and bettered by it twill form the tender minds of youth for the reception and practice of virtue and honor confirm and establish those of maturer years on good and steady principles reclaim the vicious and mend the age in general insomuch that as i doubt not pamela will become the bright example and imitation of all the fashionable young ladies of great britain so the truly generous benefactor and rewarder of her exemplary virtue will be no less admired and imitated among the beau monde of our own sex i am  your affectionate friend etc  introduction to the second edition the kind reception which this piece has met with from the public a large impression having been carried off in less than three months deserves not only acknowledgment but that some notice should be taken of the objections that have hitherto come to hand against a few passages in it that so the work may be rendered as unexceptionable as possible and of consequence the fitter to answer the general design of it which is to promote virtue and cultivate the minds of the youth of both sexes  but difficulties having arisen from the different opinions of gentlemen some of whom applauded the very things that others found fault with it was thought proper to submit the whole to the judgment of a gentleman of the most distinguished taste and abilities the result of which will be seen in the subsequent pages  we begin with the following letter at the desire of several gentlemen to whom on a very particular occasion it was communicated and who wished to see it prefixed to the new edition it was directed to the editor of pamela dear sir you have agreeably deceived me into a surprise which it will be as hard to express as the beauties of pamela though i opened this powerful little piece with more expectation than from common designs of like promise because it came from your hands for my daughters yet who could have dreamt he should find under the modest disguise of a novel all the soul of religion goodbreeding discretion goodnature wit fancy fine thought and morality  i have done nothing but read it to others and hear others again read it to me ever since it came into my hands and i find i am likely to do nothing else for i know not how long yet to come because if i lay the book down it comes after me  when it has dwelt all day long upon the ear it takes possession all night of the fancy  it has witchcraft in every page of it but it is the witchcraft of passion and meaning who is there that will not despise the false empty pomp of the poets when he observes in this little unpretending mild triumph of nature the whole force of invention and genius creating new powers of emotion and transplanting ideas of pleasure into that unweeded low garden the heart from the dry and sharp summit of reason  yet i confess there is one in the world of whom i think with still greater respect than of pamela and that is of the wonderful author of pamela  pray who is he dear sir and where and how has he been able to hide hitherto such an encircling and allmastering spirit he possesses every quality that art could have charmed by yet has lent it to and concealed it in nature  the comprehensiveness of his imagination must be truly prodigious  it has stretched out this diminutive mere grain of mustard seed a poor girls little innocent story into a resemblance of that heaven which the best of good books has compared it to  all the passions are his in their most close and abstracted recesses and by selecting the most delicate and yet at the same time most powerful of their springs thereby to act wind and manage the heart he moves us every where with the force of a tragedy  what is there throughout the whole that i do not sincerely admire  i admire in it the strong distinguished variety and picturesque glowing likeness to life of the characters i know hear see and live among em all and if i could paint could return you their faces i admire in it the noble simplicity force aptness and truth of so many modest oeconomical moral prudential religious satirical and cautionary lessons which are introduced with such seasonable dexterity and with so polished and exquisite a delicacy of expression and sentiment that i am only apprehensive for the interests of virtue lest some of the finest and most touching of those elegant strokes of goodbreeding generosity and reflection should be lost under the too gross discernment of an unfeeling majority of readers for whose coarseness however they were kindly designed as the most useful and charitable correctives  one of the bestjudgd peculiars of the plan is that these instructions being conveyed as in a kind of dramatical representation by those beautiful scenes her own letters and journals who acts the most moving and suffering part we feel the force in a threefold effect  from the motive the act and the consequence  but what above all i am charmed with is the amiable goodnature of the author who i am convinced has one of the best and most generous hearts of mankind because mismeasuring other minds by his own he can draw every thing to perfection but wickedness  i became inextricably in love with this delightful defect of his malice  for i found it owing to an excess in his honesty only observe sir with what virtuous reluctance he complies with the demands of his story when he stands in need of some blameable characters though his judgment compels him to mark em with disagreeable colorings so that they make an odious appearance at first he cannot forbear by an unexpected and gradual decline from themselves to soften and transmute all the horror conceived for their baseness till we are arrived through insensible stages at an inclination to forgive it entirely  i must venture to add without mincing the matter what i really believe of this book  it will live on through posterity with such unbounded extent of good consequences that twenty ages to come may be the better and wiser for its influence it will steal first imperceptibly into the hearts of the young and the tender where it will afterward guide and moderate their reflections and resolves when grown older and so a gradual moral sunshine of unaustere and compassionate virtue shall break out upon the world from this trifle for such i dare answer for the author his modesty misguides him to think it  no applause therefore can be too high for such merit and let me abominate the contemptible reserves of meanspirited men who while they but hesitate their esteem with restraint can be fluent and uncheckd in their envy  in an age so deficient in goodness every such virtue as that of this author is a salutary angel in sodom and one who could stoop to conceal a delight he receives from the worthy would be equally capable of submitting to an approbation of the praise of the wicked  i was thinking just now as i returned from a walk in the snow on that old roman policy of exemptions in favor of men who had given a few bodily children to the republic  what superior distinction ought our country to find but that policy and we are at variance for reward of this father of millions of minds which are to owe new formation to the future effect of his influence  upon the whole as i never met with so pleasing so honest and so truly deserving a book i should never have done if i explained all my reasons for admiring its author  if it is not a secret oblige me so far as to tell me his name for since i feel him the friend of my soul it would be a kind of violation to retain him a stranger  i am not able to thank you enough for this highly acceptable present and as for my daughters they have taken into their own hands the acknowledgment due from their gratitude i am  dear sir your etc dec       0  abstract of a second letter from the same gentleman   no sentiments which i have here or in my last expressed of the sweet pamela being more than the bare truth which every man must feel who lends his ear to the enchanting prattler why does the authors modesty mislead his judgment to suspect the style wants polishing  no sir there is an ease a natural air a dignified simplicity and measured fullness in it that resembling life outglows it he has reconciled the pleasing to the proper the thought is everywhere exactly clothed by the expression and becomes its dress as roundly and as close as pamela her countryhabit remember though she put it on with humble prospect of descending to the level of her purpose it adorned her with such unpresumd increase of loveliness sat with such neat propriety of elegant neglect about her that it threw out all her charms with tenfold and resistless influence  and so dear sir it will be always found  when modest beauty seeks to hide itself by casting off the pride of ornament it but displays itself without a covering and so becoming more distinguished by its want of drapery grows stronger from its purposed weakness  there were formed by an anonymous gentleman the following objections to some passages in the work    that the style ought to be a little raised at least so soon as pamela knows the gentlemans love is honorable and when his diffidence is changed to ease and from about the fourth day after marriage it should be equal to the rank she is raised to and charged to fill becomingly    that to avoid the idea apt to be joined with the word  squire the gentleman should be styled sir james or sir john etc and lady davers in a new edition might procure for him the title of a baronet    that if the sacred name were seldomer repeated it would be better for that the wise mans advice is be not righteous overmuch    that the penance which pamela suffers from lady davers might be shortened that she is too timorous after owning her marriage to that lady and ought to have a little more spirit and get away sooner out at the window or call her own servants to protect and carry her to her husbands appointment    that females are too apt to be struck with images of beauty and that the passage where the gentleman is said to span the waist of pamela with his hand is enough to ruin a nation of women by tightlacing    that the word naughty had better be changed to some other as bad faulty wicked vile abominable scandalous which in most places would give an emphasis for which recourse must otherwise be had to the innocent simplicity of the writer an idea not necessary to the moral of the story nor of advantage to the character of the heroine    that the words p  0  foolish thing that i am had better be foolish that i am the same gentleman observes by way of postscript that jokes are often more severe and do more mischief than more solid objections and would have one or two passages altered to avoid giving occasion for the supposition of a double entendre particularly in two places which he mentions viz p     and      he is pleased to take notice of several other things of less moment some of which are merely typographical and very kindly expresses on the whole a high opinion of the performance and thinks it may do a great deal of good for all which as well as for his objections the editor gives him very sincere thanks  others are of opinion that the scenes in many places in the beginning especially are too low and that the passions of lady davers in particular are carried too high and above nature  and others have intimated that pamela ought for example sake to have discharged mrs jewkes from her service  these are the most material objections that have come to hand all which are considered in the following extracts from some of the most beautiful letters that have been written in any language  the gentlemans advice not to alter pamela at all was both friendly and solidly just i run in with full sail to his anchorage that the low scenes are no more out of nature than the high passions of proud lady davers out of nature do they say it is my astonishment how men of letters can read with such absent attention they are so far from out of nature they are absolute nature herself or if they must be confessed her resemblance they are such a resemblance at least as our true face gives our face in the lookingglass  i wonder indeed what it is that the gentlemen who talk of low scenes would desire should be understood by the epithet  nothing properly speaking is low that suits well with the place it is raised to  the passions of nature are the same in the lord and his coachman all that makes them seem different consists in the degrees in the means and the air whereto or wherewith they indulge em if in painting distinctions like these which arise but from the forms of mens manners drawn from birth education and custom a writer falls short of his characters there his scene is a low one indeed whatever high fortune it flattered but to imagine that persons of rank are above a concern for what is thought felt or acted by others of their species between whom and themselves is no difference except such as was owing to accident is to reduce human nature to a lowness  too low for the truth of her frailty   in pamela in particular we owe all to her lowness it is to the docile effects of this lowness of that amiable girl in her birth her condition her hopes and her vanities in every thing in short but her virtue  that her readers are indebted for the moral reward of that virtue and if we are to look for the low among the rest of the servants less lovely though they are than a pamela there is something however so glowingly painted in the lines whereby the author has marked their distinctions  something so movingly forceful in the grief at their parting and joy at the happy return  something so finely at once and so strongly and feelingly varied even in the smallest and least promising little family incidents that i need only appeal from the heads to the hearts of the objectors themselves whether these are low scenes to be censured  and as for the opposite extreme they would quarrel with the highpassiond and untamd lady davers  i could direct em to a dozen or two of quality originals from whom with exception perhaps of her wit one would swear the author had taken her copy  what a sum might these objectors ensure to be paid by the husbands and sons of such termagant hermaphrodite minds upon their making due proof that they were no longer to be found in the kingdom  i know you are too just to imagine me capable of giving any other opinion than my bestweighd and true one but because it is fit you should have reasons in support of a judgment that can neither deserve nor expect an implicit reception i will run over the anonymous letter i herewith return you and note with what lightness even men of goodnatured intention fall into mistakes by neglect in too hasty perusals which their benevolence would take pleasure in blushing at when they discover their weakness in a cooler revisal  the writer of this letter is for having the style raised after pamelas advance in her fortune but surely this was hasty advice because as the letters are writ to her parents it would have looked like forgetting and in some sort insulting the lowliness of their inferior condition to have assumed a new air in her language in place of retaining a steady humility but here it must not be passed unobserved that in her reports of conversations that followed her marriage she does aptly and beautifully heighten her style and her phrases still returning however to her decent simplicity in her addresses to her father and mother  i am against giving a gentleman who has ennobled himself by reforming his vices and rewarding the worth of the friendless the unnecessary new toy of a title it is all strong in nature as it stands in the letters and i dont see how greatness from titles can add likeness or power to the passions so complete a resemblance of truth stands in need of no borrowed pretensions  the only of this writers objections which i think carries weight is that which advises some little contraction of the prayers and appeals to the deity i say little contraction for they are nobly and sincerely pathetic and i say it only in fear lest if fansied too long by the fashionably averse to the subject minds which most want the purposed impression might hazard the loss of its benefit by passing over those pious reflections which if shorter would catch their attention  certainly the gentlemans objection against the persecution that pamela suffers from lady davers in respect to the relation this madwoman bears to the brother is the rashest of all his advices and when he thinks she ought rather to have assumed the protection of her servants he seems unaware of the probable consequence where there was a puppy of quality in the case who had even without provocation drawn his sword on the poor passive pamela far from bearing a thought of exciting an abler resentment to the danger of a quarrel with so worthless a coxcomb how charmingly natural apprehensive and generous is her silence during the recital she makes of her sufferings with regard to this masculine part of the insult as also her prevention of mrs jewkess less delicate bluntness when she was beginning to complain of the whelp lords impertinence  if i were not afraid of a pun i should tell the anonymous letterwriter that he made a too tightlaced objection where he quarrels with the spannd waist of pamela what in the name of unshapeliness could he find to complain of in a beautiful girl of sixteen who was born out of germany and had not yet reached ungraspable roundness  these are wonderful sinkings from purpose where a man is considering such mental and passionate beauties as this gentleman professed to be touched by  but when he goes on to object against the word naughty as applied in the phrase naughty master i grow mortified in fear for our human sufficiency compared with our aptness to blunder for here it is plain this director of anothers discernment is quite blind himself to an elegance one would have thought it impossible not to be struck by  faulty wicked abominable scandalous which are the angry adjectives he prefers to that sweet one would have carried marks of her rage not affliction  whereas naughty contains in one single significant petulance twenty thousand inexpressible delicacies  it insinuates at once all the beautiful struggle between her contempt of his purpose and tender regard for his person her gratitude to himself and his family her recollection of his superior condition  there is in the elegant choice of this halfkind halfpeevish word a neverenough to be praised speaking picture of the conflict betwixt her disdain and her reverence see sir the reason i had for apprehending some danger that the refined generosity in many of the most charming of the sentiments would be lost upon the too coarse conception of some for whose use the author intended them  it is the same case again in foolish thing that i am which this nice unnice gentleman would advise you to change into foolish that i am he does not seem to have tasted the pretty contempt of herself the submissive diminutive so distant from vanity yet allayed by the gentle reluctance in selfcondemnation  and the other fine touches of nature which would all have been lost in the grave sober sound of his dutch emendation  as to his paragraph in postscript i shall say the less of it because the gentlemans own good sense seems to confess by the place he has chosen to rank it in that it ought to be turned out of doors as too dirty for the rest of his letter  in the occasions he is pleased to discover for jokes i either find not that he has any signification at all or such vulgar coarsetasted allusions to loose lowlife idioms that not to understand what he means is both the cleanliest and prudentest way of confuting him  and now sir you will easily gather how far i am from thinking it needful to change any thing in pamela i would not scratch such a beautiful face for the indies  you can hardly imagine how it charms me to hear of a second edition already but the news of still new upon new ones will be found no subject of wonder as it is sure that no family is without sisters or brothers or daughters or sons who can read or wants fathers or mothers or friends who can think so equally certain it is that the train to a parcel of powder does not run on with more natural tendency till it sets the whole heap in a blaze than that pamela enchanting from family to family will overspread all the hearts of the kingdom  as to the objection of those warm friends to honesty who are for having pamela dismiss mrs jewkes there is not one among all these benevolent complainers who would not discern himself to have been laudably in the wrong were he only to be asked this plain question  whether a step both illjudgd and undutiful had not been the reverse of a pamelas character  two or three times over mr b  had informed her that mrs jewkes and himself having been equally involved in one guilt she must forgive or condemn both together after this it grew manifest duty not to treat her with marks of resentment  and as here was a visible necessity to appear not desirous of turning her away so in point of mere moral regard to the bad woman herself it was nobler to retain her with a prospect of correcting in time her loose habit of thinking than by casting her off to the licentious results of her temper abandon her to temptations and danger which a virtue like pamelas could not wish her exposed to  the manner in which this admirable gentleman gives his opinion of the piece and runs through the principal characters is so masterly that the readers of pamela will be charmed by it though they should suppose that his inimitable benevolence has overvalud the piece itself  inspird without doubt by some skill more than human and comprehending in an humble and seemingly artless narration a force that can tear up the heart strings this author has prepared an enamouring philtre for the mind which will excite such a passion for virtue as scarce to leave it in the power of the will to neglect her   longinus i remember distinguishing by what marks we may know the sublime says it is chiefly from an effect that will follow the reading it a delightfullyadhering idea that clings fast to the memory and from which it is difficult for a man to disengage his attention  if this is a proof of the sublime there was never sublimity so lastingly felt as in pamela  not the charmers own prattling idea stuck so close to the heart of her master as the incidents of her story to the thoughts of a reader  the author transports and transforms with a power more extensive than horace requires in his poet   mr b  and the turns of his passions  and the softness yet strength of their amiable object  after having given us the most masterly image of nature that ever was painted take possession of and dwell in the memory  and there too broods the kind and the credulous parson williamss dove without serpentine mixture hatching pity and affection for an honesty so sincere and so silly  there too take their places all the lower supports of this beautiful fabric   i am sometimes transformed into plain goodman andrews and sometimes the good woman his wife  as for old mr longman and jonathan the butler they are sure of me both in their turns  now andthen i am colbrand the swiss but as broad as i stride in that character i can never escape mrs jewkes who often keeps me awake in the night   till the ghost of lady davers drawing open the curtains scares the scarer of me and of pamela   and then i take shelter with poor penitent john and the rest of the men and the maids of all whom i may say with compassionate marcia    the youths divide their reader  and this fine writer adds  i am glad i made war in my last upon the notion of altering the style for having read it twice over since then and to audiences where the tears were applausively eloquent i could hardly here and there find a place where one word can be changed for a better there are some indeed where twere possible to leave out a few without making a breach in the building but in short the author has put so bewitching a mixture together of the raised with the natural and the soft with the strong and the eloquent  that never sentiments were finer and fuller of life never any were uttered so sweetly  even in what relates to the pious and frequent addresses to god i now retract on these two last revisals the consent i half gave on a former to the anonymous writers proposal who advised the author to shorten those beauties  whoever considers his pamela with a view to find matter for censure is in the condition of a passionate lover who breaks in upon his mistress without fear or wit with intent to accuse her and quarrel  he came to her with pique in his purpose but his heart is too hard for his malice  and he goes away more enslaved for complaining  the following delightful story so admirably related will give great pleasure to the reader and we take the liberty of inserting it for that very reason  what a nevertobe satisfied length has this subject always the power of attracting me into and yet before i have done i must by your means tell the author a story which a judge not so skilful in nature as he is might be in danger perhaps of mistaking for a trifling and silly one i expect it should give him the clearest conviction in a case he is subject to question  we have a lively little boy in the family about seven years old  but alas for him poor child quite unfriended and born to no prospect he is the son of an honest poor soldier by a wife grave unmeaning and innocent yet the boy see the power of connubial simplicity is so pretty so genteel and gayspirited that we have made him and designed him our own ever since he could totter and waddle the wanton rogue is half air and every motion he acts by has a spring like pamelas when she threw down the cardtable all this quickness however is tempered by a goodnatured modesty so that the wildest of his flights are thought rather diverting than troublesome he is an hourly foundation for laughter from the top of the house to the parlours and to borrow an attribute from the reverend mr peters though without any note of his music plays a very good fiddle in the family i have told you the history of this tomtit of a prater because ever since my first reading of pamela he puts in for a right to be one of her hearers and having got half her sayings by heart talks in no other language but hers and what really surprises and has charmed me into a certain foretaste of her influence he is at once become fond of his book which before he could never be brought to attend to  that he may read pamela he says without stopping the first discovery we made of this power over so unripe and unfixd an attention was one evening when i was reading her reflections at the pond to some company the little rampant intruder being kept out by the extent of the circle had crept under my chair and was sitting before me on the carpet with his head almost touching the book and his face bowing down toward the fire  he had sat for some time in this posture with a stillness that made us conclude him asleep when on a sudden we heard a succession of heartheaving sobs which while he strove to conceal from our notice his little sides swelled as if they would burst with the throbbing restraint of his sorrow i turned his innocent face to look toward me but his eyes were quite lost in his tears which running down from his cheeks in free currents had formed two sincere little fountains on that part of the carpet he hung over all the ladies in company were ready to devour him with kisses and he has since become doubly a favorite  and is perhaps the youngest of pamelas converts  the same incomparable writer has favored us with an objection that is more material than any we have mentioned which cannot be better stated nor answered than in his own beautiful words viz  an objection is come into my thoughts which i should be glad the author would think proper to obviate in the front of the second edition  there are mothers or grandmothers in all families of affluent fortune who though they may have none of lady daverss insolence will be apt to feel one of her fears  that the example of a gentleman so amiable as mr b  may be followed by the jackies their sons with too blind and unreflecting a readiness nor does the answer of that gentleman to his sisters reproach come quite up to the point they will rest on for though indeed it is true all the world would acquit the best gentleman in it if he married such a waitingmaid as pamela yet there is an illdiscerning partiality in passion that will overthrow all the force of that argument because every beloved maid will be pamela in a judgment obscured by her influence  and since the ground of this fear will seem solid i dont know how to be easy till it is shown nor ought it to be left to the authors modesty that they who consider his design in that light will be found but shortsighted observers  request it of him then to suffer it to be told them that not a limited but general excitement to virtue was the first and great end to his story and that this excitement must have been deficient and very imperfectly offered if he had not looked quite as low as he could for his example because if there had been any degree or condition more remote from the prospect than that which he had chosen to work on that degree might have seemed out of reach of the hope which it was his generous purpose to encourage  and so he was under an evident necessity to find such a jewel in a cottage and exposed too as she was to the severest distresses of fortune with parents unable to support their own lives but from the daily hard product of labor  nor would it have been sufficient to have placed her thus low and distressful if he had not also supposed her a servant and that too in some elegant family for if she had always remained a fellowcottager with her father it must have carried an air of romantic improbability to account for her polite education  if she had wanted those improvements which she found means to acquire in her service it would have been very unlikely that she should have succeeded so well and had destroyed one great use of the story to have allowed such uncommon felicity to the effect of mere personal beauty  and it had not been judicious to have represented her as educated in a superior condition of life with the proper accomplishments before she became reduced by misfortunes and so not a servant but rather an orphan under hopeless distresses  because opportunities which had made it no wonder how she came to be so winningly qualified would have lessened her merit in being so and besides where had then been the purposed excitement of persons in pamelas condition of life by an emulation of her sweetness humility modesty patience and industry to attain some faint hope of arriving in time within view of her happiness  and what a delightful reformation should we see in all families where the vanity of their maids took no turn toward ambition to please but by such innocent measures as pamelas  as it is clear then the author was under a necessity to suppose her a servant he is not to be accountable for mistaken impressions which the charms he has given her may happen to make on wrong heads or weak hearts though in favor of maids the reverse of her likeness  what is it then they may say that the lowness and distance of pamelas condition from the gentlemans who married her proposes to teach the gay world and the fortunate  it is this  by comparison with that infinite remoteness of her condition from the reward which her virtue procured her one great proof is derived which is part of the moral of pamela that advantages from birth and distinction of fortune have no power at all when considered against those from behavior and temper of mind because where the last are not added all the first will be boasted in vain whereas she who possesses the last finds no want of the first in her influence  in that light alone let the ladies of rank look at pamela  such an alarming reflection as that will at the same time that it raises the hope and ambition of the humble correct and mortify the disdain of the proud for it will compel them to observe and acknowledge that it is the turn of their mind not the claims of their quality by which and which only womens charms can be lasting and that while the haughty expectations inseparable from an elevated rank serve but to multiply its complaints and afflictions the condescensions of accomplished humility attracting pity affection and reverence secure an hourly increase of felicity  so that the moral meaning of pamelas goodfortune far from tempting young gentlemen to marry such maids as are found in their families is by teaching maids to deserve to be mistresses to stir up mistresses to support their distinction  we shall only add that it was intended to prefix two neat frontispieces to this edition and to present them to the purchasers of the first and one was actually finished for that purpose but there not being time for the other from the demand for the new impression and the engraving part of that which was done though no expense was spared having fallen very short of the spirit of the passages they were intended to represent the proprietors were advised to lay them aside and were the rather induced to do so from the following observation of a most ingenious gentleman in a letter to the editor i am so jealous says he in behalf of our inward idea of pamelas person that i dread any figured pretense to resemblance for it will be pity to look at an air and imagine it hers that does not carry some such elegant perfection of amiableness as will be sure to find place in the fancy     verses sent to the bookseller for the unknown author of the beautiful new piece called

virtue rewarded in a series of familiar letters etc letter i dear father and mother i have great trouble and some comfort to acquaint you with the trouble is that my good lady died of the illness i mentioned to you and left us all much grieved for her loss for she was a dear good lady and kind to all us her servants much i feared that as i was taken by her ladyship to wait upon her person i should be quite destitute again and forced to return to you and my poor mother who have enough to do to maintain yourselves and as my ladys goodness had put me to write and cast accounts and made me a little expert at my needle and other qualifications above my degree it would have been no easy matter to find a place that your poor pamela was fit for but god whose graciousness to us we have so often experienced at a pinch put it into my good ladys heart on her deathbed just an hour before she expired to recommend to my young master all her servants one by one and when it came to my turn to be recommended for i was sobbing and crying at her pillow she could only say my dear son  and so broke off a little and then recovering  remember my poor pamela  and these were some of her last words o how my eyes run  dont wonder to see the paper so blotted  well but gods will must be done  and so comes the comfort that i shall not be obliged to return back to be a clog upon my dear parents for my master said i will take care of you all my lasses and for you pamela and took me by the hand yes he took my hand before them all for my dear mothers sake i will be a friend to you and you shall take care of my linen god bless him and pray with me my dear father and mother for a blessing upon him for he has given mourning and a years wages to all my ladys servants and i having no wages as yet my lady having said she would do for me as i deserved ordered the housekeeper to give me mourning with the rest and gave me with his own hand four golden guineas and some silver which were in my old ladys pocket when she died and said if i was a good girl and faithful and diligent he would be a friend to me for his mothers sake and so i send you these four guineas for your comfort for providence will not let me want and so you may pay some old debt with part and keep the other part to comfort you both if i get more i am sure it is my duty and it shall be my care to love and cherish you both for you have loved and cherished me when i could do nothing for myself and so you have for us all or what must have become of us i send it by john our footman who goes your way but he does not know what he carries because i seal it up in one of the little pill boxes which my lady had wrapped close in paper that it may not chink and be sure dont open it before him  i know dear father and mother i must give you both grief and pleasure and so i will only say pray for your pamela who will ever be  your most dutiful daughter i have been scared out of my senses for just now as i was folding this letter in my late ladys dressing room in comes my young master good sirs how was i frightened i went to hide the letter in my bosom and he seeing me tremble said smiling who have you been writing to pamela  i said in my confusion pray your honor forgive me  only to my father and mother he said well then let me see how you are come on in your writing o how ashamed i was  he in my fright took it without saying more and read it quite through and then gave it me again  and i said pray your honor forgive me  yet i know not for what for he was always dutiful to his parents and why should he be angry that i was so to mine and indeed he was not angry for he took me by the hand and said you are a good girl pamela to be kind to your aged father and mother i am not angry with you be faithful and diligent and do as you should do and i like you the better for this and then he said why pamela you write a very pretty hand and spell tolerably too i see my good mothers care in your learning has not been thrown away upon you she used to say you loved reading you may look into any of her books to improve yourself so you take care of them to be sure i did nothing but curtesy and cry and was all in confusion at his goodness indeed he is the best of gentlemen i think but i am making another long letter so will only say further that i shall ever be  your dutiful daughter pamela andrews    letter ii in answer to the preceding dear pamela your letter was indeed a great trouble and some comfort to me and your poor mother we are troubled to be sure for your good ladys death who took such care of you and gave you learning and for three or four years past has always been giving you clothes and linen and every thing that a gentlewoman need not be ashamed to appear in but our chief trouble is and indeed a very great one for fear you should be brought to any thing dishonest or wicked by being set so above yourself every body talks how you have come on and what a genteel girl you are and some say you are very pretty and indeed six months since when i saw you last i should have thought so too if you was not our child but what avails all this if you are to be ruined and undone  indeed my dear child we begin to be in great fear for you for what signify all the riches in the world with a bad conscience and to be dishonest we are it is true very poor and find it hard enough to live though once as you know it was better with us but we would sooner live upon the water and clay of the ditches i am forced to dig than to live better at the price of our dear childs ruin  i hope the good squire has no design but when he has given you so much money and speaks so kindly to you and praises your coming on and oh that fatal word that he would be kind to you if you would do as you should do almost kills us with fears  i have spoken to good old widow mumford about it who you know has formerly lived in good families and she puts us in some comfort for she says it is not unusual when a lady dies to give what she has about her person to her waitingmaid and to such as sit up with her in her illness but then why should he smile so kindly upon you why should he take such a poor girl as you by the hand as your letter says he has done twice why should he stoop to read your letter to us and commend your writing and spelling and why should he give you leave to read his mothers books  indeed indeed my dearest child our hearts ache for you and then you seem so full of joy at his goodness so taken with his kind expressions which truly are very great favors if he means well that we fear  yes my dear child we fear  you should be too grateful  and reward him with that jewel your virtue which no riches nor favor nor any thing in this life can make up to you  i too have written a long letter but will say one thing more and that is that in the midst of our poverty and misfortunes we have trusted in gods goodness and been honest and doubt not to be happy hereafter if we continue to be good though our lot is hard here but the loss of our dear childs virtue would be a grief that we could not bear and would bring our gray hairs to the grave at once  if then you love us if you value gods blessing and your own future happiness we both charge you to stand upon your guard and if you find the least attempt made upon your virtue be sure you leave every thing behind you and come away to us for we had rather see you all covered with rags and even follow you to the churchyard than have it said a child of ours preferred any worldly conveniences to her virtue  we accept kindly of your dutiful present but till we are out of our pain cannot make use of it for fear we should partake of the price of our poor daughters shame so have laid it up in a rag among the thatch over the window for a while lest we should be robbed with our blessings and our hearty prayers for you we remain  your careful but loving father and mother john and elizabeth andrews  letter iii dear father i must needs say your letter has filled me with much trouble for it has made my heart which was overflowing with gratitude for my masters goodness suspicious and fearful and yet i hope i shall never find him to act unworthy of his character for what could he get by ruining such a poor young creature as me but that which gives me most trouble is that you seem to mistrust the honesty of your child no my dear father and mother be assured that by gods grace i never will do any thing that shall bring your gray hairs with sorrow to the grave i will die a thousand deaths rather than be dishonest any way of that be assured and set your hearts at rest for although i have lived above myself for some time past yet i can be content with rags and poverty and bread and water and will embrace them rather than forfeit my good name let who will be the tempter and of this rest satisfied and think better of  your dutiful daughter till death my master continues to be very affable to me as yet i see no cause to fear any thing mrs jervis the housekeeper too is very civil to me and i have the love of every body sure they cannot all have designs against me because they are civil i hope i shall always behave so as to be respected by every one and that nobody would do me more hurt than i am sure i would do them our john so often goes your way that i will always get him to call that you may hear from me either by writing for it brings my hand in or by word of mouth    letter iv dear mother for the last letter was to my father in answer to his letter and so i will now write to you though i have nothing to say but what will make me look more like a vain hussy than any thing else yet i hope i shall not be so proud as to forget myself yet there is a secret pleasure one has to hear ones self praised you must know then that my lady davers who i need not tell you is my masters sister has been a month at our house and has taken great notice of me and given me good advice to keep myself to myself she told me i was a very pretty wench and that every body gave me a very good character and loved me and bid me take care to keep the fellows at a distance and said that i might do and be more valued for it even by themselves  but what pleased me much was what i am going to tell you for at table as mrs jervis says my master and her ladyship talking of me she told him she thought me the prettiest wench she ever saw in her life and that i was too pretty to live in a batchelors house since no lady he might marry would care to continue me with her he said i was vastly improved and had a good share of prudence and sense above my years and it would be pity that what was my merit should be my misfortune  no says my good lady pamela shall come and live with me i think he said withal his heart he should be glad to have me so well provided for well said she i will consult my lord about it she asked how old i was and mrs jervis said i was fifteen last february o says she if the wench for so she calls all us maiden servants takes care of herself she will improve yet more and more as well in her person as mind  now my dear father and mother though this may look too vain to be repeated by me yet are you not rejoiced as well as i to see my master so willing to part with me  this shows that he has nothing bad in his heart but john is just going away and so i have only to say that i am and will always be  your honest as well as dutiful daughter pray make use of the money you may now do it safely    letter v my dear father and mother john being to go your way i am willing to write because he is so willing to carry any thing for me he says it does him good at his heart to see you both and to hear you talk he says you are both so sensible and so honest that he always learns something from you to the purpose it is a thousand pities he says that such worthy hearts should not have better luck in the world and wonders that you my father who are so well able to teach and write so good a hand succeeded no better in the school you attempted to set up but was forced to go to such hard labor but this is more pride to me that i am come of such honest parents than if i had been born a lady  i hear nothing yet of going to lady davers and i am very easy at present here for mrs jervis uses me as if i were her own daughter and is a very good woman and makes my masters interest her own she is always giving me good counsel and i love her next to you two i think best of any body she keeps so good rule and order she is mightily respected by us all and takes delight to hear me read to her and all she loves to hear read is good books which we read whenever we are alone so that i think i am at home with you she heard one of our men harry who is no better than he should be speak freely to me i think he called me his pretty pamela and took hold of me as if he would have kissed me for which you may be sure i was very angry and she took him to task and was as angry at him as could be and told me she was very well pleased to see my prudence and modesty and that i kept all the fellows at a distance and indeed i am sure i am not proud and carry it civilly to every body but yet methinks i cannot bear to be looked upon by these menservants for they seem as if they would look one through and as i genereally breakfast dine and sup with mrs jervis so good she is to me i am very easy that i have so little to say to them not but they are very civil to me in the main for mrs jerviss sake who they see loves me and they stand in awe of her knowing her to be a gentlewoman born though she has had misfortunes  i am going on again with a long letter for i love writing and shall tire you but when i began i only intended to say that i am quite fearless of any danger now and indeed can but wonder at myself though your caution to me was your watchful love that i should be so foolish as to be so uneasy as i have been for i am sure my master would not demean himself so as to think upon such a poor girl as i for my harm for such a thing would ruin his credit as well as mine you know who to be sure may expect one of the best ladies in the land so no more at present but that i am  your everdutiful daughter  letter vi dear father and mother my master has been very kind since my last for he has given me a suit of my late ladys clothes and half a dozen of her shifts and six fine handkerchiefs and three of her cambrick aprons and four holland ones the clothes are fine silk and too rich and too good for me to be sure i wish it was no affront to him to make money of them and send it to you it would do me more good  you will be full of fears i warrant now of some design upon me till i tell you that he was with mrs jervis when he gave them me and he gave her a mort of good things at the same time and bid her wear them in remembrance of her good friend my lady his mother and when he gave me these fine things he said these pamela are for you have them made fit for you when your mourning is laid by and wear them for your good mistresss sake mrs jervis gives you a very good word and i would have you continue to behave as prudently as you have done hitherto and every body will be your friend  i was so surprised at his goodness that i could not tell what to say i curtesyd to him and to mrs jervis for her good word and said i wished i might be deserving of his favor and nothing should be wanting in me to the best of my knowledge  o how amiable a thing is doing good  it is all i envy great folks for  i always thought my young master a fine gentleman as every body says he is but he gave these good things to us both with such a graciousness as i thought he looked like an angel  mrs jervis says he asked her if i kept the men at a distance for he said i was very pretty and to be drawn in to have any of them might be my ruin and make me poor and miserable betimes she never is wanting to give me a good word and took occasion to launch out in my praise she says but i hope she said no more than i shall try to deserve though i may not at present i am sure i will always love her next to you and my dear mother so i rest  your everdutiful daughter  letter vii dear father since my last my master gave me more fine things he called me up to my late ladys closer and pulling out her drawers he gave me two suits of fine flanders laced headcloaths three pair of fine silk shoes two hardly the worse and just fit for me and the other with rich silver buckles in them for my lady had a very little foot and several ribbands and topknots of all colors four pair of fine white cotton stockens and three pair of fine silk ones and two pair of rich stays i was quite astonished and unable to speak for a while but yet i was inwardly ashamed to take the stockens for mrs jervis was not there if she had it would have been nothing i believe i received them very awkwardly for he smiled at my awkwardness and said dont blush pamela do think i dont know pretty maids wear shoes and stockens  i was so confounded at these words you might have beat me down with a feather for you must think there was no answer to be made to this so like a fool i was ready to cry and went away curtesying and blushing i am sure up to the ears for though there was no harm in what he said yet i did not know how to take it but i went and told all to mrs jervis who said god put it into his heart to be good to me and i must double my diligence it looked to her she said as if he would fit me in dress for a waitingmaids place on lady daverss own person  but still your kind fatherly cautions came into my head and made all these gifts nothing near to me what they would have been but yet i hope there is no reason for what good could it do to him to harm such a simple maiden as me besides to be sure no lady would look upon him if he should so disgrace himself so i will make myself easy and indeed i should never have been otherwise if you had not put it into my head for my good i know very well but maybe without these uneasinesses to mingle with these benefits i might be too much puffed up so i will conclude all that happens is sor our good and so god bless you my dear father and mother and i know you constantly pray for a blessing upon me who am and shall always be  your dutiful daughter  letter viii dear pamela i cannot but renew my cautions to you on your masters kindness to you and his free expression to you about the stockens yet there may not be and i hope there is not any thing in it but when i reflect that there possibly may and that if there should no less depends upon it than my childs everlasting happiness in this world and the next it is enough to make one fearful for you arm yourself my dear child for the worst and resolve to lose your life sooner than your virtue what though the doubts i filled you with lessen the pleasure you would have had in your masters kindness yet what signify the delights that arise from a few paltry fine clothes in comparison with a good conscience  these are indeed very great favors that he heaps upon you but so much the more to be suspected and when you say he looked so amiably and like an angel how afraid i am that they should make too great an impression upon you for though you are blessed with sense and prudence above your years yet i tremble to think what a sad hazard a poor maiden of little more than fifteen years of age stands against the temptations of this world and a designing young gentleman if he should prove so who has so much power to oblige and has a kind of authority to command as your master  i charge you my dear child on both our blessings poor as we are to be on your guard there can be no harm in that and since mrs jervis is so good a gentlewoman and so kind to you i am the easier a great deal and so is your mother and we hope you will hide nothing from her and take her counsel in every thing so with our blessings and assured prayers for you more than for ourselves we remain  your loving father and mother besure dont let peoples telling you you are pretty puff you up for you did not make yourself and so can have no praise due to you for it it is virtue and goodness only that make the true beauty remember that pamela    letter ix dear father and mother i am sorry to write you word that the hopes i had of going to wait on lady davers are quite over my lady would have had me but my master as i heard bythebye would not consent to it he said her nephew might be taken with me and i might draw him in or be drawn in by him and he thought as his mother loved me and committed me to his care he ought to continue me with him and mrs jervis would be a mother to me mrs jervis tells me the lady shook her head and said ah brother and that was all and as you have made me fearful by your cautions my heart at times misgives me but i say nothing yet of your caution or my own uneasiness to mrs jervis not that i mistrust her but for fear she should think me presumptuous and vain and conceited to have any fears about the matter from the great distance between so great a man and so poor a girl but yet mrs jervis seemed to build something upon lady davers shaking her head and saying ah brother and no more god i hope will give me his grace and so i will not if i can help it make myself too uneasy for i hope there is no occasion but every little matter that happens i will acquaint you with that you shall continue to me your good advice and pray for  your sadhearted pamela  letter x dear mother you and my good father may wonder you have not had a letter from me in so many weeks but a sad sad scene has been the occasion of it for to be sure now it is too plain that all your cautions were wellgrounded o my dear mother i am miserable truly miserable  but yet dont be frighted i am honest  god of his goodness keep me so  o this angel of a master this fine gentleman this gracious benefactor to your poor pamela who was to take care of me at the prayer of his good dying mother who was so careful of me lest i should be drawn in by lord daverss nephew that he would not let me go to lady daverss this very gentleman yes i must call him gentleman though he has fallen from the merit of that title has degraded himself to offer freedoms to his poor servant he has now showed himself in his true colors and to me nothing appears so black and so frightful  i have not been idle but have writ from time to time how he by sly mean degrees exposed his wicked views but somebody stole my letter and i know not what has become of it it was a very long one i fear that he who was mean enough to do bad things in one respect did not stick at this but be it as it will all the use he can make of it will be that he may be ashamed of his part i not of mine for he will see i was resolved to be virtuous and gloried in the honesty of my poor parents  i will tell you all the next opportunity for i am watched very narrowly and he says to mrs jervis this girl is always scribbling i think she may be better employed and yet i work all hours with my needle upon his linen and the fine linen of the family and am besides about flowering him a waistcoat  but oh my hearts broke almost for what am i likely to have for my reward but shame and disgrace or else ill words and hard treatment i will tell you all soon and hope i shall find my long letter  your most afflicted daughter i must he and him him now for he has lost his dignity with me    letter xi dear mother well i cannot find my letter and so i will tell you all as briefly as i can all went well enough in the main for some time after my last letter but one at last i saw some reason to suspect for he would look upon me whenever he saw me in such a manner as showed not well and at last he came to me as i was in the summer house in the little garden at work with my needle and mrs jervis was just gone from he and i would have gone out but he said no dont go pamela i have something to say to you and you always fly me when i come near you as if you were afraid of me  i was much out of countenance you may well think but said at last it does not become your poor servant to stay in your presence sir without your business required it and i hope i shall alway know my place  well says he my business does require it some times and i have a mind you should stay to hear what i have to say to you  i stood all confounded and began to tremble and the more when he took me by the hand for now no soul was near us  my sister davers said he and seemed i thought tobe as much at a loss for words as i would have had you live with her but she would not do for you what i am resolved to do if you continue faithful and obliging what say thou my girl said he with some eagerness had thou not rather stay with me than go to my sister davers he looked so as filled me with affrightment i dont know how wildly i thought  i said when i could speak your honor will forgive me but as you have no lady for me to wait upon and my good lady has been now dead this twelvemonth i had rather if it would not displease you wait upon lady davers because   i was proceeding and he said a little hastily  because you are a little fool and know not what is good for yourself i tell you i will make a gentlewoman of you if you be obliging and dont stand in your own light and so saying he put his arm about me and kissed me  now you will say all his wickedness appeared plainly i struggled and trembled and was so benumbed with terror that i sunk down not in a fit and yet not myself and i found myself in his arms quite void of strength and he kissed me two or three times with frightful eagerness  at last i burst from him and was getting out of the summer house but he held me back and shut the door  i would have given my life for a farthing and he said i will do you no harm pamela dont be afraid of me i said i will not stay you will not hussy said he do you know whom you speak to i lost all fear and all respect and said yes i do sir too well  well may i forget that i am your servant when you forget what belongs to a master  i sobbd and cried most sadly what a foolish hussy you are said he have i done you any harm  yes sir said i the greatest harm in the world you have taught me to forget myself and what belongs to me and have lessened the distance that fortune has made between us by demeaning yourself to be so free to a poor servant yet sir i will be bold to say i am honest though poor and if you was a prince i would not be otherwise  he was angry and said who would have you otherwise you foolish slut cease your blubbering i own i have demeaned myself but it was only to try you if you can keep this matter secret you will give me the better opinion of your prudence and here is something said he putting some gold in my hand to make you amends for the fright i put you in go take a walk in the garden and dont go in till your blubbering is over and i charge you say nothing of what has past and all shall be well and i will forgive you  i will not take the money indeed sir said i poor as i am i will not take it for to say truth i thought it looked like taking earnest and so i put it upon the bench and as he seemed vexed and confused at what he had done i took the opportunity to open the door and went out of the summer house  he called to me and said be secret i charge you pamela and dont go in yet as i told you  o how poor and mean must those actions be and how little must they make the best of gentlemen look when they offer such things as are unworthy of themselves and put it into the power of their inferiors to be greater than they  i took a turn or two in the garden but in sight of the house for fear of the worst and breathed upon my hand to dry my eyes because i would not be too disobedient my next shall tell you more  pray for me my dear father and mother and dont be angry i have not yet run away from this house so late my comfort and delight but now my terror and anguish i am forced to break off hastily  your dutiful and honest daughter  letter xii dear mother well i will now proceed with my sad story and so after i had dried my eyes i went in and began to ruminate with myself what i had best to do sometimes i thought i would leave the house and go to the next town and wait an opportunity to get to you but then i was at a loss to resolve whether to take away the things he had given me or no and how to take them away sometimes i thought to leave them behind me and only go with the clothes on my back but then i had two miles and a half and a byway to the town and being pretty well dressed i might come to some harm almost as bad as what i would run away from and then maybe thought i it will be reported i have stolen something and so was forced to run away and to carry a bad name back with me to my dear parents would be a sad thing indeed  o how i wished for my gray russet again and my poor honest dress with which you fitted me out and hard enough too you had to do it for going to this place when i was not twelve years old in my good ladys days sometimes i thought of telling mrs jervis and taking her advice and only feared his command to be secret for thought i he may be ashamed of his actions and never attempt the like again and as poor mrs jervis depended upon him through misfortunes that had attended her i thought it would be a sad thing to bring his displeasure upon her for my sake  in this quandary now considering now crying and not knowing what to do i passed the time in my chamber till evening when desiring to be excused going to supper mrs jervis came up to me and said why must i sup without you pamela come i see you are troubled at something tell me what is the matter  i begged i might be permitted to lie with her on nights for i was afraid of spirits and they would not hurt such a good person as she that was a silly excuse she said for why was you not afraid of spirits before  indeed i did not think of that but you shall be my bedfellow with all my heart added she let your reason be what it will only come down to supper i begged to be excused for said i i have been crying so that it will be taken notice of by my fellow servants and i will hide nothing from you mrs jervis when we are abed  she was so good to indulge me and went down to supper but made more haste to come up tobed and told the servants that i should lie with her because she could not rest well and she would get me to read her to sleep for she knew i loved reading as she said  when we were alone i told her all that had passed for i thought though he had bid me not yet if he should come to know i had told it would be no worse for to keep a secret of such a nature would be as i apprehended to deprive myself of the good advice which i never wanted more and might encourage him to think i did not resent it as i ought and would keep worse secrets and so make him do worse by me was i right my dear mother  mrs jervis could not help mingling tears with my tears for i cried all the time i told her the story and begged her to advise me what to do and i showed her my dear fathers two letters and she praised the honesty and inditing of them and said pleasing things to me of you both but she begged i would not think of leaving my service for says she in all likelihood you behaved so virtuously that he will be ashamed of what he has done and never offer the like to you again though my dear pamela said she i fear more for your prettiness than for any thing else because the best man in the land might love you so she was pleased to say she said she wished it was in her power to live independent that then she would take a little private house and i should live with her like her daughter  and so as you ordered me to take her advice i resolved to tarry to see how things went without he was to turn me away although in your first letter you ordered me to come away the moment i had any reason to be apprehensive so dear father and mother it is not disobedience i hope that i stay for i could not expect a blessing or the good fruits of your prayers for me if i was disobedient  all the next day i was very sad and began to write my long letter he saw me writing and said as i mentioned to mrs jervis that girl is always scribbling methinks she might find something else to do or to that purpose and when i had finished my letter i put it under the toilet in my late ladys dressing room whither nobody comes but myself and mrs jervis besides my master but when i came up again to seal it up to my great concern it was gone and mrs jervis knew nothing of it and nobody knew of my masters having been near the place in the time so i have been sadly troubled about it but mrs jervis as well as i thinks he has it some how or other and he appears cross and angry and seems to shun me as much as he said i did him it had better be so than worse  but he has ordered mrs jervis to bid me not pass so much time in writing which is a poor matter for such a gentleman as he to take notice of as i am not idle otherways if he did not resent what he thought i wrote upon and this has no very good look  but i am a good deal easier since i lie with mrs jervis though after all the fears i live in on one side and his frowning and displeasure at what i do on the other make me more miserable than enough  o that i had never left my rags and my poverty to be thus exposed to temptations on one hand or disgusts on the other how happy was i a while ago how contrary now  pity and pray for  your afflicted pamela  letter xiii my dearest child our hearts bleed for your distress and the temptations you are tried with you have our hourly prayers and we would have you flee this evil great house and man if you find he renews his attempts you ought to have done it at first had you nor had mrs jervis to advise with we can find no fault in your conduct hitherto but it makes our hearts ache for fear of the worst o my child temptations are sore things but yet without them we know not ourselves nor what we are able to do  your temptations are very great for you have riches youth and a fine gentleman as the world reckons him to withstand but how great will be your honor to withstand them and when we consider your past conduct and your virtuous education and that you have been bred to be more ashamed of dishonesty than poverty we trust in god that he will enable you to overcome yet as we cannot see but your life must be a burden to you through the great apprehensions always upon you and that it may be presumptious to trust too much to your own strength and that you are but very young and the devil may put into his head to use some stratagem of which great men are full to decoy you i think you had better come home to share our poverty with safety than to live with so much discontent in a plenty that itself may be dangerous god direct you for the best while you have mrs jervis for an adviser and bedsellow and o my dear child that was prudently done of you we are easier than we should be and so committing you to the divine protection remain  your truly loving but careful father and mother  letter xiv dear father and mother mrs jervis and i have lived very comfortably together for this fortnight past for my master was all that time at his lincolnshire estate and at his sisters the lady davers but he came home yesterday he had some talk with mrs jervis soon after he came home and mostly about me he said to her it seems well mrs jervis i know pamela has your good word but do you think her of any use in the family she told me she was surprised at the question but said that i was one of the most virtuous and industrious young creatures that ever she knew why that word virtuous said he i pray you was there any reason to suppose her otherwise or has any body taken it into their heads to try her  i wonder sir says she you ask such a question who dare offer any thing to her in such an orderly and wellgoverned house as yours and under a master of so good a character for virtue and honor your servant mrs jervis says he for your good opinion but pray if any body did do you think pamela would let you know it why sir said she she is a poor innocent young creature and i believe has so much confidence in me that she would take my advice as soon as she would her mothers innocent again and virtuous i warrant well mrs jervis you abound with your epithets but i take her to be an artful young baggage and had i a young handsome butler or steward she would soon make her market of one of them if she thought it worth while to snap at him for a husband alackaday sir said she it is early days with pamela and she does not yet think of a husband i dare say and your steward and butler are both men in years and think nothing of the matter no said he if they were younger they would have more wit than to think of such a girl i will tell you my mind of her mrs jervis i dont think this same favorite of yours so very artless a girl as you imagine i am not to dispute with your honor said mrs jervis but i dare say if the men will let her alone she will never trouble herself about them why mrs jervis said he are there any men that will not let her alone that you know of no indeed sir said she she keeps herself so much to herself and yet behaves so prudently that they all esteem her and show her as great respect as if she was a gentlewoman born  ay says he that is her art that i was speaking of but let me tell you the girl has vanity and conceit and pride too or i am mistaken and perhaps i could give you an instance of it sir said she you can see further than such a poor silly woman as i but i never saw any thing but innocence in her  and virtue too i will warrant ye said he but suppose i could give you an instance where she has talked a little too freely of the kindnesses that have been showed her from a certain quarter and has had the vanity to impute a few kind words uttered in mere compassion to her youth and circumstances into a design upon her and even dared to make free with names that she ought never to mention but with reverence and gratitude what would you say to that  say sir said she i cannot tell what to say but i hope pamela incapable of such ingratitude  well no more of this silly girl says he you may only advise her as you are her friend not to give herself too much license upon the favors she meets with and if she stays here that she will not write the affairs of my family purely for an exercise to her pen and her invention i tell you she is a subtle artful gypsey and time will show it you  was ever the like heard my dear father and mother it is plain he did not expect to meet with such a repulse and mistrusts that i have told mrs jervis and has my long letter too that i intended for you and so is vexed to the heart but i cannot help it i had better be thought artful and subtle than be so in his sense and as light as he makes of the words virtue and innocence in me he would have made a less angry construction had i less deserved that he should do so for then maybe my crime would have been my virtue with him naughty gentleman as he is is   i will soon write again but must now end with saying that i am and shall always be  your honest daughter  letter xv dear mother i broke off abruptly my last letter for i feared he was coming and so it happened i put the letter into my bosom and took up my work which lay by me but i had so little of the artful as he called it that i looked as confused as if i had been doing some great harm  sit still pamela said he and mind your work for all me  you dont tell me i am welcome home after my journey to lincolnshire it would be hard sir said i if you was not always welcome to your honors own house  i would have gone but he said dont run away i tell you i have a word or two to say to you good sirs how my heart went pitapat when i was a little kind to you said he in the summer house and you carried yourself so foolishly upon it as if i had intended to do you great harm did i not tell you you should take no notice of what passed to any creature and yet you have made a common talk of the matter not considering either my reputation or your own  i made a common talk of it sir said i i have nobody to talk to hardly  he interrupted me and said hardly you little equivocator what do you mean by hardly let me ask you have you not told mrs jervis for one pray your honor said i all in agitation let me go down for it is not for me to hold an argument with your honor equivocator again said he and took my hand what do you talk of an argument is it holding an argument with me to answer a plain question answer me what i asked o good sir said i let me beg you will not urge me further for fear i forget myself again and be saucy  answer me then i bid you says he have you not told mrs jervis it will be saucy in you if you dont answer me directly to what i ask sir said i and fain would have pulled my hand away perhaps i should be for answering you by another question and that would not become me what is it you would say replies be speak out  then sir said i why should your honor be so angry i should tell mrs jervis or any body else what passed if you intended no harm  well said pretty innocent and artless as mrs jervis calls you said he and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me insolent as you are but still i will be answered directly to my question why then sir said i i will not tell a lie for the world i did tell mrs jervis for my heart was almost broken but i opened not my mouth to any other very well boldface said he and equivocator again you did not open your mouth to any other but did you not write to some other why now and please your honor said i for i was quite courageous just then you could not have asked me this question if you had not taken from me my letter to my father and mother in which i own i had broken my mind freely to them and asked their advice and poured forth my griefs  and so i am to be exposed am i said he in my house and out of my house to the whole world by such a saucebox as you no good sir said i and i hope your honor will not be angry with me it is not i that expose you if i say nothing but the truth so taunting again assurance as you are said he i will not be thus talked to  pray sir said i whom can a poor girl take advice of if it must not be of her father and mother and such a good woman as mrs jervis who for her sexsake should give it me when asked insolence said he and stamped with his foot am i to be questioned thus by such an one as you i fell down on my knees and said for heavens sake your honor pity a poor creature that knows nothing of her duty but how to cherish her virtue and good name i have nothing else to trust to and though poor and friendless here yet i have always been taught to value honesty above my life here is ado with your honesty said he foolish girl is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master do you think indeed sir said i it is impossible i should be ungrateful to your honor or disobedient or deserve the names of boldface and insolent which you call me but when your commands are contrary to that first duty which shall ever be the principle of my life  he seemed to be moved and rose up and walked into the great chamber two or three turns leaving me on my knees and i threw my apron over my face and laid my head on a chair and cried as if my heart would break having no power to stir  at last he came in again but alas with mischief in his heart and raising me up he said rise pamela rise you are your own enemy your perverse folly will be your ruin i tell you this that i am very much displeased with the freedoms you have taken with my name to my housekeeper as also to your father and mother and you may as well have real cause to take these freedoms with me as to make my name suffer for imaginary ones and saying so he offered to take me on his knee with some force o how i was terrified i said like as i had read in a book a night or two before angels and saints and all the host of heaven defend me and may i never survive one moment that fatal one in which i shall forfeit my innocence pretty fool said he how will you forfeit your innocence if you are obliged to yield to a force you cannot withstand be easy said he for let the worst happen that can you will have the merit and i the blame and it will be a good subject for letters to your father and mother and a tale into the bargain for mrs jervis  he by force kissed my neck and lips and said who ever blamed lucretia but the ravisher only and i am content to take all the blame upon me as i have already borne too great a share for what i have deserved may i said i lucretia like justify myself with my death if i am used barbarously o my good girl said he tauntingly you are well read i see and we shall make out between us before we have done a pretty story in romance i warrant ye  he then put his hand in my bosom and the indignation gave me double strength and i got loose from him by a sudden spring and ran out of the room and the next chamber being open i made shift to get into it and threwto the door and the key being on the inside it locked but he followed me so close he got hold of my gown and tore a piece off which hung without the door  i just remember i got into the room for i knew nothing further of the matter till afterward for i fell into a fit with my fright and terror and there i lay till he as i suppose looking through the keyhole spied me lying all along upon the floor stretched out at my length and then he called mrs jervis to me who by his assistance bursting open the door he went away seeing me coming to myself and bid her say nothing of the matter if she was wise  poor mrs jervis thought it was worse and cried over me like as if she was my mother and i was two hours before i came to myself and just as i got a little up on my feet he coming in i went away again with the terror and so he withdrew but he staid in the next room to let nobody come near us that his foul proceedings might not be known  mrs jervis gave me her smellingbottle and had cut my laces and far me in a great chair and he called her to him how is the girl said he i never saw such a fool in my life i did nothing at all to her mrs jervis could not speak for crying so he said she has told you it seems that i was kind to her in the summer house though i will assure you i was quite innocent then as well as now and i desire you to keep this matter to yourself and let me not be named in it  o sir said she for your honors sake and for christs sake  but he would not hear her and said  for your own sake i tell you mrs jervis say not a word more i have done her no harm and i will not have her stay in my house prating perverse fool as she is but since she is so apt to fall into fits or at least pretend to do so prepare her to see me tomorrow after dinner in my mothers closet and do you be with her and you shall hear what passes between us  and so he went out in a pet and ordered his chariot and four to be got ready and went a visiting somewhere  mrs jervis then came to me and i told her all that had happened and said i was resolved not to stay in the house and she saying he seemed to threaten as much i said i am glad of that then i shall be easy so she told me all be had said to her as i have mentioned above  mrs jervis is very loath i should go and yet poor woman she begins to be afraid for herself but would not have me ruined for the world she says to be sure he means no good but maybe now he sees me so resolute he will give over all attempts and that i shall better know what to do after tomorrow when i am to appear before a very bad judge i doubt  o how i dread this tomorrows appearance but be assured my dear parents of the honesty of your poor child as i am sure i am of your prayers for  your dutiful daughter o this frightful tomorrow how i dread it    letter xvi my dear parents i know you longed to hear from me soon i send as soon as i could  well you may believe how uneasily i passed the time till his appointed hour came every minute as it grew nearer my terrors increased and sometimes i had great courage and sometimes none at all and i thought i should faint when it came to the time my master had dined i could neither eat nor drink for my part and do what i could my eyes were swelled with crying  at last he went up to the closet which was my good ladys dressing room a room i once loved but then as much hated  dont your heart ache for me  i am sure mine fluttered about like a newcaught bird in a cage o pamela said i to myself why art thou so foolish and fearful thou have done no harm what if thou fear an unjust judge when thou art innocent would thou do before a just one if thou were guilty have courage pamela thou know the worst and how easy a choice poverty and honesty is rather than plenty and wickedness  so i cheered myself but yet my poor heart sunk and my spirits were quite broken every thing that stirred i thought was to call me to my account i dreaded it and yet i wished it to come  well at last he rung the bell o thought i that it was my passing bell mrs jervis went up with a full heart enough poor good woman he said where is pamela let her come up and do you come with her she came to me i was ready to come with my feet but my heart was with my dear father and mother wishing to share your poverty and happiness but i went  o how can wicked men seem so steady and untouched with such black hearts while poor innocents look like malefactors before them  he looked so stern that my heart failed me and i wished myself anywhere but there though i had before been summoning up all my courage good heaven said i to myself give me courage to stand before this naughty master o soften him or harden me  come in fool said he angrily as soon as he saw me and snatched my hand with a pull you may well be ashamed to see me after your noise and nonsense and exposing me as you have done i ashamed to see you thought i very pretty indeed  but i said nothing  mrs jervis said he here you are both together do you sit down but let her stand if she will ay thought i if i can for my knees beat one against another did you not think when you saw the girl in the way you found her in that i had given her the greatest occasion that could possibly be given any woman and that i had actually ruined her as she calls it tell me could you think any thing less indeed said she i feared so at first has she told you what i did to her and all i did to her to occasion all this folly by which my reputation might have suffered in your opinion and in that of all the family  inform me what has she told you  she was a little too much frighted as she owned afterward at his sternness and said indeed she told me you only pulled her on your knee and kissed her  then i plucked up my spirit a little only mrs jervis said i and was not that enough to show me what i had to fear when a master of his honors degree demeans himself to be so free as that to such a poor servant as me what is the next to be expected  but your honor went further so you did and threatened me what you would do and talked of lucretia and her hard fate  your honor knows you went too far for a master to a servant or even to his equal and i cannot bear it so i fell a crying most sadly  mrs jervis began to excuse me and to beg he would pity a poor maiden that had such a value for her reputation he said i speak it to her face i think her very pretty and i thought her humble and one that would not grow upon my favors or the notice i took of her but i abhor the thought of forcing her to any thing i know myself better said he and what belongs to me and to be sure i have enough demeaned myself to take notice of such a one as she but i was bewitched by her i think to be freer than became me though i had no intention to carry the jest farther  what poor stuff was all this my dear mother from a man of his sense but see how a bad cause and bad actions confound the greatest wits  it gave me a little more courage then for innocence i find in a weak mind has many advantages over guilt with all its riches and wisdom  so i said your honor may call this jest or sport or what you please but indeed sir it is not a jest that becomes the distance between a master and a servant do you hear mrs jervis said he do you hear the pertness of the creature i had a good deal of this sort before in the summer house and yesterday too which made me rougher with her than perhaps i had otherwise been  says mrs jervis pamela dont be pert to his honor you should know your distance you see his honor was only in jest  o dear mrs jervis said i dont you blame me too it is very difficult to keep ones distance to the greatest of men when they will not keep it themselves to their meanest servants  see again said he could you believe this of the young baggage if you had not heard it good your honor said the wellmeaning gentlewoman pity and forgive the poor girl she is but a girl and her virtue is very dear to her and i will pawn my life for her she will never be pert to your honor if you will be so good as to molest her no more nor frighten her again said she you see how by her fit she was in terror she could not help it and though your honor intended her no harm yet the apprehension was almost death to her and i had much ado to bring her to herself again o the little hypocrite said he she has all the arts of her sex they are born with her and i told you awhile ago you did not know her but said he this was not the reason principally of my calling you before me both together i find i am likely to suffer in my reputation by the perverseness and folly of this girl she has told you all and perhaps more than all nay i make no doubt of it and she has written letters for i find she is a mighty letterwriter to her father and mother and others as far as i know in which she makes herself an angel of light and me her kind master and benefactor a devil incarnate  o how people will sometimes thought i call themselves by their right names  and all this i will not bear and so i am resolved she shall return to the distresses and poverty she was taken from and let her take care how she uses my name with freedom when she is gone from me  i was brightened up at once with these welcome words and i threw myself upon my knees at his feet with a most sincere glad heart and i said may your honor be for ever blessed for your resolution now i shall be happy and permit me on my bended knees to thank you for all the benefits and favors you have heaped upon me for the opportunities i have had of improvement and learning through my good ladys means and yours i will now forget all your honor has offered to me and i promise you that i will never take your name in my lips but with reverence and gratitude and so god almighty bless your honor for ever and ever amen  then rising from my knees i went away with anotherguise sort of heart than i came into his presence with and so i fell to writing this letter and thus all is happily over  and now my dearest father and mother expect to see soon your poor daughter with an humble and dutiful mind returned to you and dont fear but i know how to be happy with you as ever for i will lie in the loft as i used to do and pray let the little bed be got ready and i have a little money which will buy me a suit of clothes fitter for my condition than what i have and i will get mrs mumford to help me to some needle work and fear not that i shall be a burden to you if my health continues and i know i shall be blessed if not for my own sake for both your sakes who have in all your trials and misfortunes preserved so much integrity as makes every body speak well of you both but i hope he will let good mrs jervis give me a character for fear it should be thought i was turned away for dishonesty  and so my dear parents may you be blessed for me and i for you and i will always pray for my master and mrs jervis so good night for it is late and i shall be soon called tobed  i hope mrs jervis is not angry with me because she has not called me to supper with her though i could eat nothing if she had but i make no doubt i shall sleep purely tonight and dream that i am with you in my dear dear happy loft once more  so good night again my dear father and mother says  your honest poor daughter mayhap i may not come this week because i must get up the linen and leave in order every thing belonging to my place so send me a line if you can to let me know if i shall be welcome by john who will call for it as he returns but say nothing of my coming away to him as yet for it will be said i blab every thing    letter xvii my dearest daughter welcome welcome ten times welcome shall you be to us for you come to us innocent and happy and honest and you are the staff of our old age and our comfort too and though we cannot do for you as we would yet we doubt not we shall live comfortably together and what with my diligent labor and your poor mothers spinning and your needle work i make no doubt we shall live better and better only your poor mothers eyes begin to fail her though i bless god i am as strong and able and willing to labor as ever and o my dear child your virtue has made me i think stronger and better than i was before what blessed things are trials and temptations to us when they be overcome  but i am thinking about those same four guineas i think you should give them back again to your master and yet i have broke them alas i have only three left but i will borrow it if i can part upon my wages and part of mrs mumford and send it to you that you may return it against john comes next if he comes again before you  i want to know how you come i fancy honest john will be glad to bear you company part of the way if your master is not so cross as to forbid him and if i know time enough your mother will go one five miles and i will go ten on the way or till i meet you as far as one holiday will go for that i can get leave for and we shall receive you with more pleasure than we had at your birth when all the worst was over or than we ever had in our lives  and so god bless you till the happy time comes say both your mother and i which is all at present from  your truly loving parents  letter xviii dear father and mother i thank you a thousand times for your goodness to me expressed in your last letter i now long to get my business done and come to my newold lot again as i may call it i have been quite another thing since my master has turned me off and as i shall come to you an honest daughter what pleasure it is to what i should have had if i could not have seen you but as a guilty one well my writing time will soon be over and so i will make use of it now and tell you all that has happened since my last letter  i wondered mrs jervis did not call me to sup with her and feared she was angry and when i had finished my letter i longed for her coming to bed at last she came up but seemed shy and reserved and i said o my dear mrs jervis i am glad to see you you are not angry with me i hope she said she was sorry things had gone so far and that she had a great deal of talk with my master after i was gone that he seemed moved at what i said and at my falling on my knees to him and my prayer for him at my going away he said i was a strange girl he knew not what to make of me and is she gone said he i intended to say something else to her but she behaved so oddly that i had not power to stop her she asked if she should call me again he said yes and then no let her go it is best for her and me too that she shall go now i have given her warning but where she had it i cannot tell but i never met with the fellow of her in my life at any age she said he had ordered her not to tell me all but she believed he never would offer any thing to me again and i might stay she fansyd if i would beg it as a favor though she was not sure neither  i stay dear mrs jervis said i why it is the best news that could have come to me that he will let me go i do nothing but long to go back again to my poverty and distress as he said i should for though i am sure of the poverty i shall not have half the distress i have had for some months past i will assure you  mrs jervis dear good soul wept over me and said well well pamela i did not think i had showed so little love to you as that you should express so much joy to leave me i am sure i never had a child half so dear to me as you  i wept to hear her so good to me as indeed she has always been and said what would you have me to do dear mrs jervis i love you next to my own father and mother and to leave you is the chief concern i have at quitting this place but i am sure it is certain ruin if i stay after such offers and such threatenings and his comparing himself to a wicked ravisher in the very time of his last offer and making a jest of me that we should make a pretty story in romance can i stay and be safe has he not demeaned himself twice and it behooves me to beware of the third time for fear he should lay his snares surer for mayhap he did not expect a poor servant would resist her master so much and must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions if i stay after this for i think when one of our sex finds she is attempted it is an encouragement to a person to proceed if one puts ones self in the way of it when one can help it and it shows one can forgive what in short ought not to be forgiven which is no small countenance to foul actions i will assure you  she hugged me to her and said i will assure you prettyface where gottest thou all thy knowledge and thy good notions at these years thou art a miracle for thy age and i shall always love thee  but do you resolve to leave us pamela  yes my dear mrs jervis said i for as matters stand how can i do otherwise  but i will do all the duties of my place first if i may and hope you will give me a character as to my honesty that it may not be thought i was turned away for any harm ay that i will said she i will give thee such a character as never girl at thy years deserved and i am sure said i i will always love and honor you as my third best friend wherever i go or whatever becomes of me  and so we went to bed and i never waked till twas time to rise which i did as blythe as a bird and went about my business with great pleasure  but i believe my master is fearfully angry with me for he passed by me two or three times and would not speak to me and toward evening he met me in the passage going into the garden and said such a word to me as i never heard in my life from him to man woman or child for he first said this creatures always in my way i think i said standing up as close as i could and the entry was wide enough for a coach too i hope i shall not be long in your honors way d  n you said he that was the hard word for a little witch i have no patience with you  i profess i trembled to hear him say so but i saw he was vexed and as i am going away i minded it the less but i see my dear parents that when a person will do wicked things it is no wonder he will speak wicked words and so i rest  your dutiful daughter  letter xix dear father and mother our john having no opportunity to go your way i write again and send both letters at once i cannot say yet when i shall get away nor how i shall come because mrs jervis showed my master the waistcoat i am flowering for him and he said it looks well enough i think the creature had best stay till she has finished it  there is some private talk carried on betwixt him and mrs jervis that she dont tell me of but yet she is very kind to me and i dont mistrust her at all i should be very base if i did but to be sure she must oblige him and keep all his lawful commands and other i dare say she will not keep she is too good and loves me too well but she must stay when i am gone and so must get no ill will  she has been at me again to ask to stay and humble myself as she calls it but what have i done mrs jervis said i if i have been a saucebox and a boldface and pert and a creature as he calls me have i not had reason do you think i should ever have forgot myself if he had not forgot to act as my master tell me from your own heart dear mrs jervis said i if you think i could stay and be safe what would you think or how would you act in my case  my dear pamela said she and kissed me i dont know how i should act or what i should think i hope i should act as you do but i know nobody else that would my master is a fine gentleman he has a great deal of wit and sense and is admired as i know by half a dozen ladies who would think themselves happy in his addresses he has a noble estate and yet i believe he loves my good maiden though his servant better than all the ladies in the land and he has tried to overcome it because he knows you are so much his inferior and it is my opinion he finds he cannot and that vexes his proud heart and makes him resolve you shall not stay and so he speaks so to cross you when he sees you by accident  well but mrs jervis said i let me ask you if he can stoop to like such a poor girl as i as perhaps he may for i have read of things almost as strange from great men to poor damsels what can it be for  he may condescend mayhap to think i may be good enough for his harlot and those things dont disgrace men that ruin poor women as the world goes and so if i was wicked enough he would keep me till i was undone and till his mind changed for even wicked men i have read soon grow weary of wickedness of one sort and love variety well then poor pamela must be turned off and looked upon as a vile abandoned creature and every body would despise her ay and justly too mrs jervis for she that cannot keep her virtue ought to live in disgrace  but mrs jervis continued i let me tell you that i hope if i was sure he would always be kind to me and never turn me off at all that i shall have so much grace as to hate and withstand his temptations were he not only my master but my king and that for the sins sake this my poor dear parents have always taught me and i should be a sad wicked creature indeed if for the sake of riches or favor i should forfeit my good name yea and worse than any other young body of my sex because i can so contentedly return to my poverty again and think it less disgrace to be obliged to wear rags and live upon ryebread and water as i used to do than to be a harlot to the greatest man in the world  mrs jervis lifted up her hands and had her eyes full of tears god bless you my dear love said she you are my admiration and delight  how shall i do to part with you  well good mrs jervis said i let me ask you now  you and he have had some talk and you may not be suffered to tell me all but do you think if i was to ask to stay that he is sorry for what he has done ay and ashamed of it too for i am sure he ought considering his high degree and my low degree and how i have nothing in the world to trust to but my honesty do you think in your own conscience now pray answer me truly that he would never offer any thing to me again and that i could be safe  alas my dear child said she dont put thy home questions to me with that pretty becoming earnestness in thy look i know this that he is vexed at what he has done he was vexed the first time more vexed the second time  yes said i and so he will be vexed i suppose the third and the fourth time too till he has quite ruined your poor maiden and who will have cause to be vexed then  nay pamela said she dont imagine that i would be accessory to your ruin for the world i only can say that he has yet done you no hurt and it is no wonder he should love you you are so pretty though so much beneath him but i dare swear for him he never will offer you any force  you say said i that he was sorry for his first offer in the summer house well and how long did his sorrow last  only till he found me by myself and then he was worse than before and so became sorry again and if he has deigned to love me and you say cannot help it why he cannot help it neither if he should have an opportunity a third time to distress me and i have read that many a man has been ashamed of his wickedness at a repulse that never would had he succeeded besides mrs jervis if he really intends to offer no force what does that mean  while you say he cannot help liking me for love it cannot be  does it not imply that he hopes to ruin me by my own consent i think said i and i hope i should have grace to do so that i should not give way to his temptations on any account but it would be very presumptuous in me to rely upon my own strength against a gentleman of his qualifications and estate and who is my master and thinks himself entitled to call me boldface and what not only for standing on my necessary defense and that where the good of my soul and body and my duty to god and my parents are all concerned how then mrs jervis said i can i ask or wish to stay  well well says she as he seems very desirous you should not stay i hope it is from a good motive for fear he should be tempted to disgrace himself as well as you no no mrs jervis said i i have thought of that too for i would be glad to think of him with that duty that becomes me but then he would have let me gone to lady davers and not have hindered my preferment and he would not have said i should return to my poverty and distress when by his mothers goodness i had been lifted out of it but that he intended to fright me and punish me as he thought for not complying with his wickedness and this shows me enough what i have to expect from his future goodness except i will deserve it at his own dear dear price  she was silent and i said well there is no more to be said i must go that is certain all my concern will be how to part with you and indeed next to you with every body for all my fellow servants have loved me and you and they will cost me a sigh and a tear too nowandthen i am sure and so i fell acrying i could not help it for it is a pleasant thing to one to be in a house among a great many fellow servants and be beloved by them all  nay i should have told you before now how kind and civil mr longman our steward is vastly courteous indeed on all occasions and he said once to mrs jervis he wished he was a young man for my sake i should be his wife and he would settle all he had upon me on marriage and you must know he is reckoned worth a power of money  i take no pride in this but bless god and your good example my dear parents that i have been enabled so to carry myself as to have every bodys good word not but that our cook one day who is a little snappish and cross sometimes said once to me why this pamela of ours goes as fine as a lady see what it is to have a fine face  i wonder what the girl will come to at last  she was hot with her work and i sneaked away for i seldom go down into the kitchen and i heard the butler say why jane nobody has your good word what has mrs pamela done to you i am sure she offends nobody and what said the peevish wench have i said to her foolatum but that she was pretty they quarreled afterward i heard i was sorry for it but troubled myself no more about it forgive this silly prattle from  your dutiful daughter o i forgot to say that i would stay to finish the waistcoat i never did a prettier piece of work and i am up early and late to gee it done for i long to come to you    letter xx my dear father and mother i did not send my last letters so soon as i hoped because john whether my master mistrusts or no i cannot say had been sent to lady daverss instead of isaac who used to go and i could not be so free with nor so well trust isaac though he is very civil to me too so i was forced to stay till john returned  as i may not have opportunity to send again soon and yet as i know you keep my letters and read them over and over so john told me when you have done work so much does your kindness make you love all that comes from your poor daughter and as it may be some little pleasure to me mayhap to read them myself when i am come to you to remind me what i have gone through and how great gods goodness has been to me which i hope will further strengthen my good resolutions that i may not hereafter from my bad conduct have reason to condemn myself from my own hand as it were for all these reasons i say i will write as i have time and as matters happen and send the scribble to you as i have opportunity and if i dont every time in form subscribe as i ought i am sure you will always believe that it is not for want of duty so i will begin where i left off about the talk between mrs jervis and me for me to ask to stay  unknown to mrs jervis i put a project as i may call it in practice i thought with myself some days ago here i shall go home to my poor father and mother and have nothing on my back that will be fit for my condition for how should your poor daughter look with a silk nightgown silken petticoats cambrick headcloaths fine holland linen laced shoes that were my ladys and fine stockens and how in a little while must they have looked like old castoffs indeed and i looked so for wearing them and people would have said for poor folks are envious as well as rich see there goody andrewss daughter turned home from her fine place what a tawdry figure she makes and how well that garb becomes her poor parents circumstances  and how would they look upon me thought i to myself when they come to be threadbare and worn out and how should i look even if i could get homespun clothes to dwindle into them one by one as i could get them  maybe an old silk gown and a linseywoolsey petticoat and the like so thought i i had better get myself at once quipt in the dress that will become my condition and though it may look but poor to what i have been used to wear of late days yet it will serve me when i am with you for a good holiday and sunday suit and what by a blessing on my industry i may perhaps make shift to keep up to  so as i was saying unknown to any body i bought of farmer nicholss wife and daughters a good sadcolourd stuff of their own spinning enough to make me a gown and two petticoats and i made robings and facings of a pretty bit of printed calico i had by me  i had a pretty good camblet quilted coat that i thought might do tolerably well and i bought two flanel undercoats not so good as my swanskin and fine linen ones but what will keep me warm if any neighbor should get me to go out to help em to milk nowandthen as sometimes i used to do formerly for i am resolved to do all your good neighbors what kindness i can and hope to make myself as much beloved about you as i am here  i got some pretty good scots cloth and made me at mornings and nights when nobody saw me two shifts and i have enough left for two shirts and two shifts for you my dear father and mother when i come home i will make em for you and desire your acceptance as my first present  then i bought of a pedlar two pretty enough roundeard caps a little strawhat and a pair of knit mittens turned up with white calico and two pair of ordinary blue worsted hose that make a smartish appearance with white clocks i will assure you and two yards of black ribband for my shift sleeves and to serve as a necklace and when i had em all come home i went and looked upon them once in two hours for two days together for you must know though i lie with mrs jervis i keep my own little apartment still for my clothes and nobody goes thither but myself you will say i was no bad housewife to have saved so much money but my dear good lady was always giving me something  i believed myself the more obliged to do this because as i was turned away for what my good master thought want of duty and as he expected other returns for his presents than i intended to make him so i thought it was but just to leave his presents behind me when i went away for you know if i would not earn his wages why should i have them  dont trouble yourself now i think of it about the four guineas nor borrow to make them up for they were given me with some silver as i told you as a perquisite being what my lady had about her when she died and as i hope for no other wages i am so vain as to think i have deserved them in the fourteen months since my ladys death for she good soul overpaid me before in learning and other kindnesses  had she lived none of these things might have happened  but i ought to be thankful it is no worse every thing will turn about for the best that is my confidence  so as i was saying i have provided a new and more suitable dress and i long to appear in it more than ever i did in any new clothes in my life for then i shall be soon after with you and at ease in my mind  but mum  i am etc  letter xxi my dear father and mother i was forced to break off for i feared my master was coming but it proved to be only mrs jervis she came to me and said i cannot endure you should be so much by yourself pamela and i said i dread nothing so much as company for my heart was up at my mouth now for fear my master was coming but i always rejoice to see my dear mrs jervis  said she i have had a world of talk with my master about you i am sorry for it said i that i am made of so much consequence as to be talked of by him o said she i must not tell you all but you are of more consequence to him than you think for   or wish for said i for the fruits of being of consequence to him would make me of none to myself or any body else  said she thou art as witty as any lady in the land i wonder where thou gottest it but they must be poor ladies with such great opportunities i am sure if they have no more than i  but let that pass  i suppose said i that i am of so much consequence however as to vex him if it be but to think he cannot make a fool of such a one as i and that is nothing at all but a rebuke to the pride of his high condition which he did not expect and knows not how to put up with  there is something in that maybe said she but indeed pamela he is very angry at you too and calls you twenty perverse things wonders at his own folly to have shown you so much favor as he calls it which he was first inclined to he says for his mothers sake and would have persisted to show you for your own if you was not your own enemy  nay now i shall not love you mrs jervis said i you are going to persuade me to ask to stay though you know the hazards i run  no said she he says you shall go for he thinks it will not be for his reputation to keep you but he wished dont speak of it for the world pamela that he knew a lady of birth just such another as yourself in person and mind and he would marry her tomorrow  i colored up to the ears at this word but said yet if i was the lady of birth and he would offer to be rude first as he has twice done to poor me i dont know whether i would have him for she that can bear an insult of that kind i should think not worthy to be any gentlemans wife any more than he would be a gentleman that would offer it  nay now pamela said she thou carriest thy notions a great way well dear mrs jervis said i very seriously for i could not help it i am more full of fears than ever i have only to beg of you as one of the best friends i have in the world to say nothing of my asking to stay to say my master likes me when i know what end he aims at is abomination to my ears and i shall not think myself safe till i am at my poor fathers and mothers  she was a little angry at me till i assured her that i had not the least uneasiness on her account but thought myself safe under her protection and friendship and so we dropped the discourse for that time  i hope to have finished this ugly waistcoat in two days after which i have only some linen to get up and do something to and shall then let you know how i shall contrive as to my passage for the heavy rains will make it sad traveling on foot but maybe i may get a place to  which is ten miles of the way in farmer nicholss close cart for i cannot sit a horse well at all and maybe nobody will be suffered to see me on upon the way but i hope to let you know more  from etc  letter xxii my dear father and mother all my fellow servants have now some notion that i am to go away but cannot imagine for what mrs jervis tells them that my father and mother growing in years cannot live without me and so i go to them to help to comfort their old age but they seem not to believe it  what they found it out by was the butler heard him say to me as i passed by him in the entry leading to the hall who is that is pamela sir said i pamela said he how long are you to stay here  only please your honor said i till i have done the waistcoat and it is almost done  you might says he very roughly indeed have finished that long enough ago i should have thought indeed and please your honor said i i have worked early and late upon it there is a great deal of work in it  work in it said he yes you mind your pen more than your needle i dont want such idle sluts to stay in my house  he seemed startled when he saw the butler as he entered the hall where mr jonathan stood what do you here said he  the butler was as much confounded as i for i never having been taxed so roughly could not help crying sadly and got out of both their ways to mrs jervis and told my complaint this love said she is the d    l in how many strange shapes does it make people show themselves and in some the farthest from their hearts  so one and then another has been since whispering pray mrs jervis are we to lose mrs pamela as they always call me  what has she done and then she tells them as above about going home to you  she said afterward to me well pamela you have made our master from the sweetesttemperd gentleman in the world one of the most peevish but you have it in your power to make him as sweettemperd as ever though i hope you will never do it on his terms  this was very good in mrs jervis but it intimated that she thought as ill of his designs as i and as she knew his mind more than i it convinced me that i ought to get away as fast as i could  my master came in just now to speak to mrs jervis about household matters having some company to dine with him tomorrow and i stood up and having been crying at his roughness in the entry i turned away my face  you may well said he turn away your cursed face i wish i had never seen it  mrs jervis how long is she to be about this waistcoat  sir said i if your honor had pleased i would have taken it with me and though it would be now finished in a few hours i will do so still and remove this hated poor pamela out of your house and sight for ever  mrs jervis said he not speaking to me i believe this little slut has the power of witchcraft if ever there was a witch for she inchants all that come near her she makes even you who should know better what the world is think her an angel of light  i offered to go away for i believed he wanted me to ask to stay in my place for all this his great wrath and he said stay here stay here when i bid you and snatched my hand i trembled and said i will i will for he hurt my fingers he grasped me so hard  he seemed to have a mind to say something to me but broke off abruptly and said begone and away i trippd as fast as i could and he and mrs jervis had a deal of talk as she told me and among the rest he expressed himself vexed to have spoken in mr jonathans hearing  now you must know that mr jonathan our butler is a very grave good sort of old man with his hair as white as silver and an honest worthy man he is i was hurrying out with a flea in my ear as the saying is and going down stairs into the parlour met him he took hold of my hand in a gentler manner though than my master with both his and he said ah sweet sweet mrs pamela what is it i heard just now  i am sorry at my heart but i am sure i will sooner believe any body in fault than you thank you mr jonathan said i but as you value your place dont be seen speaking to such a one as me i cried too and slipped away as fast as i could from him for his own sake lest he should be seen to pity me  and now i will give you an instance how much i am in mr longmans esteem also  i had lost my pen somehow and my paper being written out i stepped to mr longmans our stewards office to beg him to give me a pen or two and a sheet or two of paper he said ay that i will my sweet maiden and gave me three pens some wafers a stick of wax and twelve sheets of paper and coming from his desk where be was writing he said let me have a word or two with you my sweet little mistress for so these two good old gentlemen often call me for i believe they love me dearly i hear bad news that we are going to lose you i hope it is not true yes it is sir said i but i was in hopes it would not be known till i went away  what a d  l said he ails our master of late i never saw such an alteration in any man in my life he is pleased with nobody as i see and by what mr jonathan tells me just now he was quite out of the way with you what could you have done to him tro only mrs jervis is a very good woman or i should have feared she had been your enemy  no said i nothing like it mrs jervis is a just good woman and next to my father and mother the best friend i have in the world  well then said he it must be worse shall i guess you are too pretty my sweet mistress and maybe too virtuous ah have i not hit it no good mr longman said i dont think any thing amiss of my master he is cross and angry with me indeed that is true but i may have given occasion for it maybe and because i am obliged to go to my father and mother rather than stay here mayhap he may think me ungrateful but you know sir said i that a father and mothers comfort is the dearest thing to a good child that can be sweet excellence said he this becomes you but i know the world and mankind too well though i must hear and see and say nothing and a blessing attend my little sweeting said he wherever you go and away went i with a curtsy and thanks  now this pleases one my dear father and mother to be so beloved  how much better by good fame and integrity is it to get every ones good word but one than by pleasing that one to make every one else ones enemy and be an execrable creature besides i am etc  letter xxiii my dear father and mother we had a great many neighboring gentlemen and their ladies this day at dinner and my master made a fine entertainment for them and isaac and mr jonathan and benjamin waited at table and isaac tells mrs jervis that the ladies will byandby come to see the house and have the curiosity to see me for it seems they said to my master when the jokes flew about well mr b  we understand you have a servantmaid who is the greatest beauty in the county and we promise ourselves to see her before we go  the wench is well enough said he but no such beauty as you talk of i will assure ye she was my mothers waitingmaid who on her deathbed engaged me to be kind to her she is young and every thing is pretty that is young  ay ay said one of the ladies that is true but if your mother had not recommended her so strongly there is so much merit in beauty that i make no doubt such a fine gentleman would have wanted no such strong inducement to be kind  they all laughed at my master and he it seems laughed for company but said i dont know how it is but i see with different eyes from other people for i have heard much more talk of her prettiness than i think it deserves she is well enough as i said but i think her greatest excellence is that she is humble and courteous and faithful and makes all her fellow servants love her my housekeeper in particular doats upon her and you know ladies she is a woman of discernment and as for mr longman and jonathan here if they thought themselves young enough i am told they would fight for her is it not true jonathan troth sir said he ant please your honor i never knew her peer and all your honors family are of the same mind do you hear now said my master  well said the ladies we will make a visit to mrs jervis byandby and hope to see this paragon  i believe they are coming and will tell you more byandby i wish they had come and were gone why cannot they make their game without me  well these fine ladies have been here and gone back again i would have been absent if i could and did step into the closet so they saw me not when they came in  there were four of them lady arthur at the great white house on the hill lady brooks lady towers and the other it seems a countess of some hard name i forget what  so mrs jervis says one of the ladies how do you do we are all come to inquire after your health i am much obliged to your ladyships said mrs jervis will your ladyships please to sit down but said the countess we are not only come to ask after mrs jerviss health neither but we are come to see a rarity besides ay says lady arthur i have not seen your pamela these two years and they tell me she is grown wondrous pretty in that time  then i wished i had not been in the closet for when i came out they must needs know i heard them but i have often found that bashful bodies owe themselves a spite and frequently confound themselves more by endeavoring to avoid confusion  why yes says mrs jervis pamela is very pretty indeed she is but in the closet there  pamela pray step hither i came out all covered with blushes and they smiled at one another  the countess took me by the hand why indeed she was pleased to say report has not been too lavish i will assure you dont be ashamed child and stard full in my face i wish i had just such a face to be ashamed of o how like a fool i looked  lady arthur said ay my good pamela i say as her ladyship says dont be so confused though indeed it becomes you too i think your good lady departed made a sweet choice of such a pretty attendant she would have been mighty proud of you as she always was praising you had she lived till now  ah madam said lady brooks do you think that so dutiful a son as our neighbor who always admired what his mother loved does not pride himself for all what he said at table in such a pretty maiden  she looked with such a malicious sneering countenance i cannot abide her  lady towers said with a free air for it seems she is called a wit well mrs pamela i cannot say i like you so well as these ladies do for i should never care if you were my servant to have you and your master in the same house together then they all set up a great laugh  i know what i could have said if i durst but they are ladies  and ladies may say any thing  says lady towers can the pretty image speak mrs jervis i vow she has speaking eyes o you little rogue said she and tapt me on the cheek you seem born to undo or to be undone  god forbid and please your ladyship said i it should be either  i beg said i to withdraw for the sense i have of my unworthiness renders me unfit for such a presence  i then went away with one of my best curtsies and lady towers said as i went out prettily said i vow  and lady brooks said see that shape i never saw such a face and shape in my life why she must be better descended than you have told me  and so belike their clacks ran for half an hour in my praises and glad was i when i got out of the hearing of them  but it seems they went down with such a story to my master and so full of me that he had much ado to stand it but as it was very little to my reputation i am sure i could take no pride in it and i feared it would make no better for me this gives me another cause for wishing myself out of this house  this is thursday morning and next thursday i hope to set out for i have finished my task and my master is horrid cross and i am vexed his crossness affects me so if ever he had any kindness toward me i believe he now hates me heartily  is it not strange that love borders so much upon hate but this wicked love is not like the true virtuous love to be sure that and hatred must be as far off as light and darkness and how must this hate have been increased if he had met with a base compliance after his wicked will had been gratified  well one may see by a little what a great deal means for if innocence cannot attract common civility what must guilt expect when novelty had ceased to have its charms and changeableness had taken place of it thus we read in holy writ that wicked amnon when he had ruined poor tamar hated her more than ever he loved her and would have turned her out of door  how happy am i to be turned out of door with that sweet companion my innocence  o may that be always my companion and while i presume not upon my own strength and am willing to avoid the tempter i hope the divine grace will assist me  forgive me that i repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer i owe every thing next to gods goodness to your piety and good examples my dear parents my dear poor parents i will say because your poverty is my pride as your integrity shall be my imitation  as soon as i have dined i will put on my new clothes i long to have them on i know i shall surprise mrs jervis with them for she shall not see me till i am fulldressd  john is come back and i will soon send you some of what i have written  i find he is going early in the morning and so i will close here that i am  your most dutiful daughter dont lose your time in meeting me because i am so uncertain it is hard if somehow or other i cannot get a passage to you but maybe my master will not refuse to let john bring me i can ride behind him i believe well enough for he is very careful and very honest and you know john as well as i for he loves you both besides maybe mrs jervis can put me in some way    letter xxiv dear father and mother i shall write on as long as i stay though i should have nothing but sillinesses to write for i know you divert yourselves on nights with what i write because it is mine john tells me how much you long for my coming but he says he told you he hoped something would happen to hinder it  i am glad you did not tell him the occasion of my coming away for if they should guess it were better so than to have it from you or me besides i really am concerned that my poor master should cast such a thought upon such a creature as me for besides the disgrace it has quite turned his temper and i begin to think he likes me and cannot help it and yet strives to conquer it and so finds no way but to be cross to me  dont think me presumptuous and conceited for it is more my concern than my pride to see such a gentleman so demean himself and lessen the regard he used to have in the eyes of all his servants on my account  but i am to tell you of my new dress today  and so when i had dined up stairs i went and locked myself into my little room there i tricked myself up as well as i could in my new garb and put on my roundeard ordinary cap but with a green knot however and my homespun gown and petticoat and plainleather shoes but yet they are what they call spanish leather and my ordinary hose ordinary i mean to what i have been lately used to though i shall think good yarn may do very well for every day when i come home a plain muslin tucker i put on and my black silk necklace instead of the french necklace my lady gave me and put the earrings out of my ears and when i was quite quippd i took my straw hat in my hand with its two blue strings and looked about me in the glass as proud as any thing  to say truth i never liked myself so well in my life  o the pleasure of descending with ease innocence and resignation  indeed there is nothing like it an humble mind i plainly see cannot meet with any very shocking disappointment let fortunes wheel turn round as it will  so i went down to look for mrs jervis to see how she liked me  i met as i was upon the stairs our rachel who is the housemaid and she made me a low curtsy and i found did not know me so i smiled and went to the housekeepers parlour and there sat good mrs jervis at work making a shift and would you believe it she did not know me at first but rose up and pulled off her spectacles and said do you want me forsooth i could not help laughing and said heyday mrs jervis what dont you know me  she stood all in amaze and looked at me from top to toe why you surprise me said she what pamela thus metamorphosd how came this about  as it happened in stepped my master and my back being to him he thought it was a stranger speaking to mrs jervis and withdrew again and did not hear her ask if his honor had any commands with her  she turned me about and about and i showed her all my dress to my underpetticoat and she said sitting down why i am all in amaze i must sit down what can all this mean i told her i had no clothes suitable to my condition when i returned to my fathers and so it was better to begin here as i was soon to go away that all my fellow servants might see i knew how to suit myself to the state i was returning to  well said she i never knew the like of thee but this sad preparation for going away for now i see you are quite in earnest is what i know not how to get over o my dear pamela how can i part with you  my master rung in the backparlour and so i withdrew and mrs jervis went to attend him it seems he said to her i was coming in to let you know that i shall go to lincolnshire and maybe to my sister daverss and be absent some weeks but pray what pretty neat damsel was with you she says she smiled and asked if his honor did not know who it was no said he i never saw her before farmer nichols or farmer brady have neither of them such a tight prim lass for a daughter have they  though i did not see her face neither said he if your honor will not be angry said she i will introduce her into your presence for i think says she she outdoes our pamela  now i did not thank her for this as i told her afterward for it brought a great deal of trouble upon me as well as crossness as you shall hear that cannot be he was pleased to say but if you can find an excuse for it let her come in  at that she stepped to me and told me i must go in with her to my master but said she for goodness sake let him find you out for he dont know you o fie mrs jervis said i how could you serve me so besides it looks too free both in me and to him i tell you said she you shall come in and pray dont reveal yourself till he finds you out  so i went in foolish as i was though i must have been seen by him another time if i had not then and she would make me take my strawhat in my hand  i dropped a low curtsy but said never a word i dare say he knew me as soon as he saw my face but was as cunning as lucifer he came up to me and took me by the hand and said whose pretty maiden are you  i dare say you are pamelas sister you are so like her so neat so clean so pretty why child you far surpass your sister pamela  i was all confusion and would have spoken but he took me about the neck why said he you are very pretty child i would not be so free with your sister you may believe but i must kiss you  o sir said i i am pamela indeed i am indeed i am pamela her own self  he kissed me for all i could do and said impossible you are a lovelier girl by half than pamela and sure i may be innocently free with you though i would not do her so much favor  this was a sad bite upon me indeed and what i could not expect and mrs jervis looked like a fool as much as i for her officiousness  at last i got away and ran out of the parlour most sadly vexed as you may well think  he talked a good deal to mrs jervis and at last ordered me to come in to him come in said he you little villain for so he called me good sirs what a name was there who is it you put your tricks upon i was resolved never to honor your unworthines said he with so much notice again and so you must disguise yourself to attract me and yet pretend like an hypocrite as you are   i was out of patience then hold good sir said i dont impure disguise and hypocrisy to me above all things for hate them both mean as i am i have put on no disguise  what aplague said he for that was his word do you mean then by this dress  why and please your honor said i i mean one of the honestest things in the world i have been in disguise indeed ever since my good lady your mother took me from my poor parents i came to her ladyship so poor and mean that these clothes i have on are a princelysuit to those i had then and her goodness heaped upon me rich clothes and other bounties and as i am now returning to my poor parents again so soon i cannot wear those good things without being whooted at and so have bought what will be more suitable to my degree and be a good holiday suit too when i get home  he then took me in his arms and presently pushed me from him mrs jervis said he take the little witch from me i can neither bear nor forbear her strange words these  but stay you shall not go  yet begone  no come back again  i thought he was mad for my share for he knew not what he would have but i was going however and he stepped after me and took hold of my arm and brought me in again i am sure he made my arm black and blue for the marks are upon it still sir sir said i pray have mercy i will i will come in  he sat down and looked at me and as i thought afterward as sillily as such a poor girl as i at last he said well mrs jervis as i was telling you you may permit her to stay a little longer till i see if my sister davers will have her if mean time she humble herself and ask this as a favor and is sorry for her pertness and the liberty she has taken with my character out of the house and in the house your honor indeed told me so said mrs jervis but i never found her inclinable to think herself in a fault pride and perverseness said he with a vengeance yet this is your doatingpiece  well for once i will submit myself to tell you hussy said he to me you may stay a fortnight longer till i see my sister davers do you hear what i say to you statue can you neither speak nor be thankful  your honor frights me so said i that i can hardly speak but i will venture to say that i have only to beg as a favor that i may go to my father and mother  why fool said he will not you like to go to wait on my sister davers sir said i i was once fond of that honor but you were pleased to say i might be in danger from her ladyships nephew or he from me  d  d impertinence said he do you hear mrs jervis do you hear how she retorts upon me was ever such matchless assurance   i then fell a weeping for mrs jervis said fie pamela fie  and i said my lot is very hard indeed i am sure i would hurt nobody and i have been it seems guilty of indiscretions which have cost me my place and my masters favor and so have been turned away and when the time is come that i should return to my poor parents i am not suffered to go quietly good your honor what have i done that i must be used worse than if i had robbed you  robbed me said he why so you have hussy you have robbed me who i sir said i have i robbed you why then you are a justice of peace and may send me to gaol if you please and bring me to a trial for my life if you can prove that i have robbed you i am sure i ought to die  now i was quite ignorant of his meaning though i did not like it when it was afterward explained neither and well thought i what will this come to at last if poor pamela is esteemed a thief then i thought in an instant how i should show my face to my honest poor parents if i was but suspected  but sir said i let me ask you but one question and pray dont let me be called names for it for i dont mean disrespectfully why if i have done amiss am i not left to be discharged by your housekeeper as the other maids have been and if jane or rachel or hannah were to offend would your honor stoop to take notice of them and why should you so demean yourself to take notice of me pray sir if i have not been worse than others why should i suffer more than others and why should i not be turned away and there is an end of it for indeed i am not of consequence enough for my master to concern himself and be angry about such a creature as me  do you hear mrs jervis cried he again how pertly i am interrrogated by this saucy slut why saucebox says he did not my good mother desire me to take care of you and have you not been always distinguished by me above a common servant and does your ingratitude upbraid me for this  i said something mutteringly and he vowed he would hear it i begged excuse but he insisted upon it why then said i if your honor must know i said that my good lady did not desire your care to extend to the summer house and her dressing room  well this was a little saucy you will say  and he flew into such a passion that i was forced to run sor it and mrs jervis said it was happy i got out of his way  why what makes him provoke one so then  i am almost sorry for it but i would be glad to get away at any rate for i begin to be more fearful now  just now mr jonathan sent me these lines  bless me what shall i do  dear mrs pamela take care of yourself for rachel heard my master say to mrs jervis who she believes was pleading for you say no more mrs jervis for by g  i will have her burn this instantly  o pray for your poor daughter i am called to go tobed by mrs jervis for it is past eleven and i am sure she shall hear of it for all this is owing to her though she did not mean any harm but i have been and am in a strange fluster and i suppose too she will say i have been full pert  o my dear father and mother power and riches never want advocates but poor gentlewoman she cannot live without him and he has been very good to her  so goodnight maybe i shall send this in the morning but maybe not so will not conclude though yet i must say i am with great apprehensions  your most dutiful daughter  letter xxv my dear parents o let me take up my complaint and say never was poor creature so unhappy and so barbarously used as poor pamela o my dear father and mother my hearts just broke i can neither write as i should do nor let it alone for to whom but you can i vent my griefs and keep my poor heart from bursting wicked wicked man  i have no patience left me  but yet dont be frighted  for  i hope  i hope i am honest  but if my head and my heart will let me you shall hear all  is there no constable nor headborough though to take me out of his house for i am sure i can safely swear the peace against him but alas he is greater than any constable and is a justice himself such a justice deliver me from  but god almighty i hope in time will right me  for he knows the innocence of my heart  john went your way in the morning but i have been too much distracted to send by him and have seen nobody but mrs jervis and rachel and one i hate to see and indeed i hate now to see any body strange things i have to tell you that happened since last night that good mr jonathans letter and my masters harshness put me into such a fluster but i will no more preambulate  i went to mrs jerviss chamber and o my dear father and mother my wicked master had hid himself base gentleman as he is in her closet where she has a few books and chest of drawers and suchlike i little suspected it though i used till this sad night always to look into that closet and another in the room and under the bed ever since the summer house trick but never found any thing and so i did not do it then being fully resolved to be angry with mrs jervis for what had happened in the day and so thought of nothing else  i sat myself down on one side of the bed and she on the other and we began to undress ourselves but she on that side next the wicked closet that held the worst heart in the world so said mrs jervis you will not speak to me pamela i find you are angry with me why mrs jervis said i so i am a little it is a folly to deny it you see what i have suffered by your forcing me in to my master and a gentlewoman of your years and experience must needs know that it was not fit for me to pretend to be any body else for my own sake nor with regard to my master  but said she who would have thought it would have turned out so ay said i little thinking who heard me lucifer always is ready to promote his own work and workmen you see presently what use he made of it pretending not to know me on purpose to be free with me and when he took upon himself to know me to quarrel with me and use me hardly and you too said i to cry fie fie pamela cut me to the heart for that encouraged him  do you think my dear said she that i would encourage him  i never said so to you before but since you force it from me i must tell you that ever since you consulted me i have used my utmost endeavors to divert him from his wicked purposes and he has promised fair but to say all in a word he doats upon you and i begin to see it is not in his power to help it  i luckily said nothing of the note from mr jonathan for i began to suspect all the world almost but i said to try mrs jervis well then what would you have me do you see he is for having me wait on lady davers now  why i will tell you freely my dear pamela said she and i trust to your discretion to conceal what i say my master has been often desiring me to put you upon asking him to let you stay   yes said i mrs jervis let me interrupt you i will tell you why i could not think of that it was not the pride of my heart but the pride of my honesty for what must have been the case here my master has been very rude to me once and twice and you say he cannot help it though he pretends to be sorry for it well he has given me warning to leave my place and uses me very harshly perhaps to frighten me to his purposes as he supposes i would be fond of staying as indeed i should if i could be safe for i love you and all the house and value him if he would act as my master well then as i know his designs and that he owns he cannot help it must i not have asked to stay knowing he would attempt me again for all you could assure me of was he would do nothing by force so i a poor weak girl was to be left to my own strength and was not this to allow him to tempt me as one may say and to encourage him to go on in his wicked devices  how then mrs jervis could i ask or wish to stay  you say well my dear child says she and you have a justness of thought above your years and for all these considerations and for what i have heard this day after you ran away and i am glad you went as you did i cannot persuade you to stay and i shall be glad which is what i never thought i could have said that you were well at your fathers for if lady davers will entertain you she may as well have you from thence as here there is my good mrs jervis said i god will bless you for your good counsel to a poor maiden that is hard beset but pray what did he say when i was gone why says she he was very angry with you but he would hear it i said i i think it was a little bold but then he provoked me to it and had not my honesty been in the case i would not by any means have been so saucy besides mrs jervis consider it was the truth if he does not love to hear of the summer house and the dressing room why should he not be ashamed to continue in the same mind but said she when you had muttered this to yourself you might have told him any thing else well said i i cannot tell a wilful lie and so there is an end of it but i find you now give him up and think there is danger in staying  lord bless me i wish i was well our of the house so it was at the bottom of a wet ditch on the wildest common in england  why said she it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was enough to make me fear you would not be so safe as i could wish and upon my word pamela i dont wonder he loves you for without flattery you are a charming girl and i never saw you look more lovely in my life than in that same new dress of yours and then it was such a surprise upon us all  i believe truly you owe some of your danger to the lovely appearance you made then said i i wish the clothes in the fire i expected no effect from them but if any a quite contrary one  hush said i mrs jervis did you not hear something stir in the closet no silly girl said she your fears are always awake  but indeed said i i think i heard something rustle  maybe says she the cat may be got there but i hear nothing  i was hush but she said prythee my good girl make haste tobed see if the door be fast so i did and was thinking to look in the closet but hearing no more noise thought it needless and so went again and sat myself down on the bedside and went on undressing myself and mrs jervis being by this time undressed stepped into bed and bid me hasten for she was sleepy  i dont know what was the matter but my heart sadly misgave me but mr jonathans note was enough to make it do so with what mrs jervis had said i pulled off my stays and my stockens and all my clothes to an underpetticoat and then hearing a rustling again in the closet i said heaven protect us but before i say my prayers i must look into this closet and so was going to it slipshod when o dreadful out rushed my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown  i screamd and ran to the bed and mrs jervis screamd too and he said i will do you no harm if you forbear this noise but otherwise take what follows  instantly he came to the bed for i had crept into it to mrs jervis with my coat on and my shoes and taking me in his arms said mrs jervis rise and just step up stairs to keep the maids from coming down at this noise i will do no harm to this rebel  o for heavens sake for pitys sake mrs jervis said i if i am not betrayed dont leave me and i beseech you raise all the house no said mrs jervis i will not stir my dear lamb i will not leave you i wonder at you sir said she and kindly threw herself upon my coat clasping me round the waist you shall not hurt this innocent said she for i will lose my life in her defense are there not said she enough wicked ones in the world for your base purpose but you must attempt such a lamb as this  he was desperate angry and threatened to throw her out of the window and to turn her out of the house the next morning you need not sir said she for i will not stay in it god defend my poor pamela till tomorrow and we will both go together  says he let me but expostulate a word or two with you pamela pray pamela said mrs jervis dont hear a word except he leaves the bed and goes to the other end of the room ay out of the room said i expostulate tomorrow if you must expostulate  i found his hand in my bosom and when my fright let me know it i was ready to die and i sighed and screamed and fainted away and still he had his arms about my neck and mrs jervis was about my feet and upon my coat and all in a cold clammy sweat was i pamela pamela said mrs jervis as she tells me since o  h and gave another shriek my poor pamela is dead for certain  and so to be sure i was for a time for i knew nothing more of the matter one fit following another till about three hours after as it proved to be i found myself in bed and mrs jervis sitting up on one side with her wrapper about her and rachel on the other and no master for the wicked wretch was gone but i was so overjoyed that i hardly could believe myself and i said which were my first words mrs jervis mrs rachel can i be sure it is you tell me can i  where have i been hush my dear said mrs jervis you have been in fit after fit i never saw any body so frightful in my life  by this i judged mrs rachel knew nothing of the matter and it seems my wicked master had upon mrs jerviss second noise on my fainting away slipped out and as if he had come from his own chamber disturbed by the screaming went up to the maids room who hearing the noise lay trembling and afraid to stir and bid them go down and see what was the matter with mrs jervis and me and he charged mrs jervis and promised to forgive her for what she had said and done if she would conceal the matter so the maids came down for the men lie in the outhouses and all went up again when i came to myself a little except rachel who staid to sit up with me and bear mrs jervis company i believe they all guess the matter to be bad enough though they dare not say any thing  when i think of my danger and the freedoms he actually took though i believe mrs jervis saved me from worse and she says he did though what can i think who was in a fit and knew nothing of the matter i am almost distracted  at first i was afraid of mrs jervis but i am fully satisfied she is very good and i should have been lost but for her and she takes on grievously about it what would have become of me had she gone out of the room to still the maids as he bid her he would certainly have shut her out and then mercy on me what would have become of your poor pamela  i must leave off a little for my eyes and my head are sadly bad  this was a dreadful trial this was the worst of all oh that i was out of the power of this dreadfully wicked man pray for  your distressed daughter  letter xxv my dear father and mother i did not rise till ten oclock and i had all the concerns and wishes of the family and multitudes of inquiries about me my wicked master went out early to hunt but left word he would be in to breakfast and so he was  he came up to our chamber about eleven and had nothing to do to be sorry for he was our master and so put on sharp anger at first  i had great emotions at his entering the room and threw my apron over my head and fell a crying as if my heart would break  mrs jervis said he since i know you and you me so well i dont know how we shall live together for the future sir said she i will take the liberty to say what i think is best for both i have so much grief that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl and especially in my chamber that i should think myself accessory to the mischief if i was not to take notice of it though my ruin therefore may depend upon it i desire not to stay but pray let poor pamela and me go together with all my heart said he and the sooner the better she fell a crying i find says he this girl has made a party of the whole house in her favor against me her innocence deserves it of us all said she very kindly and i never could have thought that the son of my dear good lady departed could have so forfeited his honor as to endeavor to destroy a virtue he ought to protect no more of this mrs jervis said he i will not bear it as for pamela she has a lucky knack at falling into fits when she pleases but the cursed yellings of you both made me not myself i intended no harm to her as i told you both if you would have left your squallings and i did no harm neither but to myself for i raised a hornets nest about my ears that as far as i know may have stung to death my reputation sir said mrs jervis then i beg mr longman may take my accounts and i will go away as soon as i can as for pamela she is at her liberty i hope to go away next thursday as she intends  i sat still for i could not speak nor look up and his presence discomposed me extremely but i was sorry to hear myself the unhappy occasion of mrs jerviss losing her place and hope that may be still made up  well said he let mr longman make up your accounts as soon as you will and mrs jewkes who is his housekeeper in lincolnshire shall come hither in your place and will not be less obliging i dare say than you have been said she i have never disobliged you till now and let me tell you sir if you knew what belonged to your own reputation or honor  no more no more said he of these antiquated topics i have been no bad friend to you and i shall always esteem you though you have not been so faithful to my secrets as i could have wished and have laid me open to this girl which has made her more afraid of me than she had occasion well sir said she after what passed yesterday and last night i think i went rather too far in favor of your injunctions than otherwise and i should have deserved every bodys censure as the basest of creatures had i been capable of contributing to your lawless attempts still mrs jervis still reflecting upon me and all for imaginary faults for what harm have i done the girl  i will not bear it i will assure you but yet in respect to my mother i am willing to part friendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom of your conversation in relation to me which i should have resented more than i do but that i am conscious i had no business to demean myself so as to be in your closet where i might have expected to hear a multitude of impertinence between you  well sir said she you have no objection i hope to pamelas going away on thursday next you are mighty solicitous said he about pamela but no not i let her go as soon as she will she is a naughty girl and has brought all this upon herself and upon me more trouble than she can have had from me but i have overcome it all and will never concern myself about her  i have a proposal made me added he since i have been out this morning that i shall go near to embrace and so wish only that a discreet use may be made of what is past and there is an end of every thing with me as to pamela i will assure you  i clasped my hands together through my apron overjoyed at this though i was soon to go away for naughty as he has been to me i wish his prosperity with all my heart for my good old ladys sake  well pamela said he you need not now be afraid to speak to me tell me what you lifted up your hands at i said not a word says he if you like what i have said give me your hand upon it i held my hand upon my apron for i could not speak to him and he took hold of it and pressed it though less hard than he did my arm the day before what does the little fool cover her face for said he pull your apron away and let me see how you look after your freedom of speech of me last night no wonder youre ashamed to see me you know you were very free with my character  i could not stand this harbarous insult at i took it to be considering his behavior to me and i then spoke and said o the difference between the minds of thy creatures good god how shall some be cast down in their innocence while others shall triumph in their guilt  and so saying i went up stairs to my chamber and wrote all this for though he vexed me at his taunting yet i was pleased to hear he was likely to be married and that his wicked intentions were so happily overcome as to me and this made me a little easier and i hope i have passed the worst or else it is very hard and yet i shall not think myself at ease quite till i am with you for methinks after all his repentance and amendment are mighty suddenly resolved upon but the divine grace is not confined to space and remorse may and i hope has smitten him to the heart at once for his injuries to poor me yet i will not be too secure neither  having opportunity i send now what i know will grieve you to the heart but i hope i shall bring my next scribble myself and so conclude though half brokenhearted  your everdutiful daughter  letter xxvi dear father and mother i am glad i desired you not to meet me and john says you will not for he says he told you he is sure i shall get a passage well enough either behind some one of my fellow servants on horseback or by farmer nicholss means but as for the chariot he talked to you of i cannot expect that favor to be sure and i should not care for it because it would look so much above me but farmer brady they say has a chaise with one horse and we hope to borrow that or hire it rather than fail though money runs a little lowish after what i have laid out but i dont care to say so here though i warrant i might have what i would of mrs jervis or mr jonathan or mr longman but then how shall i pay it you will say and besides i dont love to be beholden  but the chief reason i am glad you dont set out to meet me is the uncertainty for it seems i must stay another week still and hope certainly to go thursday after for poor mrs jervis will go at the same time she says and cannot be ready before  oh that i was once well with you  though he is very civil too at present and not so cross as he was and yet he is as vexatious another way as you shall hear for yesterday he had a rich suit of clothes brought home which they call a birthday suit for he intends to go to london against next birthday to see the court and our folks will have it he is to be made a lord  i wish they may make him an honest man as he was always thought but i have not found it so alas for me  and so as i was saying he had these clothes come home and he tried them on and before he pulled them off he sent for me when nobody else was in the parlour with him pamela said he you are so neat and so nice in your own dress alackaday i didnt know i was that you must be a judge of ours how are these clothes made do they fit me  i am no judge said i and please your honor but i think they look very fine  his waistcoat stood an end with gold lace and he looked very grand but what he did last has made me very serious and i could make him no compliments said he why dont you wear your usual clothes though i think every thing looks well upon you for i still continue in my new dress i said i have no clothes sir i ought to call my own but these and it is no matter what such a one as i wears said he why you look very serious pamela i see you can bear malice  yes so i can sir said i according to the occasion why said he your eyes always look red i think are you not a fool to take my last freedom so much at heart i am sure you and that fool mrs jervis frightened me by your hideous squalling as much as i could frighten you that is all we had for it said i and if you could be so afraid of your own servants knowing of your attempts upon a poor unworthy creature that is under your protection while i stay surely your honor ought to be more afraid of god almighty in whose presence we all stand in every action of our lives and to whom the greatest as well as the least must be accountable let them think what they list  he took my hand in a kind of goodhumored mockery and said well said my pretty preacher i when my lincolnshire chaplain dies i will put thee on a gown and cassock and thou wilt make a good figure in his place  i wish said i a little vexed at his jeer your honors conscience would be your preacher and then you would need no other chaplain well well pamela said he no more of this unfashionable jargon i did not send for you so much for your opinion of my new suit as to tell you you are welcome to stay since mrs jervis desires it till she goes i welcome said i i am sure i shall rejoice when i am out of the house  well said he you are an ungrateful baggage but i am thinking it would be pity with these fair soft hands and that lovely skin as he called it and took hold of my hand that you should return again to hard work as you must if you go to your fathers and so i would advise her to take a house in london and let lodgings to us members of parliament when we come to town and such a pretty daughter as you may pass for will always fill her house and she will get a great deal of money  i was sadly vexed at this barbarous joke but was ready to cry before and i gushed out into tears and endeavoring to get my hand from him but in vain said i can expect no better from such a rude gentleman your behavior sir to me has been just of a piece with these words nay i will say it though you were to be ever so angry  i angry pamela no no said he i have overcome all that and as you are to go away i look upon you now as mrs jerviss guest while you both stay and not as my servant and so you may say what you will but i will tell you pamela why you need not take this matter in such high disdain i  you have a very pretty romantic turn for virtue and all that  and i dont suppose but you will hold it still and nobody will be able to prevail upon you but my child fleeringly he spoke it do but consider what a fine opportunity you will then have for a tale every day to good mother jervis and what subjects for letterwriting to your father and mother and what pretty preachments you may hold forth to the young gentlemen ads my hear i think it would be the best thing you and she could do  you do well sir said i to even your wit to such a poor maiden as me but sir let me say that if you was not rich and great and i poor and little you would not insult me thus  let me ask you sir if you think this becomes your fine clothes and a masters station why so serious my pretty pamela said he why so grave and would kiss me but my heart was full and i said let me alone i will tell you if you was a king and said to me what you have done that you are no gentleman and i will not stay to be used thus i will go to the next farmers and there wait for mrs jervis if she must go and i would have you know sir that i can stoop to the ordinariest work of your scullions for all these nasty soft hands sooner than bear such ungentlemanly imputations  well said he i sent for you in in high good humor but it is impossible to hold it with such an impertinent however i will keep my temper but while i see you here pray dont put on those dismal grave looks why girl you should forbear em if it were but for your pridesake for the family will think you are grieving to leave the house then sir said i i will try to convince them of the contrary as well as your honor for i will endeavor to be more cheerful while i stay for that very reason  well said he i will set this down by itself as the first time that ever what i advised had any weight with you and i will say said i as the first advice you have given me of late that was fit to be followed  i wish said he i am almost ashamed to write it impudent gentleman as he is i wish i had thee as quick another way as thou art in thy repartees  and he laughed and i snatched my hand from him and i trippd away as fast as i could ah thought i married i am sure it is time you were married or at this rate no honest maiden ought to live with you  why dear father and mother to be sure he grows quite a rake well you see how easy it is to go from bad to worse when once people give way to vice  how would my poor lady had she lived have grieved to see it but maybe he would have been better then  though it seems he told mrs jervis he had an eye upon me in his mothers lifetime and he intended to let me know as much by the bye he told her here is shamelessness for you sure the world must be near at an end for all the gentlemen about are as bad as he almost as far as i can hear  and see the fruits of such bad examples there is squire martin in the grove has had three lyingsin it seems in his house in three months past one by himself and one by his coachman and one by his woodmen and yet he has turned none of them away indeed how can he when they but follow his own vile example there is he and two or three more such as he within ten miles of us who keep company and hunt with our fine master truly and i suppose he is never the better for their examples but heaven bless me say i and send me out of this wicked house  but dear father and mother what sort of creatures must the womenkind be do you think to give way to such wickedness why this it is that makes every one be thought of alike and alackaday what a world we live in for it is grown more a wonder that the men are resisted than that the women comply this i suppose makes me such a saucebox and boldface and a creature and all because i will not be a saucebox and boldface indeed  but i am sorry for these things one dont know what arts and stratagems these men may devise to gain their vile ends and so i will think as well as i can of these poor creatures and pity them for you see by my sad story and narrow escapes what hardships poor maidens go through whose lot it is to go out to service especially to houses where there is not the fear of god and good rule kept by the heads of the family  you see i am quite grown grave and serious so it becomes  your dutiful daughter  letter xxvii dear father and mother john says you wept when you read my last letter that he carried i am sorry you let him see that for they all mistrust already how matters are and as it is no credit that i have been attempted though it is that i have resisted yet i am sorry they have cause to think so evil of my master from any of us  mrs jervis has made up her accounts with mr longman and will stay in her place i am glad of it for her own sake and for my masters for she has a good master of him so indeed all have but poor me  and he has a good housekeeper in her  mr longman it seems took upon him to talk to my master how faithful and careful of his interests she was and how exact in her accounts and he told him there was no comparison between her accounts and mrs jewkerss at the lincolnshire estate he said so many fine things it seems of mrs jervis that my master sent for her in mr longmans presence and said pamela might come along with her i suppose to mortify me that i must go while she was to stay but as when i go away i am not to go with her nor was she to go with me so i did not matter it much only it would have been creditable to such a poor girl that the housekeeper would bear me company if i went  said he to her well mrs jervis mr longman says you have made up your accounts with him with your usual fidelity and exactness i had a good mind to make you an offer of continuing with me if you can be a little sorry for your hasty words which indeed were not so respectful as i have deserved at your hands she seemed at a sad loss what to say because mr longman was there and she could not speak of the occasion of those words which was me  indeed said mr longman i must needs say before your face that since i have known my masters family i have never found such good management in it nor so much love and harmony neither i wish the lincolnshire estate was as well served  no more of that said my master but mrs jervis may stay if she will and here mrs jervis pray accept of this which at the close of every years accounts i will present you with besides your salary as long as i find your care so useful and agreeable and he gave her five guineas  she made him a low curtsy and thanking him looked to me as if she would have spoken to me  he took her meaning i believe for he said  indeed i love to encourage merit and obligingness mr longman but i can never be equally kind to those who dont deserve it at my hands as to those who do and then he looked full at me mr longman continued he i said that girl might come in with mrs jervis because they love to be always together for mrs jervis is very good to her and loves her as well as if she was her daughter but else  mr longman interrupting him said good to mrs pamela ay sir and so she is to be sure but every body must be good to her for   he was going on but my master said no more no more mr longman i see old men are taken with pretty young girls as well as other folks and fair looks hide many a fault where a person has the art to behave obligingly why and please your honor said mr longman every body  and was going on i believe to say something more in my praise but he interrupted him and said not a word more of this pamela i cannot let her stay i will assure you not only for her own freedom of speech but her letterwriting of all the secrets of my family ay said the good old man i am sorry for that too but sir  no more i say said my master for my reputations so well known mighty fine thought i that i care not what any body writes or says of me but to tell you the truth not that it need go further i think of changing my condition soon and you know young ladies of birth and fortune will choose their own servants and that is my chief reason why pamela cannot stay as for the rest said he the girl is a good sort of body take her all together though i must needs say a little pert since my mothers death in her answers and gives me two words for one which i cannot bear nor is there reason i should you know mr longman no to be sure sir said he but it is strange methinks she should be so mild and meek to every one of us in the house and forget herself so where she should show most respect very true mr longman said he but so it is i will assure you and it was from her pertness that mrs jervis and i had the words and i should mind it the less but that the girl there she stands i say it to her face has wit and sense above her years and knows better  i was in great pain to say something but yet i knew not what before mr longman and mrs jervis looked at me and walked to the window to hide her concern for me at last i said it is for you sir to say what you please and for me only to say god bless your honor  poor mr longman falterd in his speech and was ready to cry said my insulting master to me why prythee pamela now show thyself as thou art before mr longman can not give him a specimen of that pertness which thou have exercised upon me sometimes  did he not my dear father and mother deserve all the truth to be told yet i overcame myself so far as to say well your honor may play upon a poor girl that you can answer you but dare not  why prythee now insinuator said he say the worst you can before mr longman and mrs jervis i challenge the utmost of thy impertinence and as you are going away and have the love of every body i would be a little justified to my family that you have no reason to complain of hardships from me as i have of pert saucy answers from you besides exposing me by your letters  surely sir said i i am of no consequence equal to this in your honors family that such a great gentleman as you my master should need to justify yourself about me i am glad mrs jervis stays with your honor and i know i have not deserved to stay and more than that i dont desire to stay  adsbobbers said mr longman and ran to me dont say so dont say so dear mrs pamela we all love you dearly and pray down of your knees and ask his honor pardon and we will all become pleaders in a body and i and mrs jervis too at the head of it to beg his honors pardon and to continue you at least till his honor marries  no mr longman said i i cannot ask nor will i stay if i might all i desire is to return to my poor father and mother and though i love you all i will not stay  o welladay welladay said the good old man i did not expect this  when i had got matters thus far and had made all up for mrs jervis i was in hopes to have got a double holiday of joy for all the family in your pardon too well said my master this is a little specimen of what i told you mr longman you see there is a spirit you did not expect  mr jervis told me after that she could stay no longer to hear me so hardly used and must have spoken had she stayed what would never have been forgiven her so she went out i looked after her to go too but my master said come pamela give another specimen i desire you to mr longman i am sure you must if you will but speak well sir said i since it seems your greatness wants to be justified by my lowness and i have no desire you should suffer in the sight of your family i will say on my bended knees and so i kneeled down that i have been a very faulty and a very ungrateful creature to the best of masters i have been very perverse and saucy and have deserved nothing at your hands but to be turned out of your family with shame and disgrace i therefore have nothing to say for myself but that i am not worthy to stay and so cannot wish to stay and will not stay and so god almighty bless you and you mr longman and good mrs jervis and every living soul of the family and i will pray for you as long as i live  and so i rose up and was forced to lean upon my masters elbowchair or i should have sunk down  the poor old man wept more than i and said adsbobbers was ever the like heard it is too much too much i cannot bear it as i hope to live i am quite melted dear sir forgive her the poor thing prays for you she prays for us all she owns her fault yet will not be forgiven i profess i know not what to make of it  my master himself hardened wretch as he was seemed a little moved and took his handkerchief out of his pocket and walked to the window what sort of a day is it said he  and then getting a little more hardheartedness he said well you may be gone from my presence thou strange medley of inconsistence but you shall not stay after your time in the house  nay pray sir pray sir said the good old man relent a little adsheartlikins you young gentlemen are made of iron and steel i think i am sure said he my hearts turned into butter and is running away at my eyes i never felt the like before  said my master with an imperious tone get out of my presence hussy i cannot bear you in my sight sir said i i am going as fast as i can  but indeed my dear father and mother my head was so giddy and my limbs trembled so that i was forced to go holding by the wainscot all the way with both my hands and thought i should not have got to the door but when i did as i hoped this would be my last interview with this terrible hardhearted master i turned about and made a low curtsy and said god bless you sir god bless you mr longman and i went into the lobby leading to the great hall and dropped into the first chair for i could get no further a good while  i leave all these things to your reflection my dear parents but i can write no more my poor hearts almost broken indeed it is  o when shall i get away  send me good god in safety once more to my poor fathers peaceful cot  and there the worst that can happen will be joy in perfection to what i now bear  o pity  your distressed daughter  letter xxviii my dear father and mother i must write on though i shall come so soon for now i have hardly any thing else to do for i have finished all that lay upon me to do and only wait the good time of setting out mrs jervis said i must be low in pocket for what i had laid out and so would have presented me with two guineas of her five but i could not take them of her because poor gentlewoman she pays old debts for her children that were extravagant and wants them herself this though was very good in her  i am sorry i shall have but little to bring with me but i know you will not you are so good  and i will work the harder when i come home if i can get a little plainwork or any thing to do but all your neighborhood is so poor that i fear i shall want work but maybe dame mumford can help me to something from some good family she is acquainted with  here what a sad thing it is i have been brought up wrong as matters stand for you know my good lady now in heaven loved singing and dancing and as she would have it i had a voice she made me learn both and often and often has she made me sing her an innocent song and a good psalm too and dance before her and i must learn to flower and draw too and to work fine work with my needle why all this too i have got pretty tolerably at my fingers end as they say and she used to praise me and was a good judge of such matters  well now what is all this to the purpose as things have turned about  why no more nor less than that i am like the grasshopper in the fable which i have read of in my ladys books and i will write it down in the very words as the ants were airing their provisions one winter a hungry grasshopper as suppose it was poor i begged a charity of them they told him that he should have wrought in summer if he would not have wanted in winter well says the grasshopper but i was not idle neither for i sung out the whole season nay then said they you will even do well to make a merry year of it and dance in winter to the tune you sung in summer  so i shall make a fine figure with my singing and my dancing when i come home to you nay i doubt i shall even be unfit for a may day holidaytime for these minuits rigadoons and french dances that i have been practicing will make me but ill company for my rural milkmaid companions that are to be to be sure i had better as things stand have learned to wash and scour and brew and bake and suchlike but i hope if i cannot get work and can get a place to learn these soon if any body will have the goodness to bear with me till i can learn for i bless god i have an humble and a teachable mind for all what my master says and next to his grace that is all my comfort for i shall think nothing too mean that is honest it may be a little hard at first but woe to my proud heart if i shall find it so on trial for i will make it bend to its condition or will break it  i have read of a good bishop that was to be burnt for his religion and he tried how he could bear it by putting his fingers into the lighted candle so i the other day tried when rachels back was turned if i could not scour the pewter plate she had begun i see i could do it by degrees though i blisterd my hand in two places  all the matter is if i could get needle work enough i would not spoil my fingers by this rough work but if i cannot i hope to make my hands as red as a bloodpudden and as hard as a beechen trencher to accommodate them to my condition  but i must break off here is somebody coming  it is only our hannah with a message from mrs jervis  but hold here is somebody else  well it is only rachel  i am as much frighted as were the city mouse and the country mouse in the same book of fables at every thing that stirs oh i have a power of these things to entertain you with in winter evenings when i come home if i can but get work with a little time for reading i hope we shall be very happy over our peat fires  what made me hint to you that i should bring but little with me is this  you must know i did intend to do as i have this afternoon and that is i took all my clothes and all my linen and i divided them into three parcels as i had before told mrs jervis i intended to do and i said it is now monday mrs jervis and i am to go away on thursday morning betimes so though i know you dont doubt my honesty i beg you will look over my poor matters and let every one have what belongs to them for said i you know i am resolved to take with me only what i can properly call my own  said she i did not know her drift then to be sure she meant well but i did not thank her for it when i did know it let your things be brought down into the greenroom and i will do any thing you would have me do  with all my heart said i greenroom or anywhere but i think you might step up and see em as they lie  however i fetched em down and laid them in three parcels as before and when i had done i went down to call her up to look at them  now it seems she had prepared my master for this scene unknown to me and in this greenroom was a closet with a sashdoor and a curtain before it for there she puts her sweetmeats and such things and she did it it seems to turn his heart as knowing what i intended i suppose that he should make me take the things for if he had i should have made money of them to help us when we got together for to be sure i could never have appeared in them  well as i was saying he had got unknown to me in this closet i suppose while i went to call mrs jervis and she since told me it was at his desire when she told him something of what i intended or else she would not have done it though i have reason i am sure to remember the last closetwork  so i said when she came up here mrs jervis is the first parcel i will spread it all abroad these are the things my good lady gave me  in the first place said i  and so i went on describing the clothes and linen my lady had given me mingling blessings as i proceeded for her goodness to me and when i had turned over that parcel i said well so much for the first parcel mrs jervis that was my ladys gifts  now i come to the presents of my dear virtuous master hay you know closet for that mrs jervis she laughed and said i never saw such a comical girl in my life but go on i will mrs jervis said i as soon as i have opened the bundle for i was as brisk and as pert as could be little thinking who heard me  now here mrs jervis said i are my ever worthy masters presents and then i particularized all those in the second bundle  after which i turned to my own and said  now mrs jervis comes poor pamelas bundle and a little one it is to the others first here is a calico nightgown that i used to wear of mornings twill be rather too good for me when i get home but i must have something then there is a quilted calimanco coat and a pair of stockens i bought of the pedlar and my strawhat with blue strings and a remnant of scots cloth which will make two shirts and two shifts the same i have on for my poor father and mother and here are four other shifts one the fellow to that i have on another pretty good one and the other two old fine ones that will serve me to turn and wind with at home for they are not worth leaving behind me and here are two pair of shoes i have taken the lace off which i will burn and maybe will fetch me some little matter at a pinch with an old silver buckle or two  what do you laugh for mrs jervis said i  why you are like an april day you cry and laugh in a breath  well let me seen ay here is a cotton handkerchief i bought of the pedlar there should be another somewhere o here it is and here too are my newbought knit mittens and this is my new flannel coat the fellow to that i have on and in this parcel pinned together are several pieces of printed calico remnants of silks and suchlike that if good luck should happen and i should get work would serve for robings and facings and suchlike uses and here too are a pair of pockets they are too fine for me but i have no worse bless me said i i did not think i had so many good things  well mrs jervis said i you have seen all my store and i will now sit down and tell you a piece of my mind  be brief then said she my good girl for she was afraid she said afterward that i should say too much  why then the case is this i am to enter upon a point of equity and conscience mrs jervis and i must beg if you love me you would let me have my own way those things there of my ladys i can have no claim to so as to take them away for she gave them me supposing i was to wear them in her service and to do credit to her bountiful heart but since i am to be turned away you know i cannot wear them at my poor fathers for i should bring all the little village upon my back and so i resolve not to have them  then mrs jervis said i i have far less right to these of my worthy masters for you see what was his intention in giving them to me so they were to be the price of my shame and if i could make use of them i should think i should never prosper with them and besides you know mrs jervis if i would not do the good gentlemans work why should i take his wages so in conscience in honor in every thing i have nothing to say to thee thou second wicked bundle  but said i come to my arms my dear third parcel the companion of my poverty and the witness of my honesty and may i never deserve the least rag that is contained in thee when i forfeit a title to that innocence that i hope will ever be the pride of my life and then i am sure it will be my highest comfort at my death when all the riches and pomps of the world will be worse than the vilest rags that can be worn by beggars and so i hugged my third bundle  but said i mrs jervis and she wept to hear me one thing more i have to trouble you with and that is all  there are four guineas you know that came out of my good ladys pocket when she died that with some silver my master gave me now these same four guineas i sent to my poor father and mother and they have broken them but would make them up if i would and if you think it should be so it shall but pray tell me honestly your mind as to the three years before my ladys death do you think as i had no wages i may be supposed to be quits  by quits i cannot mean that my poor services should be equal to my ladys goodness for that is impossible but as all her learning and education of me as matters have turned will be of little service to me now for it had been better for me to have been brought up to hard labor to be sure for that i must turn to at last if i cannot get a place and you know in places too one is subject to such temptations as are dreadful to think of so i say by quits i only mean as i return all the good things she gave me whether i may not set my little services against my keeping because as i said my learning is not now in the question and i am sure my dear good lady would have thought so had she lived but that too is now out of the question well then if so i would ask whether in above this year that i have lived with my master as i am resolved to leave all his gifts behind me i may not have earned besides my keeping these four guineas and these poor clothes here upon my back and in my third bundle now tell me your mind freely without favor or affection  alas my dear maiden said she you make me unable to speak to you at all to be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offered for you to leave any of these things behind you and you must take all your bundles with you or my master will never forgive you  well well mrs jervis said i i dont care i have been too much used to be snubbd and hardly treated by my master of late i have done him no harm and i shall always pray for him and wish him happy but i dont deserve these things i know i dont then i cannot wear them if i should take them so they can be of no use to me and i trust i shall not want the poor pittance that is all i desire to keep life and soul together bread and water i can live upon mrs jervis with content water i shall get anywhere and if i cannot get me bread i will live like a bird in winter upon hips and haws and at other times upon pignuts and potatoes or turnips or any thing so what occasion have i for these things  but all i ask is about these four guineas and if you think i need not return them that is all i want to know  to be sure my dear you need not said she you have well earned them by that waistcoat only no i think not so in that only but in the linen and other things do you think i have yes yes said she and more and my keeping allowed for i mean said i and these poor clothes on my back besides remember that mrs jervis yes my dear oddones no doubt you have well then said i i am as happy as a princess i am quite as rich as i wish to be and once more my dear third bundle i will hug thee to my bosom and i beg you will say nothing of all this till i am gone that my master may not be so angry but that i may go in peace for my heart without other matters will be ready to break to part with you all  now mrs jervis said i as to one matter more and that is my masters last usage of me before mr longman  said she prythee dear pamela step to my chamber and fetch me a paper i left on my table i have something to show you in it i will said i and stepped down but that was only a fetch to take the orders of my master i found it seems he said he thought two or three times to have burst out upon me but he could not stand it and wished i might not know he was there but i tript up again so nimbly for there was no paper that i just saw his back as if coming out of that green room and going into the next to it the first door that was open  i whipped in and shut the door and bolted it o mrs jervis said i what have you done by me  i see i cannot confide in any body i am beset on all hands wretched wretched pamela where shall thou expect a friend if mrs jervis joins to betray me thus  she made so many protestations telling me all and that he owned i had made him wipe his eyes two or three times and said she hoped it would have a good effect and remembered me that i had said nothing but would rather move compassion than resentment that i forgave her but o that i was safe from this house for never poor creature sure was so flusterd as i have been for so many months together  i am called down from this most tedious scribble i wonder what will next befall  your dutiful daughter mrs jervis says she is sure i shall have the chariot to carry me home to you though this will look too great for me yet it will show as if i was not turned away quite in disgrace the traveling chariot is come from lincolnshire and i fansy i shall go in that for the other is quite grand    letter xxix my dear father and mother i write again though maybe i shall bring it to you in my pocket myself for i shall have no writeing nor writingtime i hope when i come to you this is wednesday morning and i shall i hope set out to you tomorrow morning but i have had more trials and more vexation but of another complexion too a little though all from the same quarter  yesterday my master after he came from hunting sent for me i went with great terror for i expected he would storm and be in a fine passion with me for my freedom of speech before so i was resolved to begin first with submission to disarm his anger and i fell upon my knees as soon as i saw him and i said good sir let me beseech you as you hope to be forgiven yourself and for the sake of my dear good lady your mother who recommended me to you with her last words to forgive me all my faults and only grant me this favor the last i have to ask you that you will let me depart your house with peace and quietness of mind that i may take such a leave of my dear fellow servants as befits me and that my heart be not quite broken  he took me up in a kinder manner than ever i had known and he said shut the door pamela and come to me in my closet i want to have a little serious talk with you how can i sir said i how can i and wrung my hands o pray sir let me go out of your presence i beseech you by the god that made me said he i will do you no harm shut the parlourdoor and come to me in my library  he then went into his closet which is his library and full of rich pictures besides a noble apartment though called a closet and next the private garden into which it has a door that opens i shut the parlourdoor as he bid me but stood at it irresolute place some confidence in me surely said he you may when i have spoken thus solemnly so i crept toward him with trembling feet and my heart throbbing through my handkerchief come in said he when i bid you i did so pray sir said i pity and spare me i will said he as i hoped to be saved he sat down upon a rich settee and took hold of my hand and said dont doubt me pamela from this moment i will no more consider you as my servant and i desire you will not use me with ingratitude for the kindness i am going to express toward you this a little emboldened me and he said holding both my hands in his you have too much wit and good sense not to discover that i in spite of my heart and all the pride of it cannot but love you yes look up to me my sweetfacd girl i must say i love you and have put on a behavior to you that was much against my heart in hopes to frighten you to my purposes you see i own it ingenuously and dont play your sex upon me for it  i was unable to speak and he seeing me too much oppressed with confusion to go on in that strain said well pamela let me know in what situation of life is your father i know he is a poor man but is he as low and as honest as he was when my mother took you  then i could speak a little and with a down look and i felt my face glow like fire i said yes sir as poor and as honest too and that is my pride says he i will do something for him if it be not your fault and make all your family happy ah sir said i he is happier already than ever he can be if his daughters innocence is to be the price of your favor and i beg you will not speak to me on the only side that can wound me i have no design of that sort said he o sir said i tell me not so tell me not so  it is easy said he for me to be the making of your father without injuring you well sir said i if this can be done let me know how and all i can do with innocence shall be the study and practice of my life  but oh what can such a poor creature as i do and do my duty  said he i would have you stay a week or a fortnight only and behave yourself with kindness to me i stoop to beg it of you and you shall see all shall turn out beyond your expectation i see said he you are going to answer otherwise than i would have you and i begin to be vexed i should thus meanly sue and so i will say that your behavior before honest longman when i used you as i did and you could so well have vindicated yourself has quite charmed me and though i am not pleased with all you said yesterday while i was in the closer yet you have moved me more to admire you than before and i am awakened to see more worthiness in you than ever i saw in any lady in the world all the servants from the highest to the lowest dote upon you instead of envying you and look upon you in so superior a light as speaks what you ought to be i have seen more of your letters than you imagine this surprised me and am quite overcome with your charming manner of writing so free so easy and many of your sentiments so much above your years and your sex and all put together makes me as i tell you love you to extravagance now pamela when i have stooped so low as to acknowledge all this oblige me only to stay another week or fortnight to give me time to bring about some certain affairs and you shall see how much you shall find your account in it  i trembled to find my poor heart giving way  o good sir said i spare a poor maiden that cannot look up to you and speak my heart is full and why should you wish to undo me  only oblige me said he to stay a fortnight longer and john shall carry word to your father that i will see him in the time either here or at the swan in his village o sir said i my heart will burst but on my bended knees i beg you to let me go tomorrow as i designed and dont offer to tempt a poor creature whose whole will would be to do yours if my virtue would permit  it shall permit it said he for i intend no injury to you god is my witness  impossible said i i cannot sir believe you after what has passed how many ways are there to undo poor creatures good god protect me this one time and send me but to my dear fathers cot in safety  strange damned fate says he that when i speak so solemnly i cannot be believed  what should i believe sir said i what can i believe what have you said but that i am to stay a fortnight longer and what then is to become of me  my pride of birth and fortune damn them both said he since they cannot obtain credit with you but must add to your suspicions will not let me stoop at once and i ask you but a fortnights stay that after this declaration i may pacify those proud demands upon me  o how my heart throbbd and i began for i did not know what i did to say the lords prayer none of your beads to me pamela said he thou art a perfect nun i think  but i said aloud with my eyes lifted up to heaven lead me not into temptation but deliver me from evil o my good god he hugged me in his arms and said well my dear girl then you stay this fortnight and you shall see what i will do for you  i will leave you a moment and walk into the next room to give you time to think of it and to show you i have no design upon you well this i thought did not look amiss  he went out and i was tortured with twenty different thoughts in a minute sometimes i thought that to stay a week or fortnight longer in this house to obey him while mrs jervis was with me could do no great harm but then thought i how do i know what i may be able to do i have withstood his anger but may i not relent at his kindness  how shall i stand that  well i hope thought i by the same protecting grace in which i will always confide  but then what has he promised why he will make my poor father and mothers life comfortable o said i to myself that is a rich thought but let me not dwell upon it for fear i should indulge it to my ruin  what can he do for me poor girl as i am  what can his greatness stoop to he talks thought i of his pride of heart and pride of condition o these are in his head and in his heart too or he would not confess them to me at such an instant well then thought i this can be only to seduce me  he has promised nothing  but i am to see what he will do if i stay a fortnight and this fortnight thought i again is no such great matter and i shall see in a few days how he carries it  but then when i again reflected upon the distance between him and me and his now open declaration of love as he called it and that after this he would talk with me on that subject more plainly than ever and i should be less armed maybe to withstand him and then i bethought myself why if he meant no dishonor he should not speak before mrs jervis and the odious frightful closet came again into my head and my narrow escape upon it and how easy it might be for him to send mrs jervis and the maids out of the way and so that all the mischief he designed me might be brought about in less than that time i resolved to go away and trust all to providence and nothing to myself and how ought i to be thankful for this resolution  as you shall hear  but just as i have writ to this place john sends me word that he is going this minute your way and so i will send so far as i have written and hope by tomorrow night to ask your blessings at your own poor but happy abode and tell you the rest by word of mouth and so i rest till then and for ever  your dutiful daughter  letter xxx my dear father and mother i will continue my writing still because maybe i shall like to read it when i am with you to see what dangers i have been enabled to escape and though i bring it along with me  i told you my resolution my happy resolution as i have reason to think it and just then he came in again with great kindness in his looks and said i make no doubt pamela you will stay this fortnight to oblige me i knew not how to frame my words so as to deny and yet not make him storm but said i forgive sir your poor distressed maiden i know i cannot possibly deserve any favor at your hands consistent with virtue and i beg you will let me go to my poor father why said he thou art the veriest fool that i ever knew i tell you i will see your father i will send for him hither tomorrow in my traveling chariot if you will and i will let him know what i intend to do for him and you what sir may i ask you can that be your honors noble estate may easily make him happy and not unuseful perhaps to you in some respect or other but what price am i to pay for all this  you shall be happy as you can wish said he i do assure you and here i will now give you this purse in which are fifty guineas which i will allow your father yearly and find an employ suitable to his liking to deserve that and more pamela he shall never want depend upon it i would have given you still more for him but that perhaps you would suspect i intended it as a design upon you  o sir said i take back your guineas i will not touch one nor will my father i am sure till he knows what is to be done for them and particularly what is to become of me why then pamela said he suppose i find a man of probity and genteel calling for a husband for you that shall make you a gentlewoman as long as you live  i want no husband sir said i for now i began to see him in all his black colors  but being in his power so i thought i would a little dissemble but said he you are so pretty that go where you will you will never be free from the designs of some or other of our sex and i shall think i dont answer the care of my dying mother for you who committed you to me if i dont provide you a husband to protect your virtue and your innocence and a worthy one i have thought of for you  o black perfidious creature thought i what an implement art thou in the hands of lucifer to ruin the innocent heart  but still i dissembled for i feared much both him and the place i was in but whom pray sir have you thought of  why said be young mr williams my chaplain in lincolnshire who will make you happy does he know sir said i any thing of your honors intentions  no my girl said he and kissed me much against my will for his very breath was now poison to me but his dependence upon my favor and your beauty and merit will make him rejoice at my kindness to him well sir said i then it is time enough to consider of this matter and this cannot hinder me from going to my fathers for what will staying a fortnight longer signify to this your honors care and goodness may extend to me there as well as here and mr williams and all the world shall know that i am not ashamed of my fathers poverty  he would kiss me again and i said if i am to think of mr williams or any body i beg you will not be so free with me that is not pretty i am sure well said he but you stay this next fortnight and in that time i will have both williams and your father here for i will have the match concluded in my house and when i have brought it on you shall settle it as you please together mean time take and send only these fifty pieces to your father as an earnest of my favor and i will make you all happy  sir said i i beg at least two hours to consider of this i shall said he be gone out in one hour and i would have you write to your father what i propose and john shall carry it on purpose and he shall take the purse with him for the good old man if you approve it sir said i i will then let you know in one hour my resolution do so said he and gave me another kiss and let me go  o how i rejoiced i had got out of his clutches  so i write you this that you may see how matters stand for i am resolved to come away if possible base wicked treacherous gentleman as he is  so here was a trap laid for your poor pamela i tremble to think of it o what a scene of wickedness was here laid down for all my wretched life blackhearted wretch how i hate him  for at first as you will see by what i have written he would have made me believe other things and this of mr williams i believe came into his head after he walked out from his closet as i suppose to give himself time to think how to delude me better but the covering was now too thin and easy to be seen through  i went to my chamber and the first thing i did was to write to him for i thought it was best not to see him again if i could help it and i put it under his parlourdoor after i had copied it as follows honourd sir your last proposal to me convinces me that i ought not to stay but to go to my father if it were but to ask his advice about mr williams and i am so set upon it that i am not to be persuaded so honored sir with a thousand thanks for all favors i will set out tomorrow early and the honor you designed me as mrs jervis tells me of your chariot there will be no occasion for because i can hire i believe farmer bradys chaise so begging you will not take it amiss i shall ever be  your dutiful servant as to the purse sir my poor father to be sure will not forgive me if i take it till he can know how to deserve it which is impossible  so he has just now sent mrs jervis to tell me that since i am resolved to go go i may and the traveling chariot shall be ready but it shall be worse for me for that he will never trouble himself about me as long as he lives well so i get out of the house i care not only i should have been glad i could with innocence have made you my dear parents happy  i cannot imagine the reason of it but john who i thought was gone with my last is but now going and he sends to know if i have any thing else to carry so i break off to send you this with the former  i am now preparing for my journey and about taking leave of my good fellow servants and if i have not time to write i must tell you the rest when i am so happy as to be with you  one word more i slip in a paper of verses on my going sad poor stuff but as they come from me you will not dislike them maybe i showed them to mrs jewkes and she liked them and took a copy and made me sing them to her and in the green room too but i looked into the closet first i will only add that i am  your dutiful daughter       let me just say that he has this moment sent me five guineas by mrs jervis as a present for my pocket so i shall be very rich for as she brought them i thought i might take them he says he will not see me and i may go when i will in the morning and lincolnshire robin shall drive me but he is so angry he orders that nobody shall go out at the door with me not so much as into the coachyard well i cannot help it not i but does not this expose himself more than me  but john waits and i would have brought this and the other myself but he says he has put it up among other things and so can take both as well as one  john is very good and very honest i am under great obligations to him i would give him a guinea now i am so rich if i thought he would take it i hear nothing of my ladys clothes and those my master gave me for i told mrs jervis i would not take them but i fansy by a word or two that was dropped they will be sent after me dear sirs what a rich pamela you will have if they should but as i cannot wear them if they do i dont desire them and if i have them will turn them into money as i can have opportunity well no more  i am in a fearful hurry  verses on my going away i my fellow servants dear attend to these few lines which i have penned i am sure they are from your honest friend and wisherwell poor pamela ii i from a state of low degree was taken by our good lady some say it better had been for me i would still been rustic pamela iii but yet my friends i hope not so for though i to my station low again return i joyful go and think no shame to pamela iv for what makes out true happiness but innocence and inward peace and that thank god i do possess o happy happy pamela v my future lot i cannot know but this i am sure wherever i go whatever i am whatever i do i will be the grateful pamela vi no sad regrets my heart annoy i will pray for all your peace and joy from master high to scullion boy for all your loves to pamela vii one thing or two i have more to say gods holy will be sure obey and for our master always pray as ever shall poor pamela viii for oh we pity should the great instead of envying their estate temptations always on em wait exempt from which are such as we ix their riches often are a snare at best a pampered weighty care their servants far more happy are at least so thinks pamela x your parents and relations love let them your duty ever prove and you will be blessed from above as will i hope poor pamela xi for if ashamed i should be of my dear parents low degree i am sure it would been worse for me god had not blessed pamela xii thrice happy may you ever be each one in his and her degree and sirs whenever you think of me pray for content to pamela xiii yes pray for my content and peace for rest assured i will never cease to pray for all your joys increase while life is lent to pamela xiv on god all future good depends him let us serve my sonnet ends with thankye thankye honest friends for all your loves to pamela here it is necessary to observe that the fair pamelas trials were not yet over but the worst of all were to come at a time when she thought them at an end and that she was returning to her father for when her master found her virtue was not to be subdued and he had in vain tried to conquer his passion for her being a gentleman of pleasure and intrigue he had ordered his lincolnshire coachman to bring his traveling chariot from thence not caring to trust his body coachman who with the rest of the servants so greatly loved and honored the fair damsel and having given him instructions accordingly and prohibited his other servants on pretense of resenting pamelas behavior from accompanying her any part of the way he drove her five miles on the way to her fathers and then turning off crossed the country and carried her onward toward his lincolnshire estate  it is also to be observed that the messenger of her letters to her father who so often pretended business that way was an implement in his masters hands and employed by him for that purpose and who always gave her letters first to him and his master used to open and read them and then send them on by which means as he hints to her as she observes in one of her letters p  0  he was no stranger to what she wrote thus every way was the poor virgin beset and the whole will show the base arts of designing men to gain their wicked ends and how much it behooves the fair sex to stand upon their guard against their artful contrivances especially when riches and power conspire against innocence and a low estate  a few words more will be necessary to make the sequel better understood the intriguing gentleman thought fit however to keep back from her father her three last letters in which she mentions his concealing himself to hear her partitioning out her clothes his last effort to induce her to stay a fortnight his pretended proposal of the chaplain and her hopes of speedily seeing them as also her verses and to send himself a letter to her father which is as follows goodman andrews you will wonder to receive a letter from me but i think i am obliged to let you know that i have discovered the strange correspondence carried on between you and your daughter so injurious to my honor and reputation and which i think you should not have encouraged till you knew there were sufficient grounds for these aspersions which she so plentifuly casts upon me something possibly there might be in what she has written from time to time but believe me with all her pretended simplicity and innocence i never knew so much romantic invention as she is mistress of in short the girls heads turned by romances and such idle stuff to which she has given herself up ever since her kind ladys death and she assumes such airs as if she was a mirror of perfection and believed every body had a design upon her  dont mistake me however i believe her very honest and very virtuous but i have found out also that she is carrying on a sort of correspondence or love affair with a young clergyman that i hope in time to provide for but who at present is destitute of any subsistence but my favor and what would be the consequence can you think of two young folks who have nothing in the world to trust to of their own to come together with a family multiplying upon them before they have bread to eat  for my part i have too much kindness to them both not to endeavor to prevent it if i can and for this reason i have sent her out of his way for a little while till i can bring them to better consideration and i would not therefore have you be surprised you dont see your daughter so soon as you might possibly expect  yet i do assure you upon my honor that she shall be safe and inviolate and i hope you dont doubt me notwithstanding any airs she may have given herself upon my jocular pleasantry to her and perhaps a little innocent romping with her so usual with young folks of the two sexes when they have been long acquainted and grown up together for pride is not my talent  as she is a mighty letterwriter i hope she has had the duty to apprize you of her intrigue with the young clergyman and i know not whether it meets with your countenance but now she is absent for a little while for i know he would have followed her to your village if she had gone home and there perhaps they would have ruined one another by marrying i doubt not i shall bring him to see his interest and that he engages not before he knows how to provide for a wife and when that can be done let them come together in gods name for me  i expect not to be answered on this head but by your good opinion and the confidence you may repose in my honor being  your hearty friend to serve you  p s i find my man john has been the manager of the correspondence in which such liberties have been taken with me i shall soon let the saucy fellow know how much i resent his part of the affair in a manner that becomes me it is a hard thing that a man of my character in the world should be used thus freely by his own servants       it is easy to guess at the poor old mans concern upon reading this letter from a gentleman of so much consideration he knew not what course to take and had no manner of doubt of his poor daughters innocence and that foul play was designed her yet he sometimes hoped the best and was ready to believe the surmised correspondence between the clergyman and her having not received the letters she wrote which would have cleared up that affair  but after all he resolved as well to quiet his own as his wifes uneasiness to undertake a journey to the squires and leaving his poor wife to excuse him to the farmer who employed him he set out that very evening late as it was and traveling all night found himself soon after daylight at the gate of the gentleman before the family was up and there he sat down to rest himself till he should see somebody stirring  the grooms were the first he saw coming out to water their horses and he asked in so distressful a manner what was become of pamela that they thought him crasy and said why what have you to do with pamela old fellow get out of the horses way  where is your master said the poor man pray gentlemen dont be angry my hearts almost broke  he never gives any thing at the door i assure you says one of the grooms so you will lose your labor  i am not a beggar yet said the poor old man i want nothing of him but my pamela  o my child my child  i will be hanged says one of them if this is not mrs pamelas father  indeed indeed said he wringing his hands i am and weeping where is my child where is my pamela  why father said one of them we beg your pardon but she is gone home to you how long have you been come from home  o but last night said he i have traveled all night is the squire at home or is he not  yes but he is not stirring though said the grooms as yet thank god for that said he thank god for that then i hope i may be permitted to speak to him anon they asked him to go in and he stepped into the stable and sat down on the stairs there wiping his eyes and sighing so sadly that it grieved the servants to hear him  the family was soon raised with the report of pamelas father coming to inquire after his daughter and the maids would fain have had him go into the kitchen but mrs jervis having been told of his coming arose and hastened down to her parlour and took him in with her and there heard all his sad story and read the letter she wept bitterly but yet endeavored before him to hide her concern and said well goodman andrews i cannot help weeping at your grief but i hope there is no occasion let nobody see this letter whatever you do i dare say your daughters safe  well but said he i see you madam know nothing about her  if all was right so good a gentlewoman as you are would not have been a stranger to this to be sure you thought she was with me  said she my master does not always inform his servants of his proceedings but you need not doubt his honor you have his hand for it and you may see he can have no design upon her because he is not from hence and does not talk of going hence o that is all i have to hope for said he that is all indeed  but said he  and was going on when the report of his coming had reached the squire who came down in his morninggown and slippers into the parlour where he and mrs jervis were  what is the matter goodman andrews said he what is the matter o my child said the good old man give me my child i beseech you sir  why i thought says the squire that i had satisfied you about her sure you have not a letter i sent you written with my own hand yes yes but i have sir said he and that brought me hither and i have walked all night poor man returned he with great seeming compassion i am sorry for it truly why your daughter has made a strange racket in my family and if i thought it would have disturbed you so much i would have even let her gone home but what i did was to serve her and you too she is very safe i do assure you goodman andrews and you may take my honor for it i would not injure her for the world do you think i would mrs jervis no i hope not sir said she  hope not said the poor man so do i but pray sir give me my child that is all i desire and i will take care no clergyman shall come near her  why london is a great way off said the squire and i cannot send for her back presently what then said he have you sent my poor pamela to london i would not have it said so says the squire but i assure you upon my honor she is quite safe and satisfied and will quickly inform you of as much by letter i am sure she is in a reputable family no less than a bishops and will wait on his lady till i get this matter over that i mentioned to you  o how shall i know this replied he  what said the squire pretending anger am i to be doubted  do you believe i can have any view upon your daughter and if i had do you think i would take such methods as these to effect it why man you know not whom you talk to  o sir said he i beg your pardon but consider my dear child is in the case let me know what bishop and where and i will travel to london barefoot to see my daughter and then shall be satisfied  why goodman andrews i think thou have read romances as well as thy daughter and thy heads turned with them may i not have my word taken do you think once more i would offer any thing to your daughter is there any thing looks like it  prythee man consider a little who i am and if i am not to be believed what signifies talking why sir said he pray forgive me but there is no harm to say what bishops or whereabouts what and so you would go troubling his lordship with your impertinent fears and stories will you be satisfied if you have a letter from her within a week it may be less if she be not negligent to assure you all is well with her why that said the poor man will be a comfort well then said the gentleman i cannot answer for her negligence if she dont but she will send a letter to you mrs jervis for i desire not to see it i have had trouble enough about her already and be sure you send it by a man and horse the moment you receive it to be sure i will said she thank your honor said the good man and then i must wait with as much patience as i can for a week which will be a year to me  i tell you said the gentleman it must be her own fault if she dont for it is what i insisted upon for my own reputation and i shall not stir from this house i assure you till she is heard from and that to satisfaction god bless your honor said the poor man as you say and mean truth amen amen goodman andrews said he you see i am not afraid to say amen so mrs jervis make the good man as welcome as you can and let me have no uproar about the matter  he then whispering her bid her give him a couple of guineas to bear his charges home telling him he should be welcome to stay there till the letter came if he would and he should be a witness that he intended honorably and not to stir from his house for one while  the poor old man staid and dined with mrs jervis with some tolerable ease of mind in hopes to hear from his beloved daughter in a few days and then accepting the present returned for his own house and resolved to be as patient as possible for a few days  mean time mrs jervis and all the family were in the utmost grief for the trick put upon the poor pamela and she and the steward represented it to their master in as moving terms as they durst but were forced to rest satisfied with his general assurances of intending her no harm which however mrs jervis little believed from the pretense he had made in his letter of the correspondence between pamela and the young parson which she knew to be all invention though she durst not say so  but the week after she went away they were made a little more easy by the following letter brought by an unknown hand and left for mrs jervis which how procured will be shown in the sequel   dear mrs jervis i have been vilely tricked and instead of being driven by robin to my dear fathers i am carried off to where i have no liberty to tell however i am at present not used hardly in the main and i write to beg of you to let my dear father and mother whose hearts must be wellnigh broken know that i am well and that i am and by the grace of god ever will be their dutiful and honest daughter as well as   your obliged friend pamela andrews  i must neither send date nor place but have most solemn assurances of honorable usage this is the only time my low estate has been troublesome to me since it has subjected me to the frights i have undergone love to your good self and all my dear fellow servants adieu adieu but pray for poor pamela     this though it quieted not entirely their apprehensions was shown to the whole family and to the gentleman himself who pretended not to know how it came and mrs jervis sent it away to the good old folks who at first suspected it was forged and not their daughters hand but finding the contrary they were a little easier to hear she was alive and well and having inquired of all their acquaintance what could be done and no one being able to put them in a way how to proceed with effect on so extraordinary an occasion against so rich and daring a gentleman and being afraid to make matters worse though they saw plainly enough that by this letter she was in no bishops family and so mistrusted all the rest of his story they applied themselves to prayers for their poor daughter and for a happy issue to an affair that almost distracted them  we shall now leave the honest old pair praying for their dear pamela and return to the account she herself gives of all this having written it journalwise to amuse and employ her time in hopes some opportunity might offer to send is to her friends and as was her constant view that she might afterward thankfully look back upon the dangers she had escaped when they should be happily overblown as in time she hoped they would be and that then she might examine and either approve of or repent for her own conduct in them  letter xxxi o my dearest father and mother let me write and bewail my miserable hard fate though i have no hope that what i write will be conveyed to your hands  i have now nothing to do but write and weep and fearand pray but yet what can i hope for when i seem to be devoted as a victim to the will of a wicked violator of all the laws of god and man  but gracious heaven forgive me my rashness and despondency o let me not sin against thee for thou best know what is fittest for thy poor handmaid  and as thou suffer not thy poor creatures to be tempted above what they can bear i will resign to thy good pleasure and still i hope desperate as my condition seems that as those trials are not of my own seeking nor the effects of ray presumption and vanity i shall be enabled to overcome them and in gods own good time be delivered from them  thus do i pray imperfectly as i am forced by my distracting fears and apprehensions and o join with me my dear parents  but alas how can you know how can i reveal to you the dreadful situation of your poor daughter the unhappy pamela may be undone which god forbid and sooner deprive me of life i before you can know my hard lot  o the unparalled wickedness stratagems and devices of those who call themselves gentlemen and pervert the design of providence in giving them ample means to do good to their own perdition and to the ruin of poor oppressed innocence  but let me tell you what has befallen me and yet how shall you receive it for i have now no honest john to carry my letters to you but am likely to be watched in all my steps till my hard fate ripens his wicked projects for my ruin i will every day now write my sad state and some way perhaps may be opened to send the melancholy scribble to you but if you know it what will it do but aggravate your troubles for o what can the abject poor do against the mighty rich when they are determined to oppress  well but i will proceed to write what i had hoped to tell you in a few hours that i believed i should receive your grateful blessings on my return to you from so many hardships  i will begin here with my account from the last letter i wrote you in which i enclosed my poor stuff of verses and continue it at times as i have opportunity though as i said i know not how it can reach you now  the long hopdfor thursday morning came that i was to set out i had taken my leave of my fellow servants overnight and a mournful leave it was to us all for men as well as womenservants wept much to part with me and for my part i was overwhelmed with tears and the affecting instances of their esteem they all would have made me little presents as tokens of their love but i would not take any thing from the lower servants to be sure but mr longman made me a present of several yards of holland and a silver snuff box and a gold ring which he desired me to keep for his sake and he wept over me but said i am sure so good a maiden god will bless and though you return to your poor father again and his low estate yet providence will find you out and one day though i may not live to see it you will be rewarded  i said o dear mr longman you make me too rich and too mody and yet i must be a beggar before my time for i shall want often to be scribbling little thinking it would be my only employment so soon and i will beg you sir to favor me with some paper and as soon as i get home i will write you a letter to thank you for all your kindness to me and a letter to good mrs jervis too  this was lucky for i should have had none else but at pleasure of my roughnaturd governess as i may call her but now i can write to ease my mind though i cannot send it to you and write what i please for she knows not how well i am provided for good mr longman gave me above forty sheets of paper and a dozen pens and a little phial of ink which last i wrapped in paper and put in my pocket and some wax and wafers  o dear sir said i you have set me up how shall i requite you he said by a kiss my fair mistress and i gave it very willingly for he is a good old man  rachel and hannah cried sadly when i took my leave and jane who sometimes used to be a little crossish and cicely too wept sadly and said they would pray for me but poor jane i doubt seldom says her prayers for herself mores the pity  then arthur the gardener our robin the coachman and lincolnshire robin too who was to carry me were very civil and both had tears in their eyes which i thought then very goodnatured in lincolnshire robin because he knew but little of me  but since i find he might well be concerned for he had then his instructions it seems and knew how he was to be a means to entrap me  then our other three footmen harry isaac and benjamin and grooms and helpers were very much affected likewise and the poor little scullionboy tommy was ready to run over for grief  they had got all together overnight expecting to be differently employed in the morning and they all begged to shake hands with me and i kissed the maidens and prayed to god to bless them all and thanked them for all their love and kindnesses to me and indeed i was forced to leave them sooner than i would because i could not stand it indeed i could not harry i could not have thought it for he is a little wildish they say cried till he sobbd again john poor honed john was not then come back from you but as for the butler mr jonathan he could not stay in company  i thought to have told you a deal about this but i have worse things to employ my thoughts  mrs jervis good mrs jervis cried all night long and i comforted her all i could and she made me promise that if my master went to london to attend parliament or to lincolnshire i would come and stay a week with her and she would have given me money but i would not take it  well next morning came and i wondered i saw nothing of poor honest john for i waited to take leave of him and thank him for all his civilities to me and to you but i suppose he was sent further by my master and so could not return and i desired to be remembered to him  and when mrs jervis told me with a sad heart the chariot was ready with four horses to it i was just upon sinking into the ground though i wanted to be with you  my master was above stairs and never asked to see me i was glad of it in the main but he knew false heart as he is that i was not to be out of his reach  o preserve me heaven from his power and from his wickedness  well they were not suffered to go with me one step as i writ to you before for he stood at the window to see me go and in the passage to the gate out of his sight there they stood all of them in two rows and we could say nothing on both sides but god bless you and god bless you but harry carried my own bundle my third bundle as i was used to call it to the coach and some plumcakes and dietbread made for me overnight and some sweatmeats and six bottles of canary wine which mrs jervis would make me take in a basket to cheer our hearts nowandthen when we got together as she said and i kissed all the maids again and shook hands with the men again but mr jonathan and mr longman were not there and then i tript down steps to the chariot mrs jervis crying most sadly  i looked up when i got to the chariot and i saw my master at the window in his gown and i curtsyd three times to him very low and prayed for him with my hands lifted up for i could not speak indeed i was not able and he bowed his head to me which made me then very glad he would take such notice of me and in i stepped and was ready to burst with grief and could only till robin began to drive wave my white handkerchief to them wet with my tears and at last away he drove jehulike as they say out of the courtyard and i too soon found i had cause for greater and deeper grief  well said i to myself at this rate i shall soon be with my dear father and mother and till i had got as i supposed halfway i thought of the good friends i had left and when on stopping for a little bait to the horses robin told me i was near halfway i thought it was high time to wipe my eyes and think to whom i was going as then alack for me i thought so i began to ponder what a meeting i should have with you how glad you would both be to see me come safe and innocent to you after all my dangers and so i began to comfort myself and to banish the other gloomy side from my mind though too it returned nowandthen for i should be ungrateful not to love them for their love  well i believe i set out about eight oclock in the morning and i wondered and wondered when it was about two as i saw by a churchdial in a little village we passed through that i was still more and more out of my knowledge heyday thought i to drive this strange pace and to be so long agoing little more than twenty miles is very odd but to be sure thought i robin knows the way  at last he stopped and looked about him as if he was at a loss for the way and i said mr robert sure you are out of the way  i am afraid i am said he but it cannot be much i will ask the first person i see pray do said i and he gave his horses a mouthful of hay and i gave him some cake and two glasses of canary wine and stopped about half an hour in all then he drove on very fast again  i had so much to think of of the dangers i now doubted not i had escaped of the loving friends i had left and my best friends i was going to and the many things i had to relate to you that i the less thought of the way till i was startled out of my meditations by the sun beginning to set and still the man driving on and his horses sweating and foaming and then i began to be alarmed all at once and called to him and he said he had horrid ill luck for he had come several miles out of the way but was now right and should get in still before it was quite dark my heart began then to misgive me a little and i was very much fatigued for i had no sleep for several nights before to signify and at last i said pray mr robert there is a town before us what do you call it  if we are so much out of the way we had better put up there for the night comes on apace and lord protect me thought i i shall have new dangers mayhap to encounter with the man who have escaped the master  little thinking of the base contrivance of the latter says he i am just there it is but a mile on one side of the town before us  nay said i i may be mistaken for it is a good while since i was this way but i am sure the face of the country here is nothing like what i remember it  he pretended to be much out of humor with himself for mistaking the way and at last stopped at a farmhouse about two miles beyond the village i had seen and it was then almost dark and he alighted and said we must make shift here for i am quite out  lord thought i be good to the poor pamela more trials still  what will befall me next  the farmers wife and maid and daughter came out and the wife said what brings you this way at this time of night mr robert and with a lady too  then i began to be frightened out of my wits and laying middle and both ends together i fell a crying and said god give me patience i am undone for certain i  pray mistress said i do you know esquire b of bedfordshire  the wicked coachman would have prevented the answering me but the simple daughter said know his worship yes surely why he is my fathers landlord  well said i then i am undone undone for ever  o wicked wretch what have i done to you said i to the coachman to serve me thus  vile tool of a wicked master  faith said the fellow i am sorry this task was put upon me but i could not help it but make the best of it now here are very civil reputable folks and you will be safe here i will assure you  let me get out said i and i will walk back to the town we came through late as it is  for i will not enter here  said the farmers wife you will be very well used here i will assure you young gentlewoman and have better conveniences than anywhere in the village i matter not conveniences said i i am betrayed and undone as you have a daughter of your own pity me and let me know if your landlord as you call him be here  no i will assure you he is not said she  and then came the farmer a goodlike sort of man grave and wellbehavd and he spoke to me in such sort as made me a little pacified and seeing no help for it i went in and the wife immediately conducted me up stairs to the best apartment and told me that was mine as long as i staid and nobody should come near me but when i called i threw myself on the bed in the room tired and frightened to death almost and gave way to the most excessive fit of grief that i ever had  the daughter came up and said mr robert had given her a letter to give me and there it was i raised myself and saw it was the hand and seal of the wicked wretch my master directed to mrs pamela andrews  this was a little better than to have him here though if he had he must have been brought through the air for i thought i was  the good woman for i began to see things about a little reputable and no guile appearing in them but rather a face of grief for my grief offered me a glass of some cordial water which i accepted for i was ready to sink and then i sat up in a chair a little though very faintish and they brought me two candles and lighted a brushwood fire and said if i called i should be waited upon instantly and so left me to ruminate on my sad condition and to read my letter which i was not able to do presently after i had a little come to myself i found it to contain these words  dear pamela the passion i have for you and your obstinacy have constrained me to act by you in a manner that i know will occasion you great trouble and fatigue both of mind and body yet forgive me my dear girl for though i have taken this step i will by all that is good and holy use you honorably suffer not your fears to transport you to a behavior that will be disreputable to us both for the place where you will receive this is a farm that belongs to me and the people civil honest and obliging  you will by this time be far on your way to the place i have allotted for your abode for a few weeks till i have managed some affairs that will make me show myself to you in a much different light than you may possibly apprehend from this rash action and to convince you that i mean you no harm i do assure you that the house you are going to shall be so much at your command that even i myself will not approach it without leave from you so make yourself easy be discreet and prudent and a happier turn shall reward these your troubles than you may at present apprehend  mean time i pity the fatigue you will have if this comes to your hand in the place i have directed and will write to your father to satisfy him that nothing but what is honorable shall be offered to you by  your passionate admirer so i must style myself  dont think hardly of poor robin you have so possessed all my servants in your favor that i find they had rather serve you than me and it is reluctantly the fellow undertook this task and i was forced to submit to assure him of my honorable intentions to you which i am fully resolved to make good if you compel me not to a conduct abhorrent to me at present       i but too well apprehended that this letter was only to pacify me for the present but as my danger was not so immediate as i had reason to dread and he had promised to forbear coming to me and to write to you my dear parents to quiet your concern i was a little more easy than i was before and i made shift to eat a little bit of boiled chicken they had got for me and drank a glass of my sack and made each of them do so too  but after i had so done i was again a little flusterd for in came the coachman with the look of a hangman i thought and madamd me up strangely telling me he would beg me to get ready to pursue my journey by five in the morning or else he should be late in i was quite grieved at this for i began not to dislike my company considering how things stood and was in hopes to get a party among them and so to put myself into any worthy protection in the neighborhood rather than go forward  when he withdrew i began to tamper with the farmer and his wife but alas they had had a letter delivered them at the same time i had so securely had lucifer put it into his head to do his work and they only shook their heads and seemed to pity me and so i was forced to give over that hope  however the good farmer showed me his letter which i copied as follows for it discovers the deep arts of this wicked master and how resolved he seems to be on my ruin by the pains he took to deprive me of all hopes of freeing myself from his power   farmer norton i send to your house for one night only a young gentlewoman much against her will who has deeply embarked in a love affair which will be her ruin as well as the persons to whom she wants to betroth herself i have to oblige her father ordered her to be carried to one of my houses where she will be well used to try if by absence and expostulation with both they can be brought to know their own interest and i am sure you will use her kindly for my sake for excepting this matter which she will not own she does not want prudence and discretion i will acknowledge any trouble you shall be at in this matter the first opportunity and am  your friend and servant   he had said too cunningly for me that i would not own this pretended love affair so that he had provided them not to believe me say what i would and as they were his tenants who all love him for he has some good qualities and so he had need i saw all my plot cut out and so was forced to say the less  i wept bitterly however for i found he was too hard for me as well in his contrivances as riches and so had recourse again to my only refuge that god who takes the innocent heart into his protection and is alone able to baffle and confound the devices of the mighty nay the farmer was so prepossessed with the contents of his letter to him that he began to praise his care and concern for me and to advise me against entertaining addresses without my friends advice and consent and made me the subject of a lesson for his daughters improvement so i was glad to shut up this discourse for i saw i was not likely to be believed  i sent however to tell my driver that i was so fatigued i could not set out so soon the next morning but he insisted upon it and said it would make my days journey the lighter and i found he was a more faithful servant to his master notwithstanding what he wrote of his reluctance than i could have wished so i saw still more and more that all was deep dissimulation and contrivance worse and worse  indeed i might have shown them his letter to me as a full confutation of his to them but i saw no probability of engaging them in my behalf and so thought it signified little as i was to go away so soon to enter more particularly into the matter with them and besides i saw they were not inclinable to let me stay longer for fear of disobliging him so i went to bed but had very little rest and they would make their servantmaid bear me company in the chariot five miles early in the morning and she was to walk back  i had contrived in my thoughts when i was on my way in the chariot on friday morning that when we came into some town to bait as he must do for the horses sake i would at the inn apply myself if i saw i any way could to the mistress of the inn and tell her the case and refuse to go farther having nobody but this wicked coachman to contend with  well i was very full of this project and was in great hopes somehow or other to extricare myself this way but oh the artful wretch had provided for even this last resource of mine for when we came to put up at a large town on the way to eat a morsel for dinner and i was fully resolved to execure my project who should be at the inn that he put up at but the wicked mrs jewkes expecting me and her sisterinlaw was the mistress of it and she had provided a little entertainment for me  and this i found when i desired as soon as i came in to speak with the mistress of the house she came to me and i said i am a poor unhappy young body that want your advice and assistance and you seem to be a good sort of gentlewoman that would assist an oppressed innocent person yes madam said she i hope you guess right and i have the happiness to know something of the matter before you speak pray call my sister jewkes  jewkes jewkes thought i i have heard of that name i dont like it  then the wicked creature appeared whom i had never seen but once before and i was terrified out of my wits no stratagem thought i not one for a poor innocent girl but every thing to turn out against me that is hard indeed  so i began to pull in my horns as they say for i saw i was now worse off than at the farmers  the naughty woman came up to me with an air of confidence and kissed me see sister said she here is a charming creature would she not tempt the best lord in the land to run away with her o frightfull thought i here is an avowal of the matter at once i am now gone that is certain and so was quite silent and confounded and seeing no help for it for she would not part with me out of her sight i was forced to set out with her in the chariot for she came thither on horseback with a manservant who rode by us the rest of the way with her horse and now i gave over all thoughts of redemption and was in a desponding condition indeed  well thought i here are strange pains taken to ruin a poor innocent helpless and even worthless young body this plot is laid too deep and has been too long a hatching to be baffled i fear but then i put my trust in god who i knew was able to do every thing for me when all other possible means should fail and in him i was resolved to confide  you may see  yet oh that kills me for i know not whether ever you may see what i now write or no  else you may see what sort of woman this mrs jewkes is compared to good mrs jervis by this   every nowandthen she would be staring in my face in the chariot and squeezing my hand and saying why you are very pretty my silent dear and once she offered to kiss me but i said i dont like this sort of carriage mrs jewkes it is not like two persons of one sex she fell a laughing very confidently and said that is prettily said i vow then thou had rather be kissed by the other sex ifackins i commend thee for that  i was sadly tiezd with her impertinence and bold way but no wonder she was an innkeepers housekeeper before she came to my master and those sort of creatures dont want confidence you know and indeed she made nothing to talk boldly on twenty occasions and said two or three times when she saw the tears every nowandthen as we rid trickle down my checks i was sorely hurt truly to have the handsomest and finest young gentleman in five counties in love with me  so i find i am got into the hands of a wicked procuress and if i was not safe with good mrs jervis and where every body loved me what a dreadful prospect have i now before me in the hands of a woman that seems to delight in filthiness  o dear sirs what shall i do what shall i do  surely i shall never be equal to all these things  about eight at night we entered the courtyard of this handsome large old and lonely mansion that looks made for solitude and mischief as i thought by its appearance with all its brown nodding horrors of lofty elms and pines about it and here said i to myself i fear is to be the scene of my ruin unless god protect me who is allsufficient  i was very sick at entering it partly from fatigue and partly from dejection of spirits and mrs jewkes got me some mulld wine and seemed mighty officious to welcome me thither and while she was absent ordering the wine the wicked robin came in to me and said i beg a thousand pardons for my part in this affair since i see your grief and your distress and i do assure you that i am sorry it fell to my task  mighty well mr robert said i i never saw an execution but once and then the hangman asked the poor creatures pardon and wiped his mouth as you do and pleaded his duty and then calmly tucked up the criminal but i am no criminal as you all know and if i could have thought it my duty to obey a wicked master in his unlawful commands i had saved you all the merit of this vile service  i am sorry said he you take it so but every body dont think alike well said i you have done your part mr robert toward my ruin very faithfully and will have cause to be sorry maybe at the longrun when you shall see the mischief that comes of it  your eyes were open and you knew i was to be carried to my fathers and that i was barbarously tricked and betrayed and i can only once more thank you for your part of it god forgive you  so he went away a little sad what have you said to robin madam said mrs jewkes who came in as he went out the poor fellows ready to cry i need not be afraid of your following his example mrs jewkes said i i have been telling him that he has done his part to my ruin and he now cannot help it so his repentance does me no good i wish it may him  i will assure you madam said she i should be as ready to cry as he if i should do you any harm it is not in his power to help it now said i but your part is to come and you may choose whether you will contribute to my ruin or not  why look ye look ye madam said she i have a great notion of doing my duty to my master and therefore you may depend upon it if i can do that and serve you i will but you must think if your desire and his will come to clash once i shall do as he bids me let it be what it will  pray mrs jewkes said i dont madam me so i am but a silly poor girl set up by the gambol of fortune for a may game and now am to be something and now nothing just as that thinks fit to sport with me and let you and me talk upon a foot together for i am a servant inferior to you and so much the more as i am turned out of place  ay ay says she i understand something of the matter you have so great power over my master that you may be soon mistress of us all and so i would oblige you if i could and i must and will call you madam for i am instructed to show you all respect i will assure you  who instructed you to do so said i who my master to be sure said she why said i how can that be you have not seen him lately no that is true said she but i have been expecting you here some time o the deeplaid wickedness thought i and besides i have a letter of instructions by robin but maybe i should not have said so much if you would show them to me said i i should be able to judge how far i could or could not expect favor from you consistent with your duty to our master i beg your pardon fair mistress for that said she i am sufficiently instructed and you may depend upon it i will observe my orders and so far as they will let me so far will i oblige you and there is an end of it  well said i you will not i hope do an unlawful or wicked thing for any master in the world lookye said she he is my master and if he bids me do a thing that i can do i think i ought to do it and let him who has power to command me look to the lawfulness of it why said i suppose he should bid you cut my throat would you do it there is no danger of that said she but to be sure i would not for then i should be hanged for that would be murder well said i and suppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young creature and ruin her would you assist him in that for to rob a person of her virtue is worse than cutting her throat  why now says she how strangely you talk are not the two sexes made for one another and is it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty woman and suppose he can obtain his desires is that so bad as cutting her throat and then the wretch fell a laughing and talked most impertinently and showed me that i had nothing to expect from her virtue or conscience and this gave me great mortification for i was in hopes of working upon her by degrees  so we ended our discourse here and i bid her show me where i must lie  why said she lie where you list madam i can tell you i must lie with you for the present for the present said i and torture then wrung my heart  but is it in your instructions that you must lie with me yes indeed said she i am sorry for it said i why said she i am wholesome and cleanly too i will assure you yes said i i dont doubt that but i love to lie by myself how so said she was not mrs jervis your bedfellow at the other house  well said i quite sick of her and my condition you must do as you are instructed i think i cannot help myself and am a most miserable creature she repeated her insufferable nonsense mighty miserable indeed to be so well beloved by one of the finest gentlemen in england  i am now come down in my writing to this present saturday and a deal i have written my wicked bedfellow has very punctual orders it seems for she locks me and herself in and ties the two keys for there is a double door to the room about her wrist when she goes to bed she talks of the house having been attempted to be broken open two or three times whether to fright me i cannot tell but it makes me fearful though not so much as i should be if i had not other and greater fears  i slept but little last night and got up and pretended to sit by the window which looks into the spacious gardens but i was writing all the time from break of day to her getting up and after when she was absent  at breakfast she presented the two maids to me the cook and housemaid poor awkward souls that i can see no hopes of they seem so devoted to her and ignorance yet i am resolved if possible to find some way to escape before this wicked master comes  there are besides of servants the coachman robert a groom a helper a footman all but robert and he is accessory to my ruin strange creatures that promise nothing and all likewise devoted to this woman the gardener looks like a good honest man but he is kept at a distance and seems reserved  i wondered i saw not mr williams the clergyman but would not ask after him apprehending it might give her some jealousy but when i had beheld the rest he was the only one i had hopes of for i thought his cloth would set him above assisting in my ruin  but in the afternoon he came for it seems he has a little latin school in the neighboring village which he attends and this brings him in a little matter additional to my masters favor till something better falls of which he has hopes  he is a sensible sober young gentleman and when i saw him i confirmed myself in my hopes of him for he seemed to take great notice of my distress and grief for i could not hide it though he appeared fearful of mrs jewkes who watched all our motions and words  he has an apartment in the house but is mostly at a lodging in the town for convenience of his little school only on saturday afternoons and sundays and he preaches sometimes for the parson of the village which is about three miles off  i hope to go to church with him tomorrow sure it is not in her instructions to deny me he cannot have thought of every thing and something may strike out for me there  i have asked her for a feint because she shall not think i am so well provided to indulge me with pen and ink though i have been using my own so freely when her absence would let me for i begged to be left to myself as much as possible she says she will let me have it but then i must promise not to send any writing out of the house without her seeing it i said it was only to divert my grief when i was by myself as i desired to be for i loved writeing but i had nobody to send to she knew well enough  no not at present maybe said she but i am told you are a great writer and it is in my instructions to see all you write so look you here said she i will let you have a pen and ink and two sheets of paper for this employment will keep you out of worse thoughts but i must see them always when i ask written or not written that is very hard said i but may i not have to myself the closet in the room where we lie with the key to lock up my things i believe i may consent to that said she and i will set it in order for you and leave the key in the door and there is a spinnet too said she if it be in tune you may play to divert you nowandthen for i know my old lady learnt you  so i resolved to hide a pen of my own here and another there for fear i should come to be denied and a little of my ink in a broken chinacup and a little in another cup and a sheet of paper hereandthere among my linen with a little wax and a few wafers in several places lest i should be searched and something i thought might happen to open a way for my deliverance by these or some other means o the pride thought i i shall have if i can secure my innocence and escape the artful wiles of this wicked master for if he comes hither i am undone to be sure for this naughty woman will assist him rather than fail in the worst of his attempts and he will have no occasion to send her out of the way as he would have done mrs jervis once so i must set all my little wits at work  it is a grief to me to write and not to be able to send to you what i write but now it is all the diversion i have and if god will favor my escape with my innocence as i trust he graciously will for all these black prospects with what pleasure shall i read them afterward  i was going to say pray for your dutiful daughter as i used but alas you cannot know my distress though i am sure i have your prayers and i will write on as things happen that if a way should open my scribble may be ready to send for what i do must be at a jirk to be sure  o how i want such an obliging honesthearted man as john  i am now come to sunday well here is a sad thing i am denied by this barbarous woman to go to church as i had built upon i might and she has huffed poor mr williams all topiece for pleading for me i find he is to be forbid the house if she pleases poor gentleman all his dependence is upon my master who has a very good living for him if the incumbent die and he has kept his bed these four months of old age and dropsy  he pays me great respect and i see pities me and would perhaps assist my escape from these dangers but i have nobody to plead for me and why should i wish to ruin a poor gentleman by engaging him against his interest yet one would do any thing to preserve ones innocence and providence would perhaps make it up to him  o judge but how shall you see what i write my distracted condition to be reduced to such a pass as to desire to lay traps for mankind  but he wants sadly to say something to me as he whisperingly hinted  the wretch i think i will always call her the wretch henceforth abuses me more and more i was but talking to one of the maids just now indeed a little to tamper with her by degrees and she popt upon us and said  nay madam dont offer to tempt poor innocent country maidens from doing their duty you wanted i hear she should take a walk with you but i charge you nan never stir with her nor obey her without letting me know it in the smallest trisles  i say walk with you why where would you go i tro why barbarous mrs jewkes said i only to look a little up the elmwalk as you would not let me go to church  nan said she to show me how much they were all in her power pull off madams shoes and bring them to me i have taken care of her others  indeed she shall not said i nay said nan but i must if my mistress bids me so pray madam dont hinder me and so indeed would you believe it she took my shoes off and left me barefoot and for my share i have been so frightened at this that i have not power even to relieve my mind by my tears i am quite stupifyd to be sure  here i was forced to leave off  now i will give you a picture of this wretch she is a broad squat pursy fat thing quite ugly if any thing human can be so called about forty years old she has a huge hand and an arm as thick as my waist i believe her nose is flat and crooked and her brows grow over her eyes a dead spiteful gray goggling eye to be sure she has and her face is flat and broad and as to color looks like as if it had been pickled a month in saltpeter i dare say she drinks  she has a hoarse manlike voice and is as thick as she is long and yet looks so deadly strong that i am afraid she would dash me at her foot in an instant if i was to vex her  so that with a heart more ugly than her face she frightens me sadly and i am undone to be sure if god does not protect me for she is very very wicked  indeed she is  this is but poor helpless spite in me  but the picture is too near the truth notwithstanding she sends me a message just now that i shall have my shoes again if i will accept of her company to walk with me in the garden  to waddle with me rather thought i  well it is not my business to quarrel with her downright i shall be watched the narrower if i do and so i will go with the hated wretch  o for my dear mrs jervis or rather to be safe with my dear father and mother  oh i am out of my wits for joy just as i have got my shoes on i am told john honest john is come on horseback  a blessing on his faithful heart what joy is this but i will tell you more byandby i must not let her know i am so glad to see this dear blessed john to be sure  o but he looks sad as i see him out of the window what can be the matter  i hope my dear parents are well and mrs jervis and mr longman and every body my naughty master not excepted  for i wish him to live and repent of all his wickedness to poor me  o dear heart what a world do we live in  i am now to take up my pen again but i am in a sad taking truly another puzzling trial to be sure  here is john as i said and the poor man came to me with mrs jewkes who whispered that i would say nothing about the shoes for my own sake as she said the poor man saw my distress and my red eyes and my haggard looks i suppose for i have had a sad time of it you must needs think and though he would have hid it if he could yet his eyes ran over oh mrs pamela said he oh mrs pamela  well honest fellow servants said i i cannot help it at present i am obliged to your honesty and kindness to be sure and then he wept more said i for my heart was ready to break to see his grief for it is a touching thing to see a man cry tell me the worst is my master coming no no said he and sobbd  well said i is there any news of my poor father and mother how do they do  i hope well said he i know nothing to the contrary there is no mishap i hope to mrs jervis or mr longman or my fellow servants no  said he poor man with a long n  o as if his heart would burst well thank god then said i  the mans a fool said mrs jewkes i think what ado is here why sure you are in love john do thou not see young madam is well what ails thee man nothing at all said he but i am such a fool as to cry for joy to see good mrs pamela but i have a letter for you  i took it and saw it was from my master so i put it in my pocket mrs jewkes said i you need not i hope see this no no said she i see whom it comes from well enough or else maybe i must desire to see it  and here is one for you mrs jewkes said he but yours said he to me requires an answer which i must carry back early in the morning or tonight if i can  you have no more john said mrs jewkes for mrs pamela have you no said he i have not but every bodys kind love and service ay to us both to be sure said she john said i i will read the letter and pray take care of yourself for you are a good man god bless you and i rejoice to see you and hear from you all but i longed to say more only that nasty mrs jewkes   so i went up and locked myself in my closet and opened the letter and this is a copy of it my dearest pamela i send purposely to you on an affair that concerns you very much and me something but chiefly for your sake i am conscious that i have proceeded by you in such a manner as may justly alarm your fears and give concern to your honest friends and all my pleasure is that i can and will make you amends for all the disturbance i have given you as i promised i sent to your father the day after your departure that he might not be too much concerned for you and assured him of my honor to you and made an excuse such an one as ought to have satisfied him for your not coming to him but this was not sufficient it seems for he poor man came to me next morning and set my family almost in an uproar about you  o my dear girl what trouble has not your obstinacy given me and yourself too i had no way to pacify him but to promise that he should see a letter written from you to mrs jervis to satisfy him you are well  now all my care in this case is for your aged parents lest they should be fatally touched with grief and for you whose duty and affection for them i know to be so strong and laudable for this reason i beg you will write a few lines to them and let me prescribe the form which i have done putting myself as near as i can in your place and expressing your sense with a warmth that i doubt will have too much possessed you  after what is done and which cannot now be helped but which i assure you shall turn out honorably for you i expect not to be refused because i cannot possibly have any view in it but to satisfy your parents which is more your concern than mine and so i must beg you will not alter one tittle of the underneath if you do it will be impossible for me to send it or that it should answer the good end i propose by it  i have promised to you that i will not approach you without your leave if i find you easy and not attempting to dispute or avoid your present lot i will keep to my word though it is a difficulty upon me nor shall the present restraint upon you last long for i will assure you that i am resolved very soon to convince you how ardently i am   yours etc     the letter he prescribed for me was this dear mrs jervis i have instead of being driven by robin to my dear fathers been carried off to where i have no liberty to tell however at present i am not used hardly and i write to beg you to let my dear father and mother whose hearts must be wellnigh broken know that i am well and that i am and by the grace of god ever will be their dutiful and honest daughter as well as  your obliged friend i must neither send date nor place but have most solemn assurances of honorable usage       i knew not what to do on this most strange request and occasion but my heart bled so much for you my dear father who had taken the pains to go yourself and inquire after your poor daughter as well as for my dear mother that i resolved to write and pretty much in the above see p     her alterations are in a different character form that it might be sent to pacify you till i could let you some how or other know the true state of the matter and i wrote this to this strange wicked master himself sir if you knew but the anguish of my mind and how much i suffer by your dreadfully strange usage of me you would surely pity me and consent to my deliverance what have i done that i should be the only mark of your cruelty i can have no hope no desire of living left me because i cannot have the least dependence after what has passed upon your solemn assurances  it is impossible surely they should be consistent with the honorable designs you profess  nothing but your promise of not seeing me here in my deplorable bondage can give me the least ray of hope  dont drive the poor distressed pamela upon a rock i beseech you that may be the destruction both of her body and soul you dont know sir how dreadfully i dare weak as i am of mind and intellect when my virtue is in danger and oh hasten my deliverance that a poor unworthy creature below the notice of so great a man may not be made the sport of a high condition for no reason in the world but because she is not able to defend herself nor has a friend that can right her  i have sir in part to show my obedience to you but indeed i own more to give ease to the minds of my poor distressed parents whose poverty one would think should screen them from violences of this sort as well as their poor daughter followed pretty much the form you have prescribed for me to mrs jervis and the alterations i have made for i could not help a few are of such a nature as though they show my concern a little yet must answer the end you are pleased to say you propose by this letter  for gods sake good sir pity my lowly condition and my present great misery and let me join with all the rest of your servants to bless that goodness which you have extended to every one but the poor afflicted heartbroken  pamela     i thought when i had written this letter and that which he had prescribed it would look like placing a confidence in mrs jewkes to show them to her and i showed her at the same time my masters letter to me for i believed the value he expressed for me would give me credit with one who professed in every thing to serve him right or wrong though i had so little reason i fear to pride myself in it and i was not mistaken for it has seemed to influence her not a little and she is at present mighty obliging and runs over in my praises but is the less to be minded because she praises as much the author of all my miseries and his honorable intentions as she calls them when i see that she is capable of thinking as i fear he does that every thing that makes for his wicked will is honorable though to the ruin of the innocent pray god i may find it otherwise i hope whatever the wicked gentleman may intend that i shall be at least rid of her impertinent bold way of talk when she seems to think by his letter that he means honorably  i am now come to monday the  th day of my bondage and misery i was in hope to have an opportunity to see john and have a little private talk with him before he went away but it could not be the poor mans excessive sorrow made mrs jewkes take it into her head to think he loved me and so she brought up a message to me from him this morning that he was going i desired he might come up to my closet as i called it and she came with him and the honest man as i thought him was as full of concern as before at taking leave and i gave him my two letters the one for mrs jervis enclosed in that for my master but mrs jewkes would see me seal them up for fear of any other  i was surprised at the mans going away to see him drop a bit of paper just at the head of the stairs which i took up without mrs jewkess seeing me but i was a thousand times more surprised when i returned to my closet and opening it read as follows good mrs pamela i am grieved to tell you how much you have been deceived and betrayed and that by such a vile dog as i little did i think it would come to this but i must say if ever there was a rogue in the world it is me i have all along showed your letters to my master he employed me for that purpose and he saw every one before i carried them to your father and mother and then sealed them up and sent me with them i had some business that way but not half so often as i pretended and as soon as i heard how it was with you i was ready to hang myself you may well think i could not stand in your presence o vile vile wretch to bring you to this if you are ruined i am the rogue that caused it all the justice i can do you is to tell you you are in vile hands and i am afraid will be undone in spite of all your sweet innocence and i believe i shall never live after i know it if you can forgive me you are exceeding good but i shall never forgive myself that is certain howsomever it will do you no good to make this known and mayhap i may live to do you service if i can i will i am sure i ought  master kept your last two or three letters and did not send them at all i am the most abandoned wretch of wretches  j arnold you see your undoing has been long hatching pray take care of your sweet self mrs jewkes is a devil but in my masters the other house you have not one false heart but myself out upon me for a villain       my dear father and mother when you come to this place i make no doubt your hair will stand on end as mine does  o the deceitfulness of the heart of man  this john that i took to be the honestest of men that you took for the same that was always praising you to me and me to you and for nothing so much as for our honest hearts this very fellow was all the while a vile hypocrite and a perfidious wretch and helping to carry on my ruin  but he says enough of himself and i can only sit down with this sad reflection that power and riches never want tools to promote their vilest ends and that there is nothing so hard to be known as the heart of man  yet i can but pity the poor wretch since he seems to have some remorse and i believe it best to keep his wickedness secret and if it lies in my way to encourage his penitence for i may possibly make some discoveries by it  one thing i should mention in this place he brought down in a portmanteau all the clothes and things my lady and master had given me and moreover two velvet hoods and a velvet scarf that used to be worn by my lady but i have no comfort in them or any thing else  mrs jewkes had the portmanteau brought into my closer and she showed me what was in it but then locked it up and said she would let me have what i would out of it when i asked but if i had the key it might make me want to go abroad maybe and so the insolent woman put it in her pocket  i gave myself over to sad reflections upon this strange and surprising discovery of johns and wept much for him and for myself too and now i see as he says my ruin has been so long a hatching that i can make no doubt what my masters honorable professions will end in what a heap of names does the poor fellow call himself but what must they deserve who set him to work o what has this wicked master to answer for to be so corrupt himself and to corrupt others who would have been innocent and all to carry on further a more corrupt scene and to ruin a poor creature who never did him harm nor wished him any and who still can pray for his happiness and his repentance  i can but wonder what these gentlemen as they are called can think of themselves for these vile doings john had some inducement for he hoped to please his master who rewarded him and was bountiful to him and the same may be said bad as she is for this same odious mrs jewkes but what inducement has my master for taking so much pains to do the devils work  if he loves me as it is falsely called must he therefore lay traps for me to ruin me and to make me as bad as himself i cannot imagine what good the undoing of such a poor creature as i can procure him  to be sure i am a very worthless body people indeed say i am handsome but if i was so should not a gentleman prefer an honest servant to a guilty harlot  and must he be more earnest to seduce me because i dread of all things to be seduced and would rather lose ray life than my honesty  well these are strange things to me i cannot account for them for my share but sure nobody will say that these fine gentlemen have any tempter but their own wicked wills  this naughty master could run away from me when he thought none but his servants should know his base attempts in that sad closet affair but is it not strange that he should not be afraid of the allseeing eye from which even that black poisonous heart of his and its most secret motions could not be hid  but what avail me these sorrowful reflections he is and will be wicked and i am i fear to be a victim to his lawless attempts if the god in whom i trust and to whom i hourly pray prevent it not  tuesday and wednesday i have been hindered by this wicked womans watching me too close from writing on tuesday and so i will put both these days together i have been a little turn with her for an airing in the chariot and walked several times in the garden but have always her at my heels  mr williams came to see us and look a walk with us once and while her back was just turned encouraged by the hint he had before given me i said sir i see two tiles upon that parsleybed cannot one cover them with mould with a note between them on occasion  a good hint said he let that sunflower by the backdoor of the garden be the place i have a key to that for it is my nearest way to the town  so i was forced to begin o what inventions will necessity be the parent of i hugged myself with the thought and she coming to us he said as if he was continuing the discourse we were in no not extraordinary pleasant what is that what is that said mrs jewkes  only said he the town i am saying is not very pleasant no indeed said she it is not it is a poor town to my thinking are there any gentry in it said i and so we chatted on about the town to deceive her but my deceit intended no hurt to any body  we then talked of the garden how large and pleasant and the like and sat down on the turfted slope of the fine fish pond to see the fishes play upon the surface of the water and she said i should angle if i would  i wish said i you would be so kind to fetch me a rod and baits pretty mistress said she  i know better than that i will assure you at this time  i mean no harm said i indeed let me tell you said she i know no one that has their thoughts more about them than you a body ought to look to it where you are but well angle a little tomorrow mr williams who is much afraid of her turned the discourse to a general subject i saunterd in and left them to talk by themselves but he went away to town and she was soon after me  i had got to my pen and ink and i said i want some paper putting what i was about in my bosom you know i have written two letters and sent them by john o how his name poor guilty fellow grieves me well said she you have some left one sheet did for those two letters yes said i but i used half another for a wrapper you know and see how i have scribbled the other half and so i showed her a parcel of broken scraps of verses which i had tried to recollect and which i had written purposely that she might see and think me usually employed to such idle purposes ay said she so you have well i will give you two sheets more but let me see how you dispose of them either written or blank well thought i i hope still argus to be too hard for thee now argus the poets say had an hundred eyes and was made to watch with them all as she does  she brought me the paper and said now madam let me see you write something i will said i and took the pen and wrote i wish mrs jewkes would be as good to me as i would be to her if i had it in my power  that is pretty now said she well i hope i am but what then why then  wrote i she would do me the favor to let me know what i have done to be made her prisoner and what she thinks is to become of me well and what then said she why then of consequence  scribbled i she would let me see her instructions that i may know far to blame her or acquit her  thus i fooled on to show her my fondness for scribbling for i had no expectation of any good from her that so she might suppose i employed myself as i said to no better purpose at other times for she will have it that i am upon the some plot i am so silent and love so much to be myself  she would have me write on a little further no said i you have not answered me why said she what can you doubt when my master himself assures you of his honor ay said i but lay your hand to your heart mrs jewkes and tell me if you yourself believe him yes said she to be sure i do but said i what do you call honor  why said she what does he call honor think you  ruin shame disgrace said i i fear  pho pho said she if you have any doubt about it he can best explain his own meaning  i will send him word to come to satisfy you if you will  horrid creature said i all in a fright  can thou not stab me to the heart i would rather thou would than say such another word  but i hope there is no thought of his coming  she had the wickedness to say no no he dont intend to come as i know of  but if i was he i would not be long away  what means the woman said i  mean said she turning it off why i mean i would come if i was he and put an end to all your fears  by making you as happy as you wish it is out of his power said i to make me happy great and rich as he is but by leaving me innocent and giving me liberty to go to my dear father and mother  she went away soon after and i ended my letter in hopes to have an opportunity to lay it in the appointed place so i went to her and said i suppose as it is not dark i may take another turn in the garden it is too late said she but if you will go dont stay and nan see and attend madam as she called me  so i went toward the pond the wench following me and dropped purposely my hussy and when i came near the tiles i said mrs ann i have dropped my hussy be so kind as to look for it i had it by the pondside the wench went to look and i slipped the note between the tiles and covered them as quick as i could with the light mould quite unperceived and the maid finding the hussy i took it and saunterd in again and met mrs jewkes coming to see after me what i wrote was this reverend sir the want of opportunity to speak my mind to you i am sure will excuse this boldness in a poor creature that is betrayed hither i have reason to think for the worst purposes you know something to be sure of my story my native poverty which i am not ashamed of my late ladys goodness and my masters designs upon me it is true he promises honor and all that but the honor of the wicked is disgrace and shame to the virtuous and he may think he may keep his promises according to the notions he may allow himself to hold and yet according to mine and every good bodys beside basely ruin me  i am so wretched and illtreated by this mrs jewkes and she is so illprincipled a woman that as i may soon want the opportunity which the happy hint of this day affords to my hopes so i throw myself at once upon your goodness without the least reserve for i cannot be worse than i am should that fail me which i dare say to your power it will not for i see it sir in your looks i hope it from your cloth and i doubt it not from your inclination in a case circumstanced as my unhappy one is for sir in helping me out of my present distress you perform all the acts of religion in one and the highest mercy and charity both to a body and a soul of a poor wretch that believe me sir has at present not so much as in thought swerved from her innocence  is there not some way to be found out for my escape without danger to yourself is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighborhood to whom i may fly only till i can find a way to get to my poor father and mother cannot lady davers be made acquainted with my sad story by your conveying a letter to her my poor parents are so low in the world they can do nothing but break their hearts for me and that i fear will be the end of it  my master promises if i will be easy as he calls it in my present lot he will not come down without my consent alas sir this is nothing for what is the promise of a person who thinks himself at liberty to act as he has done by me if he comes it must be to ruin me and come to be sure he will when he thinks he has silenced the clamours of my friends and lulled me as no doubt he hopes into a fatal security  now therefore sir is all the time i have to work and struggle for the preservation of my honesty if i stay till becomes i am undone you have a key to the back gardendoor i have great hopes from that study good sir and contrive for me i will faithfully keep your secret  yet i should be loath to have you suffer for me  i say no more but commit this to the happy tiles and to the bosom of that earth in which i hope my deliverance will take root and bring forth such fruit as may turn to my inexpressible joy and your eternal reward both here and hereafter as shall ever pray  your oppressed humble servant     thursday this completes a fatal week since my setting out as i hoped to see you my dear father and mother o how different were my hopes then from what they are now yet who knows what these happy tiles may produce  but i must tell you first how i have been beaten by mrs jewkes it is very true  and thus it came about  my impatience was great to walk in the garden to see if any thing had offered answerable to my hopes but this wicked mrs jewkes would not let me go without her and she said she was not at leisure we had a great many words about it for i said it was very hard i could not be trusted to walk by myself in the garden for a little air but must be dogged and watched worse than a thief  she still pleaded her instructions and said she was not to trust me out of her sight and you had better said she be easy and contented i assure you for i have worse orders than you have yet found i remember said she your asking mr williams if there were any gentry in the neighborhood this makes me suspect you want to get away to them to tell your sad dismal story as you call it  my heart was at my mouth for i feared by that hint she had seen my letter under the tiles o how uneasy i was at last she said well since you take so on you may take a turn and i will be with you in a minute  i went out and when i was out of sight of her window i speeded toward the hopeful place but was soon forced to slacken my pace by her odious voice heyday why so nimble and whither so fast said she what are you upon a wager i stopped for her till her pursy sides were waddled up to me and she held by my arm half out of breath so i was forced to pass by the dear place without daring to look at it  the gardener was at work a little further and so we looked upon him and i began to talk about his art but she said softly my instructions are not to let you be so familiar with the servants why said i are you afraid i should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my master maybe i am said the odious wretch for to rob him of yourself would be the worst that could happen to him in his opinion  and pray said i walking on how came i to be his property what right has he in me but such as a thief may plead to stolen goods  why was ever the like heard says she  this is downright rebellion i protest  well well lambkin which the foolish often calls me if i was m his place he should not have his property in you long questionable why what would you do said i if you were he  not stand shilli shalli as he does but put you and himself both out of your pain  why jezebel said i i could not help it would you ruin me by force  upon this she gave me a deadly slap upon my shoulder take that said she whom do you call jezebel  i was so surprised for you never beat me my dear father and mother in your lives that i was as one thunderstruck and looked round as if i wanted somebody to help me but alas i had nobody and said at last rubbing my shoulder is this also in your instructions  alas for me am i to be beaten too and so i fell acrying and threw myself upon the grasswalk we were upon  said she in a great pet i will not be called such names i will assure you marry come up i see you have a spirit you must and shall be kept under i will manage such little provoking things as you i warrant ye come come well go in doors and i will lock you up and you shall have no shoes nor any thing else if this is to be the case  i did not know what to do this was a cruel thing to me and i blamed myself for my free speech for now i had given her some pretense and oh thought i here i have by my malpertness ruined the only project i had left  the gardener saw this scene but she called to him well jacob what do you stare at pray mind what youre upon and away he walked to another quarter out of sight  well thought i i must put on the dissembler a little i see she took my hand roughly come get up said she and come in doors  i will jezebel you i warrant ye  why dear mrs jewkes said i  none of your dears and your coaxing said she why not jezebel again  she was in a fearful passion i saw and i was out of my wits thought i i have often heard women blamed for their tongues i wish mine had been shorter but i cannot go in said i indeed i cannot  why said she cannot you i will warrant i can take such a thin body as you are under my arm and carry you in if you will not walk you dont know my strength  yes but i do said i too well and will you not use me worse when i come in  so i arose and she muttered to herself all the way she to be a jezebel with me that had used me so well and suchlike  when i came near the house i said sitting down upon a settlebench well i will not go in till you say you will forgive me mrs jewkes  if you will forgive my calling you that name i will forgive your beating me  she sat down by me and seemed in a great pucker and said well come i will forgive you for this time and so kissed me as a mark of reconciliation  but pray said i tell me where i am to walk and go and give me what liberty you can and when i know the most you can favor me with you shall see i will be as content as i can and not ask you for more  ay said she this is something like i wish i could give you all the liberty you desire for you must think it is no pleasure to me to tie you to my petticoat as it were and not to let you stir without me  but people that will do their duties must have some trouble and what i do is to serve as good a master to be sure as lives  yes said i to every body but me  he loves you too well to be sure replied she and that is the reason so you ought to bear it i say love said i come said she dont let the wench see you have been crying nor tell her any tales for you will not tell them fairly i am sure and i will send her and you shall take another walk in the garden if you will maybe said she it will get you a stomach to your dinner for you dont eat enough to keep life and soul together you are beauty to the bone added the strange wretch or you could not look so well as you do with so little stomach so little rest and so much pining and whining for nothing at all well thought i say what thou will so i can be rid of thy bad tongue and company and i hoped to find some opportunity now to come at my sunflower but i walked the other way to take that in my return to avoid suspicion  i forced my discourse to the wench but it was all upon general things for i find she is asked after every thing i say and do when i came near the place as i had been devising i said pray step to the gardener and ask him to gather a sallad for me to dinner she called out jacob  said i he cannot hear you so far off and pray tell him i should like a cucumber too if he has one when she had stepped about a bowshot from me i popt down and whipped my fingers under the upper tile and pulled out a letter without direction and thrust it in my bosom trembling for joy she was with me before i could well secure it and i was in such a taking that i feared i should discover myself you seem frighted madam said she why said i with a lucky thought alas your poor daughter will make an intriguer byandby but i hope an innocent one i stooped to smell at the sunflower and a great nasty worm ran into the ground that startled me for i dont love worms said she sunflowers dont smell so i find replied i and so we walked in and mrs jewkes said well you have made haste in  you shall go another time  i went up to my closet locked myself in and opening my letter found in it these words i am infinitely concerned for your distress i most heartily wish it may be in my power to serve and save so much innocence beauty and merit my whole dependence is upon mr b and i have a near view of being provided for by his favor to me but yet i would sooner forfeit all my hopes from him trusting in god for the rest than not assist you if possible i never looked upon mr b in the light he now appears in to me in your case to be sure he is no professed debauchee but i am entirely of opinion you should if possible get out of his hands and especially as you are in very bad ones in mrs jewkess  we have here the widow lady jones mistress of a good fortune and a woman of virtue i believe we have also old sir simon darnford and his lady who is a good woman and they have two daughters virtuous young ladies all the rest are but middling people and traders at best i will try if you please either lady jones or lady darnford if they will permit you to take refuge with them i see no probability of keeping myself concealed in this matter but will as i said risque all things to serve you for i never saw a sweetness and innocence like yours and your hard case has attached me entirely to you for i know as you so happily express if i can serve you in this case i shall thereby perform all the acts of religion in one  as to lady davers i will convey a letter if you please to her but it must not be from our post house i give you caution for the man owes all his bread to mr b and his place too and i believe by something that dropped from him over a can of ale has his instructions you dont know how you are surrounded all which confirms me in your opinion that no honor is meant you let what will be professed and i am glad you want no caution on that head  give me leave to say that i had heard much in your praise both as to person and mind but i think greatly short of what you deserve my eyes convince me of the one your letter of the other for fear of losing the present lucky opportunity i am longer than otherwise i should be but i will not enlarge only to assure you that i am to the best of my power   your faithful friend and servant arthur williams i will come once every morning and once every evening after schooltime to look for your letters i will come in and return without going into the house if i see the coast clear otherwise to avoid suspicion i will come in       i instantly to this pleasing letter wrote as follows reverend sir o how answerable to your function and your character is your kind letter god bless you for it i now think i am beginning to be happy i should be sorry you should suffer on my account but i hope it will be made up to you an hundredfold by that god whom you so faithfully serve i should be too happy could i ever have it in my power to contribute in the least to it but alas to serve me must be for gods sake only for i am poor and lowly in fortune though in mind i hope too high to do a mean or unworthy deed to gain a kingdom but i lose time   any way you think best i shall be pleased with for i know not the persons nor in what manner it is best to apply to them i am glad of the hint you so kindly give me of the man at the post house i was thinking of opening a way for myself by letter when i could have opportunity but i see more and more that i am indeed strangely surrounded with dangers and that there is no dependence to be made on my masters honor  i should think sir if either of those ladies would give leave i might some way get out by favor of your key and as it is impossible watched as i am to know when it can be suppose sir you could get one made by it and put it by the next opportunity under the sunflower  i am sure no time is to be lost because it is rather my wonder that she is not thoughtful about this key than otherwise for she forgets not the minutest thing but sir if i had this key i could if these ladies would not shelter me run away anywhere and if i was once out of the house they could have no pretense to force me in again for i have done no harm and hope to make my story good to any compassionate body and by this way you need not be known torture should not wring it from me i assure you  one thing more good sir have you no correspondence with my masters family by that means maybe i could be informed of his intentions of coming hither and when i enclose you a letter of a deceitful wretch for i can trust you with anything poor john arnold its contents will tell why i enclose it perhaps by his means something may be discovered for he seems willing to atone for his treachery to me by the intimation of future service i leave the hint for you to improve upon and am reverend sir   your for ever obliged and thankful servant i hope sir by your favor i could send a little packet nowandthen somehow to my poor father and mother i have a little stock of money about five or six guineas shall i put half in your hands to defray a man and horse or any other incidents       i had time but just to transcribe this before i was called to dinner and i put that for mr williams with a wafer in it in my bosom to get an opportunity to lay it in the dear place  o good sirs of all the flowers in the garden the sunflower sure is the loveliest  it is a propitious one to me how nobly my plot succeeds but i begin to be afraid my writings may be discovered for they grow large i stitch them hitherto in my undercoat next my linen but if this brute should search me  i must try to please her and then she will not  well i am but just come off from a walk in the garden and have deposited my letter by a simple wile i got some horsebeans and we took a turn in the garden to angle as mrs jewkes had promised me she baited the hook and i held it and soon hooked a lovely carp play it play it said she i did and brought it to the bank a sad thought just then came into my head and i took it and threw it in again and o the pleasure it seemed to have to flounce in when at liberty  why this says she o mrs jewkes said i i was thinking this poor carp was the unhappy pamela i was likening you and myself to my naughty master as we hooked and deceived the poor carp so was i betrayed by false baits and when you said play it play it it went to my heart to think i should sport with the destruction of the poor fish i had betrayed and i could not but fling it in again and did you not see the joy with which the happy carp flounced from us o said i may some good merciful body procure me my liberty in the same manner for to be sure i think my danger equal  lord bless thee said she what a thought is there  well said i i can angle no more i will try my fortune said she and took the rod well said i i will plant life then if i can while you are destroying it i have some horsebeans here and will go and stick them into one of the borders to see how long they will be coming up and i will call them my garden  so you see dear father and mother i hope now you will soon see for maybe if i cannot get away so soon myself i may send my papers somehow i say you will see that this furnishes me with a good excuse to look after my garden another time and if the mould should look a little freshish it will not be so much suspected she mistrusted nothing of this and i went and stuck in here and there my beans for about the length of five else of each side of the sunflower and easily reposited my letter and not a little proud am i of this contrivance sure something will do at last  friday saturday i have just now told you a trick of mine now i will tell you a trick of this wicked womans she comes up to me says she i have a bill i cannot change till tomorrow and a tradesman wants his money most sadly and i dont love to turn poor tradesfolks away without their money have you any about you i have a little how much will do said i oh said she i want eight pounds alack said i i have but between five and six lend me that said she till tomorrow i did so and she went down stairs and when she came up she laughed and said well i have paid the tradesman said i i hope you will give it me again tomorrow at that the assurance laughing loud said why what occasion have you for money to tell you the truth lambkin i didnt want it i only feared you might make a bad use of it and now i can trust nan with you a little oftener especially as i have got the key of your portmanteau so that you can neither corrupt her with money or fine things never did any body look more silly than i  o how i fretted to be so foolishly outwitted  and the more as i had hinted to mr williams that i would put some in his hands to defray the charges of my sending to you i cried for vexation  and now i have not five shillings left to support me if i can get away  was ever such a fool as i i must be priding myself in my contrivances indeed said i was this in your instructions wolfkin for she called me lambkin jezebel you mean child said she  well i now forgive you heartily let us buss and be friends  out upon you said i cannot bear you but i durst not call her names again for i dread her huge paw most sadly the more i think of this thing the more do i regret it and blame myself  this night the man from the post house brought a letter for mrs jewkes in which was one enclosed to me she brought it me up said she well my good master dont forget us he has sent you a letter and see what he writes to me so she read that he hoped her fair charge was well happy and contented ay to be sure said i i cannot choose  that he did not doubt her care and kindness to me that i was very dear to him and she could not use me too well and the like there is a master for you said she sure you will love and pray for him i desired her to read the rest no no said she but i wont said i are there any orders for taking my shoes away and for beating me no said she nor about jezebel neither well returned i i cry truce for i have no mind to be beat again i thought said she we had forgiven one another  my letter is as follows  my dear pamela i begin to repent already that i have bound myself by promise not to see you till you give me leave for i think the time very tedious can you place so much confidence in me as to invite me down assure yourself that your generosity shall not be thrown away upon me i the rather would press this as i am uneasy for your uneasiness for mrs jewkes acquaints me that you take your restraint very heavily and neither eat drink nor rest well and i have too great an interest in your health not to wish to shorten the time of this trial to you which will be the consequence of my coming down to you john too has intimated to me your concern with a grief that hardly gave him leave for utterance a grief that a little alarmed my tenderness for you not that i fear any thing but that your disregard to me which yet my proud heart will hardly permit me to own may throw you upon some rashness that might encourage a daring hope but how poorly do i descend to be anxious about such a menial as he  i will only say one thing that if you will give me leave to attend you at the hall consider who it is that requests this from you as a favor i solemnly declare that you shall have cause to be pleased with this obliging mark of your confidence in me and consideration for me and if i find mrs jewkes has not behaved to you with the respect due to one i so dearly love i will put it entirely into your power to discharge her the house if you think proper and mrs jervis or who else you please shall attend you in her place this i say on a hint john gave me as if you resented something from that quarter dearest pamela answer favorably this earnest request of one that cannot live without you and on whose honor to you you may absolutely depend and so much the more as you place a confidence in it i am and assuredly ever will be   your faithful and affectionate etc you will be glad i know to hear your father and mother are well and easy upon your last letter that gave me a pleasure that i am resolved you shall not repent mrs jewkes will convey to me your answer       i but slightly read this letter for the present to give way to one i had hopes of finding by this time from mr williams i took an evening turn as i called it in mrs jewkess company and walking by the place i said do you think mrs jewkes any of my beans can have struck since yesterday she laughed and said you are a poor gardener but i love to see you divert yourself she passing on i found my good friend had provided for me and slipping it in my bosom for her back was toward me here said i having a bean in my hand is one of them but it was not stirred no to be sure said she and turned upon me a most wicked jest unbecoming the mouth of a woman about planting etc when i came in i hyd to my closet and read as follows i am sorry to tell you that i have had a repulse from lady jones she is concerned at your case she says but dont care to make herself enemies i applied to lady darnford and told her in the most pathetick manner i could your sad story and showed her your more pathetick letter i found her well disposed but she would advise with sir simon who bytheby is not a man of extraordinary character for virtue but he said to his lady in my presence why what is all this my dear but that our neighbor has a mind to his mothers waitingmaid and if he takes care she wants for nothing i dont see any great injury will be done her he hurts no family by this so my dear father and mother it seems that poor peoples honesty is to go for nothing and i think mr williams you of all men should not engage in this affair against your friend and patron he spoke this in so determined a manner that the lady had done and i had only to beg no notice should be taken of the matter as from me  i have hinted your case to mr peters the minister of this parish but i am concerned to say that he imputed selfish views to me as if i would make an interest in your affections by my zeal and when i represented the duties of our function and the like and protested my disinterestedness he coldly said i was very good but was a young man and knew little of the world and though twas a thing to be lamented yet when he and i set about to reform mankind in this respect we should have enough upon our hands for he said it was too common and fashionable a case to be withstood by a private clergyman or two and then he uttered some reflections upon the conduct of the present fathers of the church in regard to the first personages of the realm as a justification of his coldness on this score  i represented the different circumstances of your affair that other women lived evilly by their own consent but to serve you was to save an innocence that had but few examples and then i showed him your letter  he said it was prettily written and he was sorry for you and that your good intentions ought to be encouraged but what said he would you have me do mr williams why suppose sir said i you give her shelter in your house with your spouse and niece till she can get to her friends  what and imbroil myself with a man of mr bs power and fortune no not i i will assure you  and i would have you consider what you are about besides she owns continued he that he promises to do honorably by her and her shyness will procure her good terms enough for he is no covetous nor wicked gentleman except in this case and it is what all young gentlemen will do  i am greatly concerned for him i assure you but am not discouraged by this ill success let what will come of it if i can serve you  i dont hear as yet that mr b is coming i am glad of your hint as to that unhappy fellow john arnold something perhaps will strike out from that which may be useful as to your pacquets if you seal them up and lay them in the usual place if you find it not suspected i will watch an opportunity to convey them but if they are large you had best be very cautious this evil woman i find mistrusts me much  i just hear that the gentleman is dying whose living mr b has promised me i have almost a scruple of taking it as i am acting so contrary to his desires but i hope he will one day thank me for it as to money dont think of it at present be assured you may command all in my power to do for you without reserve  i believe when we hear he is coming it will be best to make use of the key which i shall soon procure you and i can borrow a horse for you i believe to wait within half a mile of the backdoor over the pasture and will contrive by myself or somebody to have you conducted some miles distant to one of the villages thereabouts so dont be discomforted i beseech you i am excellent mrs pamela   your faithful friend etc     i made a thousand sad reflections upon the former part of this honest gentlemans kind letter and but for the hope he gave me at last should have given up my case as quite desperate i then wrote to thank him most gratefully for his kind endeavors to lament the little concern the gentry had for my deplorable case the wickedness of the world first to give way to such iniquitous fashions and then plead the frequency of them against the attempt to amend them and how unaffected people were to the distresses of others i recalled my former hint as to writing to lady davers which i feared i said would only serve to apprize her brother that she knew his wicked scheme and more harden him in it and make him come down the sooner and to be the more determined on my ruin besides that it might make mr williams guessed at as a means of conveying my letter and being very fearful that if that good lady would interest herself in my behalf which was a doubt because she both loved and feared her brother it would have no effect upon him and that therefore i would wait the happy event i might hope for from his kind assistance in the key and the horse i intimated my masters letter begging to be permitted to come down was fearful it might be sudden and that i was of opinion no time was to be lost for we might lose all our opportunities telling him the moneytrick of this vile woman etc  i had not time to take a copy of this letter i was so watched but when i had it ready in my bosom i was easy and so i went to seek out mrs jewkes and told her i would have her advice upon the letter i had received from my master which point of confidence in her pleased her not a little ay said she now this is something like and well take a turn in the garden or where you please i pretended it was indifferent to me and so we walked into the garden i began to talk to her of the letter but was far from acquainting her with all the contents only that he wanted my consent to come down and hoped she used me kindly and the like and i said now mrs jewkes let me have your advice as to this why then said she i will give it you freely even send to him to come down it will highly oblige him and i dare say you will fare the better for it how the better said i  i dare say you think yourself that he intends my ruin i hate said she that foolish word your ruin  why never a lady in the lady may live happier than you if you will or be more honorably used  well mrs jewkes said i i shall not at this time dispute with you about the words ruin or honorable for i find we have quite different notions of both but now i will speak plainer than ever i did do you think he intends to make proposals to me as to a kept mistress or kept slave rather or do you not  why lambkin said she what do thou think thyself  i fear said i he does well said she but if he does for i know nothing of the matter i assure you you may have your own terms  i see that for you may do any thing with him  i could not bear this to be spoken though it was all i feared of a longtime and began to exclaim most sadly nay said she he may marry you as far as i know  no no said i that cannot be  i neither desire nor expect it his condition dont permit me to have such a thought and that and the whole series of his conduct convinces me of the contrary and you would have me invite him to come down would you is not this to invite my ruin  it is what i would do said she in your place and if it was to be as you think i should rather be out of my pain than live in continual frights and apprehension as you do no replied i an hour of innocence is worth an age of guilt and were my life to be made ever so miserable by it i should never forgive myself if i were not to lengthen out to the longest minute my happy time of honesty who knows what providence may do for me  why maybe said she as he loves you so well you may prevail upon him by your prayers and tears and for that reason i should think you would better let him come down well said i i will write him a letter because he expects an answer or maybe he will make that a pretense to come down how can it go  i will take care of that said she it is in my instructions  ay thought i so i doubt by the hint mr williams gave me about the post house  the gardener coming by i said mr jacob i have planted a few beans and i call the place my garden it is just by the door outyonder i will show it you pray dont dig them up so i went on with him and when we had turned the alley out of her sight and were near the place said i pray step to mrs jewkes and ask her if she has any more beans for me to plant he smiled i suppose at my foolishness and i popt the letter under the mould and stepped back as if waiting for his return which being near was immediate and she followed him what should i do with beans said she  and sadly scared me for she whispered me i am afraid of some fetch you dont use to send of such simple errands  what fetch said i it is hard i can neither stir nor speak but i must be suspected  why said she my master writes that i must have all my eyes about me for though you are as innocent as a dove yet youre as cunning as a serpent but i will forgive you if you cheat me  then i thought of my money and could have called her names had i dared and i said pray  mrs jewkes now you talk of forgiving me if i cheat you be so kind as to pay me my money for though i have no occasion for it yet i know you was but in jest and intended to give it me again you shall have it in a proper time said she but indeed i was in earnest to get it out of your hands for fear you should make an ill use of it and so we cavilled upon this subject as we walked in and i went up to write my letter to my master and as i intended to show it her i resolved to write accordingly as to her part of it for i made little account of his offer of mrs jervis to me instead of this wicked woman though the most agreeable thing that could have befallen me except my escape from hence nor indeed of any thing he said for to be honorable in the just sense of the word he need not have caused me to be run away with and confined as i am i wrote as follows honoured sir when i consider how easy it is for you to make me happy since all i desire is to be permitted to go to my poor father and mother when i reflect upon your former proposal to me in relation to a certain person not one word of which is now mentioned and upon my being in that strange manner run away with and still kept here a miserable prisoner do you think sir pardon your poor servants freedom my fears make me bold do you think i say that your general assurances of honor to me can have the effect upon me that were it not for these things all your words ought to have  o good sir i too much apprehend that your notions of honor and mine are very different from one another and i have no other hope but in your continued absence if you have any proposals to make me that are consistent with your honorable professions in my humble sense of the word a few lines will communicate them to me and i will return such an answer as befits me but oh what proposals can one in your high station have to make to one in my low one i know what belongs to your degree too well to imagine that any thing can be expected but sad temptations and utter distress if you come down and you know not sir when i am made desperate what the wretched pamela dares to do  whatever rashness you may impute to me i cannot help it but i wish i may not be forced upon any that otherwise would never enter into my thoughts forgive me sir my plainness i should be loath to behave to my master unbecomingly but i must needs say sir my innocence is so dear to me that all other considerations are and i hope shall ever be treated by me as niceties that ought for that to be dispensed with if you mean honorably why sir should you not let me know it plainly why is it necessary to imprison me to convince me of it and why must i be close watched and attended hindered from stirring out from speaking to any body from going so much as to church to pray for you who have been till of late so generous a benefactor to me why sir i humbly ask why all this if you mean honorably  it is not for me to expostulate so freely but in a case so near to me with you sir so greatly my superior pardon me i hope you will but as to any the least desire of seeing you i cannot bear the dreadful apprehension whatever you have to propose whatever you intend by me let my assent be that of a free person mean as i am and not of a sordid slave who is to be threatened and frightened into a compliance that your conduct to her seems to imply would be otherwise abhorred by her  my restraint is indeed hard upon me i am very uneasy under it shorten it i beseech you or  but i will not dare to say more than that i am  your greatly oppressed unhappy servant     after i had taken a copy of this i folded it up and mrs jewkes coming up just as i had done sat down by me and said when she saw me direct it i wish you would tell me if you have taken my advice and consented to my masters coming down if it will oblige you said i i will read it to you that is good said she then i will love you dearly  said i then you must not offer to alter one word i will not replied she so i read it to her and she praised me much for my wording it but said she thought i pushed the matter very close and it would better hear talking of than writing about she wanted an explanation or two as about the proposal to a certain person but i said she must take it as she heard it well well said she i make no doubt you understand one another and will do so more and more i sealed up the letter and she undertook to convey it  sunday for my part i knew it in vain to expect to have leave to go to church now and so i did not ask and i was the more indifferent because if i might have had permission the sight of the neighboring gentry who had despised my sufferings would have given me great regret and sorrow and it was impossible i should have edified under any doctrine preached by mr peters so i applied myself to my private devotions  mr williams came yesterday and this day as usual and took my letter but having no good opportunity we avoided one another conversation and kept at a distance but i was concerned i had not the key for i would not have lost a moment in that case had i been he and he me when i was at my devotions mrs jewkes came up and wanted me sadly to sing her a psalm as she had often on common days importuned me for a song upon the spinnet but i declined it because my spirits were so low i could hardly speak nor cared to be spoken to but when she was gone i remembering the    th psalm to be a little touching turned to it and took the liberty to alter it to my case more i hope i did not sin in it but thus i turned it i when sad i sat in b  nhall all watched round about and thought of every absent friend the tears for grief burst out ii my joys and hopes all overthrown my heart strings almost broke unfit my mind for melody much more to bear a joke iii then she to whom i prisoner was said to me tauntingly now cheer your heart and sing a song and tune your mind to joy iv alas said i how can i frame my heavy heart to sing or tune my mind while thus enthralled by such a wicked thing v but yet if from my innocence i even in thought should slide then let my fingers quite forget the sweet spinnet to guide vi and let my tongue within my mouth be locked for ever fast if i rejoice before i see my full deliverance past vii and thou almighty recompense the evils i endure from those who seek my sad disgrace so causeless to procure viii remember lord this mrs jewkes when with a mighty sound she cries down with her chastity down to the very ground ix even so shall thou o wicked one at length to shame be brought and happy shall all those be called that my deliverance wrought x yea blessed shall the man be called that shames thee of thy evil and saves me from thy vile attempts and thee too from the d    l   monday tuesday wednesday i write now with a little more liking though less opportunity because mr williams has got a large parcel of my papers safe in his hands to send them to you as he has opportunity so i am not quite uselesly employed and i am delivered besides from the fear of their being found if i should be searched or discovered i have been permitted to take an airing five or six miles with mrs jewkes but though i know not the reason she watches me more closely than ever so that we have discontinued by consent for these three days the sunflower correspondence  the poor cookmaid has had a bad mischance for she has been hurt much by a bull in the pasture by the side of the garden not far from the backdoor now this pasture i am to cross which is about half a mile and then is a common and near that a private horseroad where i hope to find an opportunity for escaping as soon as mr williams can get me a horse and has made all ready for me for he has got me the key which he put under the mould just by the door as he found an opportunity to hint to me  he just now has signified that the gentleman is dead whose living he has had hope of and he came pretendedly to tell mrs jewkes of it and so could speak this to her before me she wished him joy see what the world is one mans death is another mans joy thus we thrust out one another  my hard case makes me serious he found means to slide a letter into my hands and is gone away he looked at me with such respect and solemnness at parting that mrs jewkes said why madam i believe our young parson is half in love with you  ah mrs jewkes said i he knows better said she i believe to sound me why i cannot see you can either of you do better and i have lately been so touched for you seeing how heavily you apprehend dishonor from my master that i think it is pity you should not have mr williams  i knew this must be a fetch of hers because instead of being troubled for me as she pretended she watched me closer and him too and so i said there is not the man living that i desire to marry if i can but keep myself honest it is all my desire and to be a comfort and assistance to my poor parents if it should be my happy lot to be so is the very top of my ambition well but said she i have been thinking very seriously that mr williams would make you a good hushand and as he will owe all his fortune to my master he will be very glad to be sure to be obliged to him for a wife of his choosing especially said she such a pretty one and one so ingenious and genteelly educated  this gave me a doubt whether she knew of my masters intimation of that sort formerly and i asked her if she had reason to furmise that that was in view no she said it was only her own thought but it was very likely that my master had either that in view or something better for me but if i approved of it she would propose such a thing to her master directly and gave a detestable hint that i might take resolutions upon it of bringing such an affair to effect i told her i abhorred her vile insinuation and as to mr williams i thought him a civil good sort of man but as on one side he was above me so on the other of all things i did not love a parson so finding she could make nothing of me she quitted the subject  i will open his letter byandby and give you the contents of it for she is up and down so much that i am afraid of her surprising me  well i see providence has not abandoned me i shall be under no necessity to make advances to mr williams if i was as i am sure i am not disposed to it this is his letter i know not how to express myself lest i should appear to you to have a selfish view in the service i would do you but i really know but one effectual and honorable way to disengage yourself from the dangerous situation you are in it is that of marriage with some person that you could make happy in your approbation as for my own part it would be as things stand my apparent ruin and worse still i should involve you in misery too but yet so great is my veneration for you and so entire my reliance in providence on so just an occasion that i should think myself but too happy if i might be accepted i would in this case forego all my expectations and be your conductor to some safe distance but why do i say in this case that i will do whether you think fit to reward me so eminently or not and i will the moment i hear of mr bs setting out and i think now i have settled a very good method of intelligence of all his motions get a horse ready and myself to conduct you i refer myself wholly to your goodness and direction and am with the highest respect  your most faithful humble servant dont think this a sudden resolution i always admired your hearsay character and the moment i saw you wished to serve so much excellence       what shall i say my dear father and mother to this unexpected declaration i want now more than ever your blessing and direction but after all i have no mind to marry i had rather live with you but yet i would marry a man who begs from door to door and has no home nor being rather than endanger my honesty yet i cannot methinks hear of being a wife  after a thousand different thoughts i wrote as follows reverend sir i am much confused at the contents of your last you are much too generous and i cannot bear you should risque all your future prospects for so unworthy a creature i cannot think of your offer without equal concern and gratitude for nothing but to avoid my utter ruin can make me think of a change of condition and so sir you ought not to accept of such an involuntary compliance as mine would be were i upon the last necessity to yield to your very generous proposal i will rely wholly upon your goodness to me in assisting my escape but shall not on your account principally think of the honor you propose for me at present and never but at the pleasure of my parents who poor as they are in such a weighty point are as much entitled to my obedience and duty as if they were ever so rich i beg you therefore sir not to think of any thing from me but everlasting gratitude which will always bind me to be  your most obliged servant     thursday friday saturday the   th   th and   th of my bondage mrs jewkes has received a letter and is much civiler to me and mr williams too than she used to be i wonder i have not one in answer to mine to my master i suppose i put the matter too home to him and he is angry i am not the more pleased for her civility for she is horrid cunning and is not a whit less watchful i laid a trap to get at her instructions which she carries in the bosom of her stays but it has not succeeded  my last letter is come safe to mr williams by the old conveyance so that he is not suspected he has intimated that though i have not come so readily as he hoped into his scheme yet his diligence shall not be slackened and he will leave it to providence and myself to dispose of him as he shall be found to deserve he has signified to me that he shall soon send a special messenger with the packet to you and i have added to it what has occurred since  sunday i am just now quite astonished  i hope all is right  but i have a strange turn to acquaint you with mr williams and mrs jewkes came to me both together he in ecstacies she with a strange fluttering sort of air well said she mrs pamela i give you joy i give you joy  let nobody speak but me then she sat down as out of breath puffing and blowing why every thing turns as i said it would said she why there is to be a match between you and mr williams well i always thought it never was so good a master  go to go to naughty mistrustful mrs pamela nay mrs williams said the forward creature i may as good as call you you ought on your knees to beg his pardon a thousand times for mistrusting him  she was going on but i said dont torture me thus i beseech you mrs jewkes let me know all  ah mr williams said i take care take care  mistrustful again said she why mr williams show her your letter and i will show her mine they were brought by the same hand  i trembled at the thoughts of what this might mean and said you have so surprised me that i cannot stand nor hear nor read why did you come up in such a manner to attack such weak spirits said he to mrs jewkes shall we leave our letters with mrs pamela and let her recover from her surprise ay said she with all my heart here is nothing but flaming honor and good will and so saying they left me their letters and withdrew  my heart was quite sick with the surprise so that i could not presently read them notwithstanding my impatience but after awhile recovering i found the contents thus strange and unexpected mr williams the death of mr fownes has now given me the opportunty i have long wanted to make you happy and that in a double respect for i shall soon put you in possession of his living and if you have the art of making yourself well received of one of the loveliest wives in england she has not been used as she has reason to think according to her merit but when she finds herself under the protection of a man of virtue and probity and a happy competency to support life in the manner to which she has been of late years accustomed i am persuaded she will forgive those seeming hardships which have paved the way to so happy a lot as i hope it will be to you both i have only to account for and excuse the odd conduct i have been guilty of which i shall do when i see you but as i shall soon set out for london i believe it will not be yet this month mean time if you can prevail with pamela you need not suspend for that your mutual happiness only let me have notice of it first and that she approves of it which ought to be in so material a point entirely at her option as i assure you on the other hand i would have it at yours that nothing may be wanting to complete your happiness i am  your humble servant     was ever the like heard  lie still my throbbing heart divided as thou art between thy hopes and thy fears  but this is the letter mrs jewkes left with me  mrs jewkes you have been very careful and diligent in the task which for reasons i shall hereafter explain i had imposed upon you your trouble is now almost at an end for i have written my intentions to mr williams so particularly that i need say the less here because he will not scruple i believe to let you know the contents of my letter i have only one thing to mention that if you find what i have hinted to him in the least measure disagreeeble to either you assure them both that they are at entire liberty to pursue their own inclinations i hope you continue your civilities to the mistrustful uneasy pamela who now will begin to think better of hers and   your friend etc     i had hardly time to transcribe these letters though writing so much i write pretty fast before they both came up again in high spirits and mr williams said i am glad at my heart madam that i was beforehand in my declarations to you this generous letter has made me the happiest man on earth and mrs jewkes you may be sure that if i can procure this fairones consent i shall think myself  i interrupted the good man and said ah mr williams take care take care dont let  there i stopped and mrs jewkes said still mistrustful  i never saw the like in my life  but i see said she i was not wrong while my old orders lasted to be wary of you both  i should have had a hard task to prevent you i find for as the saying is naught can restrain consent of twain  i doubted not her taking hold of his joyful indiscretion  i took her letter and said here mrs jewkes is yours i thank you for it but i have been so long in a maze that i can say nothing of this for the present time will bring all to light  sir said i here is yours may every thing turn to your happiness i give you joy of my masters goodness in the living  it will be dying said he not a living without you  forbear sir said i while i have a father and mother i am not my own mistress poor as they are and i will see my self quite at liberty before i shall think my self fit to make a choice  mrs jewkes held up her eyes and hands and said such art such caution such cunning for thy years  well  why said i that he might be more on his guard though i hope there cannot be deceit in this twould be strange villainy and that is a hard word if there should i have been so used to be made a fool of by fortune that i hardly can tell how to govern my self and am almost an infidel as to mankind  but i hope i may be wrong henceforth mrs jewkes you shall regulate my opinions as you please and i will consult you in every thing  that i think proper said i to myself  for to be sure though i may forgive her i can never love her  she left mr williams and me a few minutes together and i said consider sir consider what you have done it is impossible said he there can be deceit i hope so said i but what necessity was there for you to talk of your former declaration let this be as it will that could do no good especially before this woman forgive me sir they talk of womens promptness of speech but indeed i see an honest heart is not always to be trusted with itself in bad company  he was going to reply but though her task is said to be almost i took notice of that word at an end she came up to us again and said well i had a good mind to show you the way to church tomorrow i was glad of this because though in my present doubtful situation i should not have chosen it yet i would have encouraged her proposal to be able to judge by her being in earnest or otherwise whether one might depend upon the rest but mr williams again indiscreetly helped her to an excuse by saying that it was now best to defer it one sunday and till matters were riper for my appearance and she readily took hold of it and confirmed his opinion  after all i hope the best but if this should turn out to be a plot i fear nothing but a miracle can save me but sure the heart of man is not capable of such black deceit besides mr williams has it under his own hand and he dare not but be in earnest and then again though to be sure he has been very wrong to me yet his education and parents example have neither of them taught him such very black contrivances so i will hope for the best  mr williams mrs jewkes and i have been all three walking together in the garden and she pulled out her key and we walked a little in the pasture to look at the bull an ugly grim surly creature that hurt the poor cookmaid who is got pretty well again mr williams pointed at the sunflower but i was forced to be very reserved to him for the poor gentleman has no guard no caution at all  we have just supped together all three and i cannot yet think but all must be right  only i am resolved not to marry if i can help it and i will give no encouragement i am resolved at least till i am with you  mr williams said before mrs jewkes he would send a messenger with a letter to my father and mother  i think the man has no discretion in the world but i desire you will give no answer till i have the pleasure and happiness which now i hope for soon of seeing you he will in sending my packet send a most tedious parcel of stuff of my oppressions my distresses my fears and so i will send this with it for mrs jewkes gives me leave to send a letter to my father which looks well and i am glad i can conclude after all my sufferings with my hopes to be soon with you which i know will give you comfort and so i rest begging the continuance of your prayers and blessings  your ever dutiful daughter   my dear father and mother i have so much time upon my hands that i must write on to employ myself the sunday evening where i left off mrs jewkes asked me if i chose to lie by myself i said yes with all my heart if she pleased well said she after tonight you shall i asked her for more paper and she gave me a little bottle of ink eight sheets of paper which she said was all her store for now she would get me to write for her to our master if she had occasion and six pens with a piece of sealingwax this looks mighty well  she pressed me when she came to bed very much to give encouragement to mr williams and said many things in his behalf and blamed my shyness to him i told her i was resolved to give no encouragement till i had talked to my father and mother she said she fancied i thought of somebody else or i could never be so insensible i assured her as i could do very safely that there was not a man on earth i wished to have and as to mr williams he might do better by far and i had proposed so much happiness in living with my poor father and mother that i could not think of any scheme of life with pleasure till i had tried that i asked her for my money and she said it was above in her strong box but that i shall have it tomorrow all these things look well as i said  mr williams would go home this night though late because he would dispatch a messenger to you with a letter he had proposed from himself and my packet but pray dont encourage him as i said for he is much too heady and precipitate as to this matter in my way of thinking though to be sure he is a very good man and i am much obliged to him   monday morning alasaday we have bad news from poor mr williams he has had a sad mischance fallen among rogues in his way home last night but by good chance has saved my papers this is the account he gives of it to mrs jewkes   good mrs jewkes i have had a sore misfortune in going from you when i had got as near the town as the dam and was going to cross the woodenbridge two fellows got hold of me and swore bitterly they would kill me if i did not give them what i had they romagd my pockets and took from me my snuff box my sealring and half a guinea and some silver and halfpence also my handkerchief and two or three letters i had in my pocket by good fortune the letter mrs pamela gave me was in my bosom and so that escaped but they bruised my head and face and cursing me for having no more money tipped me into the dam crying lie there parson till tomorrow my shins and knees were bruised much in the fall against one of the stumps and i had like to have been suffocated in water and mudd to be sure i shall not be able to stir out this day or two for i am a fearful spectacle my hat and wig i was forced to leave behind me and go home a mile and a half without but they were found next morning and brought me with my snuff box which the rogues must have dropped my cassock is sadly torn as is my band to be sure i was much frighted for a robbery in these parts has not been known many years diligent search is making after the rogues my humblest respects to good mrs pamela if she pities my misfortunes i shall be the sooner well and fit to wait on her and you this did not hinder me in writing a letter though with great pain as i do this  to be sure this good man can keep no secret and sending it away by a man and horse this morning i am good mrs jewkes  your most obliged humble servant god be praised it is no worse and i find i have got no cold though miserably wet from top to toe my fright i believe prevented me from catching cold for i was not rightly myself for some hours and know not how i got home i will write a letter of thanks this night if i am able to my kind patron for his inestimable goodness to me i wish i was enabled to say all i hope with regard to the better part of his bounty to me incomparable mrs pamela     the wicked brute fell a laughing when she had read this letter till her fat sides shook said she i can but think how the poor parson looked after parting with his pretty mistress in such high spirits when he found himself at the bottom of the dam and what a figure he must cut in his tattered band and cassock and without hat and wig when he got home i warrant said she he was in a sweet pickle  i said i thought it was very barbarous to laugh at such a misfortune but she said as he was safe she laughed otherwise she should have been sorry and she was glad to see me so concerned for him  it looked promising she said  i heeded not her reflection but as i have been used to causes for mistrusts i cannot help saying that i dont like this thing and their taking his letters most alarms me  how happy it was they missed my packet i know not what to think of it  but why should i let every accident break my peace but yet it will do so while i stay here  mrs jewkes is mightily at me to go with her in the chariot to visit mr williams she is so officious to bring on the affair between us that being a cunning artful woman i know not what to make of it i have refused her absolutely urging that except i intended to encourage his suit i ought not to do it and she is gone without me  i have strange temptations to get away in her absence for all these fine appearances it is sad to have no body to advise with  i know not what to do but alas for me i have no money if i should to buy any bodys civilities or to pay for necessaries or lodging but i will go into the garden and resolve afterward   i have been in the garden and to the backdoor and there i stood my heart up at my mouth i could not see i was watched so this looks well but if any thing should go bad afterward i should never forgive myself for not taking this opportunity well i will go down again and see if all is clear and how it looks out at the backdoor in the pasture  to be sure there is witchcraft in this house and i believe lucifer is bribed as well as all about me and is got into the shape of that nasty grim bull to watch me  for i have been down again and ventured to open the door and went out about a bowshoot into the pasture but there stood that horrid bull staring me full in the face with fiery saucer eyes as i thought so i got in again for fear he should come at me nobody saw me however  do you think there are such things as witches and spirits if there be i believe in my heart mrs jewkes has got this bull of her side but yet what could i do without money or a friend  o this wicked woman to trick me so every thing man woman and beast is in a plot against your poor pamela i think  then i know not one step of the way nor how far to any house or cottage and whether i could gain protection if i got to a house and now the robbers are abroad too i may run into as great danger as i want to escape from nay greater much if these promising appearances hold and sure my master cannot be so black as that they should not  what can i do  i have a good mind to try for it once more but then i may be pursued and taken and it will be worse for me and this wicked woman will beat me and take my shoes away and lock me up  but after all if my master should mean well he cannot be angry at my fears if i should escape and no body can blame me and i can more easily be induced with you when all my apprehensions are over to consider his proposal of mr williams than i could here and he pretends as you have read in his letter he will leave me at my choice why then should i be afraid i will go down again i think but yet my heart misgives me because of the difficulties before me in escaping and being so poor and so friendless  o good god the preserver of the innocent direct me what to do   well i have just now a sort of strange persuasion upon me that i ought to try to get away and leave the issue to providence so once more  i will see at least if this bull be still there  alackaday what a fate is this i have not the courage to go neither can i think to stay but i must resolve the gardner was in sight last time so made me come up again but i will contrive to send him out of the way if i can  for if i never should have such another opportunity i could not forgive myself once more i will venture god direct my footsteps and make smooth my path and my way to safety  well here i am come back again frighted like a fool out of all my purposes o how terrible every thing appears to me i had got twice as far again as i was before out of the back door and i looked and saw the bull as i thought between me and the door and another bull coming toward me the other way well thought i here is double witchcraft to be sure here is the spirit of my master in one bull and mrs jewkess in the other and now i am gone to be sure o help cried i like a fool and run back to the door as swift as if i flew when i had got the door in my hand i ventured to look back to see if these supposed bulls were coming and i saw they were only two poor cows a grazing in distant places that my fears had made all this rout about but as every thing is so frightful to me i find i am not fit to think of my escape for i shall be as much frighted at the first strange man that i meet with and i am persuaded that fear brings one into more dangers than the caution that goes along with it delivers one from  i then locked the door and put the key in my pocket and was in a sad quandary but i was soon determined for the maid nan came in sight and asked if any thing was the matter that i was so often up and down stairs god forgive me but i had a sad lie at my tongues end said i though mrs jewkes is sometimes a little hard upon me yet i know not where i am without her i go up and i come down to walk about in the garden and not having her know scarcely what to do with myself ay said the idiot she is main good company madam no wonder you miss her  so here i am again and here likely to be for i have no courage to help myself anywhere else o why are poor foolish maidens tried with such dangers when they have such weak minds to grapple with them  i will since it is so hope the best but yet i cannot but observe how grievously every thing makes against me for here are the robbers though i fell not into their hands myself yet they gave me as much terror and had as great an effect upon my fears as if i had and here is the bull it has as effectually frightened me as if i had been hurt by it instead of the cookmaid and so they joined together as i may say to make a very dastard of me but my folly was the worst of all for that deprived me of my money for had i had that i believe i should have ventured the other two  monday afternoon so mrs jewkes is returned from her visit well said she i would have you set your heart at rest for mr williams will do very well again he is not half so badly off as he fancied o these scholars said she they have not the hearts of mice he has only a few scratches on his face which said she i suppose he got by grabbling among the gravel at the bottom of the dam to try to find a hole in the ground to hide himself from the robbers his shin and his knee are hardly to be seen to all any thing he says in his letter he was a frightful spectacle he might be so indeed when he first came in adoors but he looks well enough now and only for a few groans nowandthen when he thinks of his danger i see nothing is the matter with him so mrs pamela said she i would have you be very easy about it i am glad of it said i for all your jokes mrs jewkes  well said she he talks of nothing but you and when i told him i would fain have persuaded you to come with me the man was out of his wits with his gratitude to me and so has laid open all his heart to me and told me all that has passed and was contriving between you two this alarmed me prodigiously and the rather as i saw by two or three instances that his honest heart could keep nothing believing every one as undesigning as himself i said but yet with a heavy heart ah mrs jewkes mrs jewkes this might have done with me had he had any thing that he could have told you of but you know well enough that had we been disposed we had no opportunity for it from your watchful care and circumspection no said she that is very true mrs pamela not so much as for that declaration that he owned before me he had found opportunity for all my watchfulness to make you come come said she no more of these shams with me you have an excellent headpiece for your years but maybe i am as cunning as you  however said she all is well now because my watchments are now over by my masters direction how have you employed yourself in my absence  i was so troubled at what might have passed between mr williams and her that i could not hide it and she said well mrs pamela since all matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended let me advise you to be a little less concerned at his discoveries and make me your confident as he has done and i shall think you have some favor for me and reliance upon me and perhaps you might not repent it  she was so earnest that i mistrusted she did this to pump me and i knew how now to account for her kindness to mr williams in her visit to him which was only to get out of him what she could why mrs jewkes said i is all this fishing about for something where there is nothing if there be an end of your watchments as you call them nothing said she but womanish curiosity i will assure you for one is naturally led to find out matters where there is such privacy intended well said i pray let me know what he has said and then i will give you an answer to your curiosity i dont care said she whether you do or not for i have as much as i wanted from him and i despair of getting out of you any thing you have not a mind i should know my little cunning dear  well said i let him have said what he would i care not for i am sure he can say no harm of me and so let us change the talk  i was the easier indeed because for all her pumps she gave no hints of the key and the door etc which had he communicated to her she would not have forborne giving me a touch of  and so we gave up one another as despairing to gain our ends of each other but i am sure he must have said more than he should  and i am the more apprehensive all is not right because she has now been actually these two hours shut up a writing though she pretended she had given me up all her stores of paper etc and that i should write for her i begin to wish i had ventured every thing and gone off when i might o when will this state of doubt and uneasiness end  she has just been with me and says she shall send a messenger to bedfordshire and he shall carry a letter of thanks for me if i will write it for my masters favor to me indeed said i i have no thanks to give till i am with my father and mother and besides i sent a letter as you know but have had no answer to it she said she thought that his letter to mr williams was sufficient and the least i could do was to thank him if but in two lines no need of it said i for i dont intend to have mr williams what then is that letter to me well said she i see thou art quite unfathomable  i dont like all this o my foolish fears of bulls and robbers  for now all my uneasiness begins to double upon me o what has this uncautious man said that no doubt is the subject of her long letter  i will close this days writing with just saying that she is mighty silent and reserved to what she was and says nothing but no or yes to what i ask something must be hatching i doubt  i the rather think so because i find she does not keep her word with me about lying by myself and my money to both which points she returned suspicious answers saying as to the one why you are mighty earnest for your money i shall not run away with it and to the other good lack you need not be so willing as i know of to part with me for a bedfellow till you are sure of one you like better this cut me to the heart  and at the same time stopped my mouth  tuesday wednesday mr williams has been here but we have had no opportunity to talk together he seemed confounded at mrs jewkess change of temper and reservedness after her kind visit and their freedom with one another and much more at what i am going to tell you he asked if i would take a turn in the garden with mrs jewkes and him no said she i cannot go said he may not mrs pamela take a walk  no said she i desire she will not why mrs jewkes said he i am afraid i have somehow disobliged you not at all replied she but i suppose you will soon be at liberty to walk together as much as you please and i have sent a messenger for my last instructions about this and more weighty matters and when they come i shall leave you to do as you both will but till then it is no matter how little you are together this alarmed us both and he seemed quite struck of a heap and put on as i thought a selfaccusing countenance so i went behind her back and held my two hands together flat with a bit of paper i had between them and looked at him and he seemed to take me as i intended intimating the renewing of the correspondence by the tiles  so i left them both together and retired to my closet to write a letter for the tiles but having no time for a copy i will give you the substance only  i expostulated with him on his too great openness and easiness to fall into mrs jewkess snares told him my apprehensions of foul play and gave briefly the reasons which moved me begged to know what he had said and intimated that i thought there was the highest reason to resume our project of the escape by the backdoor i put this in the usual place in the evening and now wait with impatience for an answer  thursday i have the following answer dearest madam i am utterly confounded and must plead guilty to all your just reproaches i wish i were master of but half your caution and discretion i hope after all this is only a touch of this ill womans temper to show her power and importance for i think mr b neither can nor dare deceive me in so black a manner i would expose him all the world over if he did but it is not cannot be in him i have received a letter from john arnold in which he tells me that his master is preparing for his london journey and believes afterward he will come into these parts but he says lady davers is at their house and is to accompany her brother to london or meet him there he knows not which he professes great zeal and affection to your service but i find he refers to a letter he sent me before but which is not come to my hand i think there can be no treachery for it is a particular friend at gainsborough that i have ordered him to direct to and this is come safe to my hands by this means for well i know i durst trust nothing to brett at the post house here this gives me a little pain but i hope all will end well and we shall soon hear if it be necessary to pursue our former intentions if it be i will lose no time to provide a horse for you and another for myself for i can never do either god or myself better service though i were to forego all my expectations for it here i am  your most faithful humble servant i was too free indeed with mrs jewkes led to it by her dissimulation and by her pretended concern to make me happy with you i hinted that i would not have scrupled to have procured your deliverance by any means and that i had proposed to you as the only honorable one marriage with me but i assured her though she would hardly believe me that you discouraged my application which is too true but not a word of the backdoor key etc       mrs jewkes continues still sullen and illnatured and i am almost afraid to speak to her she watches me as close as ever and pretends to wonder why i shun her company as i do  i have just put under the tiles these lines inspired by my fears which are indeed very strong and i doubt not without reason  sir every thing gives me additional disturbance the missed letter of john arnolds makes me suspect a plot yet am i loath to think myself of so much importance as to suppose every one in a plot against me are you sure however the london journey is not to be a lincolnshire one may not john who has been once a traitor be so again  why need i be thus in doubt  if i could have this horse i would turn the reins on his neck and trust to providence to guide him for my safeguard for i would not endanger you now just upon the edge of your preferment yet sir i fear your fatal openness will make you suspected as accessory let us be ever so cautious  were my life in question instead of my honesty i would not wish to involve you or any body in the least difficulty for so worthless a poor creature but o sir my soul is of equal importance with the soul of a princess though my quality is inferior to that of the meanest slave  save then my innocence good heaven and preserve my mind spotless and happy shall i be to lay down my worthless life and see an end to all my troubles and anxieties  forgive my impatience but my presaging mind bodes horrid mischiefs  every thing looks dark around me and this womans impenetrable sullenness and silence without any apparent reason from a conduct so very contrary bids me fear the worst  blame me sir if you think me wrong and let me have your advice what to do which will oblige  your most afflicted servant   friday i have this halfangry answer but what is more to me than all the letters in the world could be yours my dear father enclosed  madam i think you are too apprehensive by much i am sorry for your uneasiness you may depend upon me and all i can do but i make no doubt of the london journey nor of johns contrition and fidelity i have just received from my gainsborough friend this letter as i suppose from your good father in a cover directed for me as i had desired i hope it contains nothing to add to your uneasiness pray dearest madam lay aside your fears and wait a few days for the issue of mrs jewkess letter and mine of thanks to mr b things i hope must be better than you expect providence will not desert such piety and innocence and be this your comfort and reliance which is the best advice that can at present be given by  your most faithful humble servant   n b the fathers letter was as follows my dearest daughter our prayers are at length heard and we are overwhelmed with joy o what sufferings what trials have thou gone through blessed be the divine goodness which has enabled thee to withstand so many temptations we have not yet had leisure to read through your long accounts of all your hardships i say long because i wonder how you could find time and opportunity for them but otherwise they are the delight of our spare hours and we shall read them over and over as long as we live with thankfulness to god who has given us so virtuous and so discreet a daughter how happy is our lot in the midst of our poverty o let none ever think children a burden to them when the poorest circumstances can produce so much riches in a pamela persist my dear daughter in the same excellent course and we shall not envy the highest estate but defy them to produce such a daughter as ours  i said we had not read through all yours in course we were too impatient and so turned to the end where we find your virtue within view of its reward and your masters heart turned to see the folly of his ways and the injury he had intended to our dear child for to be sure my dear he would have ruined you if he could but seeing your virtue his heart is touched and he has no doubt been awakened by your good example  we dont see that you can do any way so well as to come into the present proposal and make mr williams the worthy mr williams god bless him  happy and though we are poor and can add no merit no reputation no fortune to our dear child but rather must be a disgrace to her as the world will think yet i hope i do not sin in my pride to say that there is no good man of a common degree especially as your late ladys kindness gave you such good opportunities which you have had the grace to improve but may think himself happy in you but as you say you had rather not marry at present far be it from us to offer violence to your inclinations so much prudence as you have shown in all your conduct would make it very wrong in us to mistrust it in this or to offer to direct you in your choice but alas my child what can we do for you  to partake our hard lot and involve yourself into as hard a life would not help us but add to our afflictions but it is time enough to talk of these things when we have the pleasure you now put us in hope of of seeing you with us which god grant amen amen say   your most indulgent parents amen our humblest service and thanks to the worthy mr williams again we say god bless him for ever  o what a deal we have to say to you god give us a happy meeting we understand the squire is setting out for london he is a fine gentleman and has wit at will i wish he was as good but i hope he will now reform       o what inexpressible comfort my dear father has your letter given me you ask what can you do for me  what is it you cannot do for your child  you can give her the advice she has so much wanted and still wants and will always want you can confirm her in the paths of virtue into which you first initiated her and you can pray for her with hearts so sincere and pure that are not to be met with in palaces  oh how i long to throw myself at your feet and receive from your own lips the blessings of such good parents but alas how are my prospects again overclouded to what they were when i closed my last parcel  more trials more dangers i fear must your poor pamela be engaged in but through the divine goodness and your prayers i hope at last to get well out of all my difficulties and the rather as they are not the effect of my own vanity or presumption  but i will proceed with my hopeless story i saw mr williams was a little nettled at my impatience and so i wrote to assure him i would be as easy as i could and wholly directed by him especially as my father whose respects i mentioned had assured me my master was setting out for london which he must have somehow from his own family or he would not have written me word of it  saturday sunday mr williams has been here both these days as usual but is very indifferently received still by mrs jewkes and to avoid suspicion i left them together and went up to my closet most of the time he was here he and she i found by her had a quarrel and she seems quite out of humor with him but i thought it best not to say any thing and he said he would very little trouble the house till he had an answer to his letter from mr b and she returned the less the better poor man he has got but little by his openness and making mrs jewkes his confident as she bragged and would have had me to do likewise  i am more and more satisfied there is mischief brewing and shall begin to hide my papers and be circumspect she seems mighty impatient for an answer to her letter to my master  monday tuesday the   th and   th days of my heavy restraint still more and more strange things to write a messenger is returned and now all is out o wretched wretched pamela what at last will become of me  such strange turns and trials sure never poor creature of my years experienced he brought two letters one to mrs jewkes and one to me but as the greatest wits may be sometimes mistaken they being folded and sealed alike that for me was directed to mrs jewkes and that for her was directed to me but both are stark naught abominably bad she brought me up that directed for me and said here is a letter for you long lookdfor is come at last i will ask the messenger a few questions and then i will read mine so she went down and i broke it open in my closet and found it directed to mrs pamela andrews but when i opened it it began mrs jewkes i was quite confounded but thinks i this may be a lucky mistake i may discover something and so i read on these horrid contents  mrs jewkes what you write me has given me no small disturbance this wretched fools plaything no doubt is ready to leap at any thing that offers rather than express the least sense of gratitude for all the benefits she has received from my family and which i was determined more and more to heap upon her i reserve her for my future resentment and i charge you double your diligence in watching her to prevent her escape i send this by an honest swiss who attended me in my travels a man i can trust and so let him be your assistant for the artful creature is enough to corrupt a nation by her seeming innocence and simplicity and she may have got a party perhaps among my servants with you as she has here even john arnold whom i confided in and favored more than any has proved an execrable villain and shall meet his reward for it  as to that college novice williams i need not bid you take care he sees not this painted bauble for i have ordered mr shorter my attorney to throw him instantly into goal on an action of debt for money he has had of me which i had intended never to carry to account against him for i know all his rascally practices besides what you write me of his perfidious intrigue with that girl and his acknowledged contrivances for her escape when he knew not for certain that i designed her any mischief and when if he had been guided by a sense of piety or compassion for injured innocence as he pretends he would have expostulated with me as his function and my friendship for him might have allowed him but to enter into a vile intrigue charmed like a godly sensualist with the amiable gewgaw to favor her escape in so base a manner to say nothing of his disgraceful practices against me in sir simon darnfords family of which sir simon himself has informed me is a conduct that instead of preferring the ungrateful wretch as i had intended shall pull down upon him utter ruin  monsieur colbrand my trusty swiss will obey you without reserve if my other servants refuse  as for her denying that she encouraged his declaration i believe it not it is certain the speaking picture with all that pretended innocence and bashfulness would have run away with him yes she would have run away with a fellow that she had been acquainted with and that not intimately if you was as careful as you ought to be but few days at a time when she had the strongest assurances of my honor to her  well i think i now hate her perfectly and though i will do nothing to her myself yet i can bear for the sake of my revenge and my injured honor and slighted love to see any thing even what she most fears be done to her and then she may be turned loose to her evil destiny and echo to the woods and groves her piteous lamentations for the loss of her fantastical innocence which the romantic idiot makes such a work about i shall go to london with my sister davers and the moment i can disengage myself which perhaps may be in three weeks from this time i will be with you and decide her fate and put an end to your trouble mean time be doubly careful for this innocent as i have warned you is full of contrivances i am  your friend     i had but just read this dreadful letter through when mrs jewkes came up in a great fright guessing at the mistake and that i had her letter and she found me with it open in my hand just sinking away what business said she had you to read my letter and snatched it from me you see said she looking upon it it says mrs jewkes at top you ought in manners to have read no further o add not said i to my afflictions i shall be soon out of all your ways this is too much too much i never can support this  and threw myself upon the couch in my closet and wept most bitterly she read it in the next room and came in again afterward why this said she is a sad letter indeed i am sorry for it but i feared you would carry your niceties too far  leave me leave me mrs jewkes said i for awhile i cannot speak nor talk  poor heart said she well i will come up again presently and hope to find you better but here take your own letter i wish you well but this is a sad mistake and so she put down by me that which was intended for me but i have no spirit to read it at present o man man hardhearted cruel man what mischiefs art thou not capable of unrelenting persecutor as thou art  i sat ruminating when i had a little come to myself upon the terms of this wicked letter and had no inclination to look into my own the bad names fools plaything artful creature painted bauble gewgaw speaking picture are hard words for your poor pamela and i began to think whether i was not indeed a very naughty body and had not done vile things but when i thought of his having discovered poor john and of sir simons base officiousness in telling him of mr williams with what he had resolved against him in revenge for his goodness to me i was quite dispirited and yet still more about that fearful colebrand and what he could see done to me for then i was ready to gasp for breath and my heart quite failed me then how dreadful are the words that he will decide my fate in three weeks gracious heaven said i strike me dead before that time with a thunderbolt or provide some way for my escaping these threatened mischiefs god forgive me if i sinned  at last i took up the letter directed for mrs jewkes but designed for me and i find that little better than the other these are the hard terms it contains well have you done perverse forward artful yet foolish pamela to convince me before it was too late how ill i had done to place my affections on so unworthy an object i had vowed honor and love to your unworthiness believing you a mirror of bashful modesty and unspotted innocence and that no perfidious designs lurked in so fair a bosom but now i have found you out you specious hypocrite and i see that though you could not repose the least confidence in one you had known for years and who under my good mothers misplaced favor for you had grown up in a manner with you when my passion in spite of my pride and the difference of our condition made me stoop to a meanness that now i despise myself for yet you could enter into an intrigue with a man you never knew till within these few days past and resolve to run away with a stranger whom your fair face and insinuating arts had bewitched to break through all the ties of honor and gratitude to me even at a time when the happiness of his future life depended upon my favor  henceforth for pamelas sake whenever i see a lovely face will i mistrust a deceitful heart and whenever i hear of the greatest pretenses to innocence will i suspect some deep laid mischief you were determined to place no confidence in me though i have solemnly over and over engaged my honor to you what though i had alarmed your fears in sending you one way when you hoped to go another yet had i not to convince you of my resolution to do justly by you although with great reluctance such then was my love for you engaged not to come near you without your own consent was not this a voluntary demonstration of the generosity of my intentions to you yet how have you requited me the very first fellow that your charming face and insinuating address could influence you have practiced upon corrupted too i may say and even ruined as the ungrateful wretch shall find and thrown your forward self upon him as therefore you would place no confidence in me my honor owes you nothing and in a little time you shall find how much you have erred in treating as you have done a man who was once  your affectionate and kind friend mrs jewkes has directions concerning you and if your lot is now harder than you might wish you will bear it the easier because your own rash folly has brought it upon you       alas for me what a fate is mine to be thus thought artful and forward and ungrateful when all i intended was to preserve my innocence and when all the poor little shifts which his superior wicked wit and cunning have rendered ineffectual were forced upon me in my own necessary defense  when mrs jewkes came up to me again she found me bathed in tears she seemed as i thought to be moved to some compassion and finding myself now entirely in her power and that it is not for me to provoke her i said it is now i see in vain for me to contend against my evil destiny and the superior arts of my barbarous master i will resign myself to the divine will and prepare to expect the worst but you see how this poor mr williams is drawn in and undone i am sorry i am made the cause of his ruin  poor poor man  to be taken in thus and for my sake too  but if you will believe me said i i gave no encouragement to what he proposed as to marriage nor would he have proposed it i believe but as the only honorable way he thought was left to save me and his principal motive to it all was virtue and compassion to one in distress what other view could he have you know i am poor and friendless all i beg of you is to let the poor gentleman have notice of my masters resentment and let him flee the country and not be thrown into goal this will answer my masters end as well for it will as effectually hinder him from assisting me as if he was in a prison  ask me said she to do any thing that is in my power consistent with my duty and trust and i will do it for i am sorry for you both but to be sure i shall keep no correspondence with him nor let you i offered to talk of a duty superior to that she mentioned of which would oblige her to help distressed innocence and not permit her to go the lengths enjoined by lawless tyranny but she plainly bid me be silent on that head for it was in vain to attempt to persuade her to betray her trust  all i have to advise you said she is to be easy lay aside all your contrivances and arts to get away and make me your friend by giving me no reason to suspect you for said she i glory in my fidelity to my master and you have both practiced some strange sly arts to make such a progress as he has owned there was between you so seldom as i thought you saw one another and i must be more circumspect than i have been  this doubled my concern for i now apprehended i should be much closer watched than before  well said i since i have by this strange accident discovered my hard destiny let me read over again that fearful letter of yours that i may get it by heart and feed my distress upon it for now i have nothing else to think of and must familiarize myself to calamity then said she let me read yours again i gave her mine and she lent me hers and so i took a copy of it with her leave because as i said i would by it prepare myself for the worst and when i had done i pinned it on the head of the couch this said i is the use i shall make of this wretched copy of your letter and here you shall always find it wet with my tears  she said she would go down to order supper and insisted upon my company to it i would have excused myself but she begun to put on a commanding air that i durst not oppose and when i went down she took me by the hand and presented me to the most hideous monster i ever saw in my life here monsieur colbrand said she here is your pretty ward and mine let us try to make her time with us easy he bowed and put on his foreign grimaces and seemed to bless himself and in broken english told me i was happy in de affections of de vinest gentleman in de varld  i was quite frightened and ready to drop down and i will describe him to you my dear father and mother if now you will ever see this and you shall judge if i had not reason especially not knowing he was to be there and being apprizd as i was of his hated employment to watch me closer  he is a giant of a man for stature taller by a good deal than harry mawlidge in your neighborhood and largebond and scraggy and has a hand  i never saw such an one in my life he has great staring eyes like the bulls that frightened me so vast jawbones sticking out eyebrows hanging over his eyes two great scars upon his forehead and one on his left cheek and two huge whiskers and a monstrous wide mouth blubber lips long yellow teeth and a hideous grin he wears his own frightful long hair tied up in a great black bag a black crape neckloth about a long ugly neck and his throat sticking out like a wen as to the rest he was dressed well enough and had a sword on with a nasty red knot to it leather garters buckled below his knees and a foot  near as long as my arm i verily think  he said he fright de lady and offered to withdraw but she bid him not and i told mrs jewkes that as she knew i had been crying she should not have called me to the gentleman without letting me know he was there i soon went up to my closet for my heart aked all the time i was at table not being able to look upon him without horror and this brute of a woman though she saw my distress before this addition to it no doubt did it on purpose to strike me more in terror and indeed it had its effect for when i went tobed i could think of nothing but his hideous person and my masters more hideous actions and thought them too well paired and when i dropped asleep i dreamed they were both coming to my bedside with the worst designs and i jumped out of bed in my sleep and frighted mrs jewkes till waking with the terror i told her my dream and the wicked creature only laughed and said all i feared was but a dream as well as that and when it was over and i was well awake i should laugh at it as such  and now i am come to the close of wednesday the   th day of my distress poor mr williams is actually arrested and carried away to stamford so there is an end of all my hopes in him poor gentleman his oversecurity and openness have ruined us both i was but too well convinced that we ought not to have lost a moments time but he was half angry and thought me too impatient and then his fatal confessions and the detestable artifice of my master  but one might well think that he who had so cunningly and so wickedly contrived all his stratagems hitherto that it was impossible to avoid them would stick at nothing to complete them i fear i shall soon find it so  but one stratagem i have just invented though a very discouraging one to think of because i have neither friends nor money nor know one step of the way if i was out of the house but let bulls and bears and lions and tigers and what is worse false treacherous deceitful men stand in my way i cannot be in more danger than i am and i depend nothing upon his three weeks for how do i know now be is in such a passion and has already begun his vengeance on poor mr williams that he will not change his mind and come down to lincolnshire before he goes to london  my stratagem is this i will endeavor to get mrs jewkes to go tobed without me as she often does while i sit locked up in my closet and as she sleeps very sound in her first sleep of which she never fails to give notice by snoring if i can but then get out between the two ears of the window for you know i am very slender and i find i can get my head through then i can drop upon the leads underneath which are little more than my height and which leads are over a little summerparlour that juts out toward the garden and as i am light i can easily drop from them for they are not high from the ground then i shall get into the garden and then as i have the key of the backdoor i will get out but i have another piece of cunning still good heaven succeed to me my dangerous but innocent devices  i have read of a great captain who being in danger leaped overboard into the sea and his enemies shooting at him with bows and arrows he got off his upper garment and swam away while they stuck that full of their darts and arrows and he escaped and triumphed over them all so what will i do but strip off my upper petticoat and throw it into the pond with my neckhandkerchief for to be sure when they miss me they will go to the pond first thinking i have drowned myself and so when they see some of my clothes floating there they will be all employed in dragging the pond which is a very large one and as i shall not perhaps be missed till the morning this will give me opportunity to get a great way off and i am sure i will run for it when i am out and so i trust that providence will direct my steps to some good place of safety and make some worthy body my friend for sure if i suffer ever so i cannot be in more danger nor in worse hands than where i am and with such avowed bad designs  o my dear parents dont be frighted when you come to read this  but all will be over before you can see it and so god direct me for the best my writings for fear i should not escape i will bury in the garden for to be sure i shall be searched and used dreadfully if i cannot get off and so i will close here for the present to prepare for my plot prosper thou o gracious protector of oppressed innocence this last effort of thy poor handmaid that i may escape the crafty devices and snares that have begun to entangle my virtue and from which but by this one trial i see no way of escaping and oh whatever becomes of me bless my dear parents and protect poor mr williams from ruin for he was happy before he knew me  just now just now i heard mrs jewkes who is in her cups own to the horrid colbrand that the robbing of poor mr williams was a contrivance of hers and executed by the groom and a helper in order to seize my letters upon him which they missed they are now both laughing at the dismal story which they little think i heard  o how my heart aches for what are not such wretches capable of can you blame me for endeavoring through any danger to get out of such clutches  past eleven oclock mrs jewkes is come up and gone tobed and bids me not stay long in my closet but come tobed o for a dead sleep for the treacherous brute i never saw her so tipsy and that gives me hopes i have tried again and find i can get my head through the iron bars i am now all prepared as soon as i hear her fast and now i will seal up these and my other papers my last work and to thy providence o my gracious god commit the rest  once more god bless you both and send us a happy meeting if not here in his heavenly kingdom amen  thursday friday saturday sunday the   th   th  0th and   st days of my distress and distress indeed for here i am still and every thing has been worse and worse oh the poor unhappy pamela  without any hope left and ruined in all my contrivances but oh my dear parents rejoice with me even in this low plunge of my distress for your poor pamela has escaped from an enemy worse than any she ever met with an enemy she never thought of before and was hardly able to stand against i mean the weakness and presumption both in one of her own mind which had well nigh had not divine grace interposed sunk her into the lowest last abyss of misery and perdition  i will proceed as i have opportunity with my sad relation for my pen and ink in my now doublysecurd closet is all that i have besides my own weakness of body to employ myself with and till yesterday evening i have not been able to hold a pen  i took with me but one shift besides what i had on and two handkerchiefs and two caps which my pocket held for it was not for me to incumber myself and all my stock of money which was but five or six shillings to set out for i knew not where and got out of the window not without some difficulty sticking a little at my shoulders and hips but i was resolved to get out if possible and it was further from the leads than i thought and i was afraid i had spraind my ancle and when i had dropped from the leads to the ground it was still further off but i did pretty well there at least i got no hurt to hinder me from pursuing my intentions so being now on the ground i hid my papers under a rosebush and covered them over with mould and there they still lie as i hope then i hyd away to the pond the clock struck twelve just as i got out and it was a dark misty night and coldish but i felt none then  when i came to the pondside i flung in my uppercoat as i had designed and my neckhandkerchief and a round eared cap with a knot and then with great speed ran to the door and took the key out of my pocket my poor heart beating all the time against my bosom as if it would have forced its way through it and beat it well might for i then too late found that i was most miserably disappointed for the wicked woman had taken off that lock and put another on so that my key would not open it i tried and tried and feeling about i found a padlock besides on another part of the door o then how my heart sunk  i dropped down with grief and confusion unable to stir or support myself for a while but my fears awakening my resolution and knowing that my attempt would be as terrible for me as any other danger i could then encounter i clamberd up upon the ledges of the door and upon the lock which was a great wooden one and reached the top of the door with my hands then little thinking i could climb so well i made shift to lay hold on the top of the wall with my hands but alas for me nothing but ill luck  no escape for poor pamela the wall being old the bricks i held by gave way just as i was taking a spring to get up and down came i and received such a blow upon my head with one of the bricks that it quite stunned me and i broke my shins and m ancle besides and beat off the heel of one of my shoes  in this dreadful way flat upon the ground lay poor i for i believe five or six minutes and when i would have got up i could hardly stand for i found i had bruised my left hip and shoulder and was full of pain with it and besides my head bled and akd with the blow i had with the brick  yet this i valued not but crawled a good way upon my feet and hands in search of a ladder i just recollected to have seen against the wall two days before on which the gardner was nailing a nectarine branch that was blown off from the wall but no ladder could i find and the wall was very high what now thinks i must become of the miserable pamela  then i began to wish myself most heartily again in my closet and to repent of my attempt which i now censured as rash because it did not succeed  god forgive me but a sad thought came just then into my head  i tremble to think of it indeed my apprehensions of the usage i should meet with had like to have made me miserable for ever o my dear dear parents forgive your poor child but being then quite desperate i crept along till i could get up on my feet though i could hardly stand and away limpd i  what to do but to throw myself into the pond and so put a period to all my griefs in this world  but oh to find them infinitely aggravated had i not by the divine grace been withheld in a miserable eternity as i have escaped this temptation blessed be god for it i will tell you my conflicts on this dreadful occasion that the divine mercies may be magnified in my deliverance that i am yet on this side the dreadful gulf from which there can be no redemption  it was well for me as i have since thought that i was so maimed as made me the longer before i got to the water for this gave me some reflection and abated that impetuousness of my passions which possibly might otherwise have hurried me in my first transport of grief on my seeing no way to escape and the hard usage i had reason to expect from my dreadful keepers to throw myself in without consideration but my weakness of body made me move so slowly that it gave time for a little reflection a ray of grace to dart in upon my benighted mind and so when i came to the pondside i sat myself down on the sloping bank and began to ponder my wretched condition and thus i reasoned with myself  pause here a little pamela on what thou art about before thou take the dreadful leap and consider whether there be no way yet left no hope if not to escape from this wicked house yet from the mischiefs threatened thee in it  i then considered and after i had cast about in my mind every thing that could make me hope and saw no probability a wicked woman devoid of all compassion a horrid helper just arrived in this dreadful colbrand an angry and resenting master who now hated me and threatened the most afflicting evils and that i should in all probability be deprived even of the opportunity i now had before me to free myself from all their persecutions  what have thou to do distressed creature said i to myself but throw thyself upon a merciful god who knows how innocently i suffer to avoid the merciless wickedness of those who are determined on my ruin  and then thought i and oh that thought was surely of the devils instigation for it was very soothing and powerful with me these wicked wretches who now have no remorse no pity on me will then be moved to lament their misdoings and when they see the dead corpse of the unhappy pamela dragged out to these slopy banks and lying breathless at their feet they will find that remorse to wring their obdurate hearts which now has no place there  and my master my angry master will then forget his resentments and say o this is the unhappy pamela that i have so causelessly persecuted and destroyed now do i see she preferred her honesty to her life will he say and is no hypocrite nor deceiver but really was the innocent creature she pretended to be then thinks i will he perhaps shed a few tears over the poor corse of his persecuted servant and though he may give out it was love and disappointment and that too in order to hide his own guilt for the unfortunate mr williams perhaps yet will he be inwardly grieved and order me a decent funeral and save me or rather this part of me from the dreadful stake and the highway interrment and the young men and maidens all around my dear fathers will pity poor pamela but o i hope i shall not be the subject of their ballads and elegies but that my memory for the sake of my dear father and mother may quickly slide into oblivion  i was once rising so indulgent was i to this sad way of thinking to throw myself in but again my bruises made me slow and i thought what art thou about to do wretched pamela how know thou though the prospect be all dark to thy shortsighted eye what god may do for thee even when all human means fail god almighty would not lay me under these sore afflictions if he had not given me strength to grapple with them if i will exert it as i ought and who knows but that the very presence i so much dread of my angry and designing master for he has had me in his power before and yet i have escaped may be better for me than these persecuting emissaries of his who for his money are true to their wicked trust and are hardened by that and a long habit of wickedness against compunction of heart god can touch his heart in an instant and if this should not be done i can then but put an end to my life by some other means if i am so resolved  but how do i know thought i that even these bruises and maims that i have gotten while i pursued only the laudable escape i had meditated may not kindly furnish me with the opportunity i now am tempted to precipitate myself upon and of surrendering up my life spotless and unguilty to that merciful being who gave it  then thought i who gave thee presumptuous as thou art a power over thy life who authorized thee to put an end to it when the weakness of thy mind suggests not to thee a way to preserve it with honor how know thou what purposes god may have to serve by the trials with which thou art now tempted art thou to put a bound to the divine will and to say thus much will i bear and no more and will thou dare to say that if the trial be augmented and continued thou will sooner die than bear it  this act of despondency thought i is a sin that if i pursue it admits of no repentance and can therefore claim no forgiveness  and will thou for shortening thy transitory griefs heavy as they are and weak as thou fanciest thyself plunge both body and soul into everlasting misery hitherto pamela thought i thou art the innocent the suffering pamela and will thou be the guilty aggressor and because wicked men persecute thee will thou fly in the face of the almighty and bid defiance to his grace and goodness who can still turn all these sufferings to benefits and how do i know but that god who sees all the lurking vileness of my heart may have permitted these sufferings on that very score and to make me rely solely on his grace and assistance who perhaps have too much prided myself in a vain dependence on my own foolish contrivances  then again thought i will thou suffer in one moment all the good lessons of thy poor honest parents and the benefit of their example who have persisted in doing their duty with resignation to the divine will amidst the extremest degrees of disappointment poverty and distress and the persecutions of an ungrateful world and merciless creditors to be thrown away upon thee and bring down as in all probability this thy rashness will their gray hairs with sorrow to the grave when they shall understand that their beloved daughter slighting the tenders of divine grace desponding in the mercies of a gracious god has blemished in this last act a whole life which they had hitherto approved and delighted in  what then presumptuous pamela do thou here thought i quit with speed these guilty banks and flee from these dashing waters that even in their sounding murmurs this still night reproach thy rashness tempt not gods goodness on the mossy banks that have been witnesses of thy guilty intentions and while thou have power left thee avoid the tempting evil lest thy grand enemy now repulsed by divine grace and due reflection return to the charge with a force that thy weakness may not be able to resist and lest one rash moment destroy all the convictions which now have awed thy rebellious mind into duty and resignation to the divine will  and so saying i arose but was so stiff with my hurts so cold with the moist dew of the night and the wet banks on which i had sat as also the damps arising from so large a piece of water that with great pain i got from the banks of this pond which now i think of with terror and bending my limping steps toward the house refugd myself in the corner of an outhouse where wood and coals are laid up for family use till i should be found by my cruel keepers and consigned to a wretched confinement and worse usage than i had hitherto experienced and there behind a pile of firewood i crept and lay down as you may imagine with a mind just broken and a heart sensible to nothing but the extremest woe and dejection  this my dear father and mother is the issue of your poor pamelas fruitless enterprise and who knows if i had got out at the backdoor whether i had been at all in better case moneyless friendless as i am and in a strange place  but blame not your poor daughter too much nay if ever you see this miserable scribble all bathed and blotted with my tears let your pity get the better of your blame but i know it will  and i must leave off for the present  for oh my strength and my will are at this time very far unequal to one another  but yet i will add that though i should have praised god for my deliverance had i been freed from my wicked keepers and my designing master yet i have more abundant reason for praise that i have been delivered from a worse enemy myself  i will continue my sad relation  it seems mrs jewkes awaked not till daybreak and not finding me in bed she called me and no answer being returned she relates that she got out of bed and run to my closet and not finding me searched under the bed and in another closet finding the chamber door as she had left it quite fast and the key as usual about her wrist for if i could have got out at the chamber door there were two or three passages and doors to them all double locked and barred to go through into the great garden so that to escape there was no way but that of the window and that very window because of the summerparlour under it for the other windows are a great way from the ground  she says she was excessively frighted and instantly raised the swiss and the two maids who lay not far off and finding every door fast she said i must be carried away as st peter was out of prison by some angel it is a wonder she had not a worse thought  she says she wept and wrung her hands and took on sadly running about like a mad woman little thinking i could have got out of the closet window between the iron bars and indeed i dont know if i could do so again but at last finding that casement open they concluded it must be so and so they ran out into the garden and found my footsteps in the mould of the bed which i dropped down upon from the leads and so speeded away all of them that is to say mrs jewkes colbrand and nan toward the backdoor to see if that was fast while the cook was sent to the outoffices to raise the men and make them get horses ready to take each a several way to pursue me  but it seems finding that door doublelockd and padlockd and the heel of my shoe and the broken bricks they verily concluded i was got away by some means over the wall and then they say mrs jewkes seemed like a distracted woman till at last nan had the thought to go toward the pond and there seeing my coat and cap and handkerchief in the water cast almost to the banks by the dashing of the waves she thought it was me and screaming out run to mrs jewkes and said o madam madam here is a piteous thing  mrs pamela lies drowned in the pond  thither they all ran and finding my clothes doubted not i was at the bottom and they all swiss among the rest beat their breasts and made most dismal lamentations and mrs jewkes sent nan to the men to bid them get the dragnet ready and leave the horses and come to try to find the poor innocent as she it seems then called me beating her breast and lamenting my hard hap but most what would become of them and what account they should give to my master  while every one was thus differently employed some weeping and wailing some running here and there nan came into the woodhouse and there lay poor i so weak so low and dejected and withal so stiff with my bruises that i could not stir nor help myself to get upon my feet and i said with a low voice for i could hardly speak mrs ann mrs ann  the creature was sadly frighted but was taking up a billet to knock me on the head believing i was some thief as she said but i cried out o mrs ann mrs ann help me for pitys sake to mrs jewkes for i cannot get up  bless me said she what you madam  why our hearts are almost broke and we were going to drag the pond for you believing you had drowned yourself now said she you will make us all alive again  and without helping me she run away to the pond and brought all the crew to the woodhouse  the wicked woman as she entered said where is she  plague of her spells and her witchcrafts she shall dearly repent of this trick if my name be jewkes and coming to me took hold of my arm so roughly and gave me such a pull as made me squeal out my shoulder being bruised on that side and drew me on my face o cruel creature said i if you knew what i have suffered it would move you to pity me  even colbrand seemed to be concerned and said fie madam fie you see she is almost dead you must not be so rough with her the coachman robin seemed to be sorry for me too and said with sobs what a scene is here dont you see she is all bloody in her head and cannot stir  curse of her contrivances said the horrid creature she has frighted me out of my wits i am sure how the d  i came you here  o said i ask me now no questions but let the maids carry me up to my prison and there let me die decently and in peace for indeed i thought i could not live two hours  the still more inhuman tygress said i suppose you want mr williams to pray by you dont you well i will send for my master this minute let him come and watch you himself for me for there is no such thing as holding you i am sure  so the maids took me up between them and carried me to my chamber and when the wretch saw how bad i was she began a little to relent  while every one wondered at what i had neither strength nor inclination to tell them how all this came to pass which they imputed to sorcery and witchcraft  i was so weak when i had got up stairs that i fainted away with dejection pain and fatigue and they undressed me and got me to bed and mrs jewkes ordered nan to bathe my shoulder and arm and ancle with some old rum warmed and they cut the hair a little from the back part of my head and washed that for it was clotted with blood from a pretty long but not deep gash and put a family plaster upon it for if this woman has any good quality it is it seems in a readiness and skill to manage in cases where sudden misfortunes happen in a family  after this i fell into a pretty sound and refreshing sleep and lay till twelve oclock tolerably easy considering i was very feverish and aguishly inclined and she took a deal of care to fit me to undergo more trials which i had hoped would have been more happily ended but providence did not see fit  she would make me rise about twelve but i was so weak i could only fit up till the bed was made and went into it again and was as they said delirious some part of the afternoon but having a tolerable night on thursday i was a good deal better on friday and on saturday got up and eat a little spoonmeat and my feverishness seemed to be gone and i was so mended by evening that i begged her indulgence in my closet to be left to myself which she consented to it being doublebarrd the day before and i assuring her that all my contrivances as she called them were at an end but first she made me tell her the whole story of my enterprise which i did very faithfully knowing now that nothing could stand me in any stead or contribute to my safety and escape and she seemed full of wonder at my resolution and venturesomeness but told me frankly that i should have found a hard matter to get quite off for that she was provided with a warrant from my master who is a justice of peace in this county as well as the other to get me apprehended if i had got away on suspicion of wronging him let me have been where i would  o how deeplaid are the mischiefs designed to fall on my devoted head  surely surely i cannot be worthy of all this contrivance  this too well shows me the truth of what was hinted to me formerly at the other house that my master swore he would have me o preserve me heaven from being his in his own wicked sense of the adjuration  i must add that now this woman sees me pick up so fast she uses me worse and has abridgd me of paper all but one sheet which i am to show her written or unwritten on demand and has reduced me to one pen yet my hidden stores stand me in stead but she is more and more snappish and cross and tauntingly calls me mrs williams and any thing that she thinks will vex me  sunday afternoon mrs jewkes has thought fit to give me an airing for three or four hours this afternoon and i am a good deal better and should be much more so if i knew for what i am reserved but health is a blessing hardly to be coveted in my circumstances since that fits me for the calamity i am in continual apprehensions of whereas a weak and sickly state might possibly move compassion for me o how i dread the coming of this angry and incensed master though i am sure i have done him no harm  just now we heard that he had like to have been drowned in crossing a stream a few days ago in pursuing his game what is the matter with all his ill usage of me that i cannot hate him to be sure i am not like other people he has certainly done enough to make me hate him but yet when i heard his danger which was very great i could not in my heart forbear rejoicing for his safety though his death would have ended my afflictions ungenerous master if you knew this you surely would not be so much my persecutor but for my late good ladys sake i must wish him well and o what an angel would he be in my eyes yet if he would cease his attempts and reform  well i hear by mrs jewkes that john arnold is turned away being detected in writing to mr williams and that mr longman and mr jonathan the butler have incurred his displeasure for offering to speak in my behalf mrs jervis too is in danger for all these three belike went together to beg in my favor for now it is known where i am  mrs jewkes has with the news about my master received a letter but she says the contents are too bad for me to know they must be bad indeed if they be worse than what i have already known  just now the horrid creature tells me as a secret that she has reason to think he has found out a way to satisfy my scruples it is by marrying me to this dreadful colbrand and buying me of him on the wedding day for a sum of money  was ever the like heard  she says it will be my duty to obey my husband and that mr williams will be forced as a punishment to marry us and that when my master has paid for me and i am surrendered up the swiss is to go home again with the money to his former wife and children for she says it is the custom of those people to have a wife in every nation  but this to be sure is horrid romancing but abominable as it is it may possibly serve to introduce some plot now hatching  with what strange perplexities is my poor mind agitated perchance some shammarriage may be designed on purpose to ruin me but can a husband sell his wife against her own consent  and will such a bargain stand good in law  monday tuesday wednesday the   d   d and   th days of my imprisonment nothing offers these days but squabblings between mrs jewkes and me she grows worse and worse to me i vexed her yesterday because she talked nastily and told her she talked more like a vile london prostitute than a gentlemans housekeeper and she cannot use me bad enough for it bless me she curses and storms at me like a trooper and can hardly keep her hands off me you may believe she must talk sadly to make me say such harsh words indeed it cannot be repeated and she is a disgrace to her sex and then she ridicules me and laughs at my notions of honesty and tells me impudent creature that she is what a fine bedfellow i shall make for my master and suchlike with such whimsical notions about me  do you think this is to be borne and yet she talks worse than this if possible  quite filthily o what vile hands am i put into  thursday i have now all the reason that can be to apprehend my master will be here soon for the servants are busy in setting the house to rights and a stable and coachhouse are cleaning out that have not been used some time i ask mrs jewkes but she tells me nothing nor will hardly answer me when i ask her a question sometimes i think she puts on these strange wicked airs to me purposely to make me wish for what i dread most of all things my masters coming down he talk of love  if he had any the least notion of regard for me to be sure he would not give this naughty body such power over me  and if he does come where is his promise of not seeing me without i consent to it but it seems his honor owes me nothing so he tells me in his letter andwhy because i am willing to keep mine but indeed he says he hates me perfectly and it is plain he does or i should not be left to the mercy of this woman and what is worse to my woeful apprehensions  friday the   th day of my imprisonment i took the liberty yesterday afternoon finding the gates open to walk out before the house and ere i was aware had got to the bottom of the long row of elms and there i sat myself down upon the steps of a sort of broad style which leads into the road that goes toward the town and as i sat musing about what always busies my mind i saw a whole body of folks running toward me from the house men and women as in a fright at first i wondered what was the matter till they came nearer and i found they were all alarmed thinking i had attempted to get off there was first the horrible colbrand running with his long legs well nigh two yards at a stride then there was one of the grooms poor mr williamss robber then i spied nan half out of breath and the cookmaid after her and lastly came waddling as fast as she could mrs jewkes exclaiming most bitterly as i found against me colbrand said o how have you frighted us all  and went behind me lest i should run away as i suppose  i sat still to let them see i had no view to get away for besides the improbability of succeeding my last sad attempt had cured me of enterprizing again and when mrs jewkes came within hearing i found her terribly incensed and raving about my contrivances why said i should you be so concerned here i have sat a few minutes and had not the least thought of getting away or going further but to return as soon as it was duskish she would not believe me and the barbarous creature struck at me with her horrid fist and i believe would have felled me had not colbrand interposed and said he saw me sitting still looking about me and not seeming to have the least inclination to stir but this would not serve she ordered the two maids to take me each by an arm and lead me back into the house and up stairs and there have i been locked up ever since without shoes in vain have i pleaded that i had no design as indeed i had not the least and last night i was forced to lie between her and nan and i find she is resolved to make a handle of this against me and in her own behalf  indeed what with her usage and my own apprehensions of still worse i am quite weary of my life  just now she has been with me and given me my shoes and has laid her imperious commands upon me to dress myself in a suit of clothes out of the portmanteau which i have not seen lately against three or four oclock for she says she is to have a visit from lady darnfords two daughters who came purposely to see me and so she gave me the key of the portmanteau but i will not obey her and i told her i would not be made a show of nor see the ladies she left me saying it should be worse for me if i did not but how can that be  five of clock is come and no young ladies  so that i fansy  but hold i hear their coach i believe i will step to the window  i will not go down to them i am resolved   good sirs good sirs what will become of me here is my master come in his fine chariot  indeed he is what shall i do where shall i hide myself  oh what shall i do  pray for me but oh you will not see this  now good god of heaven preserve me if it be thy blessed will  seven oclock though i dread to see him yet do i wonder i have not to be sure something is resolving against me and he stays to hear all her stories i can hardly write yet as i can do nothing else i know not how to forbear  yet i cannot hold my pen  how crooked and trembling the lines  i must leave off till i can get quieter fingers  why should the guiltless tremble so when the guilty can possess their minds in peace  saturday morning now let me give you an account of what passed last night for i had no power to write nor yet opportunity till now  this vile woman held my master till half an hour after seven and he came hither about five in the afternoon and then i heard his voice on the stairs as he was coming up to me it was about his supper for he said i shall choose a boiled chicken with butter and parsley  and up he came  he put on a stern and majestic air and he can look very majestic when he pleases well perverse pamela ungrateful runaway said he for my first salutation  you do well dont you to give me all this trouble and vexation i could not speak but throwing my self on the floor hid my face and was ready to die with grief and apprehension  he said well may you hide your face well may you be ashamed to see me vile forward one as you are  i sobbd and wept but could not speak and he let me lie and went to the door and called mrs jewkes  there said he take up that fallen angel  once i thought her as innocent as an angel of light but i have now no patience with her the little hypocrite prostrates her self thus in hopes to move my weakness in her favor and that i will raise her from the floor myself but i shall not touch her no said he cruel gentleman as he was let such fellows as williams be taken in by her artful wiles i know her now and see she is for any fools turn that will be caught by her  i sighed as if my heart would break  and mrs jewkes lifted me up upon my knees for i trembled so i could not stand come said she mrs pamela learn to know your best friend confess your unworthy behavior and beg his honors forgiveness of all your faults i was ready to saint and he said she is mistress of arts i will assure you and will mimick a fit ten to one in a minute  i was struck to the heart at this but could not speak presently only lifted up my eyes to heaven  and at last made shift to say  god forgive you sir  he seemed in a great passion and walked up and down the room casting sometimes an eye upon me and seemng as if he would have spoken but checked himself and at last he said when she has acted this her first part over perhaps i will see her again and she shall soon know what she has to trust to  and so he went out of the room and i was quite sick at heart  surely said i i am the wickedest creature that ever breathed well said the impertinent not so wicked as that neither but i am glad you begin to see your faults nothing like being humble  come i will stand your friend and plead for you if you will promise to be more dutiful for the future come come added the wretch this may be all made up by tomorrow morning if you are not a fool  begone hideous woman said i and let not my afflictions be added to by thy inexorable cruelty and unwomanly wickedness  she gave me a push and went away in a violent passion and it seems she made a story of this and said i had such a spirit there was no hearing it  i laid me down on the floor and had no power to stir till the clock struck nine and then the wicked woman came up again you must come down stairs said she to my master that is if you please spirit  said i i believe i cannot stand then said she i will send monsieur colbrand to carry you down  i got up as well as i could and trembled all the way down stairs and she went before me into the parlour and a new servant that he had waiting on him instead of john withdrew as soon as i came in and by the way he had a new coachman too which looked as if bedfordshire robin was turned away  i thought said he when i came down you should have sat at table with we when i had not company but when i find you cannot forget you original but must prefer my menials to me i call you down to wait on me while i sup that i may have some talk with you and throw away as little time as possible upon you  sir said i you do me honor to wait upon you  and i never shall i hope forget my original but i was forced to stand behind his chair that i might hold by it fill me said he a glass of that burgundy i went to do it but my hand shook so that i could not hold the plate with the glass in it and spilt some of the wine so mrs jewkes poured it for me and i carried it as well as i could and made a low courtsy he took it and said stand behind me out of my sight  why mrs jewkes said he you tell me she remains very sullen still and eats nothing no said she not so much as will keep life and soul together  and is always crying you say too yes sir answered she i think she is for one thing or another ay said he your young wenches will feed upon their tears and their obstinacy will serve them for meat and drink i think i never saw her look better tho in my life  but i suppose she lives upon love this sweet mr williams and her little villainous plots together have kept her alive and well to be sure for mischief love and contradiction are the natural ailments of a woman  poor i was forced to hear all this and be silent and indeed my heart was too full to speak  and so you say said he that she had another project but yesterday to get away she denies it herself said she but it had all the appearance of one i am sure she made me in a fearful pucker about it and i am glad your honor is come with all my heart and i hope whatever be your honors intention concerning her you will not be long about it for you will find her as slippery as an eel i will assure you  sir said i and clapsed his knees with my arms not knowing what i did and falling on my knees have mercy on me and hear me concerning that wicked womans usage of me   he cruelly interrupted me and said i am satisfied she has done her duty it signifies nothing what you say against mrs jewkes that you are here little hypocrite as you are pleading your cause before me is owing to her care of you else you had been with the parson  wicked girl said he to tempt a man to undo himself as you have done him at a time when i was on the point of making him happy for his life  i arose but said with a deep sigh i have done sir  i have done  i have a strange tribunal to plead before the poor sheep in the fable had such an one when it was tried before the vultur on the accusation of the wolf  so mrs jewkes said he you are the wolf i the vultur and this the poor innocent lamb on her trial before us  oh you dont know how well this innocent is read in reflection she has wit at will when she has a mind to display her own romantic innocence at the price of other peoples characters  well said the aggravating creature this is nothing to what she has called me i have been a jezebel a london prostitute and what not  but i am contented with her ill names now i see it is her fashion and she can call your honor a vultur  said i i had no thought of comparing my master  and was going to say on but he said dont prate girl  no said she it dont become you i am sure  well said i since i must not speak i will hold my peace but there is a righteous judge who knows the secrets of all hearts and to him i appeal  see there said he now this meek good creature is praying for fire from heaven upon us o she can curse most heartily in the spirit of christian meekness i will assure you  come sawcyface give me another glass of wine  so i did as well as i could but wept so that he said i suppose i shall have some of your tears in my wine  when he had supped he stood up and said o how happy for you it is that you can at will thus make your speaking eyes overflow in this manner without losing any of their brilliancy you have been told i suppose that you are most beautiful in your tears  did you ever said he to her who all thi while was standing in one corner of the parlur see a more charming creature than this is it to be wondered at that i demean myself thus to take notice of her  see said he and took the glass with one hand and turned me round with the other what a shape what a neck what a hand and what a bloom in that lovely face  but who can describe the tricks and artifices that lie lurking in her little plotting guileful heart it is no wonder the poor parson was infatuated with her  i blame him less than i do her for who could expect such artifice in so young a sorceress  i went to the further part of the room and held my face against the wainscot and in spite of all i could do to refrain crying sobbd as if my heart would break he said i am surpised mrs jewkes at the mistake of the letters you tell me of but you see i am not afraid any body should read what i write i dont carry on private correspondencies and reveal every secret that comes to my knowledge and then corrupt people to carry my letters against their duty and all good conscience  come hither hussy said he you and i have a dreadful reckoning to make  why dont you come when i bid you  fie upon it mrs pamela said she what not stir when his honor command you to come to him  who knows but his goodness will forgive you  he came to me for i had no power to stir and put his arms about my neck and would kiss me and said well mrs jewkes if it were not for the thought of this cursed parson i believe in my heart so great is my weakness that i could yet forgive this intriguing little slut and take her to my bosom  o said the sycophant yen are very good sir very forgiving indeed  but come added the profligate wretch i hope you will be so good as to take her to your bosom and that by tomorrow morning you will bring her to a better sense of her duty  could any thing in womanhood be so vile i had no patience but yet grief and indignation choked up the passage of my words and i could only stammer out a passionate exclamation to heaven to protect my innocence but the word was the subject of their ridicule was ever poor creature worse beset  he said as if he had been considering whether he could forgive me or not no i cannot yet forgive her neither  she has given me great disturbance has brought great discredit upon me both abroad and at home has corrupted all my servants at the other house has despised my honorable views and intentions to her and sought to run away with this ungrateful parson  and surely i ought not to forgive all this  yet with all this wretched grimace he kissed me again and would have put his hand in my bosom but i struggled and said i would die before i would be used thus  consider pamela said he in a threatening tone consider where you are and dont play the fool if you do a more dreadful fate awaits you than you expect but take her up stairs mrs jewkes and i will send a few lines to her to consider off and let me have your answer pamela in the morning till then you have to resolve upon and after that your doom is fixed  so i went up stairs and gave myself up to grief and expectation of what he would send but yet i was glad of this nights reprieve  he sent me however nothing at all and about twelve oclock mrs jewkes and nan came up as the night before to be my bedfellows and i would go tobed with some of my clothes on which they muttered at sadly and mrs jewkes railed at me particularly indeed i would have sat up all night for fear if she would have let me for i had but very little rest that night apprehending this woman would let my master in she did nothing but praise him and blame me but i answered her as little as i could  he has sir simon telltale alias darnford to dine with him today whose family sent to welcome him into the country and it seems the old knight wants to see me so i suppose i shall be sent for as samson was to make sport for him  here i am and must bear it all  twelve oclock saturday noon just now he has sent me up by mrs jewkes the following proposals so here are the honorable intentions all at once laid open they are my dear parents to make me a vile kept mistress which i hope i shall always detest the thoughts of but you will see how they are accommodated to what i should have most desired could i have honestly promoted it your welfare and happiness i have answered them as i am sure you will approve and i am prepared for the worst for though i fear there will be nothing omitted to ruin me and though my poor strength will not be able to defend me yet i will be innocent of crime in my intention and in the sight of god and to him leave the avenging of all my wrongs in his own good time and manner i shall write to you my answer against his articles and hope the best though i fear the worst but if i should come home to you ruined and undone and may not be able to look you in the face yet pity and in spirit the poor pamela to make her little remnant of life easy for long i shall not survive my disgrace and you may be assured it shall not be my fault if it be my misfortune  to mrs pamela andrews the following articles are proposed to your serious consideration and let me have an answer in writing to them that i may take my resolutions accordingly only remember that i will not be trifled with and what you give for answer will absolutely decide your fate without expostulation or further trouble  this is my answer forgive good sir the spirit your poor servant is about to show in her answer to your articles not to be warm and in earnest on such an occasion as the present would show a degree of guilt that i hope my soul abhors i will not trifle with you nor act like a person doubtful of her own mind for it wants not one moments consideration with me and i therefore return the answer following let what will be the consequence  i if you can convince me that the hated parson has had no encouragement from you in his addresses and that you have no inclination for him in preference to me then i will offer the following proposals to you which i will punctually make good  i as to the first article sir it may behove me that i may not deserve in your opinion the opprobrious terms of forward and artful and suchlike to declare solemnly that mr williams never had the least encouragement from me as to what you hint and i believe his principal motive was the apprehended duty of his function quite contrary to his apparent interest to assist a person he thought in distress you may sir the rather believe me when i declare that i know not the man breathing i would wish to marry and that the only one i could honor more than another is the gentleman who of all others seeks my everlasting dishonor  ii i will directly make you a present of  00 guineas for your own use which you may dispose of to any purpose you please and will give it absolutely into the hands of any person you shall appoint to receive it and expect no favor in return till you are satisfied in the possession of it  ii as to your second proposal let the consequence be what it will i reject it with all my soul money sir is not my chief good may god almighty desert me whenever it is and whenever for the sake of that i can give up my title to that blessed hope which will stand me in stead at a time when millions of gold will not purchase one happy moment of reflection on a past mispent life  iii i will likewise directly make over to you a purchase i lately made in kent which brings in   0 l per annum clear of all deductions this shall be made over to you in full property for your life and for the lives of any children to perpetuity that you may happen to have and your father shall be immediately put into possession of it in trust for these purposes and the management of it will yield a comfortable subsistence to him and your mother for life and i will make up any deficiencies if such should happen to that clear sum and allow him  0 l per annum besides for his life and that of your mother for his care and management of this your estate  iii your third proposal sir i reject for the same reason and am sorry you could think my poor honest parents would enter into their part of it and be concerned for the management of an estate which would be owing to the prostitution of their poor daughter forgive sir my warmth on this occasion but you know not the poor man and the poor woman my ever dear father and mother if you think that they would not much rather choose to starve in a ditch or rot in a noisome dungeon than accept of the fortune of a monarch upon such wicked terms i dare not say all that my full mind suggests to me on this grievous occasion  but indeed sir you know them not nor shall the terrors of death in its most frightful forms i hope through gods assisting grace ever make me act unworthy of such poor honest parents  iv i will moreover extend my favor to any other of your relations that you may think worthy of it or that are valued by you  iv your fourth proposal i take upon me sir to answer as the third if i have any friends that want the favor of the great may they ever want it if they are capable of desiring it on unworthy terms  v i will besides order patterns to be sent you for choosing four complete suits of rich clothes that you may appear with reputation as if you was my wife and i will give you the two diamond rings and two pair of earrings and diamond necklace that were bought by my mother to present to miss tomlins if the match that was proposed between her and me had been brought to effect and i will confer upon you still other gratuities as i shall find myself obliged by your good behavior and affection  v fine clothes sir become not me nor have i any ambition to wear them i have greater pride in my poverty and meanness than i should have in dress and finery believe me sir i think such things less become the humbleborn pamela than the rags your good mother raised me from your rings sir your necklace and your earrings will better befit ladies of degree than me and to lose the best jewel my virtue would be poorly recompensed by those you propose to give me what should i think when i looked upon my finger or saw in the glass those diamonds on my neck and in my ears but that they were the price of my honesty and that i wore those jewels outwardly because i had none inwardly  vi now pamela will you see by this what a value i set upon the free will of a person already in my power and who if these proposals are not accepted shall find that i have not taken all these pains and risqued my reputation as i have done without resolving to gratify my passion for you at all adventures and if you refuse without making any terms at all  vi i know sir by woeful experience that i am in your power i know all the resistance i can make will be poor and weak and perhaps stand me in little stead i dread your will to ruin me is as great as your power yet sir will i dare to tell you that i will make no free will offering of my virtue all that i can do poor as it is i will do to convince you that your offers shall have no part in my choice and if i cannot escape the violence of man i hope by gods grace i shall have nothing to reproach myself for not doing all in my power to avoid my disgrace and then i can safely appeal to the great god my only refuge and protector with this consolation that my will bore no part in my violation  vii you shall be mistress of my person and fortune as much as if the foolish ceremony had passed all my servants shall be yours and you shall choose any two persons to attend yourself either male or female without any control of mine and if your conduct be such that i have reason to be satisfied with it i know not but will not engage for this that i may after a twelvemonths cohabitation marry you for if my love increases for you as it has done for many months past it will be impossible for me to deny you any thing  and now pamela consider well it is in your power to oblige me on such terms as will make yourself and all your friends happy but this will be over this very day irrevocably over and you shall find all you would be thought to fear without the least benefit arising from it to yourself  and i beg you will well weigh the matter and comply with my proposals and i will instantly set about securing to you the full effect of them and let me if you value yourself experience a grateful return on this occasion and i will forgive all that is past  vii i have not once dared to look so high as to such a proposal as your seventh article contains hence have proceeded all my little abortive artifices to escape from the consinement you have put me in although you promised to be honorable to me your honor well i knew would nor let you stoop to so mean and so unworthy a slave as the poor pamela all i desire is to be permitted to return to my native meanness unviolated what have i done sir to deserve it should be otherwise for the obtaining of this though i would not have married your chaplain yet would i have run away with your meanest servant if i had thought i could have got safe to my beloved poverty i heard you once say sir that a certain great commander who could live upon lentils might well refuse the bribes of the greatest monarch and i hope as i can contentedly live at the meanest rate and think not myself above the lowest condition that i am also above making an exchange of my honesty for all the riches of the indies when i come to be proud and vain of gaudy apparel and outside finery then which i hope will never be may i rest my principal good in such vain trinkets and despise for them the more solid ornaments of a good fame and a chastity inviolate  give me leave to say sir in answer to what you hint that you may in a twelvemonths time marry me on the continuance of my good behavior that this weighs less with me if possible than any thing else you have said for in the first place there is an end of all merit and all good behavior on my side if i have now any the moment i consent to your proposals and i should be so far from expecting such an honor that i will pronounce that i should be most unworthy of it what sir would the world say were you to marry your harlot  that a gentleman of your rank in life should stoop not only to the baseborn pamela but to a baseborn prostitute  little sir as i know of the world i am not to be caught by a bait so poorly covered as this  yet after all dreadful is the thought that i a poor weak friendless unhappy creature am too fully in your power but permit me sir to pray as i now write on my bended knees that before you resolve upon my ruin you will weigh well the matter hitherto sir though you have taken large strides to this crying sin yet are you on this side the commission of it  when once it is done nothing can recall it and where will be your triumph  what glory will the spoils of such a weak enemy yield you let me but enjoy my poverty with honesty is all my prayer and i will bless you and pray for you every moment of my life think o think before it is yet too late what stings what remorse will attend your dying hour when you come to reflect that you have ruined perhaps soul and body a wretched creature whose only pride was her virtue and how pleased you will be on the contrary if in that tremendous moment you shall be able to acquit yourself of this soul crime and to plead in your own behalf that you suffered the earnest supplications of an unhappy wretch to prevail with you to be innocent your self and let her remain so  may god almighty whose mercy so lately saved you from the peril of perishing in deep waters on which i hope you will give me cause to congratulate you touch your heart in my favor and save you from this sin and me from this ruin  and to him do i commit my cause and to him will i give the glory and night and day pray for you if i may be permitted to escape this great evil  from  your poor oppressed brokenspirited servant   i took a copy of this for your perusal my dear parents if i shall ever be so happy to see you again for i hope my conduct will be approved of by you and at night when sir simon was gone he sent for me down well said he have you considered my proposals yes sir said i i have and there is my answer but pray let me not see you read it is it your bashfulness said he or your obstinacy that makes you not choose i should read it before you  i offered to go away and he said dont run from me i will not read it till you are gone but said he tell me pamela whether you comply with my proposals or not sir said i you will see presently pray dont hold me for he took my hand said he did you well consider before you answered  i did sir said i if it be not what you think will please me said he dear girl take it back again and reconsider it for if i have this as your absolute answer and i dont like it you are undone for i will not sue meanly where i can command i fear said he it is not what i like by your manner and let me tell you that i cannot bear denial if the terms i have offered are not sufficient i will augment them to two thirds of my estate for said he and swore a dreadful oath i cannot live without you and since the thing is gone so far i will not  and so he clasped me in his arms in such a manner as quite frighted me and kissed me two or three times  i got from him and run up stairs and went to the closet and was quite uneasy and fearful  in an hours time he called mr jewkes down to him and i heard him very high in passion and all about poor me and i heard her say it was his own fault there would be an end of all my complaining and perverseness if he was once resolved and other most impudent aggravations i am resolved not to go to bed this night if i can help it  lie still lie still my poor fluttering heart  what will become of me  almost twelve oclock saturday night he sent mrs jewkes about ten oclock to tell me to come to him where said i i will show you said she i went down three or four steps and saw her making to his chamber the door of which was open so i said i cannot go there  dont be foolish said she but come no harm will be done to you  well said i if i die i cannot go there i heard him say let her come or it shall be worse for her i cannot bear said he to speak to her myself  well said i i cannot come indeed i cannot and so i went up again into my closet expecting to be fetched by force  but she came up soon after and bid me make haste tobed said i i will not go tobed this night that is certain  then said she you shall be made to come tobed and nan and i will undress you i knew neither prayers nor tears would move this wicked woman so i said i am sure you will let my master in and i shall be undone mighty piece of undone she said but he was too exasperated against me to be so familiar with me she would assure me  ay said she you will be disposed of another way soon i can tell you for your comfort and i hope your husband will have your obedience though nobody else can have it no husband in the world said i shall make me do an unjust or base thing  she said that would be soon tried and nan coming in what said i am i to have two bedfellows again these warm nights yes said she slipperyones you are till you can have one good one instead of us said i mrs jewkes dont talk nastily to me i see you are beginning again and i shall affront you maybe for next to bad action are bad words for they could not be spoken if they were not in the heart  come to bed purity said she you are a nonsuch i suppose indeed said i i cannot come to bed and it will do you no harm to let me sit all night in the great chair nan said she undress my young lady if she will not let you i will help you and if neither of us can do it quietly well call my master to do it for us tho said she i think it an office worthier of monsieur colebrand  you are very wicked said i i know it said she i am a jezebel and a london prostitute you know you did great feats said i to tell my master all this poor stuff but you did not tell him how you beat me no lambkin said she a word i had not heard a good while that i left for you to tell and you was going to do it if the vultur had not taken the wolfs part and bid the poor innocent lamb be silent  ay said i no matter for your fleers mrs jewkes though i can have neither justice nor mercy here and cannot be heard in my defense yet a time will come maybe when i shall be heard and when your own guilt will strike you dumb  ay spirit said she and the vultur too must we both be dumb why that lambkin will be pretty  then said the wicked one you will have all the talk to your self  then how will the tongue of the pretty lambkin bleat out innocence and virtue and honesty till the whole trial be at an end  youre a wicked woman that is certain said i and if you thought any thing of another world could not talk thus but no wonder  it shows what hands i am got into  ay so it does said she but i beg you will undress and come tobed or i believe your innocence will not keep you from still worse hands i will come tobed said i if you will let me have the keys in my own hand not else if i can help it yes said she and then hey for another contrivance another escape  no no said i all my contrivances are over i will assure you pray let me have the keys and i will come to bed she came to me and took me in her huge arms as if i was a feather said she i do this to show you what a poor resistance you can make against me if i pleased to exert my self and so lambkin dont say to your wolf i will not come to bed  and set me down and tapped me on the neck ah said she thou art a pretty creature it is true but so obstinate so full of spirit if thy strength was but answerable to that thou would run away with us all and this great house too on thy backbut undress undress i tell you  well said i i see my misfortunes make you very merry and very witty too but i will love you if you will humor me with the keys of the chamberdoors  are you sure you will love me said she  now speak your conscience  why said i you must not put it so close neither would you if you thought you had not given reason to doubt it  but i will love you as well as i can  i would not tell a wilful lie and if i did you would not believe me after your hard usage of me well said she that is all fair i own  but nan pray pull off my young ladys shoes and stockens  no pray dont said i i will come tobed presently since i must  and so i went to the closet and scribbled a little about this idle chitchat and she being importunate i was forced to go tobed but with some of my clothes on as the former night and she let me hold the two keys for there are two locks there being a double door and so i got a little sleep that night having had none for two or three nights before  i cannot imagine what she means but nan offered to talk a little once or twice and she snubbd her and said i charge you wench dont open your lips before me and if you are asked any questions by mrs pamela dont answer her one word while i am here  but she is a lordly woman to to the maidservants and that has always been her character o how unlike good mrs jervis in every thing  sunday morning a thought came into my head i meant no harm but it was a little bold for seeing my master dressing to go to church and his chariot getting ready i went to my closet and i writ the prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired for a gentlemen of great worth and honor who labors under a temptation to exert his great power to ruin a poor distressed worthless maiden and also the prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired by a poor distressed creature for the preservation of her virtue and innocence  mrs jewkes came up always writing said she and would see it and strait all that ever i could say carried it down to my master  he looked upon it and said tell her she shall soon see how her prayers are answered she is very bold but as she has rejected all my favors her reckoning for all is not far off i looked after him out of the window and he was charmingly dressed to be sure he is a handsome fine gentleman  what pity his heart is not as good as his appearance why cannot i hate him  but dont be uneasy if you should see this for it is impossible i should love him for his vices all ugly him over as i may say  my master sends word that he shall not come home to dinner i suppose he dines with this sir simon darnford i am much concerned for poor mr williams mrs jewkes says he is confined still and takes on much all his trouble is brought upon him for my sake this grieves me much my master it seems will have his money from him this is very hard for it is three fifty pounds he gave him as he thought as a salary for three years that he has been with him but there was no agreement between them and he absolutely depended on my masters favor to be sure it was the more generous of him to run these risques for the sake of oppressed innocence and i hope he will meet with his reward in due time alas for me i dare not plead for him that would raise my oppressors jealousy more and i have not interest to save myself  sunday evening mrs jewkes has received a line from my master i wonder what it is but his chariot is come home without him but she will tell me nothing so it is in vain to ask her i am so fearful of plots and tricks i know not what to do  every thing i suspect for now my disgrace is avowed what can i think  to be sure the worst will be attempted i can only pour out my soul in prayer to god for his blessed protection but if i must suffer let me not be long a mournful survivor  only let me not shorten my own time sinfully   this woman left upon the table in the chamber this letter of my masters to her and i bolted myself in till i had transcribed it you will see how tremblingly by the lines i wish poor mr williamss release at any rate but this letter makes my heart ache yet i have another days reprieve thank god   mrs jewkes i have been so pressed on williamss affair that i shall set out this afternoon in sir simon chariot and with parson peters who is his intercessor for stamford and shall not be back till tomorrow evening if then as to your ward i am thoroughly incensed against her she has with stood her time and now would she sign and seal to my articles it is too late i shall discover something perhaps by him and will on my return let her know that all her insnaring loveliness shall not save her from the fate that awaits her but let her know nothing of this lest it put her fruitful mind upon plots and artifices besure trust her not without another with you at night lest she venture the window in her foolish rashness for i shall require her at your hands   yours etc   i had but just finished taking a copy of this and laid the letter where i had it and unbolted the door when she came up in a great fright for fear i should have seen it but i being in my closet and that lying as she left it she did not mistrust o said she i was afraid you had seen my masters letter here which i carelessly lest on the table i wish said i i had known that why sure said she if you had you would not have offered to read my letters indeed said i i should at this time if it had been in my way  do let me see it  well said she i wish poor mr williams well off i understand my master is gone to make up matters with him which is very good to be sure added she he is a very good gentleman and very forgiving  why said i as if i had known nothing of the matter how can he make up matters with him is not mr williams at stamford yes said she i believe so but parson peters pleads for him and he is gone with him to stamford and will not be back tonight so we have nothing to do but to eat our suppers betimes and go tobed ay that is pure said i and i shall have good rest this night i hope so said she you might every night but for your own idle fears you are afraid of your friends when none are near you ay that is true said i for i have not one near me  so have i one more good honest night before me what the next may be i know not and so i will try to take in a good deal of sleep while i can be a little easy therefore here i say goodnight my dear parents for i have no more to write about this night and though his letter shocks me yet i will be as bri as i can that she may not suspect i have seen it  tuesday night for the future i will always mistrust most when appearances look fairest o your poor daughter what has she not suffered since what i wrote of sunday night  my worst trial and my fearfullest danger o how i shudder to write you an account of this wicked interval of time for my dear parents will you not be too much frightened and affected with my distress when i tell you that his journey to stamford was all abominable pretense for he came home privately and had well nigh effected all his vile purposes and the ruin of your poor daughter and that by such a plot as i was not in the least apprehensive of and oh you will hear what a vile and unwomanly part that wicked wretch mrs jewkes acted in it  i left off with letting you know how much i was pleased that i had one nights reprieve added to my honesty but i had less occasion to rejoice than ever as you will judge by what i have said already take then the dreadful story as well as i can relate it  the maid nan is a little apt to drink if she can get at liquor and mrs jewkes happened or designed as is too probable to leave a bottle of cherrybrandy in her way and the wench drank some of it more than she should and when she came in to lay the cloth mrs jewkes perceived it and fell a rating at her most sadly for she has too many faults of her own to suffer any of the like sort in any body else if she can help it and she bid her get out of her sight when we had supped and go tobed to sleep off her liquor before we came tobed and so the poor maid went muttering up stairs  about two hours after which was near eleven oclock mrs jewkes and i went up to go tobed i pleasing myself with what a charming night i should have we locked both doors and saw poor nan as i thought for oh twas my abominable master as you shall hear byandby sitting fast asleep in an elbowchair in a dark corner of the room with her apron thrown over her head and neck and mrs jewkes said there is that beast of a wench fast asleep instead of being a bed i knew said she she had taken a fine dose i will wake her said i no dont said she let her sleep on we shall lie better without her ay said i so we shall but will not she get cold  said she i hope you have no writing tonight no replied i i will go tobed with you mrs jewkes said she i wonder what you can find to write about so much and am sure you have better conveniences of that kind and more paper than i am aware of and i had intended to romage you if my master had not come down for i spyd a broken teacup with ink which gave me a suspicion but as he is come let him look after you if he will and if you deceive him it will be his own fault  all this time we were undressing ourselves and i fetched a deep sigh what do you sigh for said she i am thinking mrs jewkes answered i what a sad life i live and how hard is my lot i am sure the thief that has robbed is much better off than i bating the guilt and i should i think take it for a mercy to be hanged out of the way rather than live in these cruel apprehensions so being not sleepy and in a prattling vein i began to give a little history of myself as i did once before to mrs jervis in this manner  here said i were my poor honest parents they took care to instill good principles into my mind till i was almost twelve years of age and taught me to prefer goodness and poverty to the highest condition of life and they confirmed their lessons by their own practice for they were of late years remarkably poor and always as remarkably honest even to a proverb for as honest as goodman andrews was a byeword  well then said i comes my late dear good lady and takes a fancy to me and said she would be the making of me if i was a good girl and she put me to sing to dance to play on the spinnet in order to divert her melancholy hours and also learnt me all manner of fine needle work but still this was her lesson my good pamela be virtuous and keep the men at a distance well so i was i hope and so i did and yet though i say it they all loved me and respected me and would do any thing for me as if i was a gentlewoman  but then what comes next  why it pleased god to take my good lady and then comes my master and what says he  why in effect it is be not virtuous pamela  so here have i lived above sixteen years in virtue and reputation and all at once when i come to know what is good and what is evil i must renounce all the good all the whole sixteen years innocence which next to gods grace i owed chiefly to my parents and my ladys good lessons and examples and choose the evil and so in a moments time become the vilest of creatures and all this for what i pray why truly for a pair of diamond earrings a necklace and a diamond ring for my finger which would not become me for a few paltry fine clothes which when i wore it would make but my former poverty more ridiculous to every body that saw me especially when they knew the base terms i wore them upon but indeed i was to have a great parcel of guineas beside i forget how many for had there been ten times more they would have been not so much to me as the honest six guineas you tricked me out of mrs jewkes  well forsooth but then i was to have i know not how many pounds a year for my life and my poor father there was the jest of it was to be the manager for the abandoned prostitute his daughter and then there was the jest again my kind forgiving virtuous master would pardon me all my misdeeds  yes thank him for nothing truly and what pray are all these violent misdeeds  why they are for daring to adhere to the good lessons that were taught me and not learning a new one that would have reversed all my former for not being contented when i was run away with in order to ruin me but contriving if my poor wits had been able to get out of danger and preserve myself honest  then was he once jealous of poor john though he knew john was his own creature and helped to deceive me  then was he outrageous against poor parson williams and him has this good merciful master thrown into goal and for what why truly for that being a divine and a good man he had the fear of god before his eyes and was willing to forego all his expectations of interest and assist an oppressed poor creature  but to be sure i must be forward bold saucy and what not to dare to run away from certain ruin and to strive to escape from an unjust confinement and i must be married to the parson nothing so sure  he would have had but a poor catch of me had i consented but he and you too know i did not want to marry any body i only wanted to go to my poor parents and to have my own liberty and not to be confined to such an unlawful restraint and which would not be inflicted upon me but only that i am a poor destitute young body and have no friend that is able to right me  so mrs jewkes said i here is my history in brief and i am a very unhappy young creature to be sure  and why am i so  why because my master sees something in my person that takes his present fancy and because i would not be undone  why therefore to choose i must and i shall be undone  and this is all the reason that can be given  she heard me run on all this time while i was undressing without any interruption and i said well i must go to the two closets ever since an affair of the closet at the other house though he is so far off and i have a good mind to wake this poor maid no dont said she i charge you i am very angry with her and she will get no harm there but if she wakes she may come tobed well enough as long as there is a candle in the chimney  so i looked into the closetsand kneeled down in my own as i used to do to say my prayers and this with my under clothes in my hand all undrest and passed by the poor sleeping wench as i thought in my return but oh little did i think it was my wicked wicked master in a gown and petticoat of hers and her apron over his face and shoulders what meannesses will not lucifer make his votaries stoop to to gain their abominable ends  mrs jewkes by this time was got tobed on the further side as she used to be and to make room for the maid when she should awake i got into bed and lay close to her and i said where are the keys though said i i am not so much afraid tonight here said the wicked woman put your arm under mine and you shall find them about my wrist as they used to be so i did and the abominable designer held my hand with her right hand as my rightarm was under her left  in less than a quarter of an hour i said there is poor nan awake i hear her stir let us go to sleep said she and not mind her she will come tobed when she is quite awake poor soul said i i will warrant she will have the headache finely tomorrow for it be silent said she and go to sleep you keep me awake and i never found you in so talkative a humor in my life dont chide me said i i will say but one thing more do you think nan could hear me talk of my masters offers no no said she she was dead asleep i am glad of that said i because i would not expose my master to his common servants and i knew you were no stranger to his fine articles said she i think they were fine articles and you were bewitched you did not close in with them but let us go to sleep so i was silent and the pretended nan o wicked base villainous designer what a plot what an unexpected plot was this seemed to be awaking and mrs jewkes abhorred creature said come nan  what are you awake at last prythee come tobed for mrs pamela is in a talking fit and will not go to sleep one while  at that the pretended she came to the bed side and sitting down in a chair where the curtain hid her began to undress said i poor mrs ann i warrant your head aches most sadly how do you do  she answered not one word said the superlatively wicked woman you know i have ordered her not to answer you and this plot to be sure was laid when she gave her these orders the night before  i heard her as i thought breathe all quick and short indeed said i mrs jewkes the poor maid is not well what ails you mrs ann and still no answer was made  but i tremble to relate it the pretended she came into bed but quiverd like an aspenleaf and i poor fool that i was pitied her much  but well might the barbarous deceiver tremble at his vile dissimulation and base designs  what words shall i find my dear mother for my father should not see this shocking part to describe the rest and my confusion when the guilty wretch took my left arm and laid it under his neck as the vile procuress held my right and then he clasped me round my waist  said i is the wench mad why how now confidence thinking still it had been nan but he kissed me with frightful vehemence and then his voice broke upon me like a clap of thunder now pamela said he is the dreadful time of reckoning come that i have threatened  i screamd out in such a manner as never any body heard the like but there was nobody to help me and both my hands were secured as i said sure never poor soul was in such agonies as i wicked man said i wicked abominable woman o god my god this time this one time deliver me from this distress or strike me dead this moment and then i screamd again and again  says he one word with you pamela one word hear me but and hitherto you see i offer nothing to you is this nothing said i to be in bed here to hold my hands between you i will hear if you will instantly leave the bed and take this villainous woman from me  said she o disgrace of womankind what you do sir do dont stand dillydallying she cannot exclaim worse than she has done and she will be quieter when she knows the worst  silence said he to her i must say one word to you pamela it is this you see now you are in my power  you cannot get from me nor help yourself yet have i not offered any thing amiss to you but if you resolve not to comply with my proposals i will not lose this opportunity if you do i will yet leave you  o sir said i leave me leave me but and i will do any thing i ought to do  swear then to me said he that you will accept my proposals  and then for this was all detestable grimace he put his hand in my bosom with struggling fright terror i fainted away quite and did not come to myself soon so that they both from the cold sweats that i was in thought me dying  and i remember no more than that when with great difficulty they brought me to myself she was sitting on one side of the bed with her clothes on and he on the other with his and in his gown and slippers  your poor pamela cannot answer for the liberties taken with her in her deplorable state of death and when i saw them there i sat up in my bed without any regard to what appearance i made and nothing about my neck and he soothing me with an aspect of pity and concern i put my hand to his mouth and said o tell me yet tell me not what i have suffered in this distress and i talked quite wild and knew not what for to be sure i was on the point of distraction  he most solemnly and with a bitter imprecation vowed that he had not offered the least indecency that he was frightened at the terrible manner i was taken with the fit that he would desist from his attempt and begged but to see me easy and quiet and he would leave me directly and go to his own bed o then said i take from me this most wicked woman this vile mrs jewkes as an earnest that i may believe you  and will you sir said the wicked wretch for a fit or two give up such an opportunity as this  i thought you had known the sex better  she is now you see quite well again  this i heard more she might say but i fainted away once more at these words and at his clasping his arms about me again and when i came a little to myself i saw him sit there and the maid nan holding a smellingbottle to my nose and no mrs jewkes  he said taking my hand now will i vow to you my dear pamela that i will leave you the moment i see you better and pacified here is nan knows and will tell you my concern for you i vow to god i have not offered any indecency to you and since i found mrs jewkes so offensive to you i have sent her to the maids bed and the maid shall lie with you tonight and but promise me that you will compose yourself and i will leave you but said i will not nan also hold my hand and will not she let you come in again to me  he said by heaven i will not come in again tonight nan undress yourself go tobed and do all you can to comfort the dear creature and now pamela said he give me but your hand and say you forgive me and i will leave you to your repose i held out my trembling hand which he vouchsafed to kiss and i said god forgive you sir as you have been just in my distress and as you will be just to what you promise and he withdrew with a countenance of remorse as i hoped and she shut the doors and at my request brought the keys tobed  this o my dear parents was a most dreadful trial i tremble still to think of it and dare not recall all the horrid circumstances of it i hope as he assures me he was not guilty of indecency but have reason to bless god who by disabling me in my faculties enabled me to preserve my innocence and when all my strength would have signified nothing magnified himself in my weakness  i was so weak all day on monday that i lay abed my master showed great tenderness for me and i hope he is really sorry and that this will be his last attempt but he does not say so neither  he came in the morning as soon as he heard the door open and i began to be fearful he stopped short of the bed and said rather than give you apprehensions i will come no further i said your honor sir and your mercy is all i have to beg he sat himself on the side of the bed and asked kindly how i did  begged me to be composed said i still looked a little wildly and i said pray good sir let me not see this infamous mrs jewkes i doubt i cannot bear her sight she shall not come near you all this day if you will promise to compose yourself then sir i will try he pressed my hand very tenderly and went out what a change does this show  o may it be lasting but alas he seems only to have altered his method of proceeding but retains i doubt his wicked purpose  on tuesday about ten oclock when my master heard i was up he sent for me down into the parlour when i came he said come nearer to me pamela i did so and he took my hand and said you begin to look well again i am glad of it you little slut how did you frighten me on sunday night  sir said i pray name not that night and my eyes overflowed at the remembrance and i turned my head aside  said he place some little confidence in me i know what those charming eyes mean and you shall not need to explain yourself for i do assure you that as soon as i saw you change and a cold sweat bedew your pretty face and you fainted away i quitted the bed and mrs jewkes did so too and i put on my gown and she fetched her smellingbottle and we did all we could to restore you and my passion for you was all swallowed up in the concern i had for your recovery for i thought i never saw a fit so strong and violent in my life and feared we should not bring you to life again for what i saw you in once before was nothing to it this said he might be my folly and my unacquaintedness with what your sex can show when they are in earnest but this i repeat to you that your mind may be entirely comforted  all i offered to you and that i am sure was innocent was before you fainted away  sir said i that was very bad and it was too plain you had the worst designs when said he i tell you the truth in one instance you may believe me in the other i know not i declare beyond this lovely bosom your sex but that i did intend what you call the worst is most certain and though i would not too much alarm you now i could curse my weakness and my folly which makes me own that i love you beyond all your sex and cannot live without you but if i am master of myself and my own resolution i will not attempt to force you to any thing again sir said i you may easily keep your resolution if you will send me out of your way to my poor parents that is all i beg  it is a folly to talk of it said he you must not shall not go and if i could be assured you would not attempt it you should have better usage and your confinement should be made easier to you but to what end sir am i to stay said i you yourself seem not sure you can keep your own present good resolutions and do you think if i was to stay when i could get away and be safe it would not look as if either i confided too much in my own strength or would tempt my ruin and as if i was not in earnest to wish myself safe and out of danger  and then how long am i to stay and to what purpose and in what light must i appear to the world would not that censure me although i might be innocent and you will allow sir that if there be any thing valuable or exemplary in a good name or fair reputation one must not despise the worlds censure if one can avoid it  well said he i sent not for you on this account just now but for two reasons the first is that you promise me that for a fortnight to come you will not offer to go away without my express consent and this i expect for your own sake that i may give you a little more liberty and the second is that you will see and forgive mrs jewkes she takes on much and thinks that as all her fault was her obedience to me it would be very hard to sacrifice her as she calls it to your resentment  as to the first sir said i it is a hard injunction for the reasons i have mentioned and as to the second considering her vile unwomanly wickedness and her endeavors to instigate you more to ruin me when your returning goodness seemed to have some compassion upon me it is still harder but to show my obedience to your commands for you know my dear parents i might as well make a merit of my compliance when my refusal would stand me in no stead i will consent to both and to every thing else that you shall be pleased to injoin which i can do with innocence  that is my good girl said he and kissed me this is quite prudent and shows me that you dont take insolent advantage of my favor for you and will perhaps stand you in more stead than you are aware of  so he rung the bell and said call down mrs jewkes she came down and he took my hand and put it into hers and said mrs jewkes i am obliged to you for all your diligence and fidelity to me but pamela i must own is not because the service i employed you in was not so very obliging to her as i could have wished she would have thought it and you were not to favor her but obey me but yet i will assure you at the very first word she has once obliged me by consenting to be friends with you and if she gives me no great cause i shall not perhaps put you on such disagreeable service again  now therefore be you once more bedfellows and boardfellows as i may say for some days longer and see that pamela sends no letters nor messages out of the house nor keeps a correspondence unknown to me especially with that williams and as for the rest show the dear girl all the respect that is due to one i must love if she will deserve it as i hope she will yet and let her be under no unnecessary or harsh restraints but your watchful care is not however to cease and remember that you are not to disoblige me to oblige her and that i will not cannot yet part with her  mrs jewkes looked very sullen and as if she would be glad still to do me a good turn if it lay in her power  i took courage then to drop a word or two for poor mr williams but he was angry with me for it and said he could not endure to hear his name in my mouth so i was forced to have done for that time  all this time my papers that i had buried under the rosebush lay there still and i begged for leave to send a letter to you so i should he said if he might read it first but this did not answer my design and yet i would have sent you such a letter as he might see if i had been sure my danger was over but that i cannot for he now seems to take another method and what i am more afraid of because maybe he may watch an opportunity and join force with it on occasion when i am least prepared for now he seems to abound with kindness and talks of love without reserve and makes nothing of allowing himself in the liberty of kissing me which he calls innocent but which i do not like and especially in the manner he does it but for a master to do it at all to a servant has meaning too much in it not to alarm an honest body  wednesday morning i find i am watched and suspected still very close and i wish i was with you but that must not be it seems this fortnight i dont like this fortnight and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to me i doubt  my master just now sent for me down to take a walk with him in the garden but i like him not at all nor his ways for he would have all the way his arm about my waist and said abundance of fond things to me enough to make me proud if his design had not been apparent after walking about he led me into a little alcove on the further part of the garden and really made me afraid of myself for he began to be very tiezing and made me sit on his knee and was so often kissing me that i said sir i dont like to be here at all i assure you indeed you make me afraid  and what made me the more so was what he once said to mrs jewkes and did not think i heard him and which though always uppermost with me i did not mention before because i did not know how to bring it in in my writing  she i suppose had been encouraging him in his wickedness for it was before the last dreadful trial and i only heard what he answered  said he i will try once more but i have begun wrong for i see terror does but add to her frost but she is a charming girl and may be thawed by kindness and i should have melted her by love instead of freezing her by fear  is he not a wicked sad man for this  to be sure i blush while i write it but i trust that that god who has delivered me from the paw of the lion and the bear that is his and mrs jewkess violences will also deliver me from this philistine myself and my own infirmities that i may not defy the commands of the living god  but as i was saying this expression coming into my thoughts i was of opinion i could not be too much on my guard at all times more especially when he took such liberties for he professed honor all the time with his mouth while his actions did not correspond i begged and prayed he would let me go and had i not appeared quite regardless of all he said and resolved not to stay if i could help it i know not how far he would have proceeded for i was forced to fall down upon my knees  at last he walked out with me still bragging of his honor and his love yes yes sir said i your honor is to destroy mine and your love is to ruin me i see it too plainly but indeed i will not walk with you sir said i any more do you know said he whom you talk to and where you are  you may believe i had reason to think him not so decent as he should be for i said as to where i am sir i know it too well and that i have no creature to befriend me and as to who you are sir let me ask you what you would have me answer  why tell me said he what answer you would make it will only make you angry said i and so i shall fare worse if possible i will not be angry said he why then sir said i you cannot be my late good ladys son for she loved me and taught me virtue you cannot then be my master for no master demeans himself so to his poor servant  he put his arm round me and his other hand on my neck which made me more angry and bold and he said what then am i why said i struggling from him and in a great passion to be sure you are lucifer himself in the shape of my master or you could not use me thus these are too great liberties said he in anger and i desire that you will not repeat them for your own sake for if you have no decency toward me i will have none to you  i was running from him and he said come back when i bid you  so knowing every place was alike dangerous to me and i had nobody to run to i came back at his call and seeing him look displeased i held my hands together and wept and said pray sir forgive me no said he rather say pray lucifer forgive me and now since you take me for the devil how can you expect any good from me  how rather can you expect any thing but the worst treatment from me  you have given me a character pamela and blame me not that i act up to it  sir said i let me beg you to forgive me i am really sorry for my boldness but indeed you dont use me like a gentleman and how can i express my resentment if i mince the matter while you are so indecent  precise fool said he what indecencies have i offered you  i was bewitched i had not gone through my purpose last sunday night and then your licentious tongue had not given the worst name to little puny freedoms that show my love and my folly at the same time but begone said he taking my hand and tossing it from him and learn another conduct and more wit and i will lay aside my foolish regard for you and assert myself begone said he again with a haughty air  indeed sir said i i cannot go till you pardon me which i beg on my bended knees i am truly sorry for my boldness  but i see how you go on you creep by little and little upon me and now sooth me and now threaten me and if i should forbear to show my resentment when you offer incivilities to me would not that be to be lost by degrees would it not show that i could bear any thing from you if i did not express all the indignation i could express at the first approaches you make to what i dread and have you not as good as avowed my ruin  and have you once made me hope you will quit your purposes against me how then sir can i act but by showing my abhorrence of every step that makes toward my undoing and what is left me but words  and can these words be other than such strong ones as shall show the detestation which from the bottom of my heart i have for every attempt upon my virtue judge for me sir and pardon me  pardon you said he what when you dont repent  when you have the boldness to justify yourself in your fault why dont you say you never will again offend me i will endeavor sir said i always to preserve that decency toward you which becomes me but really sir i must beg your excuse for saying that when you forget what belongs to decency in your actions and when words are all that are left me to show my resentment of such actions i will not promise to forbear the strongest expressions that my distressed mind shall suggest to me nor shall your angriest frowns deter me when my honesty is in question  what then said he do you beg pardon for where is the promise of amendment for which i should forgive you indeed sir said i i own that must absolutely depend on your usage of me for i will bear any thing you can inflict upon me with patience even to the laying down of my life to show my obedience to you in other cases but i cannot be patient i cannot be passive when my virtue is at stake  it would be criminal in me if i was  he said he never saw such a fool in his life and he walked by the side of me some yards without saying a word and seemed vexed and at last walked in bidding me attend him in the garden after dinner so having a little time i went up and wrote thus far  wednesday night if my dear parents i am not destined more surely than ever for ruin i have now more comfort before me than ever i yet knew and am either nearer my happiness or my misery than ever i was god protect me from the latter if it be his blessed will i have now such a scence to open to you that i know will alarm both your hopes and your fears as it does mine and this it is  after my master had dined he took a turn into the stables to look at his stud of horses and when he came in he opened the parlourdoor where mrs jewkes and i sat at dinner and at his entrance we both rose up but he said sit still sit still and let me see how you eat your victuals pamela o said mrs jewkes very poorly sir i will assure you no said i pretty well sir considering none of your considerings said hepretty face and tappd me on the cheek i blushed but was glad he was so goodhumored but i could not tell how to sit before him nor to behave myself so he said i know pamela you are a nice carver my mother used to say so my lady sir said i was very good to me in every thing and would always make me do the honors of her table for her when she was with her few select friends that she loved cut up said he that chicken i did so now said he and took a knife and fork and put a wing upon my plate let me see you eat that o sir said i i have eat a whole breast of a chicken already and cannot eat so much but he said i must eat it for his sake and he would learn me to eat heartily so i did eat it but was much confused at his so kind and unusual freedom and condescension and good sirs you cannot imagine how mrs jewkes looked and stard and how respectful she seemed to me and called me good madam i will assure you urging me to take a little bit of tart  my master took two or three turns about the room musing and thoughtful as i had never before seen him and at last he went out saying i am going into the garden you know pamela what i said to you before dinner i rose and curtsyd saying i would attend his honor and he said do good girl  well said mrs jewkes i see how things will go o madam as she called me again i am sure you are to be our mistress and then i know what will become of me ah mrs jewkes said i if i can but keep myself virtuous it is the most of my ambition and i hope no temptation shall make me otherwise  nothwithstanding i had no reason to be pleased with his treatment of me before dinner yet i made haste to attend him and i found him walking by the side of that pond which for want of grace and through a sinful despondence had like to have been so fatal to me and the sight of which ever since has been a trouble and reproach to me and it was by the side of this pond and not far from the place where i had that dreadful conflict that my present hopes if i am not to be deceived again began to dawn which i presume to flatter myself with being an happy omen for me as if god almighty would show your poor sinful daughter how well i did to put my affiance in his goodness and not to throw away myself because my ruin seemed inevitable to my shortsighted apprehension  so he was pleased to say well pamela i am glad you are come of your own accord as i may say give me your hand i did so and he looked at me very steadily and pressing my hand all the time at last said i will now talk to you in a serious manner  you have a great deal of wit a great deal of penetration much beyond your years and as i thought your opportunities you are possessed of an open frank and generous mind and a person so lovely that you excel all your sex in my eyes all these accomplishments have engaged my affections so deeply that as i have often said i cannot live without you and i would divide with all my soul my estate with you to make you mine upon my own terms these you have absolutely rejected and that though in saucy terms enough yet in such a manner as makes me admire you more your pretty chitchat to mrs jewkes the last sunday night so innocent and so full of beautiful simplicity half disarmed my resolutions before i approached your bed and i see you so watchful over your virtue that though i hoped to find it otherwise i cannot but say my passion for you is increased by it but now what shall i say further pamela  i will make you though a party my adviser in this matter though not perhaps my definitive judge  you know i am not a very abandoned profligate i have hitherto been guilty of no very enormous or vile actions this of seizing you and confining you thus may perhaps be one of the worst at least to persons of real innocence had i been utterly given up to my passions i should before now have gratified them and not have shown that remorse and compassion for you which have reprieved you more than once when absolutely in my power and you are as inviolate a virgin as you were when you came into my house  but what can i do consider the pride of my condition i cannot endure the thought of marriage even with a person of equal or superior degree to myself and have declined several proposals of that kind how then with the distance between us and in the worlds judgment can i think of making you my wife  yet i must have you i cannot bear the thoughts of any other man supplanting me in your affections and the very apprehension of that has made me hate the name of williams and use him in a manner unworthy of my temper  now pamela judge for me and since i have told you thus heartily my mind and i see yours is big with some important meaning by your eyes your blushes and that sweet confusion which i behold struggling in your bosom tell me with like openness and candor what you think i ought to do and what you would have me do   it is impossible for me to express the agitations of my mind on this unexpected declaration so contrary to his former behavior his manner too had something so noble and so sincere as i thought that alas for me i found i had need of all my poor discretion to ward off the blow which this treatment gave to my most guarded thoughts i threw myself at his feet for i trembled and could hardly stand o sir said i spare your poor servants confusion o spare the poor pamela  speak out said he and tell me what i bid you what you think i ought to do i cannot say what you ought to do answered i but i only beg you will not ruin me and if you think me virtuous if you think me sincerely honest let me go to my poor parents i will vow to you that i will never suffer myself to be engaged without your approbation  still he insisted upon a more explicit answer to his question of what i thought he ought to do and i said as to my poor thoughts of what you ought to do i must needs say that indeed i think you ought to regard the worlds opinion and avoid doing any thing disgraceful to your birth and fortune and therefore if you really honor the poor pamela with your respect a little time absence and the conversation of worthier persons of my sex will effectually enable you to overcome a regard so unworthy of your condition and this good sir is the best advice i can offer  charming creature lovely pamela said he with an ardor that was never before so agreeable to me this generous manner is of a piece with all the rest of your conduct but tell me still more explicitly what you would advise me to in the case  o sir said i take not advantage of my credulity and these my weak moments but were i the first lady in the land instead of the poor abject pamela i would i could tell you but i can say no more   o my dear father and mother now i know you will indeed be concerned for me  for now i am for myself  and now i begin to be afraid i know too well the reason why all his hard trials of me and my black apprehensions would not let me hate him  but be assured still by gods grace that i shall do nothing unworthy of your pamela and if i find that he is still capable of deceiving me and that this conduct is only put on to delude me more i shall think nothing in this world so vile and so odious and nothing if he be not the worst of his kind as he says and i hope he is not so desperately guileful as the heart of man  he generously said i will spare your confusion pamela but i hope i may promise myself that you can love me preferably to any other man and that no one in the world has had any share in your affections for i am very jealous of what i love and if i thought you had a secret whispering in your soul that had not yet come up to a wish for any other man breathing i should not forgive myself to persist in my affection for you nor you if you did not frankly acquaint me with it  as i still continued on my knees on the grass slope by the pondside he sat himself down on the grass by me and took me in his arms why hesitates my pamela said he  can you not answer me with truth as i wish if you cannot speak and i will forgive you  o good sir said i it is not that indeed it is not but a frightful word or two that you said to mrs jewkes when you thought i was not in hearing comes cross my mind and makes me dread that i am in more danger than ever i was in my life  you have never found me a common liar said he too fearful and foolish pamela nor will i answer how long i may hold in my present mind for my pride struggles hard within me i will assure you and if you doubt me i have no obligation to your confidence or opinion but at present i am really sincere in what i say and i expect you will be so too and answer directly my question  i find sir said i i know not myself and your question is of such a nature that i only want to tell you what i heard and to have your kind answer to it or else what i have to say to your question may pave the way to my ruin and show a weakness that i did not believe was in me  well said he you may say what you have overheard for in nor answering me directly you put my soul upon the rack and half the trouble i have had with you would have brought to my arms the finest lady in england  o sir said i my virtue is as dear to me as if i was of the highest quality and my doubts for which you know i have had too much reason have made me troublesome but now sir i will tell you what i heard which has given me great uneasiness  you talked to mrs jewkes of having begun wrong with me in trying to subdue me with terror and of frost and suchlike  you remember it well  and that you would for the future change your conduct and try to melt me that was your word by kindness  i fear not sir the grace of god supporting me that any acts of kindness would make me forget what i owe to my virtue but sir i may i find be made more miserable by such acts than by terror because my nature is too frank and open to make me wish to be ungrateful and if i should be taught a lesson i never yet learnt with what regret should i descend to the grave to think that i could not hate my undoer and that at the last great day i must stand up as an accuser of the poor unhappy soul that i could wish it in my power to save  exalted girl said he what a thought is that  why now pamela you excel your self you have given me a hint that will hold me long but sweet creature said he tell me what is this lesson which you never yet learnt and which you are so afraid of learning  if sir said i you will again generously spare my confusion i need not say it but this i will say in answer to the question you seem most solicitous about that i know not the man breathing that i would wish to be married to or that ever i thought of with such a hope i had brought my mind so to love poverty that i hoped for nothing but to return to the best though the poorest of parents and to employ myself in serving god and comforting them and you know not sir how you disappointed my hopes and my proposed honest pleasures when you sent me hither  well then said he i may promise myself that neither the parson nor any other man is any the least secret motive to your steadfast refusal of my offers indeed sir said i you may and as you was pleased to ask i answer that i have not the least shadow of a wish or thought for any man living  but said he for i am foolishly jealous and yet it shows my fondness for you have you not encouraged williams to think you will have him indeed sir said i i have not but the very contrary and would you not have had him said he if you had got away by his means i had resolved sir said i in my mind otherwise and he knew it and the poor man  i charge you said he say not a word in his favor you will excite a whirlwind in my soul if you name him with kindness and then you will be borne away with the tempest  sir said i i have done  nay said he but do not have done let me know the whole if you have any regard for him speak out for it would end fearfully for you for me and for him if i found that you disguised any secret of your soul from me in this nice particular  sir said i if i have ever given you cause to think me sincere  say then said he interrupting me with great vehemence and taking both my hands between his say that you now in the presence of god declare that you have not any the most hidden regard for williams or any other man  sir said i i do as god shall bless me and preserve my innocence i have not well said he i will believe you pamela and in time perhaps i may better bear that mans name and if i am convinced that you are not prepossessed my vanity makes me assured that i need not to fear a place in your esteem equal if not preferable to any man in england but yet it stings my pride to the quick that you was so easily brought and at such a short acquaintance to run away with that college novice  o good sir said i may i be heard one thing and though i bring upon me your highest indignation i will tell you perhaps the unnecessary and imprudent but yet the whole truth  my honesty i am poor and lowly and am not entitled to call it honor was in danger i saw no means of securing myself from your avowed attempts you had showed you would not stick at little matters and what sir could any body have thought of my sincerity in preferring that to all other considerations if i had not escaped from these dangers if i could have found any way for it  i am not going to say any thing for him but indeed indeed sir i was the cause of putting him upon assisting me in my escape i got him to acquaint me what gentry there were in the neighborhood that i might fly to and prevailed upon him  dont frown at me good sir for i must tell you the whole truth  to apply to one lady jones to lady darnford and he was so good to apply to mr peters the minister but they all refused me and then it was he let me know that there was no honorable way but marriage that i declined and he agreed to assist me for gods sake  now said he you are going  i boldly put my hand before his mouth hardly knowing the liberty i took pray sir said i dont be angry i have just done  i would only say that rather than have staid to be ruined i would have thrown myself upon the poorest beggar that ever the world saw if i thought him honest  and i hope when you duly weigh all matters you will forgive me and not think me so bold and so forward as you have been pleased to call me  well said he even in this your last speech which let me tell you shows more your honesty of heart than your prudence you have not overmuch pleased me but i must love you and that vexes me not a little but tell me pamela for now the former question recurs since you so much prize your honor and your virtue since all attempts against that are so odious to you and since i have avowedly made several of these attempts do you think it is possible for you to love me preferably to any other of my sex  ah sir said i and here my doubt recurs that you may thus graciously use me to take advantage of my credulity  still perverse and doubting said he cannot you take me as i am at present and that i have told you is sincere and undesigning whatever i may be hereafter   ah sir replied i what can i say  i have already said too much if this dreadful hereafter should take place dont bid me say how well i can  and then my face glowing as the fire i all abashed leaned upon his shoulder to hide my confusion  he clasped me to him with great ardour and said hide your dear face in my bosom my beloved pamela your innocent freedoms charm me  but then say how well  what  if you will be good said i to your poor servant and spare her i cannot say too much but if not i am doubly undone  undone indeed  said he i hope my present temper will hold for i tell you frankly that i have known in this agreeable hour more sincere pleasure than i have experienced in all the guilty tumults that my desiring soul put me into in the hopes of possessing you on my own terms and pamela you must pray for the continuance of this temper and i hope your prayers will get the better of my temptations  this sweet goodness overpowered all my reserves i threw myself at his feet and embraced his knees what pleasure sir you give me at these gracious words is not lent your poor servant to express  i shall be too much rewarded for all my sufferings if this goodness hold god grant it may for your own souls sake as well as mine and oh how happy should i be if   he stopped me and said but my dear girl what must we do about the world and the worlds censure  indeed i cannot marry  now was i again struck all of a heap however soon recollecting myself sir said i i have not the presumption to hope such an honor if i may be permitted to return in peace and safety to my poor parents to pray for you there it is all i at present request this sir after all my apprehensions and dangers will be a great pleasure to me and if i know my own poor heart i shall wish you happy in a lady of suitable degree and rejoice most sincerely in every circumstance that shall make for the happiness of my late good ladys most beloved son  well said he this conversation pamela is gone farther than i intended it you need not be afraid at this rate of trusting yourself with me but it is i that ought to be doubtful of myself when i am with you  but before i say any thing further on this subject i will take my proud heart to task and till then let every thing be as if this conversation had never passed only let me tell you that the more confidence you place in me the more you will oblige me but your doubts will only beget cause of doubts and with this ambiguous saying he saluted me in a more formal manner if i may so say than before and lent me his hand and so we walked toward the house sidebyside he seeming very thoughtful and pensive as if he had already repented him of his goodness  what shall i do what steps take if all this be designing  o the perplexities of these cruel doubtings  to be sure if he be false as i may call it i have gone too far much too far  i am ready on the apprehension of this to bite my forward tongue or rather to beat my more forward heart that dictated to that poor machine for what i have said but sure at least he must be sincere for the time  he could not be such a practiced dissembler  if he could o how desperately wicked is the heart of man  and where could he learn all these barbarous arts  if so it must be native surely to the sex  but silent be my rash censurings be hushed ye stormy tumults of my disturbed mind for have i not a father who is a man  a man who knows no guile who would do no wrong  who would not deceive or oppress to gain a kingdom  how then can i think it is native to the sex and i must also hope my good ladys son cannot be the worst of men  if he is hard the lot of the excellent woman that bore him  but much harder the hap of your poor pamela who has fallen into such hands  but yet i will trust in god and hope the best and so lay down my tired pen for this time  the end of vol i
