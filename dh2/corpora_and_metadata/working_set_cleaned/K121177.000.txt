the doubledealer comedy as it is acted at the theater royal by their majestys servants  written by mr congreve  interdum tamen and vocem comedia tollit  ar po huic equidem consilio palmam do hic me magnifice effero qui vim tantam in me and potestatem habeam tantae astutiae vera dicendo ut eos ambos fallam sir in terent  the second edition  london printed for jacob tonson  grays inn lane   0   to the right honorable charles montagve one of the lords of the treasury sir i heartily wish this play  as perfect as i intended it that it might be more worthy your acceptance and that my dedication of it to you might be more becoming that honor and esteem which i with every body who are so fortunate as to know you have for you it had your countenance when yet unknown and now it is made public it wants your protection  i would not have any body imagine that i think  without  faults for i am conscious of several i confess i designed whatever vanity or ambition occasioned that design to have written a true and regular comedy but i found it an undertaking which put me in mind of  sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem and now to make amends for the vanity of such a design i do confess both the attempt and the imperfect performance yet i must take the boldness to say i have not miscarried in the whole for the mechanical part of it is perfect that i may say with as little vanity as a builder may say he has built a house according to the model laid down before him or a gardener that he has set his flowers in a knot of such or such a figure i designed the moral first and to that moral i invented the fable and do not know that i have borrowed one hint of it any where i made the plot as strong as i could because it was single and i made it single because i would avoid confusion and was resolved to preserve the three unities of the drama which i have visibly done to the utmost severity this is what i ought not to observe upon my self but the ignorance and malice of the greater part of the audience is such that they would make a man turn herald to his own play and blazon every character however sir this discourse is very impertinent to you whose judgment much better can discern the faults than i can excuse them and whose good nature like that of a lover will find out those hidden beauties if there are any such which it would be great immodesty for me to discover i think i dont speak improperly when i call you a lover of poetry for it is very well known she has been a very kind mistress to you she has not denied you the last favor you have enjoyed her and she has been fruitful in a most beautiful issue  if i break off abruptly here i hope every body will understand that it is to avoid a commendation which as it is your due would be most easy for me to pay and too troublesome for you to receive  i have since the acting of this play harkend after the objections which have been made to it for i was conscious where a true critic might have put me upon my defense i was prepared for their attack and am pretty confident i could have vindicated some parts and excused others and where there were any plain miscarriages i would most ingenuously have confessed em but i have not heard any thing said sufficient to provoke an answer that which looks most like an objection does not relate in particular to this play but to all or most that ever have been written and that is soliloquy therefore i will answer it not only for my own sake but to save others the trouble to whom it may hereafter be objected  i grant that for a man to talk to himself appears absurd and unnatural and indeed it is so in most cases but the circumstances which may attend the occasion make great alteration it oftentimes happens to a man to have designs which require him to himself and in their nature cannot admit of a confident such for certain is all villainy and other less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be communicated to a second person in such a case therefore the audience must observe whether the person upon the stage takes any notice of them at all or no for if he supposes any one to be by when he talks to himself it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree nay not only in this case but in any part of a play if there is expressed any knowledge of an audience it is insufferable but otherwise when a man in soliloquy reasons with himself and pros and cons and weighs all his designs we ought not to imagine that this man either talks to us or to himself he is only thinking and thinking such matter as were inexcusable folly in him to speak but because we are concealed spectators of the plot in agitation and the poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole mystery of his contrivance he is willing to inform us of this persons thoughts and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of speech no other better way being yet invented for the communication of thought  another very wrong objection has been made by some who have not taken leisure to distinguish the characters the hero of the play as they are pleased to call him meaning mellefont is a gull and made a fool and cheated is every man a gull and a fool that is deceived at that rate i am afraid the two classes of men will be reduced to one and the knaves themselves be at a loss to justify their title but if an openhearted honest man who has an entire confidence in one whom he takes to be his friend and whom he has obliged to be so and who to confirm him in his opinion in all appearance and upon several trials has been so if this man be deceived by the treachery of the other must he of necessity commence fool immediately only because the other has proved a villam ay but there was caution given to mellefont in the first act by his friend careless of what nature was that caution only to give the audience some light into the character of maskwell before his appearance and not to convince mellefont of his treachery for that was more than careless was then able to do he never knew maskwell guilty of any villainy he was only a sort of man which he did not like as for his suspecting his familiarity with my lady touchwood let em examine the answer that mellefont makes him and compare it with the conduct of maskwells character through the play  i would begem again to look into the character of maskwell before they accuse mellefont of weakness for being deceived by him for upon summing up the enquiry into this objection it may be found they have mistaken cunning in one character for folly in another  but there is one thing at which i am more concerned than all the false criticisms that are made upon me and that is some of the ladies are offended i am heartily sorry for it for i declare i would rather disoblige all the critics in the world than one of the fair sex they are concerned that i have represented some women vicious and affected how can i help it it is the business of a comic poet to paint the vices and follies of humankind and there are but two sexes male and female men and women which have a title to humanity and if i leave one half of them out the work will be imperfect i should be very glad of an opportunity to make my compliment to those ladies who are offended but they can no more expect it in a comedy than to be tickled by a surgeon when he is letting em blood they who are virtuous or discreet can hardly be offended for such characters as these distinguish them and make their beauties more shining and observed and they who are of the other kind may nevertheless pass for such by seeming not to be displeased or touched with the satire of this comedy thus have they also wrongfully accused me of doing them a prejudice when i have in reality done them a service  i have heard there are some who intend to accuse this play of smuttiness and bawdy but i can hardly believe it because i took a particular care to avoid it and if they find any in it it is of their own making for i did not design it to be so understood but to avoid my saying any thing upon a subject which has been so admirably handled before and for their better instruction i earnestly recommend to their perusal the epistle dedicatory before the plaindealer  you will pardon me sir for the freedom i take of making answers to other people in an epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you but since i intend the play to be so too i hope i may take the more liberty of justifying it where it is in the right  i must now sir declare to the world how kind you have been to my endeavors for in regard of what was well meant you have excused what was ill performed i beg you would continue the same method in your acceptance of this dedication i know no other way of making a return to that humanity you showed in protecting an infant but by enrolling it in your service now that it is of age and come into the world therefore be pleased to accept of this as an acknowledgement of the favor you have shown me and an earnest of the real service and gratitude of  sir your most obliged humble servant william congreve  to my dear friend mr congreve on his comedy called the doubledealer well then the promised hour is come at last the present age of wit obscures the past strong were our syres and as they fought they writ conquering with force of arms and dint of wit theirs was the giant race before

addresses she has endeavored to do me all ill offices with my uncle yet has managed em with that subtilty that to him they have born the face of kindness while her malice like a dark lanthorn only shone upon me where it was directed still it gave me less perplexity to prevent the success of her displeasure than to avoid the importunities of her love and of two evils i thought my self favored in her aversion but whether urged by her despair and the short prospect of time she saw to accomplish her designs whether the hopes of revenge or of her love terminated in the view of this my marriage with cynthia i know not but this morning she surpised me in my bed    care was there ever such a fury it is well nature has not put it into her sexes power to ravish  well bless us  what followed   mel what at first amazed me for i looked to have seen her in all the transports of a slighted and revengeful woman but when i expected thunder from her voice and lightning in her eyes i saw her melted into tears and hushed into a sigh it was long before either of us spoke passion had tied her tongue and amazement mine  in short the consequence was thus she omitted nothing that the most violent love could urge or tender words express which when she saw had  but still i pleaded honor and nearness of blood  the storm i feared at first for  a fury she flew to my sword and  her doing  her self a mischief having  her in a gust of passion she left me and in a resolution confirmed by a thousand curses not to close her eyes till she had seen my ruin   care exquisite woman but what the devil does she think thou have no more sense than to get an heir upon her body to disinherit thy self for as i take it this settlement upon you is with a proviso that your uncle have no children   mel it is so well the service you are to do me will be a pleasure to your self i must get you to engage my lady plyant all this evening that my pious aunt may not work her to her interest and if you chance to secure her to your self you may incline her to mine she is handsome and knows it is very silly and thinks she has sense and has an old fond husband   care i confess a very fair foundation for a lover to build upon   mel for my lord froth he and his wife will be sufficiently taken up with admiring one another and brisks gallantry as they call it i will observe my uncle my self and jack maskwell has

make her a moment uneasy to have her happy hereafter   care so you have manned your works but i wish you may not have the weakest guard where the enemy is strongest   mel maskwell you mean prithee why

nothing in the world but his design to do me service and he endeavors to be well in her esteem that he may be able to effect it   care well i shall be glad to be mistaken but your aunts aversion in her revenge cannot be any way so effectually shown as in bringing forth a child to disinherit you she is handsome and cunning and naturally wanton maskwell is flesh and blood at best and opportunities

but i made love a great while to no purpose   mel why what is the matter she is convinced that i dont care for her   care pox i cannot get an answer from her that does not begin with her honor or her virtue her religion or some such cant then she has told me the whole history of sir pauls nine years courtship how he has lain for whole nights together upon the stairs before her chamber door and that the first favor he received from her was a piece of an old scarlet petticoat for a stomacher which since the day of his marriage he has out of a piece of gallantry converted into a nightcap and wears it still with much solemnity on his anniversary weddingnight   mel that i have seen with the ceremony thereunto belonging  for on that night he creeps in at the beds feet like a gulled bassa that has married a relation of the grand signiors and that night he  his arms at liberty did not she tell you at what distance she keeps  he  at some certain times that is i suppose when she apprehends being with child he never has the privilege of using the familiarity of a husband with his wife he was once given to scrambling with his hands and sprawling in his sleep and ever since she has him swaddled up in blankets and his hands and feet swathed down and so put to bed and there he lies with a great beard like a russian bear upon a drift of snow you are very great with him i wonder he never told you his grievances he will i warrant you   care excessively foolish  but that which gives me most hopes of her is her telling me of the many temptations she has resisted   mel nay then you have her for a womans bragging to a man that she has overcome temptations is an argument that they were weakly offered and a challenge to him to engage her more irresistably it is only an inhancing the price of the commodity by telling you how many customers have underbid her   care nay i dont despair  but still she has a grudging to you  i talked to her the other night at my lord froths masquerade when i am satisfied she knew me and i had no reason to complain of my reception but i find women are not the same barefaced and in masks  and a vizor disguises their inclinations as much as their faces   mel it is a mistake for women may most properly be said to be unmasked when they wear vizors for that secures them from blushing and being out of countenance and next to being in the dark or alone they are most truly themselves in a vizor mask here they come i will leave you ply her close and by and by clap a billet doux into her hand for a woman never thinks a man truly in

will not  because we are both willing we each of us strive to reach the gole and hinder one another in the race i swear it never does well when the parties are so agreed  for when people walk hand in hand there is neither overtaking nor meeting we hunt in couples where we both pursue the same game but forget one another and it is because we are so near that we dont think of coming together   mel

my lady touchwood has no kindness for him and besides i have been informed by mr careless that mellefont had never any thing more than a profound respect  that he has owned himself to be my admirer it is true but he was never so presumptuous to entertain any dishonorable notions of things so that if this be made plain  i dont see how my daughter can in conscience or honor or any thing in the world
