justification by christ alone a fountain of life and comfort declaring that the whole work of mans salvation was accomplished by jesus christ upon the cross in that he took away and healed all his from all sins and presented them to god holy without fault in his sight  by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities isa liii    jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scriptures might be fulfilled he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost john xix    0 in the body of his flesh through death to make you holy and unblameable and without fault in his sight col xxi    being justified by his blood romans v   thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee cant    written by samuel richardson in the year       london printed by john heart in poppingscourt fleet street and sold by j lewis in bartholomewclose near westsmithfield and at the tabernacle mdccxlv  to the reader the point here insisted on is of the greatest moment though the least regarded or rightly understood  many think they truly know it when they have but crude carnal indigested notions of the same which dead faith not purifying their conscience and giving true peace they are obliged to support by past experience frames feelings or works and when they hear those who spiritually understand the mystery of christ talk of living upon christ and being perfectly holy by faith only without these things they imagine we mean to rest contented with such a faith as theirs namely that christ has died to ward off the wrath of god to purchase his favor and as an effect of that to obtain certain inherent qualities and dispositions etc to make us meet for the kingdom of heaven was this our faith it would be certainly requisite to seek after this sort of sanctification and not be at rest without we felt something of it but on the contrary we believe that the bloodshed upon the cross was the very atonement and that that blood has purged put away and blotted out all our sins and that then there was an everlasting righteousness brought in by believing which our hearts and consciences are made as perfectly clean as though we had never sinned in this consists true purity of soul and not in habitual qualities and whosoever are thus made pure and perfect have fellowship with god have the holy ghost have constant peace and are delivered from the dominion of sin they do also bear forth the fruits of righteousness not in order to become more holy either in the sight of god or in their own consciences but because they are perfectly holy through faith and a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit  it is true we have still the vile sinful body which continually disposes the mind to evil but the blood of jesus by purifying the conscience makes us free from sin and as it were destroys the connection i would therefore recommend this little piece to the consideration those who desire to walk in the highway of holiness and remain theirs to serve in the lord jesus christ  william cudworth  justification by christ alone unto him that has loved us and washed away our sins in his own blood rev i   these words contain the virtue fruit and effectualness of christs death and the benefit privilege and happiness of the sons of god by it  in these words we are to consider   the persons whose sins christ washed away and they were all those who were given to christ john        what is he that washed their sins away and that is the lord jesus christ ver     how and by what means he washed them away and that was with his blood it is ascribed to his blood because without blood there is no remission heb     question did christs blood as blood simply so considered effect this work answer no there is something else included in it as appears the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god heb     the word was god the word took flesh john     christ who is god by taking flesh united the elect by his flesh to himself and so became one with god as god and christ are one john         so that the flesh of christ became in an unspeakable manner one with the perfection of the divine and infinite being which was the life and substance of all which lay hid under this vail that is to say his flesh heb  0 0 so that by the power of his divine nature he might make satisfaction in and by the human and by reason of this union there was an infinite value and worth in christs blood therefore it is called the precious blood of christ   pet    yea the blood of god acts  0   so that we may not know christ simply after the flesh but in the flesh and in the spirit together   cor       the time when he washed their sins away which was then when he shed his blood for in his blood they were washed away christs blood and their sins went away together   the ground and cause why he took their sin away was his love which was in himself nothing in us or done by us could move him to die for us  the sum of all is that jesus christ by once offering the sacrifice of himself when he was upon the cross he took away put to an end blotted out and utterly destroyed all the sins of his people for ever and presented them just righteous and holy without spot before god  this will appear to be true if ye consider these several reasons which are proved by plain scriptures    because that was the time which christ was to do this work in seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgressions and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy and after threescore and two weeks shall the messiah be cut off but not for himself and he shall confirm the covenant with many etc dan              which time was at an end when christ died therefore it is said the year of my redeemed is come isa     yea the hour is come says christ john        because christ was ordained of god to take away sins and to present us holy who verily was fore ordained to redeem us with his precious blood   pet      0 for he has made him to be sin for us that knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him   cor     who of god is made unto us wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption   cor   0    because christ was mighty to save therefore he did do this work himself alone who is this that comes from edom with died garments from bozrah that is glorious in his apparel traveling in the greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to save i have trodden the wine press alone and of the people there was none with me i looked and there was none to help therefore my own arm brought salvation unto me isa    so that christ did all this work alone for none else could help then thou spakest in a vision to thy holy one and said i have laid help upon one that is mighty psalm         because christ took flesh on purpose to effect this work wherefore when he came into the world he said sacrifices and offerings thou would not but a body thou have prepared for me in burntofferings and sacrifices for sin thou had no pleasure heb  0    it was the will of god that christ should by the shedding his blood sanctify his by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus once for all heb  0   to       because jesus christ came on purpose to take away our sins etc then said i lo i come to do thy will o god heb  0 he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin   john    once in the end of the world has he appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself heb                 because jesus christ was made a curse for us and suffered all the punishment due to us for sin christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us gal     surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows we did esteem him stricken and smitten of god and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he bare the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors isa       because the scriptures says he has obtained eternal redemption for us having obtained eternal redemption for us heb   in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins col    col     behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world john     and that he has healed us by whose stripes we are healed isa    who his own self bare our sins in his own body by whose stripes we are healed   pet        because it was the promise of god that this work should prosper and that he should justify many by bearing their sins when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he has set judgment on the earth isa       etc see isa      my righteous servant shall justify many for he shall bear their iniquity isa      were these promises fulfilled concerning christ or no surely yea then he has justified his   0 because else christ had not answered the types under the law  adam was a type of christ who was a public person as christ was and as truly the first adam by one act made all that were in him sinners which was true enough so really and truly did christ the second adam by his own act viz the sacrifice of himself he made all that were in him righteous and that is as true see romans     to    and as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one many are made righteous and as by our natural birth we become personally sinners from our sinful root adam so by our spiritual birth or believing we become personally righteous in our righteous branch christ  and as being conceived in sin etc we bear forth sinful fruit in thought word and actions so by being personally righteous in conscience by faith we bear forth good fruit in thought word and actions  as by the first adam condemnation came so by the righteousness of one came upon all unto justification of life the priest was a type of christ who is said to make atonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins before the lord levit    0 christ by his death did present all his people to god without spot or blemish or wrinkle ephesians           in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unreproveable in his sight col     so then i hope they are free from all sin if the scripture says truth as it does  the live goat was a type of christ upon whose head all the transgressions of the children were laid who did bear them and carry them all away into a land not inhabited in the wilderness levit         which were shadows of things to come but the body is christ col         because christ did exceed all the priests and sacrifices under the law for they could not make the comers thereunto perfect but christ the substance of those sacrifices has made his perfect if those sacrifices could have purged them as christ has purged us they should have no more conscience of sin than we have that is none at all because we are for ever fully and freely set free being perfected heb  0 0          the priest under the law made many offerings and yet by all their offerings they could never take away one sin but christ by one offering has taken away all their sins for ever they stood daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which could never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for ever sat down at the right hand of god heb    to    oh what a difference is there betwixt them christ has wonderfully exceeded them therefore this priest this offering is more glorious and happy yea and all the elect are made happy by this perfect effectual glorious offering heb  0     because there needs no more offerings for sin therefore sin is quite gone and remitted now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin heb  0      because there needs none for this one of christ is sufficient     because there can be no more required to be done to make us just and righteous than christ has done for us he has done all that he was required to do to take away sin therefore he has done jesus knowing that all things were accomplished that the scriptures might be fulfilled john       0   cor         because if christ had not fully accomplished what he came to do viz to make us just and righteous he would not have ascended into heaven as he did this man after he had offered one sacrifice sat down at the right hand of god heb   and  0       because the scripture says we are justified by his blood which could not be true if he had not taken away and destroyed all our sins and presented us to god without spot and made peace by the blood of his cross now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight col   0       for this end christ gave himself for his church that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it might be holy without blemish ephesians   therefore the scriptures say all our sins are scattered removed cast behind his back thou have cast all my sins behind thy back isa     they are cast into the depth of the sea mich     as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us psalm  0    this is something but this is not all they are covered whose sin is covered psalm     yet the soul is not satisfied because a thing may have a being that is covered therefore god says they are blotted out i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sin isa      this is more for now they are not they have no being but god can remember that which is not this is answered for god says i wiil not remember thy sins isa      i will remember their sins no more jer      i hope now you are satisfied     because they are holy and without spot therefore christ says of his thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee song    my love my fair one song   0 they are without fault before the throne of god revel     now this could not have been if christ had not in the body of his flesh through death made them so holy and presented them so to god as col        ephesians       because christ says that we are without sin we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world   john     how is christ i pray sure he is without sin for so says the scriptures in him is no sin   john    heb     thus we are now as we are in christ in respect of his righteousness which is ours though it be in him i say this our perfection and happiness is in respect of our justification and as we are in christ for as we are in ourselves simply so considered though we were never out of christ in our bodies in the flesh we are not capable of so great perfection in this life for the apostle says if any man says he has no sin he is a liar and deceives himself   john      but these scriptures are all true therefore we are all fair without fault and spot and we are so as we are in christ and so we were made all this by christ when he died and seeing it must be true also that we have sin and do sin that is as we are in our flesh in our bodies and seeing we are so notwithstanding conversion and faith therefore our believing etc has not made us so perfect and therefore christ upon his cross made us so and so presented us to god col   0        because christ did all that was needful to be done to make us perfect and present us holy for what can be more required to the justification of a sinner before god than to be free from all sin is not he that is no sinner a righteous person must not he that is free from all sin of necessity appear just to him that knows he is so as god does it is all one to be free from sin and to be perfectly righteous   cor       john    there is no medium betwixt them by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities so that his bearing their iniquity was that which did justify them and by his knowledge he knew whose sins he bore viz whom he justified isa          christ upon the cross did this work for us because the scripture says he has washed away our sins in his own blood rev    therefore they are done away therefore to say that they are not done away is to contradict god in his word and very dishonorable to jesus christ that he should be manifested to take away our sins   john    that christ should come to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins etc dan       cor     and yet this work is still to do what is this but to say christ came not to do it or if he came to do it he did not do it for he did it not if it be still to do   0 because christ says this work is finished therefore it is so for he is the faithful and true witness therefore we may believe it and affirm it is done these words spoke jesus i have glorified thee on earth i have finished the work thou gave me to do jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled says i thirst when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost john      0 and     to   the work god gave christ to do was the work of our salvation which consisted in taking and destroying our sins and presenting us holy without spot to god and this he did by being made sin us that so we might be made being made sin for us the righteousness of god in him   cor      therefore if when christ died that was the time this was to be done and if christ was ordained to do it if christ was mighty to save if christ took flesh to do this work if it was the will of god that he should do it if christ came on purpose to do it if our sins were laid upon christ and he suffered the punishment the curse of them if he has redeemed us if it was prophesied of him that he should justify many and that his work should prosper if christ did answer his types if he has exceeded all the priests and sacrifices under the law if there needs no more offerings for sin if christ has done all the law required if christ has done what he came to do if we are justified by his blood if he has made us holy and presented us without spot if we are free from all sin if christ has done all that can be done to make us just and righteous if christ did wash away our sins in his own blood if christ has said it is finished then it is done it is done it is done perfectly and completely done and then what i have said is fully proved namely that jesus christ by once offering the sacrifice of himself when he was on the cross put an end to sin and so destroyed all the sins of his people for ever and presented them just righteous and holy without spot etc before god col            col         oh what a fountain of consolation is here what marrow and fatness is here what sweetness is like to this to all that believe who now may say once sin was mine then it was laid upon christ and now they are neither mine nor his because they are not at all for by his blood he washed them all away and now they are all gone blotted out and shall be remembered no more no more no more now christs righteousness is mine as well as his for i was made the righteousness of god in him   cor     and i did nothing at all to procure these things to me in this appears free grace here is christ and christ alone and nothing but christ all things else pass away because they are under the sun eccles    they are full of mutation and change faith may be obscured and the soul greatly deserted so as to see no light isa  0   yet when at the worst they need not be comfortless john      for still god is their god and their lives are hid with christ in god col    who is the same to day yesterday and for ever heb     we change often but he never changes mal    in this is our happiness comfort and glory and even then when we cannot apprehend him yet were we in him ephesians    and we are and ever shall be in him and one with him and are comprehended of him   john   0 because i live says christ ye shall live also john      what doctrine in religion is more sweet and comfortable more necessary or profitable yea or more honorable to the lord jesus christ this is that which holds forth the love of god that sets the crown upon his head and will not give his glory to another isa     jer    this will have christ to be our life col    peace ephesians     glory isa      this is that that thrust us out of ourselves our life our righteousness romans  0  tit    to his to live in him and caused us to say o lord thou art our righteousness ezra     the lord our righteousness which life is most sweet and serviceable because this is sure and mo spiritual in a word this makes christ all in all col     and exalts him above all which is his place psalm     and surely that which is the life of our souls that upon which the eternal happiness of our souls depends is not in any thing in us but that is christ in him   cor       cor   0 it lies in him that so it may be kept safe for us and that we might not live upon any thing within us faith is given that by it we may live out of ourselves in another even the lord jesus where our life is col      surely if our life and happiness had been infused in us we should have lived in our selves and not upon god adam had his life in him and he lost it therefore it is better for us that our life is hid in christ in god col       this is comfortable indeed as god says comfort ye my people speak comfortably unto her tell her that her warfare is accomplished and her iniquity is pardoned etc  isa  0     this is good news from heaven indeed that this great work is finished it is not now to do neither for faith nor thee oh see that ye add not nor detract from it if thou be christs  i e if thou believe it is thine apply it take comfort in it admire gods love free grace give god all the glory of it give none of it to faith nor to any thing else rejoice in god and thy union with him witness to his truth and suffer for him serve and love and live and die with him and his  many having a notion in this day of being justified by a faith which is sometime out of exercise i would recommend to their consideration a few questions of this authors in his answers to some objections against this doctrine   whether says in the nature and power of it unacted do justify or no if yea i desire to know how the power to believe apart from the exercise of it can be known to us   how it may fitly be called says when there is no believing as there is not without the act seeing faith and to believe is one thing and whether the same light and power etc be not the same power by which we obey the rest of gods commands and if it be how you can distinguish it apart from its act and if it justifies as it is a grace unacted can you tell how and when you were justified and if it may abide in the soul one hour and not act why not two and so two seven years and whether then this opinion does not imply that a man may have faith in him and be justified by it and yet he never believe nor know it  finis
