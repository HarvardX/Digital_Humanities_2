particular will encourage this work by communicating drawings from portraits of eminent men many of which may lurk in domestic concealment nor can it be necessary to remind them that the present

his time  the regencies of robert and murdac dukes of albany had been fertile in public abuses and the dilapidation of the royal lands and revenues which they had shared among the nobles in order to establish their own power exposed the new sovereign to a choice of difficulties his reign must be degraded by penury or rendered dangerous by the arduous task of resuming the royal patrimony the spirit and genius of james preferred the latter alternative and after a long series of national disorder the sword of justice at length filled the hand of the monarch and flashed in the eyes of an usurping aristocracy the most guilty of the public depredators fell under the axe of the law neither rank nor even royal blood could save them from equal justice terror for a time seized the peers and

concerned in a plot of the house of douglas against the kings life there is every room to believe from original papers which will soon be laid before the public his sternness to the nobles was more

regard mary of guise as one of the most illustrious queens who ever shared the throne  her beauty and the elegant gentleness of her manners are mentioned in general terms lesley     but amid the

remarkably barren the continuator of fordun ends his work at the death of james i hector boyce the notorious fabulist is the only writer who details the reign of james ii and his account is translated by lindsay of pittscottie and abridged by lesley and buchanan though it deserve very little credit being generally irreconcilable with the genuine fragments and records his minority was chiefly rendered memorable by the contests between crichton and livingston and successive earls of douglas in      james ii espoused mary of gelder niece of philip the good duke of burgundy  the execution of william sixth earl of douglas in the castle of edinburgh    0 had not quieted the rebellious spirit of that great family and in      james was in the effervescence of passion provoked to stab william

brothers james it is chief the earls of moray and ormond and lord balveny were doomed to expiate by death or exile the vengeance of their offended monarch and country yet in the course of a few years the branch of angus succeeded to the exorbitant power of the stem such strangers were the monarchs to modern theoretic ideas of a design to subvert the aristocracy while in fact all they attempted was to withstand its encroachments when they became absolutely incompatible with royalty  on the  d of august    0 james ii was accidentally slain by the bursting of a cannon while he was besieging roxburgh  james ii was a prince of eminent spirit and his measures were decisive even to violence the obscurity attending his reign renders his private life little known his person according to a dry

first monarch of the house of stuart ascended the throne on the   th march      being in the fiftieth and fifth year of his age he died on the   th of april    0 his advanced years and an inflammation in his eyes prevented his personal appearance as an eminent actor in history but his reign was distinguished by the battle of otterburn and other illustrious incidents  he was a just and beneficent sovereign in person he was tall and majestic but his countenance was disfigured by the inflammation of his eyes which froissart says were distorted and red as sandal wood tome    f     a defect which procured him the vulgar epithet of blear eye  this portrait from the inscriptions of jonston seems not much to be depended on the eyes are indeed distorted but the beard worn in that age is wanting the dress however accords with the costume david ii appears with the robe fringed on the shoulders as here and the form of the bonnet repeatedly occurs in montfaucons prints strutts reg and ecc ant plate liii montf mon t iii pl            james the first portrait of james i of scotland from a painting at kielberg in sbia    this portrait is taken from a painting at kielberg near tubingen in germany the seat of the von lytrums  the late learned sir james stuart denham had informed lord buchan that he had often seen at m von lytrums a portrait full length of a scottish king in a close jacket the peaks of his shoes fastened to his girdle with chains of gold that it was in a gallery with portraits of many other princes that an ancestor of m von lytrum being a great traveller had visited most courts in europe and obtained those pictures of the reigning sovereigns from his lordships information   lord buchan in consequence applied to m gognel chancellor to the duke of wirtemburg at montbeliard for a copy of this piece which only came to hand half length as here though the remainder would have presented an instance of a singular fashion mentioned by old english writers as beginning in the reign of richard ii but of which no other specimen is known in painting or miniature  the editor was led to suppose that this prince was james iv because the contemporary sovereigns were of his reign or soon after but he now inclines to infer james i from the following reasons   m gognel named it the latter   the features correspond so much with the fine portrait of james i in johnstons inscriptions that the beard and more advanced years seem to form the only difference   the crown over the arms is too simple for the time of james iv that of james iii having fleurons of quite a different height and richness   the hat resembles that of charles vii of france contemporary with james i in mezeray   the jacket is not slashed there is in montfaucon mon t iii pl    a portrait of charles duke of burgundy slain in      in this very dress with the chain of the golden fleece but the jacket is slashed in strait lines and this fashion of slashing appears in the genuine portrait of james iv   the shoes with chains are so rare that it is probable they were only known in the latter part of the reign of richard ii and in that of henry iv who died in      when james i was twenty years of age and had been a captive for eight years long peaks are common and appear in the statutes of edward iv but no mention of chains occurs after the above period it is improbable that von lytrum should from such a distance visit scotland but most likely that the portrait of james i was executed in england during his captivity and procured there by von lytrum who not being able to get that of the reigning monarch contented himself with another   alex erskine portrait of alex erskine     alexander erskine plenipotentiary for sweden at the treaty of munster this

long since settled at bonne in germany this information was obligingly communicated by lord buchan further materials have not arisen  mary portrait of mary queen of scots from a painting in kensington

necessary to state the chief dates in order to illustrate the portraits in that splendid work the heads of illustrious persons o england dr birch has proceeded on a different plan but no one consults such books for biography and it had been better if he had authenticated and illustrated the portraits several of which are well known to be erroneous this last cause with the unwieldy size of superfluous ornaments for the portraits themselves might have appeared in  vo may perhaps account for the abrupt termination of a work which the more ample it had proved the more honorable it had been

editor has seen in the possession of sir william musgrave the small eyes and oval features occur in all the genuine portraits but this has not that rise in the middle of the nose which appears in the others perhaps the engraver was careless or this feature was the product of more advanced years montfaucon mon de la mon fr gives a curious small whole length of her leaning on a chair it is intended to be copied for this work   the portraits by elstrack and a good modern profile by stewart may be classed between her twentieth and thirtieth year the present undoubted portrait at kensington seems

thought his heart was in heaven and that he was never alone with him but he felt within himself a commentary on those words of the apostle did not our hearts burn within us while he yet talked with us and opened to us the scriptures during the time he was principal at aberdeen he had interspersed several things among his academical prelections tending to create peace among the contending parties of christianity some notes whereof were published above twenty years after his death under the title of considerationes modestae et pacificae etc keith bish         the book forms an  vo volume replete

a patron of the arts gentle affable just had his prudence equalled his other qualities he would have been one of the greatest of monarchs but his impetuosity of temper hurried him into two romantic

work  john earl of mar regent of scotland     john erskine earl of mar regent of scotland this truly illustrious character was third son of john twelfth lord erskine and was educated to the church but

james ii douglas peer art mar   on the birth of james vi in      the royal babe was committed to the custody of the earl of mar then governor of the castle of stirling his candor and moderation became most conspicuous in the public distractions that followed and he was almost the only man who wished to preserve the independence of his country alike unviolated either by french or english influence on the death of lennox the earl of mar was chosen regent sept        in spite of the artifices of elizabeth but he did not hold that high office much above a year dying on the   th of oct      not without suspicions of poison a crime of which elizabeth and morton were not incapable his age is not commemorated but there is room to infer he was born about    0  his courage was conspicuous in his sally from stirling castle at the head of thirty men to repel the four hundred sent by kirkaldy to surprise the peers and by his success in that unequal conflict his attempts to conciliate all parties and to maintain the independence of his country against foreign influence evince the real patriot he was perhaps the only person in the kingdom who could have enjoyed the office of regent without envy

preceptors in      he favored the party which opposed the infamous morton the regent who in revenge persuaded the young earl of mar that his uncle intended to deprive him of the custody of the king

entrusted to him the custody of his son and it is highly to the honor of this illustrious family that the care of their minor sovereigns had been in a manner hereditary james v having been entrusted to lord erskine by his mother margaret and the parliament it was solely a special character of probity that produced those successive testimonies of high approbation  this earl was joined with bruce

was born at aberdeen in      the portraits by him at taymouth are said to have been executed before he studied in flanders so the late lord hailes thought but this opinion is very doubtful and the author of the sketch of painting in scotland weekly magazine vol xv be vol xviii asserts with great probability that jameson returned to scotland in      and as one piece there is dated      it would appear that he was advanced in years before he visited rubens he died at edinburgh in      aged    and was buried in the grayfriars churchyard  for some account of his works the reader may consult the valuable anecdotes of painting in england nor is much additional information to be procured dr arthur johnston in his parerga aberdeen      addresses a small poem to jameson instructing him how to paint the beautiful lady ann campbell one of his most curious paintings is at cullen house het seat of the earl of finlater it is his own portrait sitting in his paintingroom the walls of which are hung with pictures probably such of his own as he most valued  jameson is the first scottish painter on record but eminent foreigners had visited scotland and painted illustrious portraits the most curious assemblage of the kind is in the old gallery of the palace at scone a huntingpiece in which james vi and his chief courtiers appear alexander the scholar of jameson married his daughter and cosmo alexander engraved a portrait of jameson his great grandfather in      the elder scougal an imitator of lely and corrudes a foreigner appeared in charles the seconds reign and were followed by

natural son of gawin lesley parson of kingussie in badenoch he was born   th sept      in      we find him at school in moray in      an acolyte in the cathedral church of aberdeen he is a canon of aberdeen in    0 and prebendary and official of that diocese eight years after  about      he appears among the ecclesiastic lords of session and in      is commendator of the abbey of lindoris and bishop of ross  his attachment to mary and his sufferings in her cause are well known deprived of his preferments in his own country he was at last forced into exile and after various disappointments in france and flanders he died at brussels   st may      aged    keiths bishops            it is no wonder that his active character has been blackened by party but a candid protestant must allow that bishop lesley acted with uniform principle as a writer his reputation ought also to stand in a superior class for not to mention his works of controversy and piety his history of scotland from james iii to his own time is executed with great information and accuracy and is far superior in the real merits of history to the elegant but incorrect work of buchanan the chronology and the preservation of important events and incidents are solely implied for both were partisans and this work estranged from party wishes not to pull a wreath from one character in order to bestow it on another but only to assign just applause where it is due  this portrait is from an original in the university of aberdeen     kensington picture compartment i this exquisite painting is in complete preservation though executed as appears from the age of the prince ten or twelve about      or      originally intended for an altarpiece it is in two divisions painted on both sides the first division contains on one side the king prince and st andrew as here on the reverse is the trinity the father an old man with the dead christ on his knees while the holy ghost is as usual typified by a dove the other division presents the queen and a saint apparently canute the patron of denmark and perhaps the features may be those of her father christiern i the reverse bears the ecclesiastic and angels  the first compartment is rich in effect and it is hoped the copy will present an adequate idea of the original the kings gown is cloth of gold the robes of a lilac purple the lion of the arms is crowned and the tressure does not go round the top  it has been surmized that the saint might wear the features of shevis archbishop of st andrews a favorite of james but the ecclesiastics did not then preserve their beards and the character of the face seems ideal  picture at kensington compartment ii   kensington picture compartment ii the queens headdress is singularly rich in gold precious stones and pearls the upper part of the kirtle or gown is cloth of gold the robe blue the arms of denmark and scotland are exactly blazoned the three united crowns for the united kingdoms of denmark sweden and norway the three lions of denmark lion and ax norway the dragon for slavonia the escutcheon of pretense is holstein sleswick dithmarch delmenhorst surmounted by oldenburg  the banner borne by the saint is the common cross of the crusades with the inscription ave maria it may allude to the arms of gothland the holy lamb supporting a banner with the same cross as here see the elzevir dania his armor is a curious specimen of the platearmour of the times and a helmet appears in the preceding compartment a gauntlet hangs by the sword the ornament behind apparently of oak leaves is singular but resembles that in one of the dresses of the order of the knot or holy ghost in montfaucon instituted in      but afterward dormant till revived by henry iii in the   th century men of the fr mon pl cxviii english edition its meaning here must be left to some future antiquary  picture at kensington  iii   kensington picture compartment iii it is probable that this picture was painted for the royal chapel at stirling founded by james iii with much magnificence and that the ecclesiastic here kneeling was the dean of that chapel always the queens confessor spottiswoode rel houses p     he had also episcopal jurisdiction three being no indication of superior dignity the arms three buckles and a cheveron can be traced to no family in scotland except that of bonkil in the merse but perhaps the person may be sir william rogers the great english musician the sir being often applied to ecclesiastics or some other eminent foreigner  the angels in the original have little of ideal beauty and the unusual ornament of the coronet may denote the kings sister mary first wedded to thomas boyd earl of arran and afterward to james lord hamilton while the other may be margaret not wedded to lord crichton till       james iii portrait of james iii of scotland from jonstom ptiones    james iii portrait of james iii of scotland l from the picture at kensmaton    james iii this monarch ascended the throne on the  0th of august    0 in the eighth year of his age and was slain after the civil conflict at sauchy on the   th june      in the thirtysixth year of his age  his reign was distinguished by many memorable events the recapture of roxburgh and berwick and the acquisition of the orkney islands by his marriage with the daughter of denmark the chief stain on it is the murder of the earl of mar youngest brother of james an incident the more singular as that king was averse from blood  and though all historical evidence infer the guilt yet the rebellious peers eager to expose every fault of the government never impute this to their sovereigns charge if true james must have been infatuated by his love of astrology which predicted to him his death by one of his nearest kindred  and mar may not have been innocent of a conspiracy against his brothers life certain it is that albany the second brother aspired to the crown and termed james iii a bastard  but the sovereignty of james was weak despotic and impolitic and his warm attachment to the arts forms the most pleasing part of his character his love of architecture raised cochran to the chief power in the state and rogers the english musician was in high favor the ferocious nobles despised what they esteemed the frivolous pursuits of the king and strangers to the arts could not estimate their value of the patronage afforded by james iii to foreign artists this noble painting may present no unfavourable specimen  of the person of james iii drummond gives the best description this king concerning his personage was of a stature somewhat higher than ordinary his hair was black his visage was rather long than round approaching in color more to those in the southern than northern climates this fallow complexion appears in the picture which besides corresponds so much with drummonds delineation that it may be borrowed from the painting and the complexion of james so different from that of the stuart race in general may have had its weight in the calumnies of albany especially considering the amorous propensity of mary of gelder his mother eyes and hair black there is somewhat of melancholy in the face heightened in the original by a dark tinge even in the whites of the eyes  portrait of margaret of denmark queen of james iii of scotland  margaret of denmark queen of james iii this lady was daughter of christiern the first of that name and first king of denmark of the house of oldenburg she was married to james iii in july      being only in her thirteenth year and brought the permanent dower of the orkneys the superiority of which had remained with the court of norway for six centuries  the scottish historians are unanimous in applauding her person her virtues and piety ferrerius f     lesley     etc an excellent wife an affectionate mother she adds the merit of being unknown in the political struggles of a turbulent period  margaret of denmark died in february      aged only thirty one years and was buried at cambuskenneth drummond whether she fell a prey to disease or to the continual agitations occasioned by her husbands misrule is left in doubt by the barren historians of that age  james vi portrait of james vi of scotland from jononi inscriptiones    james vi this prince was born on the   th of june      and crowned on the   th of july in the following year in   0  he united the arms of england and scotland and died on the   th of march      aged fifty nine  with the defect of a feeble character he had the high merit of being a pacific monarch a very little learning a very little knowledge being sufficient to show the advantages of peace over war both to the king and the people even his short peaceful reign greatly advanced the trade agriculture and colonies of the kingdom and if by way of speculation we could imagine it prolonged to the present epoch the three realms would have been as one garden as another china in universal wealth and industry  in features particularly the nose james vi resembles his father darnley more than the ancient stuart line the singular stare of his eyes mentioned by contemporary authors is more apparent in the portraits taken in more advanced years particularly a fine whole length at windfor in which the face not a little resembles the vulgar sign of the saracens head  anne portrait of anne of denmark queen of james vi of scotland from jonstons inscriptiones    anne of denmark queen of james vi was the daughter of frederic ii king of denmark and norway in october      james proceeded himself in quest of his bride as his grandfather james v had set an example of this gallantry they were married in denmark and anne was crowned in the ensuing spring  she died in march       the character of anne of denmark was the reverse of that of her countrywoman margaret wife of james iii amorous bold intriguing impressed with little reverence for her husbands spirit or abilities for government she was immersed in polities though her supreme cunning have veiled her from historical observation that in particular she had no small share in the gowrie conspiracy may perhaps be shown by the editor in a short tract on that embroiled subject at present he shall only hint that the main actor gowries brother was a paramour of anne that she highly offended james by her continued favor to the forfeited family that the earl of gowrie himself appears to have been entirely innocent and that annes ambition might conspire with her lovers infatuation to imprison her husband and rival elizabeth in female sovereignty had the lover been a man of ability had not his mind been almost distracted with the weight of the enterprise another example might have been added to those in ancient and modern history of imperious queens who have imprisoned or murdered their husbands  henry scougal theol prof author of the life of god in the soul of man original in the college hall aberdeen    henry scougal professor of divinity at aberdeen was the son of patrick scougal bishop of aberdeen            and has the merit of being the first scottish author it is believed who wrote a book of practical piety ecclesiastical disputes so inconsistent with the meek spirit of christianity had first prevailed between the catholics and reformers then between the episcopals and presbyterians and afterward between the presbyterians and independents sermons and commentaries on scripture were sometimes interposed but the chief object the practice of the christian virtues was unaccountably neglected durhams curious work on scandal being rather a discussion of ecclesiastic discipline and polity and a defense of the presbyterians against the independent jacobins of the day than an ethical production  of henry scougal little is known it is said that being of an amorous complexion he sometimes loved god and sometimes loved women and that having unfortunately become enamoured of a married lady at aberdeen he died in the struggles of virtue and passion but he had grown so corpulent in his retreat the steeple of the cathedral church of st machans at old aberdeen that his executors were forced to extract the body through a window these traditions seem rather inconsistent as love is generally supposed rather to belong to the class of consumptions than of dropsies and it is rare that the amorous swain pines away into plenitude  scougals life of god in the soul of man was published by bishop burnet in       vo and has since passed through many editions being a work of eminent piety without enthusiasm and written in a clear neat style  alexander henderson from a scar print by hollar    alexander henderson this franklin of the scottish commotions in last century was minister at leuchars and was in vain tempted with a bishopric he died in      regretting the excess to which affairs were carried but never repenting of his own moderate motives and actions as vainly repeated by his opponents a stale device of party see baillies letters   vols  vo   in fact the presbyterians after overturning the episcopal despotism of the time were gradually ruining their own cause by a despotism far more disguisting the saints attempted to establish a clerical aristocracy not only over scotland but over england and the civil power would have become the mere slave of ecclesiastic censure and excommunication liberty of conscience was entirely denied by the presbyterian party their church polity was a part of their creed and the penalty against any diffent was excommunication in this world and a liberal inheritance in hell fire hereafter a mans private life was to be tainted with saintship or hypocrisy and every pleasure was to vanish at the nod of those physicians of sancho the governor the presbyterians supported the regal power as a shield against the independents and sectaries who with far superior political skill allowed universal liberty of conscience  but a nondescript saint named cromwell put himself at the head of the independents and completely overthrew the presbyterian despotism both parties appealed to king christ and he decided in favor of the democratic church  in the sole choice left between the impertinent authority and degrading superstition of the presbyterians and the power merely military of cromwell it is no wonder that the nation sighed for the ancient monarchy a government at least of gentlemen over gentlemen and more beneficent to all than that of parsons or soldiers over slaves  hendersons favorite polity and the clerical aristocracy were after his death to be trampled under foot but be timously escaped from the evils to come one of the chief events of his life was the solemn conference with charles i at newcastle on various topics of religion and government the relation has been printed and does honor to both parties  patrick forbes of corse and oneil bishop of aberdeen      original kings college aberdeen    patrick forbes bishop of aberdeen this learned prelate was descended of the ancient and noble family of forbes pronounced forbis not forbs as in england and was himself baron or lord of the estates of corse and oneil in aberdeenshire having received an excellent education and being attached to ecclesiastical studies he was often persuaded to take orders but could not be prevailed on till the year      when the minister of keith having in a paroxysm of religious melancholy stabbed himself urged this as his dying request but the motive considering all the circumstances seems most inadequate to the effect  however this be mr forbes entered into ecclesiastic orders in his forty eighth year and was chosen bishop of aberdeen six years after he died on the   th march      aged seventy one years and was interred in the south aile of the cathedral  in episcopal jurisdiction he was laudably rigid and used suddenly to visit the churches of his diocese on sundays that he might see the common method of the preachers and accommodate his instructions accordingly  he wrote a commentary on the revelations printed by elzevir       to some particulars concerning him may be found in the life of the yet

of robert i or great   0        this is from a charter dated in his ninth year mr astle in his late publication of scottish seals gives another used by robert i toward the close of his reigned in the same plate is that of david ii son of robert i who reigned from a d      to       the second plate of this set contains that of edward baliol who twice usurped the throne during the reign of david ii first for three months sept  dec      and lastly for five years            and that of robert ii the first of the house of stuart          0  on the third plate the first in order of time is that of euphemia ross second wife but sole queen of robert ii the reverse only bears the arms of david earl palatine of strathern her son who joins in the deed dated      in which they agree with alexander murray of drumsergath that he shall wed lady jonet of monymusk sister of the queen and be supported in his claim of inheriting some estate and that walter murray his brother may if he choose marry the eldest daughter of the said jonet this curious seal represents euphemia clothed in the close kirtle and mantle of the times with a particular scepter alloted to the queens of scotland in her hand the gothic architecture is well delineated on her right hand are the arms of scotland on her left those of ross she appears to have died about       the next seal in order of time is that of robert iii    0    0  the beard agrees better with the description of his person given by the continuator of fordun than the portrait in johnsons inscriptiones  that at the top of the plate is of robert duke of albany regent of scotland   0        the ducal coronet is of a singular form  all these plates are from that rare and highpriced work andersons diplomata  the subject of the engravers of seals in the middle ages is obscure they were probably often greeks from constantinople sometimes italians and laterly flemings  the seals of the four first jameses are all from the same dye  and are besides unimportant as from james i the portraits of our monarchs are sufficiently identified in this case as in the former of alex i david i and malcom iv the first seal alone is entitled to any attention
