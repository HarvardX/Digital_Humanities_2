london      n b i must here acquaint the reader that through the whole i have not once made use of the common though barbarous word manmidwife except in quotations because it carries nonsense in the very front of it how can a man be a wife except he be a hermaphrodite may they not as properly say a manmonkey a mangoose or a manass the french express it very beautifully by the word accoucheur i e a man who delivers women in labor and i shall always express it by the word midman which though not so neat as the french yet is much better than the absurd word complained of  the common word midwife is also often very improperly used e g a maid may be taught the art of delivering women yet she is not a wife widows also lay women yet they are not wives therefore to reconcile this impropriety i shall always except in quotations call them midwomen which includes maids wives and widows but dr maubray the worst writer on this subject and mr chapman after him make use of another appellation much more absurd viz womanmidwife womenmidvives pray would not saying midwife and midwives distinguish their sex sufficiently pray who ever heard of girlmidwives  explication of the latin words which occur in quotations etc   cranium the scull   scrotum the bag which contains the testicles in males   labia pudendi   vagina the sheath or passage to the mouth of the womb   os tincae vel internum the mouth

the basin which contains the womb bladder etc    ossa pubis the forepart of the basin    os sacrum the backpart of the basin    ossa innominata the sides of the basin the state of midwifery is it not very surprising nay and unaccountable that though almost all the other parts of surgery have been cultivated with great assiduity by the most knowing men ever since hippocrates nay and before him yet till about the middle of the last century the operations necessary for the safety of women in labor and their children operations of more consequence to mankind than almost all the rest operations so often wanted so difficult many times to perform and upon which always two and sometimes more lives depend seem to have been entirely left to a parcel of ignorant women or to men little better qualified than they who upon any extraordinary difficulty as too many still do took hooks or knives and carved the children to pieces and often also destroyed the mother  the surgeons at paris etc to remedy this evil have for many years past obliged all the midwomen to be examined and approved of at their hall before ever they dare set up for practice an example most worthy of imitation but how or by what infatuation our dom fac totum suffered these operations to drop through their fingers as if they were no part of their profession as if they were not manual operations or were of little or no consequence to mankind into the hands of doctors inferioris sortis medici as a certain gentleman calls them apothecaries and the lowest class of their own fraternity some of whom have been and are as illiterate of as low capacities and as little acquainted with the other great operations of surgery as almost any of the women and have and do allow every silly woman who takes it in her head with very little or no instruction to practice impune among his majestys subjects without any the least examination or license are questions i shall not now take upon me to answer but to proceed  the first rational account we ever had of delivering women in labor was published at paris by mr mauriceau in      in his dedication he gives the following honest account of his design i have the rather undertaken this work that midwives might find therein what they ought to know the better to exercise their art and undergo the examination they are obliged to at surgeonshall before they are admitted to practice in his preface he says i have not run out into superfluous discourse i e he had avoided all puzzling and unintelligible theories and hypotheses about generation nutrition superfoetation and such sort of jargon that i might be more serviceable both to surgeons and midwives  this plain practical work would undoubtedly have had a much better effect upon our midwomen had they not been puzzled and confounded instead of being instructed by the artful insinuations of the translator in his preface and marginal notes published in      as will appear by the following quotations  dr chamberlen in his preface says having long observed the great want of necessary directions how to govern women with child and in childbed etc i designed a small manual to that purpose but meeting some time after in france with this treatise of mauriceau which in my opinion exceeds all former authors i changed my resolution into that of translating him whom i need not much commend because he is fortified with the approbation of the wardens of the surgeons company of paris pray would the doctor have thought he had been so well fortified if he had had the approbation of the then wardens of the surgeons company of london or the approbation of the college of physicians at paris i have carefully rendered his book into english for the benefit of our midwives this is certainly a very fair and honest exordium a worthy and laudablc design but pray mark the end on it of whom many may yet very well admit of an additional knowledge this cannot be denied but pray where are they to go look for this additional knowledge if he means in their profession is it to be found in his preface and marginal notes upon mauriceaus work no they rather darken than explain the authors meaning but the additional knowledge the doctor means and has taken such pains to inculcate through the whole of his preface and notes is to inform them the he and his family can assist them better than any other men that they have no business to meddle with any child except those who just drop into their hands and that whenever the least difficulty appears to send for him or some or the nostrummongers as will appear evidently from the tenure of the whole  then he goes on the principal thing worthy the observation of midwives in this book is accurately to discover what is properly their work and when it is necessary to send for advice and assistance that so many women and children may be preserved that now perish for want of seasonable help i e shall victims to the ignorance of midwomen and that midwifes skill is certainly the greatest and she deserves most commendation who can soonest discover the success of the labor and accordingly either wait with patience or timely send for advice and help pray is not that midwwomans skill still greater and does she not deserve much more commendation who can soonest discover what obstructs the delivery and then removes the obstruction herself and thereby saves the woman the fright trouble and expense of sending for any farther help or advice nor can it be so great a discredit to a midwife let some of them imagine what they please to have a woman or child saved by a mans assistance as to suffer either to die under her own hand though delivered for that midwife mistakes her office that thinks she has performed it by only laying the woman because her principal duty is to take care that she and her child be well with safety and convenient speed parted who dont know that and if this be impossible for her it will justify her better to wave her imaginary reputation and send for help no doubt of it but would it not have been much better if they had been taught to do their office themselves  thus you see mr mauriceaus design in publishing his book was to instruct the midwomen how to perform their office better but dr chamberlen perverts that design and seems to have the interest of the midmen and not that of the midwomen or  principally at heart as is evident from the foregoing quotations etc  notwithstanding all these coaxes and threats which he plays off so briskly upon the town midwomen who are undoubtedly much better qualified than those in the country in case they dont send for him etc on every trifling difficulty he goes on and says yet in countries and places where help and good advice is not seasonably to be had midwives are compelled to do their best as god shall enable them pray has god any where promised to give more assistance to a country than a town midwoman thus the poor country midwomen are to act as god shall enable them but the town midwomen as the doctor etc shall direct utrum horum pray has god almighty given us the least ground to expect that he will inspire us in an instant even upon the most urgent occasion with the perfect knowledge of any useful art only because it would just then be of service to us no but he has told us that if we want to acquire the knowledge of any useful art we must diligently and assiduously apply ourselves to the study of it in the most proper manner we can dii laborantibus omnia vendunt which dangerous and uncertain trials in does not become them to put in practice upon women where no timely assistance need be wanting thus you see the doctor thinks dangerous and uncertain trials may lawfully be put in practice on women in the country though not upon those in town where he and the rest of the nostrummongers may be had but pray might not many of these uncertain and dangerous trials both in town and country have been prevented if he had endeavored as much to instruct them how to give better assistance themselves as he has done to let them know when to send for him etc are not the womens lives in the country as valuable as those in town  then he goes on to tell them in what particular cases they ought to send for him etc viz   in most wrong births with or without pain alias with or without danger or difficulty   all floodings with clods though little or no pain whether at full time or not   all convulsions   many first labors   and some other i e every other case when the people are substantial viz though the child be right if little or no pain after the breaking of the waters and the childs not following them in some six or ten hours after require the good advice of and peradventure speedy delivery by expert physicians clans in this practice pray would not expert surgeons in this practice do as well is it not evident from the doctors list of cases that very few women except those in the country or who are very poor could escape those expert physicians viz he his father and two brothers  but least the charge he has given to the midwomen of sending for him etc upon every trifling occasion should not have weight enough he also threatens the poor suffering women with what may happen to them in case they dont oblige their midwomen to send for them let me therefore advise the good women not so readily to blame those midwives who are not backward in dangerous cases or not dangerous cases to desire advice least it cost them dear pray dont it always cost them dear when they do by discouraging and forcing them to presume beyond their knowledge and strength as for their want of knowledge i take it to be more their misfortune than their fault because they have not yet had such proper opportunities of informing themselves as they ought to have but as to strength i am satisfied most of them have enough did they know how to make a proper use of it especially when too many are over confident for this compliment the midwomen are as much obliged to him as for many others he passes upon them  in another place he says if therefore the use of hooks by physicians pray what business have physicians with hooks are not pen ink and paper their proper instruments what right have they then to encroach upon us dont they make a sad outcry are not they alarmed as if their craft was in danger when we use pen and ink except in pauper cases and surgeons be condemned without thereto necessitated by some monstrous birth etc now you see he is obliged to own notwithstanding all he says to the contrary that hooks are sometimes absolutely necessary we can much less approve of a midwifes using them as some here in england boast they do which rash presumption in france would call them in question for their lives the doctor allows page   country midwives are compelled to do their best as god shall direct them now supposing that god should direct one of them to make use of a crochet in a fit case and after a proper manner must she be tried for her life for it is not this a very hard charge upon the poor midwomen without any proof i must diffent so far from the doctors opinion that i believe the hardiest midwoman in london would tremble at the very thought of it unless they were fully instructed how to use it as  but for what they may do in the country according to the doctors advice above recited i cannot answer  mr mauriceau page     says a midwife vaunted she was more skilful in her art than any surgeon upon which dr chamberlen remarks that it seems midwives in other countries as well as england have that pernicious vanity but pray were there no midmen then in england who had vaunted they could perform what they really could not vid mr mauriceaus   th observation quoted below  mr mauriceau page  0  if the arm be advanced as far as the shoulder etc dr chamberlen remarks which seldom is unless an ignorant midwife tamper with it are not these pretty compliments but where is the instruction are not all practitioners of the very least experience sensible it often happens without any tampering but notwithstanding he has been so lavish in these and many other places in censuring those good women yet he winds up his preface with a salvo for all viz i hope no good midwives will blame me for reprehending the faults of bad ones who are only aimed at and admonished in this work and i am confident none but the guilty will be concerned and take it to themselves which i desire they may and amend is not this cobweb easily seen through is not this the first time he has mentioned good midwives  dr chamberlens account of his secret he is not content with amusiing confounding nay and abusing the midwomen at the same time he makes a show of teaching them but also serves the midmen the same sauce by telling them he has a secret which will do wonders i e it will save many childrens lives which they who do not know it or something as good must destroy but cannot in honor notwithstanding it might save thousands of lives discover it even to them because it might prejudice the personal interest of his father and two brothers who only in all europe know it but what they may do in africa asia etc this deponent says not his own story is as follows my author lib ii cap    justifies the fastening hooks in the head of a child that comes right and yet because of some difficulty or disproportion cannot pass which i confess has been and is yet the practice of the most expert artists in midwifery not only in england but throughout europe but i can neither approve of that practice nor those delays pray observe how long he was in attempting to deliver that woman at paris vid m m obs    quoted below because my father brothers and self though none else in europe as i know pray had not sir david hamilton more business and as good if not better success in the practice of midwifery than he may we not then reasonably suppose that he either knew his secret or had one of his own though he never made any noise about it which answered as well have by gods blessing and our iudustry attained to and long practiced a way to deliver women in this case without any prejudice to them or their infants though all others being obliged for want of such an expedient to use the common way do and must endanger if not destroy one or both with hooks pray would it not have been a grateful return for gods blessing them with so useful a secret to have communicated it to the rest of the midmen whereby the destruction of so many women and children might have been prevented by this manual operation a labor may be dispatched on the least difficulty so that on the least difficulty either to midwomen or midmen we must immediately run for one of the nostrummongers with fewer pains and sooner to the great advantage and without danger both of woman and child  he is not content with having thus acquainted us with the great value of his secret and who besides himself are possessed of it in his epistle but also mentions and recommends it over and over ad nauseam usque through the whole of his remarks on this work for fear the midwomen should attend mr mauriceau so much that they should forget his nostrum e g mr mauriceau page     if there be any case wherein a surgeon ought to make the greatest reflection and use most precaution in his art it is this to know whether the infant be alive or dead dr chamberlen remarks this caution is not so necessary to those practitoners which can fetch a child coming right or with the arm without hooks or sharp instruments as the translator of this book and his father and his brothers can  mr chapman in his essay on midwifery      says dr chamberlens secret was the forceps then makes the following quaint observation on the forementioned remark here is something very odd methinks in applying this secret to both these cases as equally serviceable to either the cases differing so very widely and requiring a quite different method for the head presenting and far advanced is to be taken hold of by the forceps and extracled when a child which presents an arm is to be turned and so brought away by its feet i e without either hooks or sharp instruments  whence its evident mr chapman did not apprehend the doctors view in applying his secret to the arm as well as the head it was undoubtedly the better to puzzle the cause the better to conceal his nostrum that he applies it to two cases between which there is not the least analogy he might as well have said it would be of great use in extracting the stone or in drawing teeth  mr mauriceau page  0  the arm is to be twisted off if the child be dead dr chamberlen good if the child be dead but it may be always done without undoubtedly it may be often done without twisting it off but not with his forceps mr mauriceau ibid before you use the crotchet be sure the child is dead dr chamberlen this caveat is unnecessary to those who understand the art aright i e only the nostrummongers dr chamberlen the use of the crotchet may be connived at when the child is dead but because the most careful may often times be mistaken it cannot be approved of as appears in the translators epistle to the reader dr chamberlen page     though the crotchet cannot hurt a dead child yet it may endanger the woman by slipping so may a lancet traphine or any other instrument in the hands of those who dont know how to use them wherefore the translator of this treatise cannot approve of it having an easier and safer way to do this operation as he mentions in his preface to this book dr chamberlen page     all this viz the use of the crotchet were to no purpose if others had the art to do it as the translator can and mentions in his preface to this book  dr chamberlen page     those instruments are very unsafe for the woman undoubtedly when in unexperienced hands otherwise they are not at all dangerous and having a better way i cannot pass them without manifesting my dislike mr mauriceau page     it is a great question whether a living child ought to be destroyed to save the mother dr chamberlen this question is out of doors for the reason given in the foresaid preface i am afraid this will prove but a very bad reason in some cases notwithstanding it is laid down with such a magisterial and dictatorial air as i shall prove at a more proper time mr mauriceau page     says it is always better of two evils to choose the least so we ought always to prefer the mothers life before the childs dr chamberlen this chapter might be very well spared if every practitioner had the art the translator professes in his epistle of fetching a child when it comes right without hooks or turning it  if turning will do there is never any occasion for hooks or for his secret either thus you see with what fulsome repetitions what nauseous recommendations of his nostrum he has stuffed his remarks but has not made one remark that can be of any advantage to our midwomen and seems to have had nothing elfse in view through the whole but to tell them when they ought to send for him and to let them know that he etc could serve them better than any body else  our translator like all the rest of the secretmongers has given a better character of his nostrum than i fancy it deserves e g he has taken a great deal of pains and used all his art to persuade us that he etc can fetch a child which presents right at all times and in all circumstances without hooks or turning etc but how this quadrates with the two following cases one of which is translated by the doctor himself and the other is recorded in mr mauriceaus   th observation i leave the reader to judge  mr mauriceau page     tells us that in the year    0 while he practiced midwifery in the hotel dieu one of the deputies had a woman whose child she could not posibly bring forth further than its head therefore called the head midwife to her aid who likewise used her utmost skill but in vain and when they had both thus tired themselves in pulling the head i came in accidentally and they desired me to examine and find the cause why the child could not be drawn forth with all their strength which was sufficient to have drawn forth the shoulders if they had been as big again as they were which having considered i immediately conceived the difficulty to proceed from something else i then put my hand into the womb up to the childs shoulders which seemed small enough to pass with ease therefore i concluded that the hindrance was not there  after that i put my hand farther up toward it is belly which i found very much swelled by a dropsy i therefore told them that it was impossible ever to deliver the woman until the water was emptied by piercing the belly but not having a crotchet in my pocket i sent to another surgeon of the same hospital and told him the story adding withal that the child could not be born unless an orifice was made to empty the belly but he would not take my advice imagining he could extract it with his hands but he soon separated the head from the shoulders the midwives having almost done it before afterward he fell to work with his crotchet and in about three quarters of an hour brought away both arms several ribs heart and lungs and tired himself heartily yet in all this time he had never opened the diaphragma nor abdomen which i advised him to do every moment without which it was impossible to draw forth the rest of the body then he gave me the crotchet telling me i might weary myself as well as he had done which i willingly accepted knowing very well that instead of amusing myself as they had done by pulling it i ought only to pierce the infants belly to let out the waters after which all the rest would easily follow i then introduced my left hand as far as the side of the infants belly and then with my right guided the crotchet upon it to the same place then turned its point and struck it into the infants belly so that i made a hole big enough to receive the ends of my two fingers with which i stretched the orifice and the waters gushed out so that with one hand i easily drew out the rest of the body to the astonishment of this surgeon whom i could never persuade that the infant was so full of the dropsy i filled the belly afterward through the hole i had made and it held about five quarts i have set down this story that other surgeons may know how to behave on the like occasions  pray what could dr chamberlen have done with his forceps in this case but the following story will more clearly show that he himself has been foiled secret and all  mr mauriceaus observation xxvi of a woman who died with her child in her womb which could not be extracted by an english physician who undertook to deliver her  on the   th of august    0 i visited a little woman about thirtyeight years of age who had been in labor of her first child for four days the membranes being broke the first day of her illness and yet there was hardly any dilatation of the mouth of the womb i ordered her to be blooded and in case that did not increase her pains to give her a decoction of senna in order to excite them which succeeded so well that next day the womb was sufficiently dilated nevertheless it was nor possible to deliver her the infant presented it is head but could not advance into the passage because of the straitness and bad formation of the bones of the pelvis which made it impossible for me to introduce my hand though i have a very small one or any other instrument wherewith i could deliver her i therefore declared to the good women that it was not possible to deliver her at all except by the caesarian section which i did not care to meddle with etc but soon after i left her there was an english physician named chamberlen recommended by somebody to visit her  when he came and heard how it was and what had passed he seemed exceedingly surprised that a man of so much experience as i was reputed to have could not deliver her yet for all that he assured them that he would deliver her in less than half a quarter of an hour let the difficulty be what it would accordingly he set about the work but instead of finishing it in half a quarter of an hour as he had promised he worked above three hours secret and all without any intermission except to breath a little now and then and at last having spent to no purpose both his strength and art and seeing the poor woman ready to expire in his hands he was obliged to give it up and declared also that it was not possible to deliver her the poor woman died with her child in her belly about twentyfour hours after he left her upon opening the body i found the womb pierced and tore in several places by the instruments that physician had blindly used without the guidance of his hand which being much larger than mine could not be introduced nevertheless this physician had come from england to paris about six months before in hopes of making his fortune he gave it out that he had a particular secret for delivering children when the head presented and bragged that he could lay the most troublesome and dangerous in half a quarter of an hour nay he had even proposed to the kings first physician that if he would give him  0000 crowns he would discover his secret but the bad success of the forementioned case put him so much out of humor that he returned a few days afterward to england  does not this story show how little dependence there is upon secrets though never so positively recommended does not this show how cautious people ought to be in believing of them does not this show that though they may be really useful in some cases yet they are not so in all as they commonly pretend  preface i shall now take leave to offer an apology for not publishing the secret i mention we have to extract children without hooks where other artists use them viz there being my father and two brothers living that practice this art i cannot esteem it my own to dispose of a pretty and reasonable excuse indeed nor publish it without injury to them but there was not a word of this when he was bargaining with the french kings first physician and think i have not been unserviceable to my country although i do but inform them that the forementioned three persons of our family and myself can serve them in these extremities with greater safety than others  if wards pill or any other quack medicine was found by experience to be generally of use in this that or the other disease it may be sent with proper directions to all parts of the kingdom so that the most distant inhabitants would have almost the same benefit of it with those among whom mr ward lived and consequently mr ward might very justly say that notwithstanding he would not discover what his medicine was composed of because it would be worth so much yearly to him and his successors yet his country was obliged to him for telling them where they might purchase so beneficial a remedy  but how few in the whole community could be the better for all the manual operations in midwifery four men could perform can four men deliver all the good women in england who want their assistance supposing they were to ride post night and day after them is there any proportion between the benefit the public would receive from the quack medicines and the secret manual operations of four men what service is it then to the country in general for the doctor to tell them that he and three others can serve them with greater safety than other men  nevertheless i am far from thinking that the public has any right to expect that every private man who at a considerable expense and assiduous study makes any considerable discovery in manual operations which cannot be made universally useful as medicines may and really are except they are fully and distinctly explained should always communicate gratis the fruits of his labor and expense no they ought to be handsomely rewarded not only for the real service they have done but to encourage industry in others  but the doctor offered to discover this secret to the french for ten thousand crowns pray why did he not make the same offer to his country had not his country better have given each of them ten thousand crowns than exposed so many thousands of beautiful women and innocent children to the danger  hooks sharp instruments etc the doctor exclaims so much against surely yes  dr chamberlen page     says the author viz mauriceau you see was only a surgeon pray what would he have him be a doctor an apothecary or what are not these operations merely chirurgical who then can be so fit to perform them as surgeons are not the superioris sortis i who never delivered one of them as capable of directing for them both before and after delivery as any doctor or apothecary who had laid several no doubt of it they are much more capable and it is very surprising they dont assert their own right and ours what then can dr chamberlen mean by this sneer this sarcasm especially when mr mauriceau is then talking as much to the purpose as ever he or any body else did on that subject viz that when a woman has a violent flooding etc the best way to serve her is to deliver her as soon as possible whether at full time or no prove the contrary who can  in page     he explains himself a little more plainly mr mauriceau says a surgeon ought always to endeavor to bring the children alive upon which the doctor makes the following most insolent remark and therefore undertake what he can safely perform and what he cannot leave to others that may pray who be they doctors apothecaries shavers or nostrummongers for life is not to be played with  is not the good which surgeons do their patients as evident as the sun e g when they cut for the stone when they perforate the scull reduce a luxation etc neither of which can be affected only by the strength of nature but as the learned and honest baglivi frankly owns it is often doubtful whether the cure supposed to be performed even by physicians of the first rank was mostly owing to nature or the medicines etc which they directed eg in fevers small pox consumptions etc what ground had he then to charge the surgeons with playing with life the doctor owns page    that surgeons only practice midwisery in france and so they do or ought to do every where else  but how far the doctor went out of his own ken when he talked to surgeons in such a magisterial and dictatorial way in matters merely chirurgical the three following cases will evidently demonstrate case   mr mauriceau page     says that childrens gums ought to be cut with a lancet though nurses sometimes do it with their nails yet our commentator says a thin groat a small piece of silver is as good or better than either whence it is evident our translator was only a doctor notwithstanding he takes upon him to direct the surgeons in such an imperious and dictatorial way yet in this observation he betrays himself and plainly shows he did not understand this very little part of surgery even so well as the very nurses the method he proposes is so far from being better than mauriceaus he takes upon him so freely and publicly to correct that it is worse than that used by the old women as will appear at sight to every proper judge case   mr mauriceau page     says when by the first fastening of the crotchet the head is drawn a little lower you may loosen it out of the first place to fasten it further up that stronger hold may be taken and so successively removing and fastening of it till the head is quite born etc dr chamberlen this is needless and dangerous in case crotchets be used unless they lose their hold  can any thing expose a mans judgment more than finding fault in the wrong place would not this remark convince any man that he had never used a crotchet nay that he did not know how to use it the doctor himself allows that crotchets are absolutely necessary in some cases and considering his large share of practice it is impossible but some of these very cases must fall in his way pray what did he do then did he use the crotchet himself or did he send for a surgeon to use it for him case   of a violent flooding mr mauriceau page    the woman being put into a proper posture the surgeon having well greased his hand introduces the end of his fingers into the mouth of the womb then opens them gently to dilate it i e by little and little without either great violence or hurry wide enough to admit his whole hand then if the membranes are not broke let him break them then though the head presents let him search for the feet and draw it forth by them because there is better hold and more easy to deliver by them than by the head or any other part of the body dr chamberlen without it could be done without hooks as mentioned in the preface of the translator  if this is not puzzling the cause if this is not amusing and confounding people instead of instructing them pray what can be called so is not bringing the child out by the feet as mr mauriceau directs bringing it out without hooks besides dont every body know that it may be quicker brought away by the feet than by the head and that the sooner the woman is delivered the sooner the flooding will stop is not this making good bad is not this finding fault where there is none dont this prove that mr mauriceau was a good and faithful surgeon and that chamberlen was only a  doctor  thus upon the whole i think it is evident that dr chamberlens main design in his preface and notes upon mr mauriceaus book was to puzzle rather than instruct the midwomen or midmen to persuade them that he and the rest of the nostrummongers could serve them better than any other artists and to represent physicians though unacquainted with almost every other part of surgery as fitter persons to deliver women in labor than surgeons etc  in      dr hody published     cases in midwifery written some years before by the late ingenious and experienced mr william giffard surgeon and manmidwife in which he has given the following account of the ignorance of the midwomen and its fatal consequences  case i i was fetched to the wife of a chairman and found one arm of the child sunk down without the outer orifice and the shoulder and side so engaged and sunk so low that i could neither return the arm nor with all my strength move the other parts to fetch it by the feet another manmidwife  had been there before me who at first would not attempt any thing without a sum of money was laid down a great piece of inhumanity too many are guilty of but upon assurances that he should be paid he worked upon the poor woman and left her in a worse condition than he found her thus you see midmen are not all witches any more than the midwomen however this was the state i found her in which gave me occasion to reprimand the midwife telling her she had not sent for help in time and not till she had worked upon her which had occasioned those parts to be funk so low and so strongly engaged that i could neither return the arm nor pass my hand the whole passage being stopped up on every side to fetch it by the feet which might have been very easily done had i been sent for in time the case being so desperate at first i was at a loss where to begin her pulse was very languid and low and she was in cold sweats so that i feared she would die under the fatigue and pain she must of necessity undergo then he twisted off the arm and with great difficulty extracted the rest of the infant with his crotchet yet after all this woman recovered q   whether one in fifty recovers after such a job q   whether this bad posture of the child the great suffering and danger of the mother might not have been prevented nay and the childs life saved had a skilful midwoman attended  case ii the child was born dead which is generally the fate of those children whose placenta offers first madam du tertre head midwoman in the hotel dieu at paris and author of one of the best books on this subject published in      says the placenta offering before the child is the most certain sign of its being dead enter les signs qui nous font connoistre que lenfant est mort le plus certain est lorsque larrierefais est sorty avaunt luy instruction familiere etc  if a proper person be not at hand to deliver them immediately who can be so proper who is so likely to be in the way as a skilful midwoman but as long as they want skill to perform it the child must die before a midman can be brought  case iii the midwife informed me that the navelstring was thrust into the vagina beyond the os internum but could not inform me what other part presented many midwives are ignorant of the method of touching which oftentimes occasions very great misfortunes both to mother and infant and sometimes is the death of both but most commonly of the child is not destroying one bad enough which being for some time engaged in a wrong posture and the waters gone off the uterus is so collapsed it gives great trouble to the operator much more pain to the mother and very often as i said before occasions the death of the infant all which may be prevented if a skilful operator is sent for in time but much better if a skilful operatrix attended  case iv i visited a woman who had been some days in labor and the midwife affirmed that the waters run off the preceding day and that she thought a foot presented but upon my touching i found it to be the hand bent backwards wards in the passage and protruded out of the inner orifice up to the shoulder  case v the midwife told me that one hand and the arm was sliped down into the vagina and that it had laid so for some hours and the waters she said were gone of several hours before the hand was protruded i rebuked her as he very well might for not sending sooner she alleged for excuse that her labor might have succeeded in time then i told her that it was impossible in the posture the child presented it could ever be born  case vi the midwife told me that one child had been born and another remained behind that the membranes with the waters pressed forwards and were very tight at every pain but the woman having flooded very much after the birth of the first child the midwife could not tell me what part of the second presented i blamed the midwife for not sending for me sooner etc whereupon i passed up my hand and found the membranes much extended with the waters and the legs of the infant which the midwife knew nothing of not knowing how to touch pressed forward into the vagina  case vii upon examining the midwife at my first coming how the child presented she answered etc this convinced me of the midwifes ignorance in the method and knowledge of touching and i could wish it was not too common i have generally found them ignorant in this point which often occasions the death both of mother and infant why did not he do his endeavor to amend this great evil what signifies finding fault with them in every page without attempting a remedy and gives a great deal of pain to the manmidwife  case viii i was sent for to a woman whose child was brought out to the shoulders where it had stuck for about three hours the midwife not knowing how to draw out the arms and the head they had also sent for another midwife before i got there but she knew not how to extricate the child out of this snare then i extracted it but the child was dead which could not otherwise be expected since it had been so long held in that posture  case ix i first enquired of the midwife how matters stood in general but she giving me no satisfactory account i descended to particulars i then asked her if the membranes were broke and if so how long before to which she could not give a ready answer so that i found her thoroughly ignorant i next enquired how long the navelstring had been fallen down her answer was several hours i told her i e rebuked her etc  case x i was sent for to a person whose child was born and the placenta left behind upon my coming there the midwife told me that she had attempted by all methods she was mistress of to fetch it but could not succeed wherefore considering the length of time from the bringing of the foetus to my coming i thought no more time ought to be lost and immediately put up my hand and found the inner orifice so much contracted that at first i could scarce pass up the ends of my two forefingers but after some time i dilated it so much that i was able to pass my hand etc  this case will show us what difficulties people often fall into from the ignorance of the midwife in not knowing how to pass their hands as soon as the foetus is protruded  case xi i found the scalp was extended and separated from the cranium this i judged to have proceeded from the midwifes top rudely handling the head  case xii the midwife being very ignonorant was not able to give me a satisfatory account of the case i found the labia pudendi very much swelled etc wherefore irebuked the midwife telling her that when she had done all the mischief she could then she persuaded them to send for me this is a common fault amongst them not being willing to have further help till matters are come to the last extremity  case xiii i thereupon passed up my hand into the vagina and found the parts somewhat swelled by the midwifes too rudely handling them  case xiv upon passing my hand i found the midwife had been too busy for the arm was sunk low and much swelled not knowing better she had endeavored to bring it away in the posture it presented whereupon i rebuked her telling her that by her so doing she had made bad work and showed her that it was almost he might have said altogether impossible to bring it away in the posture it came in  case xv this case should be a caution to midwives to send for help in time when a child comes footling and not to venture unless they are very skilful to bring it forwards but whose fault is it they are not all very skilful why are they suffered to practice who are not very skilful would not madam du tertre have laughed at any man who should have told her she must not venture to bring a child forwards when the feet presents are not our women as capable of being taught as the french women  case xvi i came and the midwife being a novice in her profession was not capable of giving proper directions she should have advised the laboring woman to have kept back as much as possible her throws and not forced downwards and she ought to have passed her hand up and pressed against the childs buttocks to retain it from slipping down whenever the pains pressed forwards  or which would have been much more to the purpose put up her hand laid hold of the feet and brought it away by them but the midwife neglecting to give this advice or to act in this manner i found the hip of the infant with the scrotum sunk low into the vagina and strongly engaged between the bones of the pelvis so that i could not move it by any means  case xvii i found things very bad which in a great measure proceeded from the ignorance of the midwife i therefore rebuked her for her carelessness etc  case xviii i enquired of the midwife if the waters were broke how long they had been gone off and what part presented she told me that the waters had been run off some hours but what part presented she knew not i soon perceived her ignorance for upon passing my singers i found the membranes protruded by the waters beyond the os internum into the vagina about the bigness os a pigs bladder so that the waters were not gone off as she said for some hours and being ignorant of the method of touching it was impossible she could tell what part presented  case xix i was called about six in the morning and the midwife told me that the membranes were broke and the waters flowed off about twelve oclock at night and that the first part which presented was the elbow i rebuked her for staying so long before she sent for help and i soon discovered her ignorance for she told me that she had delivered several children where the arm came first in the same posture and some were born alive etc the child was born dead which i imagined to proceed from its lying so long in the posture i found it and the midwifes too rudely pulling the arm when it first fell into the passage in hopes as she thought to have brought away the child in the posture it presented by her violent pulling she had almost separated the arm from the shoulder  this is one amongst the many inconveniences that occur from the ignorance of midwives had i been sent for as soon as the membranes were broke and before the shoulder by reiterated pains was so strongly locked between the bones of the pelvis most of my trouble and the childs life might have been saved undoubtedly or if she had had skill enough to have done it herself  case xx when i came i found the child protruded to the hips which hung out beyond the labia pudendi the midwife told me that the waters run off about an hour before that the child presented with the feet first and that when she had brought it to the buttocks it stuck there nor could she bring it any further i rebuked her for not sending at first when she found it to present in a wrong posture but she in excuse as is usual amongst them told me that she had brought out many children offering in that posture  she must indeed have been a very ordinary midwife if she had not the child from its having lain some time so pressed was dead which i told her was very probably owing to her neglect in not sending sooner when she was satisfied the child presented wrong  case xxi upon examination of the childs head i found a tumor about the bigness of a pigeons egg on its upper part arising as i judged from the midwifes too rudely handling it or  which is much more probable it is lying so long locked between the bones but it is their way to haul the midwomen in head and shoulders guilty or not guilty  case xxii i rebuked the midwife for not sending sooner telling her the danger she had exposed the poor woman to by her delay she in excuse answered me that she had never had such an accident before although she had been a midwife above eleven years however i found she was very ignorant  case xxiii this case viz the placenta being lest behind occasioned a flooding should be a caution to all midwives not to delay sending early and not depend too far on their own skill and experience for it is plain this poor woman died a martyr to either the midwifes ignorance or vain opinion of her own selfsufficiency which too much prevails amongst them  case xxiv passing my hand into the vagina i found the arm bent and broke by the midwifes too rudely handling it the child was born dead which proceeded as i judged from its long lying in so uneasy a posture and from the midwifes ignorance in not knowing how to keep up the arm etc  case xxv menmidwives frequently find great difficulty in passing their hand into the womb when from the ignorance of the midwife they are obliged to fetch the placenta after the child has been born some time the os internum being upon these occasions generally very much contracted pray is not a midwomans hand easier passed at first than a midmans at last  case xxvi one foot presented but the midwife thinking herself capable of delivering the woman being in her own opinion very selfsufficient although she was very ignorant would not at first send for assistance etc  case xxvii as soon as the midwife found that the hands presented she sent for me this is what midwives seldom do  a black swan indeed trusting too much to and depending upon their own sufficiency which very often occasions the loss of the child and sometimes of the mother  case xxviii the midwifes ignorance in not knowing how to pass her hand occasioned this uneasiness  case xxix this is one among the many misfortunes that attend a manmidwife when he he is sent for too late proceeding from the negligence supineness ignorance or selfsufficiency of the midwife which last prevails in most of them and is very often the occasion of the loss either of the mother or child or sometimes both  case xxx the ignorance of the midwife in not knowing how to keep up the womb from being forced before the head so low into the vagina was what added so much to my difficulty in delivering this woman  case xxxi when i came i found all but the head was protruded beyond the labia pudendi but that stuck above although the midwife had pulled so strongly that she had near separated the body from the head the midwife being ignorant did not take care to turn the childs face toward the spine of the mother as the body advanced however i brought it out in a minutes time this surprised all that were present because the midwife had been working above an hour without making any advance had i been there early i might very probably have saved the life of the child but selfsufficiency joined with an idle notion that they suffer in their character if they send for a mans assistance generally prevents most midwives from sending early by which they too often endanger the lives of both mothers and children and give no small trouble to the manmidwife  case xxxii the midwife could not fetch the placenta for as she was ignorant in the method of passing her hand into the uterus up to the body of the placenta to examine whether it adhered to it she had only pulled by the end of the string which hung out and so had very near broke it close to the placenta she had made no ligature upon the end of the string therefore a hemorrhage had ensued and the woman had lost a great quantity os blood midwives very often depend too much upon their own judgment and think themselves selfsufficient so that they postpone sending for help in time whereby the poor women become victims to their ignorance or selfconceit  case xxxiil the childs arm presented several hours before i was sent for upon which i rebuked the midwife for not sending sooner but she to justify herself had the assurance to to tell me that she had brought out several children presenting in that manner whereupon i showed her the impossibility of it and advised her for the future always to send for help as soon as she should find the hand to present first and not by pulling the hand draw it further down and engage the shoulder in the passage as she had now done pray would it not have been much more seasonable advice to have shown her how to pass her hand and get hold of the feet etc  case xxxiv the nurse came and told me the child was born but the midwife was soiled in her attempts to fetch away the placenta i went and found the midwife was both ignorant of the cause of its being retained and the method of passing the hand to extract it yet i brought it away whole in less than half a minutes time which much surprised both the woman and the bystanders the midwife having spent so much time without being able to effect it sometimes a man gets more credit by doing nothing than by a difficult operation  case xxxv the manmidwifes being sent for so late too often proceeds from the ignorance or selfsufficiency of the midwife  but oftener from the modesty of the women covetousness or real poverty of the men etc who either not knowing how to behave in difficult cases or fearing she should suffer in her character should she desire assistance puts off the calling in of a manmidwife to the last extremity so that the mother and child too often become victims either to her negligence or ignorance  case xxxvi the midwife depending upon her own sufficiency although she was very ignorant had let the child advance too far without taking care to turn and bring the face backwards toward the os sacrum and had for some time endeavored to bring out the head but to no purpose wherefore i was at last sent for and found the parts very dry and somewhat swelled by the rude handling of the midwife  case xxxvii the woman had been in labor fortyeight hours the midwife being very ignorant could neither tell me how the child presented nor at what time the membranes broke but answered me according to her dialect that it was a dry labor  case xxxviii the child was brought into the world all but the head where it had stuck two or three hours before i came the midwife being very ignorant was not able to do the business herself nor would she send for assistance in time so that the child was lost and the mother narrowly escaped  case xxxix the midwife in attempting to bring away the placenta had inverted the uterus for i found the whole body of the uterus with the placenta adhering to it is fundus hanging out beyond the labia pudendi i rebuked the midwife for not sending sooner and told her that she through her ignorance was the immediate cause of this womans death before i examined her the midwife told me that the placenta was partly brought out being ignorant that she had also pulled out the womb etc  case xl but the midwife by pulling the navelstring too rudely had broke it off near the placenta which was left in the womb as soon as i came i passed up my hand where i found the placenta entirely separated from the uterus and partly protruded into the vagina so that i readily brought it away and in so short a time that the people that were present were greatly surprised had the midwife understood how to have passed her hand she might easily have brought away the burden before and for want of this knowledge some women fall into violent floodings whence faintings convulsions and death a wonderful operation indeed but does she deserve the name of a midwoman who could not have extracted it as quick as he  case xli had i been sent for before the membranes were broke the waters passed off the arm slipped down and the back part of the shoulder so rivetted i might not only have preserved the child but prevented the mothers suffering so much pain and have likewise saved myself much fatigue and trouble without doubt  it is too true that many midwives are ignorant of the method of touching  and it is as true they might with very little trouble be taught and therefore are incapable of judging in what manner the child presents until an arm or some other part is protruded into the vagina which is often so locked between the bones of the pelvis that it is scarce possible to remove it and too often they depend so much upon their own sufficiency and delay sending for assistance in time that both the mother and child but more frequently the latter die martyrs to their presumption  case xlii i was sent for about two in the morning the midwife had delivered the child about six the evening before but not being able notwithstanding all her endeavors to bring away the placenta she at last left the woman telling her that it would in time come away and that she had known it retained fourteen days without any inconveniency but as this was a doctrine i was a stranger to and being on the contrary well satisfied that inconveniences might attend should it not be speedily drawn away therefore   case xliii the childs arm was slipped out into the vagina which as soon as the midwife observed who was first sent for she proposed that a manmidwife should be sent for telling those that were present that it was not a midwifes business whereupon another midwife was sent for who pretended to do the work of a manmidwife and at first gave them assurances that she would deliver her but after she had worked upon her for half an hour or longer putting her into several postures as kneeling standing etc she left her in a much worse condition than she found her for being ignorant of the method of delivery when a child offered in the manner this did she truly had endeavored to draw the child forward in the same posture it presented whereby she had drawn the hand out and part of the arm beyond the labia pudendi and almost separated it at the shoulder the temerity joined to the ignorance of this midwife very much increased the difficulty of laying her if i had been sent for in time i might with much more ease have delivered the woman and withal have saved the child i have meet with some midwives who have had the ignorance and assurance to tell me that they have delivered children thus presenting without turning and bringing them by the feet  in      mr chapman published an essay on the improvement of midwifery wherein he compliments the midwomen as follows preface i was induced to write the following essay on the improvement of midwifery because i found that all books hitherto written on this subject were calculated more for the instruction of my own sex than the other this had certainly been a very reasonable inducement had it not been a mistake but the forementioned madam du tertre says she composed her book for the use of the midwives apprentices in the hotel dieu composee par margarite du tertre etc en faveur des apprentisses sagefemmes dudit hotel dieu  madam lovys burgeois whose book was translated into english and published in london school says she put it forth for the sole use of the midwives is it possible these midwomen and many more who might be mentioned could have the instruction of the midmen chiefly in view why would not he believe their own declaration  preface i have daily during the space of above twenty years practice seen many fatal mistakes committed by midwives pray what sort of midwives must these have been who committed fatal mistakes every day for above twenty years together ought they not to have been restrained from practicing nay even punished by the civil magistrate  which i think could not have happened had they ever read a treatise so properly adapted to their capacities and at the same time so full and plain as the following q whether if they had read madam du tertres little book they would not have found it more properly adapted to their capacities as full and plain and her sentiments more accurately expressed  my greatest aim in it is faithfully to instruct and point out to them those dangerous rocks on which many have been cast away that they may either be able to give better assistance themselves or at least to see the danger time enough to call in superior advice  notwithstanding this formal declaration etc i am afraid his greatest aim will appear to be much the same with dr chamberlens viz to tell the midwomen when and in what particular cases to send for his superior advice and not to instruct them how to give better advice themselves  i have met with several midwives especially in this metropolis that are extremely well qualified however  well or ill qualified i must beg leave to give them this one piece of advice viz that where any material difficulty occurs they would readily and in time call in our assistance as when a child presents with it is head but does not with a proper degree of pain fall any lower when the posture happens to be wrong and consequently the child requires turning  may not the posture be wrong and yet not want turning e g when the fect or hips present may not the posture be wrong and the midwoman as able to turn it as any midman but more especially that they would not delay to send for a man in case of floodings or other threatening symptoms  pray can this be called instructing them faithfully as he proposes in his exordium or telling them when to send for superior advice is it not plainly declaring as the doctor had done before that in his opinion they know no more of the matter than to receive a child which comes away as it were of itself without any the least difficulty would he not had he designed to have instructed them faithfully how to give better assistance themselves explained to them how and after what manner to remove all these difficulties and threatening symptoms he supposes instead of only telling them to send speedily for superior advice but pray what are the poor midwomen to do in places where no superior advice i e no midmen are to be had he has made no provision for them as dr chamberlen did page    after giving his directions when he thinks they should send for superior advice he first coaxes and then threatens them as the doctor did above  i believe this advice will not be thought impertinent by the most experienced midwives who by the by i have ever found most ready to call in farther assistance and indeed they find their account in it whilst it is quite otherwise with those who from too great an opinion of their own judgment and abilities run great hazards or at the best call us in too late and so lose their good name and justly suffer in their reputation the best midwives send early for advice upon the appearance of danger and difficulty the suffering fair readily consents to it and by this means both lives are saved pray are not these two speeches both picked out of dr chamberlens preface pray would not the suffering fair have been much more obliged to her midwoman if she had performed the work herself and thereby saved her both the uneasiness and expense of superior advice  nay in the following paragraph he takes off the mask and plainly tells them he has got a secret which he must keep to himself pray is keeping of secrets consistent with his former declartion page    viz my greatest aim is faithfully to instruct them  when the head presents and sticks in the passage it can only be extracted with safety to the child by a fillet or the forceps the former of these i must beg leave to be silent in as being entirely an invention of my own  sub judice lis est nor shall i i hope be censured for my so doing any more than the great dr chamberlen was for his choosing to conceal the method or secret whereby he could extract children in this case without hooks where other artists are forced to use them  was there ever such an excuse heard of because the great dr chamberlen acted a very ungenerous part in this affair therefore mr chapman must be excused for doing just the same thing might he not as well have said the doctor had been guilty of symony or sacrilege and was not punished for it therefore he might for that reason expect the same grace in case he should take it in his head to commit the same crimes  in page    he says here i only passed a fillet over the head and thereby delivered her of a living child this method of extracting with a fillet is an art known but to very few i doubt not he will find himself as much mistaken in this assertion as he was when he affirmed that he was the second englishman who wrote originally and professedly on this subject and that all books hitherto written on this subject were calculated more for the instruction of the men than of the women etc nor should it ever be attempted but by a very skilful operator such as   page   he says if the child offers any other part than the head be what it will the hand is to be passed gently into the womb the feet are to be searched for the child to be turned and that way to be brought forth page  0 a child presenting with it is head is often to be turned and delivered with the feet first in all other postures whatever always with the feet first  but suppose a foot or the feet present what need have we then to pass the hand into the womb to fetch them and suppose the buttocks present and are sunk so low in the passage that they cannot be pushed back without danger is it not much easier safer and quicker to slip the fingers over the bend of the thigh or over the ossa ilia and draw it forward in that posture than to run the risk of forcing them back to look for the feet  though it is plain from these quotations that mr chapman notwithstanding his twentyfive years practice was perfectly unacquainted with this case yet that good old woman madam du tertre etc describes it very accurately viz that when the buttocks present low in the passage the child should be extracted as it offers les pieds font les parties par ou lon peut tire lenfant lors quil ne present pas la test la primiere except quand il se present en double quon peut le titer par les fesses si ce font les fesses que lenfant present que fautil fair  si davanture lenfant est embarasse au passage and que les cuisses soient couchees sur son ventre and les jambes sur la poitrine il faut laisser venir lenfant en cette posture mais sil est eleve au dessus des os pubis il faut aller chercher un pied etc     page ii sometimes the pain shall be strong and true the head of the child very low and bearing forcibly down every pain yet the mouth of the womb loath as it were to open shall be but very little dilated even after many hours pain e g i visited a woman who had been many hours in labor the head of the child lay in the vagina so low in the pains that the unskilful midwife who had never touched the mouth of the womb which lay more than ordinary backwards had given hopes of delivery the very next pain here i did no more than with my finger dilate and cast the part viz the mouth of the womb back and so in a few minutes opened the door and released the little prisoner pray would not madam du tertres finger have released the prisoner as soon and as safely as his did that there has been great difficulties occasioned by the lothness of the mouth of the womb to open viz in elderly women when callous schirrous etc no man will will deny but there is not the least sign of any difficulty or lothness of the mouth of the womb to open in this case mr chapman brings to prove that the pains may be strong and true etc and yet the mouth of the womb loath as it were to open shall be very little dilated the difficulty in his case consisted only in the unnatural situation of the os tincae which prevented the heads pressing directly on it otherwise it would have opened with all imaginable ease and speed as you see it did when he touched it with his finger  page     dipping the infants hand when hanging out of the womb in cold water rubbing it with ice or touching it with a wet cloth which some ignorant midwives practice etc pray how many midwomen did he ever know guilty of these fooleries  page  0 i once delivered a woman where the childs arm had been eighteen hours in the world and much swelled by the long time and ignorance of the midwife who pulled violently at the arm every pain not knowing that it was impossible to deliver a full grown infant by that method  page  0 or perhaps pull down the fundus uteri and so invert the matrix which is a case i have several times met with after rough and ignorant midwives which may serve as a warning to others how they pull at the string etc  page    he says that most midwives tie the string at too great a distance from the childs belly which occasions ruptures etc afterward it is very certain however that more than two inches of the string itself from the navel is unnecessary whereas i have commonly known midwives leave five or six  here mr chapman again fancies he has told us a secret but if you look into that good old woman madam du tertre you will find these words  elle nouera le cordon ou ombilic a deux doigts du nombril de lenfant etc i e she must tie the string two inches from the childs navel where now is the mighty secret he makes such a fuss about is it any thing more than an old woman told us before he was born  page    few midwives are sufficiently apprised of this unhappy symptom viz a violent flooding  i differ so far from mr chapman in this assertion that in my opinion there is not one midwoman in a thousand who knows not that a violent flooding will either occasion abortion or death  page    i was called to a woman who had lain ten or twelve hours with the head of the child born but the midwife being ignorant of the pains going off suffered the infant to stop there  case of a violent flooding page    one of her friends was of opinion that she ought to be delivered but the midwife resisted and said that she never yet had forced a labor and that she would hot begin then terrifying the unhappy sufferer by telling her that if she was delivered she would certainly die and so she did because she was not delivered  page    i was called to a woman whose vagina came down before the head of the child hanging far out of the body this by an ignorant midwife was taken for a water and accordingly she had scratched and endeavored to break the membrane as she foolishly thought it  page    i attended a woman who was delivered by natural pains in about two hours upon passing my hand as my constant practice is immediately to fetch the placanta i found another child which i soon brought away with two distinct placentas pray is it not every bodys practice to pass their hand immediately and examine if there is any more children and if no more to fetch the placenta what then is there extraordinary in it that it deserves to be noted so emphatically viz as my constant practice is did not madam du tertre etc do so elle doit prendre guard quil ny ait point un autre enfant avaunt de travailler a delivrer la femme etc et sur tout se souvenir de ne jamais delivrer la femme que premierement lon ait remarque quil ny ait point un autre enfant   now had an ignorant midwife been concerned in this case who had only taken the first child and afterbirth the last would probably have been left behind but suppose an experienced midwife had been concerned how would it have been then was there any such great feat done by him in this case which she could not have done as well and so either violent floodings or a bad fever would have ensued and as the woman was before very ill and extremely weak it would very likely have cost her life thus you see let a midwoman be present or not present guilty or not guilty it is all one they must be hauled in and condemned for an imaginary as well as for a real fault  page    i was sent for in great haste to a woman in labor but on my arrival found her dead i conjectured she had died by flooding but was told she had not however the midwife told me that the afterbirth stuck so fast in one part that she was not able with all her strength to take it from her upon which i desired to see the corpse and found to my great surprise that the matrix was inverted and hung down between her thighs with the placenta adhering to its fundus which i separated before the midwife and several matrons there present and convinced them all of the dismal accident this woman had it seems a very good and easy labor of the child but then she midwise pulled hard at the navelstring and so brought down the matrix which as soon as she could take hold of she did and then pulled with fresh violence and not being deterred by the loudest cries the poor miserable woman fell into convulsions and deliquiums and soon expired this was a young healthy mother cut off in the bloom of life and cast into the cold arms of death just as she was about to clasp her firstborn in her own a shocking case indeed  page    i have been called to three women where i found the vagina quite broke through in the back part by the midwifes rudely thrusting up her hand in order to come at the opening of the womb which in all these three happened to lie very forwards under the os pubis two of these died in a few days after and the other recovered beyond my expectation  page    i was sent for to a gentlewoman who kept a tavern in ipswich the child was dead and the mother flooding she was attended by no less than two midwives and a surgeon just then set out in the profession when they had all used their endeavors to little or no purpose i was called in and delivered her in a minute i left her under the care of dr beeston but she died in six or seven days  mr chapman indeed has not told this young gentlemans name but has described him so well that i doubt there is not a man in all ipswich nor perhaps twenty miles round but can tell who he means what injury might not such a tale do a worthy young fellow but how consistent this story is with the advice he gives to others page     i leave the reader to determine  preface but the dignity of this art will appear to every person in a much more advantageous light if we reflect on the learning of the professors of it e g dr c  dr m  dr w  dr g  dr a  dr b  dr gregoire tota notus in urbe etc  the improvements these great men have made in this art have effectually wiped away that load of slander and ignominy with which this profession was formerly branded  pray have nor ninetynine in a hundred of these great men he talks of kept their improvements if they ever made any to themselves dont most of them now as well as he pretend to have secrets dont they endeavor to puzzle at the same time they make a show of instructing others dont they very seldom if ever consult together as they always ought to do in difficult or dangerous cases what can hinder them except the fear of discovering the insignificancy of their pretended secrets or their real ignorance nay dr chamberlen himself page    blames them for this and very justly observes even with some regret this great fault in practitioners it were to be wished rather than hoped for that practitioners in difficult and dangerous cases whereof they have no certain knowledge would consult and not destroy one or more by undertaking what they cannot well perform or discourage patients from sending for other help or advice putting life in balance with their reputation  i very readily agree with the doctor that practitioners in midwifery should consult together when any thing very difficult or dangerous occurs with the same freedom and unreservedness as in other cases of surgery viz luxations fractures mortifications etc wherein consists the disreputation of consulting in this more than in any other case are there not more lives concerned in these than in any other cases is not consulting the only way of preserving instead of losing their reputation and the patients lives  in      mr chapman published a treatise on midwifery in the preface to which he says i own i had some assistance in regard to the diction and did not send my papers to the press until that was revised and corrected  can he be a tolerable judge of diction himself who suffers his friend to write womanmidwife womenmidwives etc words used by no body except the learned dr maubray who mr chapman or his corrector calls that ingenious and laborious author but to give a specimen first of his ingenuity he begins a large book which he calls the whole art of midwifery etc thus sect i cap   of god cap   of nature cap   of man cap   of the soul sect ii cap   of maidenhood cap   of virginity cap   of the virgindisease cap   of love cap   of copulation etc now pray what relation what connection is there between these outoftheway subjects and midwifery might he not as properly have introduced what he had to say about midwifery with an account of ratcatching rabbitbreeding or sowgelding  pray does it show most ingenuity or stupidity to jumble several subjects together which have no manner of relation connection or analogy with one another or with his main design by way of introduction secondly of his laboriousness i cannot but own that every page is labored but in such a manner that he often forgets in less than a leaf what he intended to account for or prove and leaves you as much in the dark as he found you and that he has spent a great deal of labor upon collecting from romances popish legends etc a parcel of idle groundless nay ridiculous tales and tells them with all imaginable gravity and seeming earnestness and very seriously undertakes to account for unaccountables e g page    he tells us st austin and who would not believe a popish saint tho he asserted that he saw a rabbit kitten monkeys polecats or foxes writes of a man who could sweat whenever he had a mind and i have likewise known some persons my self who could weep and shed abundance of tears at will and pleasure utrum horum yea and farther yet many learned authors pontan amat lusitan etc testify by diverse examples that women have been turned into men which some attribute to the force of imagination but though i am no ways to question the veracity of what so many excellent men have confirmed is there any other man living who would not question them yet i think we may find more probable reasons for it than all the powers of imagination whereof i shall mention that which seems to be the most rational cause viz an extinguished or latent forming faculty here sax praelect pract part iii cap 0 which however sometimes has exerted itself again like the blazing of a raked or resuscitated fire  i hope mr chapman will explain this ingenious account of this incredible phenomenon in his next edition for i must own as it stands it is far beyond my comprehension and that the account he gives of it is so very sublime that it rather puzzles than instructs me pray what does he mean by an extinguished or latent forming faculty and wherein lies the analogy between that and the blazing of a raked or resuscitated fire  he has been so justly and tartly reprimanded for the absurd and false account of the sooterkin de suyger or sucker by the late reverend and learned dr archibald mitchel the sooterkin dissected      utriusque medicinae doctor that i shall only add one observation to what he has advanced viz that dr maubray had the assurance to assert in the forementioned book page     that he had talked to some of the most learned men in the seven provinces about this sooterkin de suyger or sucker and that they ingenuously told him that it was so common a thing that scarce one woman in three escaped this kind of strange birth nay and that his own practice among them afterward confirmed it so much that he always as much expected the thing de suyger as the child itself is it not surprising that he did not catch a few of these little demons or moodiwarps as he calls them and keep them in a cage rattrap or in some other more curious mechanical contrivance for the conviction of dr mitchel and other infidels pray does such a writer as this deserve the epithets of ingenious and laborious wherein does his ingenuity appear wherein is his labor of any use pray can any thing expose a mans judgment more than laughing or hissing praising or finding fault in the wrong place  what a splutter mr chapman makes page    about his breaking the membranes of the second child in order to bring it away by the feet as if he had discovered something new and then he tells us he is not a little pleased to find dr maubray agree with him exactly in this point and advise this manner of proceeding in almost the same words used by him on this occasion though the words used by dr m are very different from his nay they are perfect nonsense e g he says i would fetch the second child by the feet in case the second flooding is not yet over etc pray what does he mean by the second flooding mr chapman answers and says that by the second flooding he must mean the flowing of the waters but who besides he ever called the flowing of the waters a flooding every body else means a dangerous flux of blood by a flooding but if he had looked back as far as madam du tertre etc he would have found that very method strongly recommended and much better shorter and clearer expressed than either he or dr maubray have done it page    si elle remarque quil y a un autre enfant elle nouera le cordon ou ombilic a deux doigts du nombril de lenfant and fera une second ligature a quatre doigts au dessus de la premiere ligature puis elle coupera le cordon enter les deux apres quelle aura oste and done lenfant a quelquun elle portera la main dans la matrice pour percer les membranes dans les quelles le second enfant est contenu sil vient mal elle ira chercher les pieds and si vient la test la premiere elle pressera la mere de fair quelque effort car il est facile a lenfant de sortir les passages estant ouverts mais si la femme est foible and quelle manque de courage and que lenfant soit encore haut dans la matrice elle ira chercher les pieds comme si venoit mal cela se pouvant fair sans aucun accident pourveu que ce soient des persons qui scachent leur mestier   he makes again page    as great a rout about extracting the placenta for three pages together as if no body had known any thing of the matter before he taught them e g the placenta is never to be left to be shut up in the womb whether the labor has been natural or not and i have the satisfaction of finding dr maubray recommending this practice a great satisfaction indeed but pray can he find any body who does not recommend it as well as he and dr maubray  he censures dionis page    for saying that the placenta in an abortion of two or three months may be left to come away of itself which undoubtedly may very often be done without any danger though it is certainly safer to bring it away at first if sent for in time but if the child has been come away some time i should give myself no trouble about it till a flooding appeared because the irritation caused by the fingers when the os tincae is almost closed may be more apt to cause an inflammation flooding etc than letting it alone nay i knew it once left whole by the obstinancy of the mother who could by no means be persuaded to have it taken away between the fourth and fifth month and yet she did very well nay that experienced midman mr giffard is also of the same opinion of two evils the greater ought to be shunned there being less danger in leaving part of the afterbirth which will very often without doing any great harm come away with the lochia than in using any force in extracting it by which we very often hurt the womb pray can he imagine mr dionis did not do the needful in case a flooding did succeed  but he finds no fault with him where i think he richly deserves it when he says paris edit lib ii cap    the os tincae in a violent flooding is more conveniently dilated with an instrument and the false concepttion etc extracted with a pair of forceps than by the fingers if this is not finding fault in the wrong place pray what is is it not a most dangerous nay and unnecessary practice  page     he gives one instance of a child he delivered with the buttocks foremost but pray how does this quadrate with what he says page    of the same book if the child offers any other part than the head the hand is to be passed into the womb the feet searched for the child to be turned and brought forth by them  page     i was unwilling to have recourse to art is it not the art of midwifery which the midwomen have been taught the only thing which distinguishes them from other women are not they obliged to make use of their art at every labor they are called to why then does he so often make use of the words art and artists and only apply them to himself or some other man will not any one who reads madam du tertres little book be convinced that she has shown more art and better diction than either dr maubray or  does her being a woman make it improper to say she had recourse to art or that she was an artist but after two hours trial finding no advantage from her pains i was forced to it i first made an attempt with the fillet but the young creatures pulse began to sink and her pains falling off a little i chose to take the most speedy as well as the most secure method viz the forceps and delivered her in about two minutes  pray is not this fairly owning that the fillet he makes a secret of page    is neither so speedy nor so secure a method as the forceps why then does he keep it a secret to what purpose can he do it when he at the same time confesses the forceps which he has given us a print of though a very indifferent one and nothing new therein to be preferable  then he goes on in the same page    and says but i have been told since the first publiccation of my essay that the fillet is so far from being an invention of mine that it its generally or at least very frequently used i own indeed that it may be commonly used in turning a child by securing one foot with it as i have directed but do not believe the manner of passing it over the head to be so universally known and practiced  daventer in the appendix to his ars obstertricandi published in   0  describes and very much approves of a fillets being passed over the childs head in order to extract it and i myself have seen eight or ten different sorts of them contrived and used by different practitioners pray was not dr birchs fillet put up to be sold for  00 l by the late excellent surgeon mr jos symonds has not dr sandys had one for many years nay i hardly know one who has not in one shape or other how then can mr chapman expect to fob us off with saying that all other peoples are for the foot and his only for the head must not he think us very weak and very illiterate if we believed him might he not with as much reason assert that he or dr maubray were the first inventors of breaking the membranes of the second child in order to bring it away presently by the feet or of directing the placenta to be extracted before the uterus closed upon it or of tying the navelstring within two inches of the childs belly etc all which have been told us by madam du tertre  then he winds up the foresaid girls case page     with these solemn reflections on his own good conduct and the mishaps which would have befalin this poor woman had not he been with her had a midwife been called to this person some days not to say weeks before when her pains and complaints began to vary and as is common with young and unexperienced midwives put her upon her labor too early which i carefully avoided considering the position of the child what must have been the consequence something very frightful undoubtedly and even had a man been called who was unacquainted with the use of that noble and safe instrument the forceps he must have destroyed the child  but suppose a knowing midwoman such a one as madam du tertre etc had been with her in the room of his young and unexperienced one would not she as carefully have avoided putting her upon her labor before her time as mr chapman did and supposing a man had been there who had no forceps about him but was well acquainted with the use of daventers birchs or any other fillet except mr chapmans secret which he owns himself page    would not do could not he have extracted the child with as much safety as he did with the forceps  mr chapman page    tells us the following story a fine young lady in labor with her first child was seized with a flooding and the arm of the infant presented she immediately sent for a physician who had lately taken upon him to practice midwifery but was so little acquainted with the art that he neglected the only thing necessary in that case viz a speedy delivery by turning the child and employed restringent or styptick medicines after some hours another gentleman was called in but the lady was now very much weakened and the artist apprehensive of her expiring under his hands or immediately after delivery which indeed too often happens would make no attempt but abandoned her to her approaching fate she lived some hours after and then died im persuaded it will be allowed by the best judges that had she been immediately delivered her life might have been saved i received this account from a worthy matron who was present during the whole time  mr giffard mentions a case of the same kind therefore i choose to place them together i was sent for about five in the afternoon to a woman at battersea who had been delivered of three children about three the preceding morning but the midwife had left the afterburthens monsterous and fatal ignorance having broke off two of the strings she not knowing how to pass her hand to fetch them and being called away to another woman had left her in this condition could a turk believe there were any wholesome laws in a country where such barbarities were not severely punished another midwife was sent for but she would not attempt to bring them away fearing the woman should die and her death be laid to her charge poor unhapy woman so when i came i found the woman in the agonies of death her whole mass of blood being drained away by the continual flooding viz for fifteen hours i immediately brought them away but the womans blood and spirits were so much exhausted before that she expired in less than an hour afterward so that this woman fell a sacrifice to the ignorance of one midwife and the timidity of the other for had the burdens been brought away at first before she had lost so much blood she had been in no danger of dying they had sent for one dr  at  who instead of advising them to fetch the burdens away or coming himself to do it had sent forcing medicines which would of consequence increase the flooding and so hastened her death the three children were all born alive and well who can read this case without being shocked at it  has any of the forementioned women committed greater blunders than these doctors is it not evident from these stories that the doctor or apothecary midmen are sometimes as ignorant as the lowest class of midwomen pray where could these doctors have been admitted to their degrees must it not have been in some popish country where orthodoxy is reckoned a better recommendation than the knowledge of diseases where visiting chapels three or four times a day is thought more conducive to the making a good physician than frequenting the hospitals as often dont this show that we want a proper school for midmen as well as for midwomen  mr chapman page    tells us of a woman who had been twice or thrice delivered by a man of children that always presented with the head which the operator took a fatal freedom with viz using a hook pray how could he tell who was not present but that all these children were dead that he was obliged to use a hook because of the largeness of the childs head shoulders or belly that he was forced to destroy the child to save the mother wherein then consists this fatal freedom he talks of ought not a man to be very sure before he accuses another after this manner at last sent for me i think he is much to blame for not telling us whether this fatal freedom taker was a doctor or an apothecary midman  that excellent anatomist dr nicholls in his compendium anatomicum published in      and republished      has the following remarkable passage in omni malo situ ut and in rebus desperatis pedibus extrahetur foetus i e in every wrong posture as also in desperate cases the child is to be extracted by the feet  now pray is it not a wrong posture when the buttocks present and yet the child may be brought away with great safety both to it and the mother when they present without looking for the feet vid page       etc the case may also be very desperate and yet not possible to bring the child away by the feet e g when the head is too large and sticks in the passage when the head is born but sticks because of the largeness of the shoulders or when the belly is full of water as in the case mentioned page    etc  dr c  writes thus    0 cum vagina sit nimis angusta vel pelvis naturaliter parva vel foetus solito major una nonnuquam continua rima seu scissura ab vulva ad anum fit quod valde periculosum est and mulierem si evadat in posterum sterilem reddit  this case i have found by repeated experience not to be at all dangerous in persons otherwise healthy and am satisfied that it will contribute as little to making them barren as a broken leg  deductions from the premises thus you see what a number of children have been lost what a number of women have suffered great and needless pains and have been brought into the utmost danger of their lives nay have actually fallen martyrs sacrifices or victims as they term it in the very flower of their age to the imprudence and ignorance of midwomen nay and doctor midmen vid page       and these only from the accounts of what fell under the cognizance of two midmen viz giffard and chapman but pray how high may we suppose the account might have risen if every midman etc who practiced in england since the end of the last century i e thirtyfive years back had also made up their accounts what a black list would it be is it not shocking to think on it are not these accounts of their blunders enough to frighten the women from ever trusting to a midwoman any more but if the midwomen in and about london and westminster are so generally and so grossly ignorant as those gentlemen have represented them what must they be in the country what havoc must they make among his majestys subjects what numbers of fine women and children must daily fall a sacrifice by the very hands proh dolor from whom they expected relief is not this a melancholy and deplorable case is it not an evil which demands both a speedy and an effectual remedy can any thing better deserve the attention even of the legislature itself but granting their ignorance to be as great as they suppose pray will calling of names such as rude rough negligent ignorant foolish novice obstinate overconfident supine unskilful conceited selfsufficient errand midwives etc or rebuking blaming checking and reprimanding etc these gentlemen have so liberally bestowed upon them make them more prudent or judicious or enable them in any degree to give better assistance themselves and thereby put a stop to the great evil they complain of so loudly surely no  pray have these gentlemen complainants proposed any other method to prevent for the future this calamitous this dismal this inhuman practice except to send for one of them upon every little trifling difficulty is not this making mere nurses of the midwomen and  of their patients is it not telling them plainly that they neither do nor ever shall know any more of the matter by any information they will give them than  what they knew before just to receive a child which drops into their hands nay it is much worse it is making mere jackcalls of them i e they must hunt about in search of their prey and then send for them to devour it but these gentlemens scheme of being consulted upon every little difficulty is and always will be impracticable in many cases even in london it self and much more in the country even though the midwomen were as much at their beck as they themselves could desire   because some women are so unseasonably modest or obstinate that they cannot be prevailed on on any account to admit of a midman until it is too late   because some husbands are as much against having their wives laid by men as they themselves are   because some people are so very covetous that they will not suffer a midman to be sent for soon enough to do any good   because some people are so very poor that they cannot bear the expense of a midman   because some midmen are so very inhuman that they will not touch a poor woman except they are paid first vide page      because sometimes midmen cannot be got in time etc what would they have the poor midwomen do in these cases are they to be blamed for other peoples tempers opinions or inhumanity though they have been often to blame yet they are not always blameable what then must we do must we always employ men or continue to stand idly by and suffer our wives and children to be thus cruelly massacred by ignorant and unhallowed hands must we never attempt the cure of this malignant and most pestilent distemper by which such numbers have been and daily are destroyed because no body has hitherto endeavored to do it no we must apply an effectual remedy if it can be found charity humanity and the strongest ties of nature viz the preservation of our wives and children oblige us to do it  but how what method will or can effectually prevent the disasters complained of above for the future the ignorance of the midwomen is undoubtedly the principal if not the sole cause of these dire events and their unskilfulness is certainly owing to their want of a proper education and not to their want of capacity and consequently is more their misfortune than their fault therefore the only method by which this fatal distemper can be cured and all its bad consequences for the future avoided is to put it in the power of the midwomen to qualify themselves thoroughly and at a moderate expense in all the parts of their most necessary office before ever they are permitted to practice and then they who did not readily embrace the opportunity would not only be deservedly blamed but ought to be punished by the civil magistrate e g they ought to be well instructed   in the knowledge of the nature and situation not only of the parts of generation in women but also of the circumjacent parts which may be affected by or may obstruct delivery and with the nature and use of the membranes waters navelstring placenta etc of the foetus   in the cause and cure of these disorders and accidents peculiar to women during their pregnancy and after their delivery   in the art of touching to the want of which most of the blunders complained of above were owing viz leaving the placenta behind dragging the womb inside out mistaking the arm for the foot the hips for the head thrusting their fingers through the vagina etc whereby they can not only tell the present state of the woman at any time of her gestation but also even prevent many of the difficult and dangerous labors being always sent for so early which now happen e g the membranes being broke and often before they may certainly tell by the touch what parts present then supposing it is the navelstring hips hand or any other part but the head advancing in a right posture they may at first appearance the parts being then so moistened by the waters be easily put back the feet sought for and the child extracted by them whereas when they have not art and jugement enough to take this favorable opportunity nature her self offers the woman is spent with fruitless pains the child advances in a wrong posture or too slowly if in a right one her body grows dry the womb collapses and contracts so closely about it and the child is so jammed and locked between the bones of the pelvis that it cannot be extracted without the greatest difficulty and danger by the most dexterous hands and how many fall under or soon after such operations the forementioned cases abundantly show pray is it not much easier and safer to prevent such blunders than to undertake thecure of them afterward   in the most rational methods of delivering women at any time of their gestation of a child false conception or mole with jugement dexterity and expedition   in the knowledge of those cases where instruments are absolutely necessary that they may send directly for a surgeon instead of fatigueing the mother and endangering both by needless delays and fruitless attempts   in the method of using them themselves where no surgeon can be had prestat anceps quam nullum adbibere remedium  to which method of qualifying themselves i doubt not the midwomen will object and say that they would readily be at any reasonable expense and fatigue to be so thoroughly instructed in all the parts of their office as i propose but it is not in their power they have no opportunity of following this scheme how can they do it the midwomen cannot and the midmen will not instruct them what then would you have them do can you blame these good women then for doing as well as they can nay as well as their mistresses who taught them the little they do know though not so well as they would had they had the opportunities of being instructed as abovementioned to which i answer i own their plea to be just and reasonable until these opportunities are put in their power  the midmen i doubt not will object and say that the midwomen want both capacity and strength instruct them as ye please to perform what i propose to which i reply that this is only an artful and groundless insinuation and do affirm  ore rotundo plenis buccis that it is not want of capacity docility strength or activity but merely want of fit and full instructions in all the parts of their office which disables them to perform it in all cases excepting where instruments are necessary with as much ease safety and expedition as the most dexterous midman which is evident to a demonstration from the successful practice of the midwomen in the hotel dieu at paris the best school for midwomen now in europe where they hardly ever want the assistance of a surgeon excepting where instruments must be used which is frankly owned by monsieur de la motte who says that during the space of six months wherein he attended amongst the women in the hotel dieu at paris there was but one hard labor happened where there was the least occasion for a surgeon and even that was at last finished by nature and in that time there were above four hundred delivered almost all by the apprentices and very rarely by madam du tertre who was then first midwife i have also been informed lately by a correspondent at paris that there are now about two thousand women delivered in that hospital communibus annis without the assistance of a surgeon excepting as above would not any person then be deservedly laughed at who should assert that our women are not as capable of performing their office had they the same instructions as the french women  but this charge of the midmen will appear still more groundless if we consider the nature of the blunders they are charged with by dr chamberlen giffard and chapman in the cases before mentioned viz of pulling at the childs arm inverting the matrix mistaking the hand for the foot leaving the placenta behind being ignorant of the art of touching etc etc pray do these charges prove their want of capacity docility or strength surely no all that can be reasonably deduced from them is that they want a proper education which is their misfortune more than their fault and what i am endeavoring to put in their power to have pray is there a midwoman in england so stupid as not to be easily convinced that pulling at the arm is wrong and to no purpose that tugging too hard at the navelstring or laying hold of the fund of the womb instead of the placenta will invert the uterus or that missing their time to take away the placenta when the passage is open makes it both difficult painful nay and dangerous to extract it afterward or that could not with proper pains be instructed to act rationally in these or most other cases pray is there any branch of surgery in which so many of the family of  have been and are engaged as in the business of midwifery yet some of them are very learned and knowing men an affair of such vast importance to mankind  how can it be made appear that doctors apothecaries and the lowest class of surgeons who are as little acquainted with the other principal operations of surgery as the very women themselves are more capable of performing these operations than they who have much more practice and many of them as good capacities pray wherein consists the secret it requires no mathematics no skill in philosophy no university learning at all otherwise most of the midmen would be distanced as well as all the midwomen has not all ages produced women who have made a figure in the most sublime parts of learning and in all manner of curious and useful arts and also illiterate thickheaded priests lawyers and physicians all which is occasioned by nothing so much as having or wanting a proper education why then is it not rational to suppose that they might also be made capable of assisting their own sex at that time when it is least proper for men to come near them  but now to come to the main point viz how the method i propose for the regular instruction of the midwomen can be put in execution to which i answer   that an hospital be erected e g in london or westminster at the public expense by donation or subscriptions as several almshouses infirmaries hospitals etc of far less consequence to the commonweal have been and are daily carried on for the reception of about two or three hundred poor women who are big with child   that a proper number of midwomen be appointed to attend them   that two surgeon midmen be appointed to assist these midwomen in all extraordinary cases and to demonstrate the structure of the parts concerned explain the art of touching etc as above in set lectures at least three times a week to all the midwomen and their apprentices who please to attend   that every young woman who designs to practice midwifery shall be obliged to attend these courses during her apprenticeship then go and practice for a set time under those expert midwomen in that hospital afterward let them be examined as to the skill and knowledge they have acquired in their profession by the two surgeons since our dom fac totum take midwifery either to be no part of surgery or such a trifling part of it that it is below their notice notwithstanding some of them can distinguish to a mathematical exactness how many grains of more knowledge in surgery is requisite for a surgeon of a first than of a second rate man of war and six or seven other persons appointed by his majesty because i dont think it reasonable that so many peoples bread should depend on the humor and caprice of any two men only and if approved to receive from them a certificate of their fitness to practice in london or any where else   that until fit hospitals can be built and endowed a midman be appointed in every city or countytown in england to read the foresaid lectures to all the midwomen in the county and demonstrate to them the truth of their doctrines on the poor of the neighborhood of which there are plenty every where  if this or same such scheme was put in execution in the principal town of the kingdom i am satisfied in a very few years there would hardly be an ignorant midwoman in england and consequently the great agonies most women suffer at the very mention of a man would be almost entirely prevented the great expense they cost saved and the melancholy scenes abovementioned would be no more seen nor heard of what can be more desirable what can show more humanity what can be more charitable than to pursue a design whereby the lives of so many innocent children and valuable women may be yearly nay daily saved from destruction  finis speedily will be published dedicated to that
