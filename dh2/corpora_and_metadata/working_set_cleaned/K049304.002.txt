the history and adventures of an atom  in two volumes  vol ii  london printed for robinson and roberts no    in paternoster row mdccxlix  the history and adventures of an atom the time was now come when fortune which had hitherto smiled upon the chinese arms resolved to turn tail to that vainglorious nation and precisely at the same instant taycho undertook to display his whole capacity in the management of the war but before he assumed this province it was necessary that he should establish a despotism in the council of twentyeight some members of which had still the presumption to offer their advice toward the administration of affairs this council being assembled by the dairos order to deliberate upon the objects of the next campaign the president began by asking the opinion of taycho who was the youngest member upon which the orator made no articulate reply but cried babababa the dairo exclaimed boh the fatzman ejaculated the interjection pish the cuboy sat in silent astonishment gottomio swore the man was dumb and hinted something of lunacy foksirokhu shook his head and soosansino shrugged up his shoulders at length fikakaka going round and kissing taycho on the forehead my dear boy cried he  gads curse what is the matter do but open the sluices of your eloquence once more my dear orator  let us have one simile  one dear simile and then i shall die contented  with respect to the operations of the campaign dont you think  here he was interrupted with ka ka ka ka heighday cried the cuboy bababa kakaka that is the language of children and children you shall be exclaimed the orator here is a twopenny trumpet for the amusement of the illustrious gothamababa a sword of gingerbread covered with goldleaf for the fatzman and a rattle for my lord cuboy i have likewise sugarplumbs for the rest of the council so saying he without ceremony advanced to the dairo and tied a scarf round the eyes of his imperial majesty then he produced a number of padlocks and sealed up the lips of every quo in council before they could recollect themselves from their first astonishment the assembly broke up abruptly and the dairo was conducted to his cabinet by the fatzman and the cuboy which last endeavored to divert the chagrin of his royal master by blowing the trumpet and shaking the rattle in his ears but gothamababa could not be so easily appeased he growled like an enraged bear at the indignity which had been offered to him and kicked the cuboy before as well as behind mr orator taycho was fain to come to an explanation he assured the dairo it was necessary that his imperial majesty should remain in the dark and that the whole council should be muzzled for a season otherwise he could not accomplish the great things he had projected in favor of the farm of yesso he declared that while his majesty remained blindfold he would enjoy all his other senses in greater perfection that his ears would be every day regaled with the shouts of triumph conveyed in notes of uncommon melody and that the less quantity of animal spirits was expended in vision the greater proportion would flow to his extremities consequently his pleasure would be more acute in his pedestrian exercitations upon the cuboy and others whom he delighted to honor he therefore exhorted him to undergo a total privation of eyesight which was at best a troublesome faculty that exposed mankind to a great variety of disagreeable spectacles this was a proposal which the dairo did not relish on the contrary he waxed exceedingly wroth and told the orator he would rather enjoy one transient glance of the farm of yesso than the most exquisite delights that could be procured for all the other senses to gratify your majesty with that ineffable pleasure cried taycho i have devoted myself soul and body and even reconciled contradictions i have renounced all my former principles without forfeiting the influence which by professing those principles i had gained i have obtained the most astonishing victories over common sense and even refuted mathematical demonstration the manyheaded mob which no former demagogue could ever tame i have taught to fetch and to carry to dance to my pipe to bray to my tune to swallow what i present without murmuring to lick my feet when i am angry and kiss the rod when i think proper to chastise it i have done more my liege i have prepared a drench for it which like lethe washes away the remembrance of what is past and takes away all sense of its own condition i have swept away all the money of the empire and persuaded the people not only to beggar themselves but likewise to entail indigence upon their latest posterity and all for the sake of yesso it is by dint of these efforts i have been able to subsidize brutantiffi and raise an army of one hundred thousand men to defend your imperial majestys farm which were the entire property of it brought to market would not fetch onethird part of the sums which are now yearly expended in its defense i shall strike but one great stroke in the country of fatsisio and then turn the whole stream of the war into the channel of tartary until the barren plains of yesso are fertilized with human blood in the mean time i must insist upon your majestys continuing in the dark and amusing yourself in your cabinet with the trumpet and other gewgaws which i have provided for your diversion otherwise i quit the reins of administration and turn the monster out of my trammels in which case like the dog that returns to its vomit it will not fail to take up its former prejudices against yesso which i have with such pains obliged it to resign  o my dear taycho cried the affrighted dairo talk not of leaving me in such a dreadful dilemma rather than the dear farm should fall into the hands of the chinese i would be contented to be led about blindfold all the days of my life  proceed in your own way  i invest you with full power and authority not only to gag my whole council but even to nail their ears to the pillory should it be found necessary for the benefit of yesso in token of which delegation present your posteriors and i will bestow upon you a double portion of my favor taycho humbly thanked his imperial majesty for the great honor he intended him but begged leave to decline the ceremony on account of the haemorrhoids which at that time gave him great disturbance  the orator having thus annihilated all opposition in the council of twentyeight repaired to his own house in order to plan the operations of the ensuing campaign though he had reinforced the army in tartary with the flower of the japonese soldiery and destined a strong squadron of fune as usual to parade on the coast of china he foresaw it would be necessary to amuse the people with some new stroke on the side of fatsisio which indeed was the original and the most natural scene of the war he locked himself up in his closet and in consulting the map of fatsisio he found that the principal chinese settlement of that island was a fortified town called quibquab to which there was access by two different avenues one by a broad rapid navigable river on the banks of which the town was situated and the other by an inland route over mountains lakes and dangerous torrents he measured the map with his compass and perceived that both routes were nearly of the same length and therefore he resolved that the forces in fatsisio being divided into two equal bodies should approach the place by the two different avenues on the supposition that they would both arrive before the walls of quibquab at the same instant of time the conduct of the inland expedition was given to yaffray who now commanded in chief in fatsisio and the rest of the troops were sent up the great river under the auspices of yaloff who had so eminently distinguished himself in the course of the preceding year  orator taycho had received some articles of intelligence which embarrassed him a little at first but these difficulties soon vanished before the vigor of his resolutions he knew that not only the town of quibquab was fortified by art but also that the whole adjacent country was almost impregnable by nature that one chinese general blocked up the passes with a strong body of forces in the route which was to be followed by yaffrai and that another commanded a separate corpse in the neighborhood of quibquab equal at least in number to the detachment of yaloff whom he might therefore either prevent from landing or attack after he should be landed or finally should neither of these attempts succeed he might reinforce the garrison of quibquab so as to make it more numerous than the besieging army which according to the rules of war ought to be ten times the number of the besieged on the other hand in order to invalidate these objections he reflected that fortune which has such a share in all military events is inconstant and variable that as the chinese had been so long successful in fatsisio it was now their turn to be unfortunate he reflected that the demon of folly was capricious and that as it had so long possessed the rulers and generals of japan it was high time it should shift its quarters and occupy the brains of the enemy in which case they would quit their advantageous posts and commit some blunder that would lay them at the mercy of the japonese  with respect to the reduction of quibquab he had heard indeed that the besiegers ought to be ten times the number of the garrison besieged but as every japonese was equivalent to ten subjects of china he thought the match was pretty equal he reflected that even if this expedition should not succeed it would be of little consequence to his reputation as he could plead at home that he neither conceived the original plan nor appointed any of the officers concerned in the execution it is true he might have reinforced the army in fatsisio so as to leave very little to fortune but then he must have subtracted something from the strength of the operations in tartary which was now become the favorite scene of the war or he must have altogether suspended the execution of another darling scheme which was literally his own conception there was an island in the great indian ocean at a considerable distance from fatsisio and here the chinese had a strong settlement taycho was inflamed with the ambition of reducing this island which was called thinquo and for this purpose he resolved to embark a body of forces which should cooperate with the squadron of fune destined to cruize in those latitudes  the only difficulty that remained was to choose a general to direct this enterprise  he perused a list of all the military officers in japan and as they were all equal in point of reputation he began to examine their names in order to pitch upon that which should appear to be the most significant and in this particular taycho was a little superstitious not but that surnames when properly bestowed might be rendered very useful terms of distinction but i must tell thee peacock nothing can be more preposterously absurd than the practice of inheriting cognomina which ought ever to be purely personal i would ask thee for example what propriety there was in giving the name xenophon which signifies one that speaks a foreign language to the celebrated greek who distinguished himself not only as a consummate captain but also as an elegant writer in his mother tongue what could be more ridiculous than to denominate the great philosopher of crotona pythagoras which implies a stinking speech or what could be more misapplied than the name of the weeping philosopher heraclitus signifying military glory the inheritance of surnames among the romans produced still more ludicrous consequences the best and noblest families in rome derived their names from the coarsest employments or else from the corporeal blemishes of their ancestors the pisones were millers the cicerones and the lentuli were so called from the vetches and the lentils which their forefathers dealt in the fabij were so denominated from a dungpit in which the first of the family was begot by stealth in the way of fornication a ploughman gave rise to the great family of the serrani the ladies of which always went without smocks the suilli the bubulci and the porci were descended from a swineherd a cowherd and a hogbutcher  what could be more disgraceful than to call the senator strabo squintum or a fine young lady of the house of poeti pigsnies or to distinguish a matron of the limi by the appellation of sheepseye  what could be more dishonorable than to give the surname of snubnose to p silius the propraetor because his greatgreatgreatgrandfather had a nose of that make ovid indeed had a long nose and therefore was justly denominated naso but why should horace be called flaccus as if his ears had been stretched in the pillory i need not mention the burrhi nigri rusi aquilij and rutilij because we have the same foolish surnames in england and even the lappa for i myself know a very pretty miss called roughhead though in fact there is not a young lady in the bills of mortality who takes more pains to dress her hair to the best advantage the famous dictator whom the deputies of rome found at the plough was known by the name of cincinnatus or raggedhead now i leave you to judge how it would found in these days if a footman at the playhouse should call out  my lady raggedheads coach room for my lady raggedhead i am doubtful whether the english name of hale does not come from the roman cognomen hala which signified stinkingbreath what need i mention the plauti panci valgi vari vatiae and scauri the tuditani the malici cenestellae and leccae in other words the splayfoots bandylegs shambleshins bakerknees clubfoots hammerheads chubbycheeks baldheads and letchers  i shall not say a word of the buteo or buzzard that i may not be obliged to explain the meaning of the word triorchis from whence it takes its denomination yet all those were great families in rome but i cannot help taking notice of some of the same improprieties which have crept into the language and customs of this country let us suppose for example a foreigner reading an english newspaper in these terms last tuesday the right honorable timothy sillyman secretary of state for the southern department gave a grand entertainment to the nobility and gentry at his house in knavesacre the evening was concluded with a ball which was opened by sir samuel hog and lady diana roughhead  we hear there is purpose of marriage between mr alderman smallcock and miss harriot hairstones a young lady of great fortune and superlative merit  by the last mail from germany we have certain advice of a complete victory which general coward has obtained over the enemy on this occasion the general displayed all the intrepidity of the most renowned hero  by the same canal we are informed that lieutenant littlefear has been broke by a court martial for cowardice  we hear that edward west esquire will be elected president of the directors of the east india company for the ensuing year it is reported that commodore north will be sent with a squadron into the south sea  captains east and south are appointed by the lords of the admiralty commanders of two frigates to sail on the discovery of the northwest passage  yesterday morning sir john summer bart lay dangerously ill at his house in springgarden he is attended by dr winter but there are no hopes of his recovery  saturday last philip frost a dealer in gunpowder died at his house on snowhill of a high fever caught by overheating himself in walking for a wager from no mans land to the worlds end  last week mr john fog teacher of astronomy in rotherhith was married to the widow fairweather of puddledock  we hear from bath that on thursday last a duel was fought on lansdown by captain sparrow and richard hawke esquire in which the latter was mortally wounded  friday last ended the sessions at the old bailey when the following persons received sentence of death leonard lamb for the murder of julius wolf and henry grave for robbing and assaulting dr death whereby the said death was put in fear of his life giles gosling for defrauding simon fox of four guineas and his watch by subtle craft was transported for seven years and david drinkwater was ordered to be set in the stocks as an habitual drunkard the trial of thomas green whitster at fulham for a rape on the body of flora white a mulatto was put off till next sessions on account of the absence of two material evidences viz sarah brown clearstarcher of pimlico and anthony black scarletdyer of wandsworth i ask thee peacock whether a sensible foreigner who understood the literal meaning of these names which are all truly british would not think ye were a nation of humorists who delighted in crosspurposes and ludicrous singularity but indeed ye are not more absurd in this particular than some of your neighbors  i know a frenchman of the name of bouvier which signifies cowkeeper pique himself upon his noblesse and a general called valavoir is said to have lost his life by the whimsical impropriety of his surname which signifies the general taking a solitary walk in the evening was questioned by a sentinel and answered  va la voir the soldier taking the words in the literal sense repeated the challenge he was answered in the same manner and being affronted fired upon the general who fell dead on the spot go and see  you may remember an italian minister called grossatesta or greathead though in fact he had scarce any head at all that nation has likewise its sforzas malatestas boccanigras porcinas giudices its colonnas muratorios medicis and gozzi endeavors chuckleheads black muzzles hogs judges pillars masons leeches and chubbychops spain has its almohadas girones utreras ursinas and zapatas signifying cushions gores bullocks bears and slippers the turks in other respects a sensible people fall into the same extravagance with respect to the inheritance of surnames an armenian merchant to whom i once belonged at aleppo used to dine at the house of a cook whose name was clockmaker and the handsomest ichoglan in the bashaws seraglio was surnamed crookback  if we may believe the historian buck there was the same impropriety in the same epithet bestowed upon richard iii king of england who he says was one of the bestmade men of the age in which he lived but here i must contradict the said buck from my own knowledge richard had undoubtedly one shoulder higher than the other and his left arm was a little shrunk and contracted but notwithstanding the ungracious colors in which he has been drawn by the flatterers of the house of lancaster i can assure thee peacock that richard was a prince of a very agreeable aspect and excelled in every personal accomplishment neither was his heart a stranger to the softer passions of tenderness and pity the very night that preceded the fatal battle of bosworth in which he lost his life he went in disguise to the house of a farmer in the neighborhood to visit an infant son there boarded who was the fruit of an amor between him and a young lady of the first condition upon this occasion he embraced the child with all the marks of paternal affection and doubtful of the issue of the approaching battle shed a flood of tears at parting from him after having recommended him to the particular care of his nurse to whom he gave money and jewels to a considerable value after the catastrophe of richard this house was plundered and the nurse with difficulty escaped to another part of the country but as the enemies of richard now prevailed she never durst reveal the secret of the boys birth and he was bred up as her own son to the trade of bricklaying in which character he lived and died in an advanced age at london  moreover it is but justice in me who constituted part of one of richards yeomen of the guard to assure thee that this prince was not so wicked and cruel as he has been represented the only share he had in the death of his brother clarence was his forbearing to interpose in the behalf of that prince with their elder brother king edward iv who in fact was the greatest brute of the whole family neither did he poison his own wife nor employ assassins to murder his two nephews in the tower both the boys were given by tyrrel in charge to a german jew with directions to breed them up as his own children in a remote country and the eldest died of a fever at embden and the other afterward appeared as claimant of the english crown  all the world knows how he finished his career under the name of perkin warbeck  so much for the abuse of surnames in the investigation of which i might have used thy own by way of illustration for if thou and all thy generation were put to the rack they would not be able to give any tolerable reason why thou should be called peacock rather than crablouse  but it is now high time to return to the thread of our narration taycho having considered the list of officers without finding one name which implied any active virtue resolved that the choice should depend upon accident he hustled them all together in his cap and putting in his hand at random drew forth that of hobnob a person who had grown old in obscurity without ever having found an opportunity of being concerned in actual service his very name was utterly unknown to fikakaka and this circumstance the orator considered as a lucky omen for the cuboy had such a remarkable knack at finding out the least qualified subjects and overlooking merit his new colleague concluded not without some shadow of reason that hobnobs being unknown to the prime minister was a sort of negative presumption in favor of his character this officer was accordingly placed at the head of an armament and sent against the island of thinquo in the conquest of which he was to be supported by a squadron of fune already in those latitudes under the command of the chief herhumn  the voyage was performed without loss the troops were landed without opposition they had already advanced toward a risingground which commanded the principal town of the island and herhumn had offered to land and draw the artillery by the mariners of his squadron when hobnob had a dream which disconcerted all his measures he dreamed that he entertained all the islanders in the temple of the white horse and that his own grandmother did the honors of the table  indeed he could not have performed a greater act of charity for they were literally in danger of perishing by famine having consulted his interpreter on this extraordinary dream he was given to understand that the omen was unlucky that if he persisted in his hostilities he himself would be taken prisoner and offered up as a sacrifice to the idol of the place while he ruminated on this unfavourable response the principal inhabitants of the island assembled in order to deliberate upon their own deplorable situation they had neither troops arms fortifications nor provision and despaired of supplies as the fleet of japan surrounded the island in this emergency they determined to submit without opposition and appointed a deputation to go and make a tender of the island to general hobnob this deputation preceded by white flags of truce the japonese commander no sooner descried than he thought upon the interpretation of his dream he mistook the deputies with their white flags for the bonzas of the idol to which he was to be sacrificed and being sorely troubled in mind ordered the troops to be immediately reimbarked notwithstanding the exhortations of herhumn and the remonstrances of rharintumm the second in command who used a number of arguments to dissuade him from his purpose the deputies seeing the enemy in motion made a halt and after they were fairly on board returned to the town singing hymns in praise of the idol fo who they imagined had confounded the understanding of the japonese general  the attempt upon thinquo having thus miscarried hobnob declared he would return to japan but was with great difficulty persuaded by the commander of the fune and his own second to make a descent upon another island belonging to the chinese called quachu where they assured him he would meet with no opposition as he had no dream to deter him from this attempt he suffered himself to be persuaded and actually made good his landing but the horror occasioned by the apparition of his grandmother had made such an impression upon his mind as affected the constitution of his body before he was visited by another such vision he sickened and died and in consequence of his death rharintumm and herhumn made a conquest of the island of quachu which was much more valuable than thinquo the first and sole object of the expedition  when the first news of this second descent arrived in japan the ministry were in the utmost confusion mr orator taycho did not scruple to declare that general hobnob had misbehaved first in relinquishing thinquo upon such a frivolouspretence as the supposed apparition of an old woman secondly in attempting the conquest of another place which was not so much as mentioned in his instructions the truth is the importance of quachu was not known to the cabinet of japan fikakaka believed it was some place on the continent of tartary and exclaimed in a violent passion rot the blockhead hobnob he will have an army of chinese on his back in a twinkling when the president soosansino assured him that quachu was a rich island at an immense distance from the continent of tartary the cuboy insisted upon kissing his excellencys posteriors for the agreeable information he had received in a few weeks arrived the tidings of the islands being totally reduced by rharintumm and herhumn  then the conquest was published throughout the empire of japan with every circumstance of exaggeration the blatant beast brayed applause the rites of fakkubasi were celebrated with unusual solemnity and hymns of triumph were sung to the glory of the great taycho even the cuboy arrogated to himself some share of the honor gained by this expedition inasmuch as the general rharintumm was the brother of his friend mr secretary nobody fikakaka gave a grand entertainment at his palace where he appeared crowned with a garland of the tsikkburasiba or laurel of japan and eat so much of the soup of joniku or famous swallowsnest that he was for three days troubled with flatulencies and indigestion  in the midst of all this festivity the emperor still growled and grumbled about yesso his new ally brutantiffi had met with a variety of fortune and even suffered some shocks which orator taycho with all his art could not keep from the knowledge of the dairo  he had been severely drubbed by the mantchoux who had advanced for that purpose even to his courtyard but this was nothing in comparison to another disaster from which he had a hairbreadth scape the great khan had employed one of his most wily and enterprising chiefs to seize brutantiffi by surprise that he might be brought to justice and executed as a felon and perturbator of the public peace kuntthan who was the partisan pitched upon for this service practiced a thousand stratagems to decoy brutantiffi into a careless security but he was still baffled by the vigilance of yamakheit a famous soldier of fortune who had engaged in the service of the outlawed tartar at length the opportunity offered when this captain was sent out to lay the country under contribution then kuntthan marching solely in the dead of night caught brutantiffi napping he might have slain him upon the spot but his orders were to take him alive that he might be made a public example accordingly his sentinels being dispatched he was pulled out of bed and his hands were already tied with cords like those of a common malefactor when by his roaring and bellowing he gave the alarm to yamakheit who chanced to be in the neighborhood returning from his excursion  he made all the haste he could and came up in the very nick of time to save his master he fell upon the party of kuntthan with such fury that they were fain to quit their prey then he cut the fetters of brutantiffi who took to his heels and fled with incredible expedition leaving his preserver in the midst of his enemies by whom he was overpowered struck from his horse and trampled to death the grateful tartar not only deserted this brave captain in such extremity but he also took care to asperse his memory by insinuating that yamakheit had undertaken to watch him while he took his repose and had himself fallen asleep upon his post by which neglect of duty the ostrog had been enabled to penetrate into his quarters it is an ill wind that blows nobody good  the same disaster that deprived him of a good officer afforded him an opportunity to shift the blame of neglect from his own shoulders to those of a person who could not answer for himself  in the same manner your general a  y acquitted himself of the charge of misconduct for the attack of t  a by accusing his engineer who having fallen in the battle could not contradict his assertion in regard to the affair with the mantchoux brutantiffi was resolved to swear truth out of tartary by mere dint of impudence in the very article of running away he began to propagate the report of the great victory he had obtained he sent the dairo a circumstantial detail of his own prowess and expatiated upon the cowardice of the mantchoux who he said had vanished from him like quicksilver at the very time when they were quietly possessed of the field of battle and he himself was calling upon the mountains to cover him it must have been in imitation of this great original that the inspector of tympanitical memory assured the public in one of his lucubrations that a certain tall hibernian was afraid of looking him in the face because the said poltroon had kicked his breech the night before in presence of five hundred people  fortune had now abandoned the chinese in good earnest two squadrons of their fune had been successively taken destroyed or dispersed by the japonese commanders ornbos and faskhan and they had lost such a number of single junks that they were scarce able to keep the sea on the coast of africa they were driven from the settlement of khorhe by the commander khafell in the extremity of asia they had an army totally defeated by the japonese captain khuttwhang and many of their settlements were taken in fatsisio they lost another battle to yanoni and diverse strong holds in the neighborhood of yesso bronxitic who commanded the mercenary army of japan on that continent had been obliged to retreat before the chinese from post to pillar till at length he found it absolutely necessary to maintain his position even at the risque of being attacked by the enemy that outnumbered him greatly he chose an advantageous post where he thought himself secure and went to sleep at his usual time of rest the chinesegeneral resolving to beat up his quarters in the night selected a body of horse for that purpose and put them in motion accordingly it was happy for bronxitic that this detachment fell upon a quarter where there happened to be a kennel of japonese dogs which are as famous as the bulldogs of england these animals ever on the watch not only gave the alarm but at the same time fell upon the chinese horses with such impetuosity that the enemy were disordered and had actually fled before bronxitic could bring up his troops to action all that he saw of the battle when he came up was a small number of killed and wounded and the cavalry of the enemy scampering off in confusion though at a great distance from the field no matter  he found means to paint this famous battle of mynthan in such colors as dazzled the weak eyesight of the japonese monster which bellowed hoarse applause through all its throats and in its hymns of triumph equalled bronxitic even to the unconquerable brutantiffi which last about this time received at his own door another beating from the mantchoux so severe that he lay for some time without exhibiting any signs of life and indeed owed his safety to a very extraordinary circumstance an ostrog chief called llhadahn who had reinforced the mantchoux with a very considerable body of horse before the battle insisted upon carrying off the carcass of brutantiffi that it might be hung up on a gibbet in terrorem before the pavilion of the great khan the general of the mantchoux on the other hand declared he would have it flayed upon the spot and the skin sent as a trophy to his sovereign this dispute produced a great deal of abuse betwixt those barbarians and it was with great difficulty some of their inferior chiefs who were wiser than themselves prevented them from going by the ears together in a word the confusion and anarchy that ensued afforded an opportunity to one of brutantiffis partisans to steal away the body of his master whom the noise of the contest had just roused from his swoon llhadahn perceiving he was gone rode off in disgust with all his cavalry and the mantchoux instead of following the blow made a retrograde motion toward their own country which allowed brutantiffi time to breathe three successive disasters of this kind would have been sufficient to lower the military character of any warrior in the opinion of any public that judged from their own senses and reflection but by this time the japonese had quietly resigned all their natural perceptions and paid the most implicit faith to every article broached by their apostle taycho the more it seemed to contradict common reason and common evidence the more greedily was it swallowed as a mysterious dogma of the political creed taycho then assured them that the whole army of the mantchoux was put to the sword and that bronxitic would carry the war within three weeks into the heart of china he gave them goblets of horseblood from mynthan and tickled their ears and their noses they snorted approbation licked his toes and sunk into a profound lethargy  from this however they were soon arroused by unwelcome tidings from fatsisio yaffrai had proceeded in his route until he was stopped by a vast lake which he could not possibly traverse without boats corkjackets or some such expedient which could not be supplied for that campaign yaloff had sailed up the river to quibquab which he found so strongly fortified by nature that it seemed rashness even to attempt a landing especially in the face of an enemy more numerous than his own detachment land however he did and even attacked a fortified camp of the chinese but in spite of all his efforts he was repulsed with considerable slaughter he sent an account of this miscarriage to taycho giving him to understand at the same time that he had received no intelligence of yaffrais motions that his troops were greatly diminished that the season was too far advanced to keep the field much longer and that nothing was left them but a choice of difficulties every one of which seemed more insurmountable than another taycho having deliberated on this subject thought it was necessary to prepare the monster for the worst that could happen as he now expected to hear by the first opportunity that the grand expedition of fatsisio had totally miscarried he resolved therefore to throw the blame upon the shoulders of yaloff and yaffrai and stigmatize them as the creatures of fikakaka who had neither ability to comprehend the instructions he had given nor resolution to execute the plan he had projected for this purpose he ascended the rostrum and with a rueful length of face opened his harangue upon the defeat of yaloff the hydra no sooner understood that the troops of japan had been discomfited than it was seized with a kind of hysteric fit and uttered a yell so loud and horrible that the blindfold dairo trembled in the most internal recesses of his palace the cuboy fikakaka had such a profuse evacuation that the discharge is said to have weighed five bollah equal to eight and forty pounds three ounces and two pennyweight averdupois of great britain even taycho himself was discomposed  in vain he presented the draught of yeast and the goblet of blood  in vain his pipers soothed the ears and his tall fellows tickled the nose of the blatant beast it continued to howl and grin and gnash its teeth and writhe itself into a thousand contortions as if it had been troubled with that twisting of the guts called the iliac passion taycho began to think its case desperate and sent for the dairos chief physician who prescribed a glyster of the distilled spirit analogous to your geneva but no apothecary nor old woman in meaco would undertake to administer it on any consideration the patient was such a filthy awkward lubberly unmanageable beast  if what comes from its mouths said they be so foul virulent and pestilential how nauseous poisonous and intolerable must that be which takes the other course  when taychos art and foresight were at a stand accident came to his assistance a courier arrived preceded by twelve postilions blowing horns and he brought the news that quibquab was taken the orator commanded them to place their horns within as many of the monsters long ears and blow with all their might until it should exhibit some signs of hearing the experiment succeeded the hydra waking from its trance opened its eyes and taycho seizing this opportunity hollowed in his loudest tone quibquab is taken this note being repeated the beast started up then raising itself on its hind legs began to wag its tail to frisk and fawn to lick taychos sweaty socks in fine crouching on its belly it took the orator on its back and proceeding through the streets of meaco brayed aloud make way for the divine taycho make way for the conqueror of quibquab  but the gallant yaloff the real conqueror of quibquab was no more  he fell in the battle by which the conquest was achieved yet not before he saw victory declare in his favor he had made incredible efforts to surmount the difficulties that surrounded him at length he found means to scale a perpendicular rock which the enemy had left unguarded on the supposition that nature had made it inaccessible this exploit was performed in the night and in the morning the chinese saw his troops drawn up in order of battle on the plains of quibquab as their numbers greatly exceeded the japonese they did not decline the trial and in a little time both armies were engaged the contest however was not of long duration though it proved fatal to the general on each side  yaloff being slain the command devolved upon tohnsyn who pursued the enemy to the walls of quibquab which was next day surrendered to him by capitulation nothing was now seen and heard in the capital but jubilee triumph and intoxication and indeed the nation had not for some centuries seen such an occasion for joy and satisfaction the only person that did not heartily rejoice was the dairo gothamababa by this time he was so tartarised that he grudged his subjects every advantage obtained in fatsisio and when fikakaka hobbled up to him with the news of the victory instead of saluting him with the kick of approbation he turned his back upon him saying boh boh what do you tell me of quibquab the damned chinese are still on the frontiers of yesso as to the beast it was doomed to undergo a variety of agitation its present gambols were interrupted by a fresh alarm from china it was reported that two great armaments were equipped for a double descent upon the dominions of japan that one of these had already sailed north about for the island of xicoco to make a diversion in favor of the other which being the most considerable was designed for the southern coast of japan these tidings which were not without foundation had such an effect upon the multitudinous monster that it was first of all seized with an universal shivering its teeth chattered so loud that the sound was heard at the distance of half a league and for some time it was struck dumb during this paroxysm it crawled silently on its belly to a sandhill just without the walls of meaco and began to scratch the earth with great eagerness and perseverance some people imagined it was digging for gold but the truth is the beast was making a hole to hide itself from the enemy whom it durst not look in the face for it must be observed of this beast it was equally timorous and cruel equally cowardly and insolent  so hard it labored at this cavern that it had actually burrowed itself all but the tail when its good angel taycho whistled it out with the news of another complete victory gained over the chinese at sea by the seyseogun phalkhan who had sure enough discomfited or destroyed the great armament of the enemy as for the other small squadron which had steered a northerly course to xicoco it was encountered defeated taken and brought into the harbors of japan by three light fune under the command of a young chief called helyotte who happened to be cruising on that part of the coast  the beast hearing taychos auspicious whistle crept out with its buttocks foremost and having done him homage in the usual style began to react its former extravagances it now considered this demagogue as the supreme giver of all good and adored him accordingly the apostle bupo was no longer invoked the temple of fakkubasi was almost forgotten and the bonzas were universally despised the praise of the prophet taycho had swallowed up all other worship  let us enquire how far he merited this adoration how justly the unparalleled success of this year was ascribed to his conduct and sagacity khorhe was taken by khafell and quibquab by yaloff and thonsyn by land the chinese were defeated in fatsisio by yanoni in the extremity of asia by khuttwhang and in tartary by the japonese bulldogs without command or direction at sea one of their squadrons had been destroyed by ornbos a second by faskhan a third was taken by helyotte a fourth was worsted and put to flight in three successive engagements near the land of kamtschatka by the chief bhakakh and their grand armament defeated by the seyseogun phalkhan but khafell was a stranger to orator taycho yaloff he had never seen the bulldogs had been collected at random from the shambles of meaco he had never heard of yanonis name till he distinguished himself by his first victory nor did he know there was any such person as khuttwhang existing as for ornbos faskhan phalkhan and bhakakh they had been seyseoguns in constant employment under the former administration and the youth helyotte owed his promotion to the interest of his own family  but it may be alleged that taycho projected in his closet those plans that were crowned with success  we have seen how he mutilated and frittered the original scheme of the campaign in fatsisio so as to leave it at the caprice of fortune the reduction of khorhe was part of the design formed by the banyan thumkhummqua which taycho did all that lay in his power to render abortive the plan of operations in the extremity of tartary he did not pretend to meddle with  it was the concern of the officers appointed by the trading company there settled and as to the advantages obtained at sea they naturally resulted from the disposition of cruises made and regulated by the board of seyseogunsealty with which no minister ever interfered he might indeed have recalled the chiefs and officers whom he found already appointed when he took the reins of administration and filled their places with others of his own choosing how far he was qualified to make such a choice and plan new expeditions appears from the adventures of the generals he did appoint moriatanti who was deterred from landing by a perspective view of whiskers hylibbib who left his rear in the lurch and hobnob who made such a masterly retreat from the supposed bonzas of thinquo  these three were literally commanders of his own creation employed in executing schemes of his own projecting and these three were the only generals he made and the only military plans he projected if we except the grand scheme of subsidizing brutantiffi and forming an army of one hundred thousand men in tartary for the defense of the farm of yesso  things being so circumstanced it may be easily conceived that the orator could ask nothing which the mobile would venture to refuse and indeed he tried his influence to the utmost stretch he milked the dugs of the monster till the blood came for the service of the ensuing year he squeezed from them near twelve millions of obans amounting to near twentyfour millions sterling about four times as much as had ever been raised by the empire of japan in any former war but by this time taycho was become not only a convert to the system of tartary which he had formerly persecuted but also an enthusiast in love and admiration of brutantiffi who had lately sent him his poetical works in a present this however would have been of no use as he could not read them had not he discovered they were printed on a very fine soft smooth chinese paper made of silk which he happily converted to another fundamental purpose in return for this compliment the orator sent him a bullocks horn bound with brass value fifteen pence which had long served him as a pitchpipe when he made harangues to the mobile  it was the same kind of instrument which horace describes tibia vincta orichalco and pray take notice peacock this was the only present taycho ever bestowed on any man woman or child through the whole course of his life i mean out of his own pocket for he was extremely liberal of the public money in his subsidies to the tartar chiefs and in the prosecution of the war upon that continent the orator was a genius selftaught without the help of human institution he affected to undervalue all men of literary talents and the only book he ever read with any degree of pleasure was a collection of rhapsodies preached by one abrenthi an obscure fanatic bonza a native of the island xicoco certain it is nature seemed to have produced him for the sole purpose of fascinating the mob and endued him with faculties accordingly  notwithstanding all his efforts in behalf of the tartarian scheme the chinese still lingered on the frontiers of yesso the views of the court of pekin exactly coincided with the interest of bronxitic the mercenary general of japan the chinese confounded at the unheard of success of the japonese in fatsisio and other parts of the globe and extremely mortified at the destruction of their fleets and the ruin of their commerce saw no other way of distressing the enemy but that of prolonging the war on the continent of tartary which they could support for little more than their ordinary expense whereas japan could not maintain it without contracting yearly immense loads of debt which must have crushed it at the longrun it was the business of the chinese therefore not to finish the war in tartary by taking the farm of yesso because in that case the annual expense of it would have been saved to japan but to keep it alive by forced marches praedatory excursions and undecisive actions and this was precisely the interest of general bronxitic who in the continuance of the war enjoyed the continuance of all his emoluments all that he had to do then was to furnish taycho from time to time with a cask of human blood for the entertainment of the blatant beast and to send over a few horsetails as trophies of pretended victories to be waved before the monster in its holiday processions he and the chinese general seemed to act in concert they advanced and retreated in their turns betwixt two given lines and the campaign always ended on the same spot where it began the only difference between them was in the motives of their conduct the chinese commander acted for the benefit of his sovereign and bronxitic acted for his own  the continual danger to which the farm of yesso was exposed produced such apprehensions and chagrin in the mind of the dairo gothamababa that his health began to decline he neglected his food and his rattle and no longer took any pleasure in kicking the cuboy he frequently muttered ejaculations about the farm of yesso nay once or twice in the transports of his impatience he pulled the bandage from his eyes and cursed taycho in the tartarian language at length he fell into a lethargy and even when roused a little by blisters and caustics seemed insensible of every thing that was done about him these blisters were raised by burning the moxa upon his scalp the powder of menoki was also injected in a glyster and the operation of acupuncture called senkei performed without effect his disorder was so stubborn that the cuboy began to think he was bewitched and suspected taycho of having practiced sorcery on his sovereign he communicated this suspicion to muraclami who shook his head and advised that with the orators good leave the council should be consulted taycho who had gained an absolute empire over the mind of the dairo and could not foresee how his interest might stand with his successor was heartily disposed to concur in any seasible experiment for the recovery of gothamababa he therefore consented that the mouths of the council should be unpadlocked pro hac vice and the members were assembled without delay with this express proviso however that they were to confine their deliberations to the subject of the dairo and his distemper by this time the physicians had discovered the cause of the disorder which was no other than his being stung by a poisonous insect produced in the land of yesso analogous to the tarantula which is said to do so much mischief in some parts of apuglia as we are told by aelian epiphanius ferdinandus and baglivi in both cases the only effectual remedy was music and now the council was called to determine what sort of music should be administered you must know peacock the japonese are but indifferently skilled in this art though in general they affect to be connoisseurs they are utterly ignorant of the theory and in the practice are excelled by all their neighbors the tartars not excepted for my own part i studied music under pythagoras at crotona he found the scale of seven tones imperfect and added the octave as a fixed sensible and intelligent termination of an interval which included every possible division and determined all the relative differences of sounds besides he taught us how to express the octave by etc etc but why should i talk to thee of the ancient digramma the genera etc of music which with their colors were constructed by a division of the diatessaron thou art too dull and ignorant to comprehend the chromatic species the construction of the tetrachord the phrygian the lydian and other modes of the ancient music and for distinction of ear thou might be justly ranked among the braying tribe that graze along the ditches of tottenhamcourt or hockleyithehole i know that nothing exhilarates thy spirits so much as a sonata on the saltbox or a concert of marrowbones and cleavers the ears of the japonese were much of the same texture and their music was suited to their ears they neither excelled in the melopoeia and rythm or cadence nor did they know any thing of the true science of harmony compositions in parts and those combinations of sounds the invention of which with the improvement of the scale is erroneously ascribed to a benedictine monk the truth is the ancients understood composition perfectly well their scale was founded upon perfect consonances they were remarkably nice in tempering sounds and had reduced their intervals and concords to mathematical demonstration  but to return to the council of twentyeight they convened in the same apartment where the dairo lay and as the business was to determine what kind of music was most likely to make an impression upon his organs every member came provided with his expedient first and foremost mr orator taycho pronounced an oration upon the excellences of the land of yesso of energy as the cuboy said sufficient to draw the moon from her sphere it drew nothing however from the patient but a single groan then the fatzman caused a drum to beat without producing any effect at all upon the dairo though it deprived the whole council of their hearing for some time the third essay was made by fikakaka first with a rattle and then with tongs and gridiron which last was his favorite music but here it failed to his great surprise and consternation stiphirumpoo brought the crier of his court to promulgate a decree against yesso in a voice that is wont to make the culprit tremble but the dairo was found ignoramus nincompoopo blew a blast with a kind of boatswains whistle which discomposed the whole audience without affecting the emperor fokh  si  rokhu said he would try his imperial majesty with a sound which he had always been known to prefer to every other species of music and pulling out a huge purse of golden obans began to chink them in his ear  this experiment so far succeeded that the dairo was perceived to smile and even to contract one hand but further effect it had none at last gottomio starting up threw a small quantity of aurum fulminans into the fire which went off with such an explosion that in the same instant fikakaha fell flat upon his face and gothamababa started upright in his bed this however was no more than a convulsion that put an end to his life for he fell back again and expired in the twinkling of an eye  as for the cuboy though he did not die he underwent a surprising transformation or metamorphosis which i shall record in due season  taycho was no sooner certified that gothamababa had actually breathed his last than he vanished from the council in the twinkling of an eye and mounting the beast whose name is legion rode full speed to the habitation of giogio the successor and descendant of the deceased dairo  giogio was a young prince who had been industriously sequestered from the public view and excluded from all share in the affairs of state by the jealousy of the last emperor  he lived retired under the wings of his grandmother and had diverse preceptors to teach him the rudiments of every art but the art of reigning of all those who superintended his education he who insinuated himself the farthest in his favor was one yakstrot from the mountains of ximo who valued himself much upon the ancient blood that ran in his veins and still more upon his elevated ideas of patriotism yakstrot was honest at bottom but proud reserved vain and affected he had a turn for nicknacks and gimcracks and once made and mounted an iron jack and a wooden clock with his own hands but it was his misfortune to set up for a connoisseur in painting and other liberal arts and to announce himself an universal patron of genius he did not fail to infuse his own notions and conceits into the tender mind of giogio who gradually imbibed his turn of thinking and followed the studies which he recommended  with respect to his lessons on the art of government he reduced them to a very few simple principles  his maxims were these that the emperor of japan ought to cherish the established religion both by precept and example that he ought to abolish corruption discourage faction and balance the two parties by admitting an equal number from each to places and offices of trust in the administration that he should make peace as soon as possible even in despite of the public which seemed insensible of the burden it sustained and was indeed growing delirious by the illusions of taycho and the cruel evacuations he had prescribed that he should retrench all superfluous expense in his household and government and detach himself entirely from the accursed farm of yesso which some evil genius had fixed upon the breech of japan as a cancerous ulcer through which all her blood and substance would be discharged these maxims were generally just enough in speculation but some of them were altogether impracticable  for example that of forming an administration equally composed of the two sactions was as absurd as it would be to yoke two stonehorses and two jackasses in the same carriage which instead of drawing one way would do nothing but bite and kick one another while the machine of government would stand stockstill or perhaps be torn in pieces by their dragging in opposite directions  the people of japan had been long divided between two inveterate parties known by the names of shittilkumsheit and sheitkumshitil the first signifying more fool than knave and the other more knave than fool each had predominated in its turn by securing a majority in the assemblies of the people for the majority had always interest to force themselves into the administration because the constitution being partly democratic the dairo was still obliged to truckle to the prevailing faction  to obtain this majority each side had employed every art of corruption calumny insinuation and priestcraft for nothing is such an effectual ferment in all popular commotions as religious fanaticism  no sooner one party accomplished its aim than it reprobated the other branding it with the epithets of traitors to their country or traitors to their prince while the minority retorted upon them the charge of corruption rapaciousness and abject servility in short both parties were equally abusive rancorous uncandid and illiberal taycho had been of both factions more than once  he made his first appearance as a shitilkumsheit in the minority and displayed his talent for scurrility against the dairo to such advantage that an old rich hag who loved nothing so well as money except the gratification of her revenge made him a present of five thousand obans on condition he should continue to revile the dairo till his dyingday  after her death the ministry intimidated by the boldness of his tropes and the fame he began to acquire as a malcontent orator made him such offers as he thought proper to accept and then he turned sheitkumshitil  being disgusted in the sequel at his own want of importance in the council he opened once more at the head of his old friends the shitilkumshitites and once more he deserted them to rule the roast as chief of the sheitkumshitilites in which predicament he now stood and indeed this was the most natural posture in which he could stand for this party embraced all the scum of the people constituting the blatant beast which his talents were so peculiarly adapted to manage and govern another impracticable maxim of yakstrot was the abolition of corruption the ordure of which is as necessary to anoint the wheels of government in japan as grease is to smear the axletree of a loaded wagon his third impolitic though not impracticable maxim was that of making peace while the populace were intoxicated with the steams of blood and elated with the shows of triumph be that as it will giogio attended by yakstrot was drawing plans of windmills when orator taycho opening the door advanced toward him and falling on his knees addressed him in these words the empire of japan magnanimous prince resembles at this instant a benighted traveller who by the light of the star hesperus continued his journey without repining until that glorious luminary setting left him bewildered in darkness and consternation but scarce had he time to bewail his fate when the more glorious sun the ruler of a fresh day appearing on the tops of the eastern hills dispelled his terrors with the shades of night and filled his soul with transports of pleasure and delight the illustrious gothamababa of honored memory is the glorious star which has set on our hemisphere  his soul which took wing about two hours ago is now happily nestled in the bosom of the blessed bupo and you my prince are the more glorious rising sun whose genial influence will cheer the empire and gladden the hearts of your faithful japonese  i therefore hail your succession to the throne and cry aloud long live the everglorious giogio emperor of the three islands of japan to this salutation the beast below brayed hoarse applause and all present kissed the hand of the new emperor who kneeling before his venerable grandame craved her blessing desiring the benefit of her prayers that god would make him a good king and establish his throne in righteousness then he ascended his chariot accompanied by the orator and his beloved yakstrot and proceeding to the palace of meaco was proclaimed with the usual ceremonies his relation the fatzman and other princes of the blood assisting on this occasion  the first step he took after his elevation was to publish a decree or rather exhortation to honor religion and the bonzes and this was no impolitic expedient for it firmly attached that numerous and powerful tribe to his interest his next measures did not seem to be directed by the same spirit of discretion he admitted a parcel of raw boys and even some individuals of the faction of shitilkumsheit into his council and though taycho still continued to manage the reins of administration yakstrot was associated with him in office to the great scandal and dissatisfaction of the niphonites who hate all the ximians with a mixture of jealousy and contempt  fikakaka was not the last who paid his respects to his new sovereign by whom he was graciously received although he did not seem quite satisfied because when he presented himself in his usual attitude he had not received the kick of approbation new reigns new customs this dairo never dreamed of kicking those whom he delighted to honor  it was a secret of state which had not yet come to his knowledge and yakstrot had always assured him that kicking the breech always and everywhere implied disgrace as kicking the parts before betokens ungovernable passion yakstrot however in this particular seems to have been too confined in his notions of the etiquette for it had been the custom time immemorial for the dairos of japan to kick their favorites and prime ministers besides there are at this day different sorts of kicks used even in england without occasioning any dishonor to the kickee  it is sometimes a misfortune to be kicked out of place but no dishonor a man is often kicked up in the way of preferment in order that his place may be given to a person of more interest then there is the amorous kick called kick um jenny which every gallant undergoes with pleasure hence the old english appellation of kicksywicksy bestowed on a wanton leman who knew all her paces as for the familiar kick it is no other than a mark of friendship nor is it more dishonorable to be cuffed and cudgelled every body knows that the alapa or box of the ear among the romans was a particular mark of favor by which their slaves were made free and the favorite gladiator when he obtained his dismission from the service was honored with a found cudgelling this being the true meaning of the phrase rude donatus in the times of chivalry the knight when dubbed was well thwacked across the shoulders by his godfather in arms  indeed dubbing is no other than a corruption of drubbing it was the custom formerly here and elsewhere for a man to drub his son or apprentice as a mark of his freedom and of his being admitted to the exercise of arms the paraschistes who practiced embalming in egypt which was counted a very honorable profession was always severely drubbed after the operation by the friends and relations of the defunct and to this day the patriarch of the greeks once a year on eastereve when he carries out the sacred fire from the holy sepulcher of jerusalem is heartily cudgelled by the infidels a certain number of whom he hires for that purpose and he thinks himself very unhappy and much disgraced if he is not beaten into all the colors of the rainbow you know the quakers of this country think it no dishonor to receive a slap of the face but when you smite them on one cheek they present the other that it may have the same salutation the venerable father lactantius falls out with cicero for saying a good man hurts nobody unless he is justly provoked nisi lacessitur injuria o cries the good father quam simplicem veramque sententiam duorum verborum adjectione corrupit  non minus enim mali est refer injuriam quam infer the great philosopher socrates thought it no disgrace to be kicked by his wife xantippe nay he is said to have undergone the same discipline from other people without making the least resistance it being his opinion that it was more courageous consequently more honorable to bear a drubbing patiently than to attempt any thing either in the way of selfdefence or retaliation  the judicious and learned puffendorf in his book de jure gentium and naturali declares that a mans honor is not so fragile as to be hurt either by a box on the ear or a kick on the breech otherwise it would be in the power of every saucy fellow to diminish or infringe it  it must be owned indeed grotius de jure belli and pacis says that charity does not of itself require our patiently suffering such an affront the english have with a most servile imitation borrowed their punto as well as other modes from the french nation now kicking and cuffing were counted infamous among those people for these reasons a box on the ear destroys the whole economy of their frisure upon which they bestow the greatest part of their time and attention and a kick on the breech is attended with great pain and danger as they are generally subject to the piles this is so truly the case that they have no less than two saints to patronize and protect the individuals afflicted with this disease one is st fiacre who was a native of the kingdom of ireland he presides over the blind piles the other is a female saint hoemorrhoissa and she comforts those who are distressed with the bleeding piles no wonder therefore that a frenchman put to the torture by a kick on those tender parts should be provoked to vengeance and that this vengeance should gradually become an article in their system of punctilio  but to return to the thread of my narration  whatever inclination the dairo and yakstrot had to restore the blessings of peace they did not think proper as yet to combat the disposition and schemes of orator taycho in consequence of whose remonstrances the tributary treaty was immediately renewed with brutantiffi and giogio declared in the assembly of the people that he was determined to support that illustrious ally and carry on the war with vigor  by this time the chinese were in a manner expelled from their chief settlements in fatsisio where they now retained nothing but an inconsiderable colony which would have submitted on the first summons but this taycho left as a nestegg to produce a new brood of disturbance to the japonese settlements that they might not rust with too much peace and security to be plain with you peacock his thoughts were entirely alienated from this fatsisian war in which the interest of his country was chiefly concerned and converted wholly to the continent of tartary where all his cares centered in schemes for the success of his friend brutantiffi this freebooter had lately undergone strange vicissitudes of fortune he had seen his chief village possessed and plundered by the enemy but he found means by surprise to beat up their quarters in the beginning of winter which always proved his best ally because then the mantchoux tartars were obliged to retire to their own country at a vast distance from the seat of the war  as for bronxitic who commanded the japonese army on that continent he continued to play booty with the chinese general over whom he was allowed to obtain some petty advantages which with the trophies won by brutantiffi were swelled up into mighty victories to increase the infatuation of the blatant beast  on the other hand bronxitic obliged the generals of china with the like indulgences by now and then sacrificing a detachment of his japonese troops to keep up the spirits of that nation  taycho had levied upon the people of japan an immense sum of money for the equipment of a naval armament the destination of which was kept a profound secret some politicians imagined it was designed for the conquest of thinquo and all the other settlements which the chinese possessed in the indian ocean others conjectured the intention was to attack the king of corea who had since the beginning of this war acted with a shameful partiality in favor of the emperor of china his kinsman and ally but the truth of the matter was this taycho kept the armament in the harbors of japan ready for a descent upon the coast of china in order to make a diversion in favor of his friend brutantiffi in case he had run any risque of being oppressed by his enemies however the beast of many heads having growled and grumbled during the best part of the summer at the inactivity of this expensive armament it was now thought proper to send it to sea in the beginning of winter but it was soon driven back in great distress by contrary winds and storms  and this was all the monster had for its ten millions of obans  while taycho amused the mobile with this winter expedition yakstrot resolved to plan the scheme of economy which he had projected he dismissed from the dairos service about a dozen of cooks andscullions shut up one of the kitchens after having sold the grates handirons spits and saucepans deprived the servants and officers of the household of their breakfast took away their usual allowance of oil and candles retrenched their tables reduced their proportion of drink and persuaded his pupil the dairo to put himself upon a diet of soupmeagre thickened with oatmeal in a few days there was no smoke seen to ascend from the kitchens of the palace nor did any fuel torch or taper blaze in the chimnies courts and apartments thereof which now became the habitation of cold darkness and hunger giogio himself who turned peripatetic philosopher merely to keep himself in heat fell into a washtub as he groped his way in the dark through one of the lower galleries two of his bodyguard had their whiskers gnawed off by the rats as they slept in his antichamber and their captain presented a petition declaring that neither he nor his men could undertake the defense of his imperial majestys person unless their former allowance of provision should be restored they and all the individuals of the household were not only punished in their bellies but likewise curtailed in their clothing and abridged in their stipends the palace of meaco which used to be the temple of mirth jollity and good cheer was now so dreary and deserted that a certain wag fixed up a ticket on the outward gate with this inscription this tenement to be let the proprietor having left off housekeeping  yakstrot however was resolved to show that if the new dairo retrenched the superfluities of his domestic expense he did not act from avarice or poorness of spirit inasmuch as he should now display his liberality in patronizing genius and the arts a general jubilee was now promised to all those who had distinguished themselves by their talents or erudition the emissaries of yakstrot declared that maecenas was but a type of this ximian mountaineer and that he was determined to search for merit even in the thickest shades of obscurity all these researches however proved so unsuccessful that not above four or five men of genius could be found in the whole empire of japan and these were gratified with pensions of about one hundred obans each one was a secularized bonza from ximo another a malcontent poet of niphon a third a reformed comedian of xicoco a fourth an empiric who had outlived his practice and a fifth a decayed apothecary who was bard quack author chemist philosopher and simpler by profession the whole of the expense arising from the favor and protection granted by the dairo to these men of genius did not exceed seven or eight hundred obans per annum amounting to about fifteen hundred pounds sterling whereas many a private quo in japan expended more money on a kennel of hounds i do not mention those men of singular merit whom yakstrot fixed in established places under the government such as architects astronomers painters physicians barbers etc because their salaries were included in the ordinary expense of the crown i shall only observe that a certain person who could not read was appointed librarian to his imperial majesty  these were all the men of superlative genius that yakstrot could find at this period in the empire of japan  whilst this great patriot was thus employed in executing his schemes of economy with more zeal than discretion and in providing his poor relations with lucrative offices under the government a negotiation for peace was brought upon the carpet by the mediation of certain neutral powers and orator taycho arrogated to himself the province of discussing the several articles of the treaty  upon this occasion he showed himself surprizingly remiss and indifferent in whatever related to the interest of japan particularly in regulating and fixing the boundaries of the chinese and japonese settlements in fatsisio the uncertainty of which had given rise to the war but when the business was to determine the claims and pretensions of his ally brutantiffi on the continent of tartary he appeared stiff and immovable as mount athos he actually broke off the negotiation because the emperor of china would not engage to drive by force of arms the troops of his ally the princess of ostrog from a village or two belonging to the tartarian freebooter who by the bye had left them defenseless at the beginning of the war on purpose that his enemies might by taking possession of them quicken the resolutions of the dairo to send over an army for the protection of yesso  the court of pekin perceiving that the japonese were rendered intolerably insolent and overbearing by success and that an equitable peace could not be obtained while orator taycho managed the reins of government at meaco and his friend brutantiffi found any thing to plunder in tartary resolved to fortify themselves with a new alliance they actually entered into closer connections with the king of corea who was nearly related to the chinese emperor had some old scores to settle with japan and because he desired those disputes might be amicably compromised in the general pacification had been grossly insulted by taycho in the person of his ambassador he had for some time dreaded the ambition of the japonese ministry which seemed to aim at universal empire and he was moreover stimulated by this outrage to conclude a defensive alliance with the emperor of china a measure which all the caution of the two courts could not wholly conceal from the knowledge of the japonese politicians  mean while a dreadful cloud big with ruin and disgrace seemed to gather round the head of brutantiffi the mantchoux tartars sensible of the inconvenience of their distant situation from the scene of action which rendered it impossible for them to carry on their operations vigorously in conjunction with the ostrog resolved to secure winter quarters in some part of the enemys territories from whence they should be able to take the field and act against him early in the spring with this view they besieged and took a frontier fortress belonging to brutantiffi situated upon a great inland lake which extended as far as the capital of the mantchoux who were thus enabled to send thither by watercarriage all sorts of provisions and military stores for the use of their army which took up their winter quarters accordingly in and about this new acquisition it was now that the ruin of brutantiffi seemed inevitable orator taycho saw with horror the precipice to the brink of which his dear ally was driven not that his fears were actuated by sympathy or friendship such emotions had never possessed the heart of taycho no he trembled because he saw his own popularity connected with the fate of the tartar it was the success and petty triumphs of this adventurer which had dazzled the eyes of the blatant beast so as to disorder its judgment and prepare it for the illusions of the orator but now that fortune seemed ready to turn tail to brutantiffi and leave him a prey to his adversaries taycho knew the dispositions of the monster so well as to prognosticate that its applause and affection would be immediately turned into grumbling and disgust and that he himself who had led it blindfold into this unfortunate connection might possibly fall a sacrifice to its resentment provided he could not immediately project some scheme to divert its attention and transfer the blame from his own shoulders  for this purpose he employed his invention and succeeded to his wish having called a council of the twentyeight at which the dairo assisted in person he proposed and insisted upon it that a strong squadron of fune should be immediately ordered to scour the seas and kidnap all the vessels and ships belonging to the king of corea who had acted during the whole war with the most scandalous partiality in favor of the chinese emperor and was now so intimately connected with that potentate by means of a secret alliance that he ought to be prosecuted with the same hostilities which the other had severely felt the whole council were confounded at this proposal the dairo stood aghast the cuboy trembled yakstrot stared like a skewered pig after some pause the president soosansino ventured to observe that the measure seemed to be a little abrupt and premature that the nation was already engaged in a very expensive war which had absolutelutely drained it of its wealth and even loaded it with enormous debts therefore little able to sustain such additional burdens as would in all probability be occasioned by a rupture with a prince so rich and powerful gottomio swore the land holders were already so impoverished by the exactions of taycho that he himself ere long should be obliged to upon the parish fikakaka got up to speak but could only cackle stiphirumpoo was for proceeding in form by citation ninkompoopo declared he had good intelligence of a fleet of merchantships belonging to corea laden with treasure who were then on their return from the indian isles and he gave it as his opinion that they should be waylaid and brought into the harbors of japan not by way of declaring war but only with a view to prevent the moneys going into the coffers of the chinese emperor fokhsirokhu started two objections to this expedient first the uncertainty of falling in with the corean fleet at sea alleging as an instance the disappointment and miscarriage of the squadron which the seyseogun had sent some years ago to intercept the chinese fune on the coast of fatsisio secondly the loss and hardship it would be to many subjects of japan who dealt in commerce and had great sums embarked in those very corean bottoms indeed fokhsirokhu himself was interested in this very commerce the fatzman sat silent yakstrot who had some romantic notions of honor and honesty represented that the nation had already incurred the censure of all its neighbors by seizing the merchantships of china without any previous declaration of war that the law of nature and nations confirmed by repeated treaties prescribed a more honorable method of proceeding than that of plundering like robbers the ships of pacific merchants who trade on the faith of such laws and such treaties he was therefore of opinion that if the king of corea had in any shape deviated from the neutrality which he professed satisfaction should be demanded in the usual form and when that should be refused it might be found necessary to proceed to compulsive measures the dairo acquiesced in this advice and assured taycho that an ambassador should be forthwith dispatched to corea with instructions to demand an immediate and satisfactory explanation of that princes conduct and designs with regard to the empire of japan  this regular method of practice would by no means suit the purposes of taycho who rejected it with great insolence and disdain he bit his thumb at the president forked out his fingers on his forehead at gottomio wagged his underjaw at the cuboy snapt his fingers at stiphirumpoo grinned at the seyseogun made the sign of the cross or gallows to fokhsirokhu then turning to yakstrot he clapped his thumbs in his ears and began to bray like an ass finally pulling out the badge of his office he threw it at the dairo who in vain entreated him to be pacified and wheeling to the rightabout stalked away slapping the flat of his hand upon a certain part that shall be nameless he was followed by his kinsman the quo lobkob who worshipped him with the most humble adoration he now imitated this great original in the signal from behind at parting and in him it was attended by a rumbling sound but whether this was the effect of contempt or compunction i could never learn  taycho having thus carried his point which was to have a pretense for quitting the reins of government made his next appeal to the blatant beast he reminded the manyheaded monster of the uninterrupted success which had attended his administration of his having supported the glorious brutantiffi the great bulwark of the religion of bupo who had kept the common enemy at bay and filled all asia with the fame of his victories he told them that for his own part he pretended to have subdued fatsisio in the heart of tartary that he despised honors and had still a greater contempt for riches and that all his endeavors had been solely exerted for the good of his country which was now brought to the very verge of destruction he then gave the beast to understand that he had formed a scheme against the king of corea which would not only have disabled that monarch from executing his hostile intentions with respect to japan but also have indemnified this nation for the whole expense of the war but that his proposal having been rejected by the council of twentyeight who were influencd by yakstrot a ximian mountaineer without spirit or understanding he had resigned his office with intention to retire to some solitude where he should in silence deplore the misfortunes of his country and the ruin of the buponian religion which must fall of course with its great protector brutantiffi whom he foresaw the new ministry would immediately abandon  this address threw legion into such a qnandary that it rolled itself in the dirt and yelled hideously mean while the orator retreating to a cell in the neighborhood of meaco hired the common crier to go round the streets and proclaim that taycho being no longer in a condition to afford any thing but the bare necessaries of life would by public sale dispose of his ambling mule and furniture together with an ermined robe of his wife and the greater part of his kitchen utensils at this time he was well known to be worth upwards of twenty thousand gold obans nevertheless the mobile discharging this circumstance entirely from their reflection attended to nothing but the object which the orator was pleased to present they thought it was a piteous case and a great scandal upon the government that such a patriot who had saved the nation from ruin and disgrace should be reduced to the cruel necessity of selling his mule and his household furniture accordingly they raised a clamor that soon rung in the ears of giogio and his favorite  it was supposed that muraclami suggested on this occasion to his countryman yakstrot the hint of offering a pension to taycho by way of remuneration for his past services if he refuses it said he the offer will at least reflect some credit upon the dairo and the administration but should he accept of it which is much more likely it will either stop his mouth entirely or expose him to the censure of the people who now adore him as a mirror of disinterested integrity the advice was instantly complied with the dairo signed a patent for a very ample pension to taycho and his heirs which patent yakstrot delivered to him next day at his cell in the country this miracle of patriotism received the bounty as a turnpikeman receives the toll and then slapped his door full in the face of the favorite yet nothing of what muraclami had prognosticated came to pass the manytailed monster far from calling in question the orators disinterestedness considered his acceptance of the pension as a proof of his moderation in receiving such a trifling reward for the great services he had done his country and the generosity of the dairo instead of exciting the least emotion of gratitude in taychos own breast acted only as a golden key to unlock all the sluices of his virulence and abuse  these however he kept within bounds until he should see what would be the fate of brutantiffi who now seemed to be in the condition of a criminal at the foot of the ladder in this dilemma he obtained a very unexpected reprieve before the army of the mantchoux could take the least advantage of the settlement they had made on his frontiers their empress died and was succeeded by a weak prince who no sooner ascended the throne than he struck up a peace with the tartar freebooter and even ordered his troops to join him against the ostrog to whom they had hithertoacted as auxiliaries such an accession of strength would have cast the balance greatly in his favor had not providence once more interposed and brought matters again to an equilibrium  taycho no sooner perceived his ally thus unexpectedly delivered from the dangers that surrounded him than he began to repent of his own resignation and resolved once more to force his way to the helm by the same means he had so successfully used before he was indeed of such a turbulent disposition as could not relish the repose of private life and his spirit so corrosive that it would have preyed upon himself if he could not have found external food for it to devour he therefore began to prepare his engines and provide proper emissaries to bespatter and raise a hueandcry against yakstrot at a convenient season not doubting but an occasion would soon present itself considering the temper inexperience and prejudices of this ximian politician together with the pacific system he had adopted so contrary to the present spirit of the blatant beast  in these preparations he was much comforted and assisted by his kinsman and pupil lobkob who entered into his measures with surprising zeal and had the good luck to light on such instruments as were admirably suited to the work in hand yakstrot was extremely pleased at the secession of taycho who had been a very troublesome colleague to him in the administration and run counter to all the schemes he had projected for the good of the empire he now found himself at liberty to follow his own inventions and being naturally an enthusiast believed himself born to be the savior of japan some efforts however he made to acquire popularity proved fruitless perceiving the people were by the orators instigations exasperated against the king of corea he sent a peremptory message to that prince demanding a categorical answer and this being denied declared war against him according to the practice of all civilized nations but even this measure failed of obtaining that approbation for which it was taken the monster tutored by taycho and his ministers exclaimed that the golden opportunity was lost inasmuch as during the observance of those useless forms the treasures of corea were safely brought home to that kingdom treasures which had they been interrupted by the fune of japan would have paid off the debts of the nation and enabled the inhabitants of meaco to pave their streets with silver by the bye this treasure existed no where but in the fiction of taycho and the imagination of the blatant beast which never attempted to use the evidence of sense on reason to examine any assertion how absurd and improbable soever it might be which proceeded from the mouth of the orator  yakstrot having now taken upon himself the task of steering the political bark resolved to show the japonese that although he recommended peace he was as well qualified as his predecessor for conducting the war he therefore with the assistance of the fatzman projected three naval enterprises the first against thinquo the conquest of which had been unsuccessfully attempted by taycho the second was destined for the reduction of fanyah one of the most considerable settlements belonging to the king of corea in the indian ocean and the third armament was sent to plunder and destroy a flourishing colony called llinam which the same prince had established almost as far to the southward as the terra australis incognita now the only merit which either yakstrot or any other minister could justly claim from the success of such expeditions is that of adopting the most feasible of those schemes which are presented by different projectors and of appointing such commanders as are capable of conducting them with vigor and sagacity  the next step which the favorite took was to provide a helpmate for the young dairo and a certain tartar princess of the religion of bupo being pitched upon for this purpose was formally demanded brought over to niphon espoused by giogio and installed empress with the usual solemnities but lest the choice of a tartarian princess should subject the dairo to the imputation of inheriting his predecessors predilection for the land of yesso which had given such sensible umbrage to all the sensible japonese who made use of their own reason he determined to detach his master gradually from those continental connexions which had been the source of such enormous expense and such continual vexation to the empire of japan in these sentiments he withheld the annual tribute which had been lately paid to brutantiffi by which means he saved a very considerable sum to the nation and at the same time rescued it from the infamy of such a disgraceful imposition  he expected the thanks of the public for this exertion of his influence in favor of his country but he reckoned without his host what he flattered himself would yield him an abundant harvest of honor and applause produced nothing but odium and reproach as we shall see in the sequel  these measures pursued with an eye to the advantage of the public which seemed to argue a considerable share of spirit and capacity were strangely chequered with others of a more domestic nature which savoured strongly of childish vanity rash ambition littleness of mind and lack of understanding he purchased a vast wardrobe of tawdry clothes and fluttered in all the finery of japan he prevailed upon his master to vest him with the badges and trappings of all the honorary institutions of the empire although this multiplication of orders in the person of one man was altogether without precedent or prescription this was only setting himself up as the more conspicuous mark for envy and detraction  not contented with engrossing the personal favor and confidence of his sovereign and in effect directing the whole machine of government he thought his fortune still imperfect while the treasure of the empire passed through the hands of the cuboy enabling that minister to maintain a very extensive influence which might one day interfere with his own he therefore employed all his invention together with that of his friends to find out some specious pretext for removing the old cuboy from his office and in a little time accident afforded what all their intrigues had not been able to procure  ever since the demise of gothamababa poor fikakaka had been subject to a new set of vagaries the death of his old master gave him a rude shock then the new dairo encroached upon his province by preferring a bonze without his consent or knowledge finally he was prevented by the express order of giogio from touching a certain sum out of the treasury which he had been accustomed to throw out of his windows at stated peperiods in order to keep up an interest among the dregs of the people all these mortifications had an effect upon the weak brain of the cuboy he began to loath his usual food and sometimes even declined showing himself to the bonzes at his levee symptoms that alarmed all his friends and dependants instead of frequenting the assemblies of the great he now attended assiduously at all groanings and christenings grew extremely fond of caudle and held conferences with practitioners both male and female in the art of midwifry when business or ceremony obliged him to visit any of the quos or quanbukus of meaco he by a surprising instinct ran directly to the nursery where if there happened to be a child in the cradle he took it up and if it was foul wiped it with great care and seeming satisfaction he moreover learned of the good women to sing lullabies and practiced them with uncommon success but the most extravagant of all his whims was what he exhibited one day in his own courtyard observing a nest with some eggs which the goose had quitted he forthwith dropped his trowsers and squatting down in the attitude of incubation began to stretch out his neck to hiss and to cackle as if he had been really metamorphosed into the animal whose place he now supplied  it was on the back of this adventure that one of the bonzes as prying and as great a gossip as the barber of midas in paying his morning worship to the cuboys posteriors spied something or rather nothing and was exceedingly affrighted he communicated his discovery and apprehension to diverse others of the cloth and they were all of opinion that some effectual inquisition should be held on this phenomenon lest the clergy of japan should hereafter be scandalized as having knowingly kissed the breech of an old woman perhaps a monster or magician information was accordingly made to the dairo who gave orders for immediate inspection and fikakaka was formally examined by a jury of matrons whether these were actuated by undue influence i shall not at present explain certain it is they found their verdict the cuboy non mas and among other evidences produced to attest his metamorphosis a certain ximian who pretended to have the second sight made oath that he had one evening seen the said fikakaka in a female dress riding through the air on a broomstick the unhappy cuboy being thus convicted was divested of his office and confined to his palace in the country while giogio by the advice of his favorite published a proclamation declaring it was not for the honor of japan that her treasury should be managed either by a witch or an old woman  fikakaka being thus removed yakstrot was appointed treasurer and cuboy in his place and now ruled the roast with uncontrouled authority on the very threshold of his greatness however he made a false step which was one cause of his tottering during the whole sequel of his administration in order to refute the calumnies and defeat the intrigues of taycho in the assemblies of the people he chose as an associate in the ministry fokhsirokhu who was at that instant the most unpopular man in the whole empire of japan and at the instigation of this colleague deprived of bread a great number of poor families who subsisted on petty places which had been bestowed upon them by the former cuboy those were so many mouths opened to augment the clamor against his own person and administration  it might be imagined that while he thus set one part of the nation at defiance he would endeavor to cultivate the other and in particular strive to conciliate the good will of the nobility who did not see his exaltation without umbrage but instead of ingratiating himself with them by a liberal turn of demeanor by treating them with frankness and affability granting them favors with a good grace making entertainments for them at his palace and mixing in their social parties of pleasure yakstrot always appeared on the reserve and under all his finery continually wore a doublet of buckram which gave an air of stiffness and constraint to his whole behavior he studied postures and in giving audience generally stood in the attitude of the idol fo so that he sometimes was mistaken for an image of stone he formed a scale of gesticulation in a great variety of divisions comprehending the slightest inclination of the head the frontnod the sidenod the bow the half the semidemibow with the shuffle the slide the circular semicircular and quadrant sweep of the right foot with equal care and precision did he model the economy of his looks into the divisions and subdivisions of the fullstare the sideglance the pensive look the pouting look the gay look the vacant look and the stolid look to these different expressions of the eye he suited the corresponding features of the nose and mouth such as the wrinkled nose the retorted nose the sneer the grin the simper and the smile all these postures and gesticulations he practiced and distributed occasionally according to the difference of rank and importance of the various individuals with whom he had communication  but these affected airs being assumed in despite of nature he appeared as awkward as a native of angola when he is first hampered with clothes or a highlander obliged by act of parliament to wear breeches  indeed the distance observed by yakstrot in his behavior to the nobles of niphon was imputed to his being conscious of a sulphurous smell which came from his own body so that greater familiarity on his side might have bred contempt he took delight in no other conversation but that of two or three obscure ximians his companions and counselors with whom he spent all his leisure time in conferences upon politics patriotism philosophy and the belles lettres those were the oracles he consulted in all the emergencies of state and with these he spent many an attic evening  the gods not yet tired of sporting with the farce of human government were still resolved to show by what inconsiderable springs a mighty empire may be moved the new cuboy was vastly well disposed to make his ximian favorites great men it was in his power to bestow places and pensions upon them but it was not in his power to give them consequence in the eyes of the public the administration of yakstrot could not fail of being propitious to his own family and poor relations who were very numerous their naked backs and hungry bellies were now clothed with the richest stuffs and fed with the fat things of japan every department civil and military was filled with ximians those islanders came over in shoals to niphon and swarmed in the streets of meaco where they were easily distinguished by their lank sides gaunt looks lanthornjaws and long sharp teeth  there was a fatality that attended the whole conduct of this unfortunate cuboy his very partiality to his own countrymen brought upon him at last the curses of the whole clan  mr orator taycho and his kinsman lobkob were not idle in the mean time they provided their emissaries and primed all their engines their understrappers filled every corner of meaco with rumors jealousies and suspicions yakstrot was represented as a statesman without discernment a minister without knowledge and a man without humanity he was taxed with insupportable pride indiscretion pusillanimity rapacity partiality and breach of faith it was affirmed that he had dishonored the nation and endangered the very existence of the buponian religion in withdrawing the annual subsidy from the great brutantiffi that he wanted to starve the war and betray the glory and advantage of the empire by a shameful peace that he had avowedly shared his administration with the greatest knave in japan that he treated the nobles of niphon with insolence and contempt that he had suborned evidence against the ancient cuboy fikakaka who had spent a long life and an immense fortune in supporting the temple of fakkubasi that he had cruelly turned adrift a great number of helpless families in order to gratify his own worthless dependants with their spoils that he had enriched his relations and countrymen with the plunder of niphon that his intention was to bring over the whole nation of ximians a savage race who had been ever perfidious greedy and hostile toward the natives of the other japonese islands nay they were described as monsters in nature with cloven feet long tails saucer eyes iron fangs and claws who would first devour the substance of the niphonites and then feed upon their blood  taycho had legions understanding so much in his power that he actually made it believe yakstrot had formed a treasonable scheme in favor of a foreign adventurer who pretended to the throne of japan and that the reigning dairo was an accomplice in this project for his own deposition indeed they did not scruple to say that giogio was no more than a puppet moved by his own grandmother and this vile ximian between whom they hinted there was a secret correspondence which reflected very little honor on the family of the dairo  mr orator taycho and his associate lobkob left no stone unturned to disgrace the favorite and drive him from the helm they struck up an alliance with the old cuboy fikakaka and fetching him from his retirement produced him to the beast as a martyr to loyalty and virtue they had often before this period exposed him to the derision of the populace but now they set him up as the object of veneration and esteem and every thing succeeded to their wish legion hoisted fikakaka on his back and paraded through the streets of meaco braying hoarse encomiums on the great talents and great virtues of the ancient cuboy his cause was now espoused by his old friends stiphirumpoo and ninkompoopoo who had been turned adrist along with him and by several other quos who had nestled themselves in warm places under the shadow of his protection but it was remarkable that not one of all the bonzes who owed their preferment to his favor had gratitude enough to sollow his fortune or pay the least respect to him in the day of his disgrace  advantage was also taken of the disgust occasioned by yakstrots reserve among the nobles of japan even the fatzman was estranged from the councils of his kinsman giogio and lent his name and countenance to the malcontents who now formed themselves into a very formidable cabal comprehending a great number of the first quos in the empire  in order to counterballance this confederacy which was a strange coalition of jarring interests the new cuboy endeavored to strengthen his administration by admitting into a share of it gottomio who dreaded nothing so much as the continuation of the war and diverse other noblemen whose alliance contributed very little to his interest or advantage gottomio was universally envied for his wealth and detested for his avarice the rest were either of the sheitkumsheitel faction which had been long in disgrace with the mobile or men of desperate fortunes and loose morals who attached themselves to the ximian favorite solely on account of the posts and pensions he had to bestow  during these domestic commotions the arms of japan continued to prosper in the indian ocean thinquo was reduced almost without opposition and news arrived that the conquest of fanyah was already more than half achieved at the same time some considerable advantages were gained over the enemy on the continent of tartary by the japonese forces under the command of bronxitic it might be naturally supposed that these events would have in some measure reconciled the niphonites to the new ministry but they produced rather a contrary effect the blatant beast was resolved to rejoice at no victories but those that were obtained under the auspices of its beloved taycho and now took it highly amiss that yakstrot should presume to take any step which might redound to the glory of the empire nothing could have pleased the monster at this juncture so much as the miscarriage of both expeditions and a certain information that all the troops and ships employed in them had miserably perished the king of corea however was so alarmed at the progress of the japonese before fanyah that he began to tremble for all his distant colonies and earnestly craved the advice of the cabinet of pekin touching some scheme to make a diversion in their favor  the councils of pekin have been ever fruitful of intrigues to embroil the rest of asia they suggested a plan to the king of corea which he forthwith put in execution the land of fumma which borders on the corean territories was governed by a prince nearly allied to the king of corea although his subjects had very intimate connexions in the way of commerce with the empire of japan which indeed had entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with this country the emperor of china and the king of corea having sounded the sovereign of fumma and found him well disposed to enter into their measures communicated their scheme in which he immediately concurred they called upon him in public as their friend and ally to join them against the japonese as the inveterate enemy of the religion of fo and as an insolent people who affected a despotism at sea to the detriment and destruction of all their neighbors plainly declaring that he must either immediately break with the dairo or expect an invasion on the side of corea the prince of fumma affected to complain loudly of this iniquitous proposal he made a merit of rejecting the alternative and immediately demanded of the court of meaco the succors stipulated in the treaty of alliance in order to defend his dominions in all appearance indeed there was no time to be lost for the monarchs of china and corea declared war against him without further hesitation and uniting their forces on that side ordered them to enter the land of fumma after having given satisfactory assurances in private that the prince had nothing to fear from their hostilities  yakstrot was not much embarrassed on this occasion without suspecting the least collusion among the parties he resolved to take the prince of fumma under his protection thereunto moved by diverse considerations first and foremost he piqued himself upon his good faith secondly he knew that the trade with fumma was of great consequence to japan and therefore concluded that his supporting the sovereign of it would be a popular measure thirdly he hoped that the multiplication of expense incurred by this new war would make the blatant beast wince under its burden and of consequence reconcile it to the thoughts of a general pacification which he had very much at heart mean while he hastened the necessary succors to the land of fumma and sent thither an old general called leyawter in order to concert with the prince and his ministers the operations of the campaign  this officer was counted one of the shrewdest politicians in japan and having resided many years as ambassador in fumma was well acquainted with the genius of that people he immediately discovered the scene which had been acted behind the curtain he found that the prince of fumma far from having made any preparations for his own defense had actually withdrawn his garrisons from the frontier places which were by this time peaceably occupied by the invading army of chinese and coreans that the few troops he had were without clothes arms and discipline and that he had amused the court of meaco with false musters and a specious account of levies and preparations which had been made in a word though he could not learn the particulars he comprehended the whole mystery of the secret negotiations he upbraided the minister of fumma with persidy refused to assume the command of the japonese auxiliaries when they arrived and returning to meaco communicated his discoveries and suspicions to the new cuboy but he did not meet with that reception which he thought he deserved for intelligence of such importance yakstrot affected to doubt perhaps he was not really convinced or if he was thought proper to temporize and he was in the right for so doing a rupture with fumma at this juncture would have forced the prince to declare openly for the enemies of japan in which case the inhabitants of niphon would have lost the benefit of a very advantageous trade they had already been great sufferers in commerce by the breach with the king of corea whose subjects had been used to take off great quantities of the japonese manufactures for which they paid in gold and silver and they could ill bear such an additional loss as an interruption of the trade with fumma would have occasioned the cuboy therefore continued to treat the prince of that country as a staunch ally who had sacrificed every other consideration to his good faith and far from restricting himself to the number of troops and fune stipulated in the treaty sent over a much more numerous body of sorces and ships of war declaring at the same time he would support the people of fumma with the whole power of japan  such a considerable diversion of the japonese strength could not fail to answer in some measure the expectation of the two sovereigns of china and corea but it did not prevent the success of the expeditions which were actually employed against their colonies in the indian ocean it was not in his power however to protect fumma had the invaders been in earnest but the combined army of the chinese and coreans had orders to protract the war and instead of penetrating to the capital at a time when the fummians though joined with the auxiliaries of japan were not numerous enough to look them in the face they made a fullstop in the middle of their march and quietly retired into summer quarters  the additional encumbrance of a new continental war redoubled the cuboys desire of peace and his inclination being known to the enemy who were also sick of the war they had recourse to the good offices of a certain neutral power called saboi sovereign of the mountains of cambodia this prince accordingly offered his mediation at the court of meaco and it was immediately accepted  the negotiation for peace which had been broke off in the ministry of taycho was now resumed an ambassador plenipotentiary arrived from pekin and gottomio was sent thither in the same capacity in order to adjust the articles and sign the preliminaries of peace  while this new treaty was on the carpet the armament equipped against fanyah under the command of the quo kepmarl and the brave admiral who had signalized himself in the sea of kamtschatka reduced that important place where they became masters of a strong squadron of fune belonging to the king of corea together with a very considerable treasure sufficient to indemnify japan for the expense of the expedition this though the most grievous was not the only disaster which the war brought upon the coreans their distant settlement of llinam was likewise taken by general trarep and the inhabitants paid an immense sum in order to redeem their capital from plunder  these successes did not at all retard the conclusion of the treaty which was indeed become equally necessary to all the parties concerned japan in particular was in danger of being ruined by her conquests the war had destroyed so many men that the whole empire could not afford a sufficiency of recruits for the maintenance of the landforces all those who had conquered fatsisio and fanyah were already destroyed by hard duty and the diseases of those unhealthy climates above twothirds of the fune were rotten in the course of service and the complements of mariners reduced to less than one half of their original numbers troops were actually wanting to garrison the new conquests the finances of japan were by this time drained to the bottom one of her chief resources was stopped by the rupture with corea while her expenses were considerably augmented and her national credit was stretched even to cracking all these considerations stimulated more and more the dairo and his cuboy to conclude the work of peace  mean while the enemies of yakstrot gave him no quarter nor respite they vilified his parts traduced his morals endeavored to intimidate him with threats which did not even respect the dairo and never failed to insult him whenever he appeared in public it had been the custom time immemorial for the chief magistrate of meaco to make an entertainment for the dairo and his empress immediately after their nuptials and to this banquet all the great quos in japan were invited the person who filled the chair at present was rhumkikh an halfwitted politician selfconceited headstrong turbulent and ambitious a professed worshipper of taycho whose oratorial talents he admired and attempted to imitate in the assemblies of the people where he generally excited the laughter of his audience by dint of great wealth and extensive traffic he became a man of consequence among the mob notwithstanding an illiberal turn of mind and an ungracious address and now he resolved to use this influence for the glory of taycho and the disgrace of the ximian favorite legion was tutored for the purpose and moreover well primed with a fiery caustic spirit in which rhumkikh was a considerable dealer the dairo and his young empress were received by him and his council with a sullen formality in profound silence the cuboy was pelted as he passed along and his litter almost overturned by the monster which yelled and brayed and hooted without ceasing until he was housed in the cityhall where he met with every sort of mortification from the entertainer as well as the spectators at length mr orator taycho with his cousin lobkob appearing in a triumphal car at the citygate the blatant beast received them with loud huzzas unharnessed their horses and putting itself in the traces drew them through the streets of meaco which resounded with acclamation they were received with the same exultation within the hall of entertainment where their sovereign and his consort sat altogether unhonoured and unnoticed  a small squadron of chinese fune having taken possession of a defenseless fishery belonging to japan in the neighborhood of fatsisio the emissaries of taycho magnified this event into a terrible misfortune arising from the maladministration of the new cuboy nay they did not scruple to affirm that he had left the fishingtown defenseless on purpose that it might be taken by the enemy this clamor however was of short duration the quo phylkholl who commanded a few fune in one of the harbors of fatsisio no sooner received intelligence of what had happened than he embarked what troops were at hand and sailing directly to the place obliged the enemy to abandon their conquest with precipitation and disgrace  in the midst of these transactions the peace was signed ratified and even approved in the great national council of the quos as well as in the assembly of the people the truth is the minister of japan has it always in his power to secure a majority in both these conventions by means that may be easily guessed and those were not spared on this occasion yakstrot in a speech harangued the great council who were not a little surprised to hear him speak with such propriety and extent of knowledge for he had been represented as tonguetied and in point of elocution little better than the palfrey he rode he now vindicated all the steps he had taken since his accession to the helm he demonstrated the necessity of a pacification explained and descanted upon every article of the treaty and finally declared his conscience was so clear in this matter that when he died he should desire no other encomium to be engraved on his tomb but that he was the author of this peace  nevertheless the approbation of the council was not obtained without violent debate and altercation the different articles were censured and inveighed against by the fatzman the late cuboy fikakaka lobkob stiphirumpoo ninkompoopoo and many other quos but at the longrun the influence of the present ministry predominated as for taycho he exerted himself in a very extraordinary effort to depreciate the peace in the assembly of the people he had for some days pretended to be dangerously ill that he might make a merit of his patriotism by showing a contempt for his own life when the good of his country was at stake in order to excite the admiration of the public and render his appearance in the assembly the more striking he was carried thither on a kind of handbarrow wrapped up in flannel with three woollen nightcaps on his head efcorted by legion which yelled and brayed and whooped and hollowed with such vociferation that every street of meaco rung with hideous clamor in this equipage did taycho enter the assembly where being held up by two adherents he after a prelude of groans to rouse the attention of his audience began to declaim against the peace as inadequate shameful and disadvantageous nay he ventured to stigmatize every separate article though he knew it was in the power of each individual of his hearers to confront him with the terms to which he had subscribed the preceding year in all respects less honorable and advantageous to his country inconsistencies equally glaring and absurd he had often crammed down the throats of the multitude but they would not go down with this assembly of the people which in spite of his flannel his nightcaps his crutches and his groans confirmed the treaty of peace by a great majority not that they had any great reason to applaud the peacemakers who might have dictated their own terms had they proceeded with more sagacity and less precipitation but fokhsirokhu and his brother undertakers having the treasure of japan at their command had anointed the greatest part of the assembly with a certain precious salve which preserved them effectually from the fascinating arts of taycho  this orator incensed at his bad success within doors renewed and redoubled his operations without he exasperated legion aganst yakstrot to such a pitch of rage that the monster could not hear the cuboys name three times pronounced without falling into fits his confederate lobkob in the course of his researches found out two originals admirably calculated for executing his vengeance against the ximian favorite one of them called llurchir a profligate bonze degraded for his lewd life possessed a wonderful talent of exciting different passions in the blatant beast by dint of quaint rhimes which were said to be inspirations of the demon of obloquy to whom he had sold his soul these oracles not only commanded the passions but even influenced the organs of the beast in such a manner as to occasion an evacuation either upwards or downwards at the pleasure of the operator the other known by the name of jankidtzin was counted the best marksman in japan in the art and mystery of dirtthrowing he possessed the art of making balls of filth which were famous for sticking and stinking and these he threw with such dexterity that they very seldom missed their aim being reduced to a low ebb of fortune by his debaucheries he had made advances to the new cuboy who had rejected his proffered services on account of his immoral character a prudish punctilio which but ill became yakstrot who had paid very little regard to reputation in choosing some of the colleagues he had associated in his administration be that as it may he no sooner understood that mr orator taycho was busy in preparing for an active campaign than he likewise began to put himself in a posture of defense he hired a body of mercenaries and provided some dirtmen and rhymers then taking the field a sharp contest and peltingmatch ensued but the dispute was soon terminated yakstrots versifiers turned out no great conjurers on the trial they were not such favorites of the demon as llurchir the rhimes they used produced no other effect upon legion but that of setting it abraying the cuboys dirtmen however played their parts tolerably well though their balls were inferior in point of composition to those of jankidtzin they did not fail to discompose orator taycho and his friend lobkob whose eyes were seen to water with the smart occasioned by those missiles but these last had a great advantage over their adversaries in the zeal and attachment of legion whose numerous tongues were always ready to lick off the ordure that stuck to any part of their leaders and this they did with such signs of satisfaction as seemed to indicate an appetite for all manner of filth  yakstrot having suffered wosully in his own person and seeing his partisans in confusion thought proper to retreat yet although discomfited he was not discouraged on the contrary having at bottom a fund of fanaticism which like camomile grows the faster for being trod upon he became more obstinately bent than ever upon prosecuting his own schemes for the good of the people in their own despite his vanity was likewise buoyed up by the flattery of his creatures who extolled the passive courage he had shown in the late engagement though every part of him still tingled and stunk from the balls of the enemy he persuaded himself that not one of their missiles had taken place and of consequence that there was something of divinity in his person full of this notion he discarded his rhymsters and his dirtcasters as unnecessary and resolved to bear the brunt of the battle in his own individual  fokhsirokhu advised him nevertheless to fill his trowsers with gold obans which he might throw at legion in case of necessity assuring him that this was the only ammunition which the monster could not withstand the advice was good and the cuboy might have followed it without being obliged to the treasury of japan for he was by this time become immensely rich in consequence of having found a hoard in digging his garden but this was an expedient which yakstrot could never be prevailed upon to use either on this or any other occasion indeed he was now so convinced of his own personal energy that he persuaded his master giogio to come forth and see it operate on the blatant beast accordingly the dairo ascended his car of state while the cuboy arrayed in all his trappings stood before him with the reins in his own hand and drove directly to the enemy who waited for him without flinching being arrived within dungshot of jankidtzin he made a halt and putting himself in the attitude of the idol fo with a simper in his countenance seemed to invite the warrior to make a full discharge of his artillery he did not long wait in suspense the balls soon began to whizz about his ears and a great number took effect upon his person at length he received a shot upon his right temple which brought him to the ground all his gewgaws fluttered and his buckram doublet rattled as he fell llurchir no sooner beheld him prostrate than advancing with the monster he began to repeat his rhymes at which every mouth and every tail of legion was opened and listed up and such a torrent of filth squirted from these channels that the unfortunate cuboy was quite overwhelmed nay he must have been actually suffocated where he lay had not some of the dairos attendants interposed and rescued him from the vengeance of the monster he was carried home in such an unsavory pickle that his family smelled his disaster long before he came in sight and when he appeared in this woeful condition covered with ordure blinded with dirt and even deprived of sense and motion his wife was seized with hysterica passio he was immediately stripped and washed and other means being used for his recovery he in a little time retrieved his recollection  he was now pretty well undeceived with respect to the divinity of his person but his enthusiasm took a new turn he aspired to the glory of martyrdom and resolved to devote himself as a victim to patriotic virtue while his attendants were employed in washing off the filth that stuck to his beard he recited in a theatrical tone the stanza of a famous japonese bard whose soul afterward transmigrated into the body of the roman poet horatius flaccus and inspired him with the same sentiment in the latin tongue virtus repulsae nescia sordidae intaminatis fulget honoribus nec sumit aut ponit secures arbitrio popularis aurae   his friends hearing him declare his resolution of dying for his country began to fear that his understanding was disturbed they advised him to yield to the torrent which was become too impetuous to stem to resign the cuboyship quietly and reserve his virtues for a more favorable occasion in vain his friends remonstrated in vain his wife and children employed their tears and entreaties to the same purpose he lent a deaf ear to all their solicitations until they began to drop some hints that seemed to imply a suspicion of his insanity which alarmed him exceedingly and the dairo himself signifying to him in private that it was become absolutely necessary to temporize he resigned the reins of government with a heavy heart though not before he was assured that he should still continue to exert his influence behind the curtain  giogios own person had not escaped untouched in the last skirmish jankidtzin was transported to such a pitch of insolence that he aimed some balls at the dairo and one of them taking place exactly betwixt the eyes defiled his whole visage had the laws of japan been executed in all their severity against this audacious plebeian he would have suffered crucifixion on the spot but giogio being goodnatured even to a fault contented himself with ordering some of his attendants to apprehend and put him in the public stocks after having seized the whole cargo of filth which he had collected at his habitation for the manufacture of his balls legion was no sooner informed of his disgrace than it released him by force being therein comforted and abetted by the declaration of a puny magistrate called praffpattphogg who seized this as the only opportunity he should ever find of giving himself any consequence in the commonwealth accordingly the monster hoisting him and jankidtzin on their shoulders went in procession through the streets of meaco hollowing huzzaing and extolling this venerable pair of patriots as the palladia of the liberty of japan  the monsters officious zeal on this occasion was far from being agreeable to mr orator taycho who took umbrage at this exaltation of his two understrappers and from that moment devoted jankidtzin to destruction the dairo finding it absolutely necessary for the support of his government that this dirtmonger should be punished gave directions for trying him according to the laws of the land he was ignominiously expelled from the assembly of the people where his old patron taycho not only disclaimed him but even represented him as a worthless atheist and sower of sedition but he escaped the weight of a more severe sentence in another tribunal by retreating without beat of drum into the territories of china where he found an asylum from whence he made diverse ineffectual appeals to the multitudinous beast at niphon  as for yakstrot he was every thing but a downright martyr to the odium of the public which produced a ferment all over the nation his name was become a term of reproach he was burnt or crucified in effigy in every city town village and district of niphon even his own countrymen the ximians held him in abhorrence and execration notwithstanding his partiality to the natale solum he had not been able to provide for all those adventurers who came from thence in consequence of his promotion the whole number of the disappointed became his enemies of course and the rest finding themselves exposed to the animosity and ill offices of their fellow subjects of niphon who hated the whole community for his sake inveighed against yakstrot as the curse of their nation  in the midst of all this detestation and disgrace it must be owned for the sake of truth that yakstrot was one of the honestest men in japan and certainly the greatest benefactor to the empire just upright sincere and charitable his heart was susceptible of friendship and tenderness he was a virtuous husband a fond father a kind master and a zealous friend in his public capacity he had nothing in view but the advantage of japan in the prosecution of which he flattered himself he should be able to display all the abilities of a profound statesman and all the virtues of the most sublime patriotism it was here he overrated his own importance his virtue became the dupe of his vanity nature had denied him shining talents as well as that easiness of deportment that affability liberal turn and versatile genius without which no man can ever figure at the head of an administration nothing could be more absurd than his being charged with want of parts and understanding to guide the helm of government considering how happily it had been conducted for many years by fikakaka whose natural genius would have been found unequal even to the art and mystery of woolcombing besides the war had prospered in his hands as much as it ever did under the auspices of his predecessor though as i have before observed neither the one nor the other could justly claim any merit from its success  but yakstrots services to the public were much more important in another respect he had the resolution to dissolve the shameful and pernicious engagements which the empire had contracted on the continent of tartary he lightened the intolerable burdens of the empire he saved its credit when it was stretched even to bursting he made a peace which if not the most glorious that might have been obtained was at least the most solid and advantageous that ever japan had concluded with any power whatsoever and in particular much more honorable useful and ascertained than that which taycho had agreed to subscribe the preceding year and by this peace he put an end to all the horrors of a cruel war which had ravaged the best parts of asia and destroyed the lives of six hundred thousand men every year on the whole yakstrots good qualities were respectable there was very little vicious in his composition and as to his follies they were rather the subjects of ridicule than of resentment  yakstrots subalterns in the ministry rejoiced in secret at his running so far into the north of legions displeasure nay it was shrewdly suspected that some of their emissaries had been very active against him in the day of his discomfiture they flattered themselves that if he could be effectually driven from the presence of the dairo they would succeed to his influence and in the mean time would acquire popularity by turning tail to and kicking at the ximian favorite who had associated them in the administration in consequence of their vowing eternal attachment to his interest and constant submission to his will having held a secret conclave to concert their operations they began to execute their plan by seducing yakstrot into certain odious measures of raising new impositions on the people which did not fail indeed to increase the clamor of the blatant beast and promote its filthy discharge upwards and downwards but then the torrents were divided and many a tail was lifted up against the real projectors of the scheme which the favorite had adopted they now resolved to make a merit with the mobile by picking a german quarrel with strot and insulting him in public gottomio caused a scrubbingpost to be set up in the night at the cuboys door  the scribe zantific presented him with a scheme for the importation of brimstone into the island of ximo the other scribe pretended he could not spell the barbarous names of the cuboys relations and countrymen who were daily thrust into the most lucrative employments as for twitzer the financier he never approached yakstrot without clawing his knuckles in derision at the council of twentyeight they thwarted every plan he proposed and turned into ridicule every word he spoke at length they bluntly told the dairo that as yakstrot resigned the reins of administration in public he must likewise give up his management behind the curtain for they were not at all disposed to answer to the people for measures dictated by an invisible agent this was but a reasonable demand in which the emperor seemed to acquiesce but the new ministers thought it was requisite that they should commit some overt act of contempt for the abdicated cuboy one of his nearest relations had obtained a profitable office in the island of ximo and of this the new cabal insisted he should be immediately deprived the dairo remonstrated against the injustice of turning a man out of his place for no other reason but to satisfy their caprice and plainly told them he could not do it without infringing his honor as he had given his word that the possessor should enjoy the post for life far from being satisfied with this declaration they urged their demand with redoubled importunity mixed with menaces which equally embarrassed and incensed the goodnatured dairo at last yakstrot taking compassion upon his indulgent master prevailed upon his kinsman to release him from the obligation of his word by making a voluntary resignation of his office the dairo fell sick of vexation his life was despaired of and all japan was filled with alarm and apprehension at the prospect of an infants ascending the throne for the heir apparent was still in the cradle  their fears however were happily disappointed by the recovery of the emperor who to prevent as much as possible the inconveniences that might attend his demise during the minority of his son resolved that a regency should be established and ratified by the states of the empire the plan of this regency he concerted in private with the venerable princess his grandmother and his friend yakstrot and then communicated the design to his ministers who knowing the quarter from whence it had come treated it with coldness and contempt they were so elevated by their last triumph over the ximian favorite that they overlooked every obstacle to their ambition and determined to render the dairo dependant on them and them only with this view they threw cold water on the present measure and to mark their hatred of the favorite more strongly in the eyes of legion they endeavored to exclude the name of his patroness the dairos grandmother from the deed of regency though their malice was frustrated by the vigilance of yakstrot and the indignation of the states who resented this affront offered to the family of their sovereign  the tyranny of this junto became so intolerable to giogio that he resolved to shake off their yoke whatever might be the consequence but before any effectual step was taken for this purpose yakstrot who understood mechanics and had studied the art of puppetplaying tried an experiment on the organs of the cabal which he tempered with individually without success instead of uttering what he prompted the sounds came out quite altered in their passage gottomio grunted the financier twitzer bleated or rather brayed one scribe mewed like a cat the other yelped like a jackall in short they were found so perverse and refractory that the master of the motion kicked them off the stage and supplied the scene with a new set of puppets made of very extraordinary materials they were the very figures through whose pipes the charge of maladministration had been so loudly sounded against the ximian favorite they were now mustered by the fatzman and hung upon the pegs of the very same puppetshewman against whom they had so vehemently inveighed even the superannuated fikakaka appeared again upon the stage as an actor of some consequence and insisted upon it that his metamorphosis was a mere calumny but taycho and lobkob kept aloof because yakstrot had not yet touched them on the proper keys  the first exhibition of the new puppets was called topsyturvy a farce in which they overthrew all the paper houses which their predecessors had built but they performed their parts in such confusion that yakstrot interposing to keep them in order received diverse contusions and severe kicks on the shins which made his eyes water and indeed he had in a little time reason enough to repent of the revolution he had brought about the new sticks of administration proved more stiff and unmanageable than the former and those he had discarded associating with the blatant beast bedaubed him with such a variety of filth drained from all the sewers of scurrility that he really became a public nuisance gottomio pretended remorse of conscience and declared he would impeach yakstrot for the peace which he himself had negotiated twitzer snivelled and cried and cast figures to prove that yakstrot was born for the destruction of japan and zantific lured an incendiary bonze called toks to throw fireballs by night into the palace of the favorite  in this distress strot cast his eyes on taycho the monstertamer who alone seemed able to overbalance the weight of all other opposition and to him he made large advances accordingly but his offers were still inadequate to the expectations of that demagogue who nevertheless put on a face of capitulation he was even heard to say that yakstrot was an honest man and a good minister nay he declared he would ascend the highest pinnacle of the highest pagod in japan and proclaim that yakstrot had never directly nor indirectly meddled with administration since he resigned the public office of minister finding him however tardy and phlegmatic in his proposals he thought proper to change his phrase and in the next assembly of the people swore with great vociferation that the said yakstrot was the greatest rogue that ever escaped the gallows this was a necessary fillip to yakstrot and operated upon him so effectually that he forthwith sent a charte blanch to the great taycho and a treaty was immediately ratified on the following conditions that the said taycho should be raised to the rank of quanbuku and be appointed conservator of the dairos signet that no state measure should be taken without his express approbation that his creature the lawyer prafffog should be ennobled and preferred to the most eminent place in the tribunals of japan and that all his friends and dependants should be provided for at the public expense in such a manner as he himself should propose his kinsman lobkob however was not comprehended in this treaty the articles of which he inveighed against with such acrimony that a rupture ensued betwixt these two originals the truth is lobkob was now so full of his own importance that nothing less than an equal share of administration would satisfy his ambition and this was neither in taychos power nor inclination to grant  the first consequence of this treaty was a new shift of hands and a new dance of ministers the chair of precedence was pulled from under the antiquated fikakaka who fell upon his back and his heels flying up discovered but too plainly the melancholy truth of his metamorphosis all his colleagues were discarded except those who thought proper to temporize and join in dancing the hay according as they were actuated by the new partners of the puppetshew this coalition was the greatest masterpiece in politics that ever yakstrot performed taycho the formidable taycho whom in his single person he dreaded more than all his other enemies of japan united was now become his coadjutor abettor and advocate and which was still of more consequence to strot that demagogue was forsaken of his good genius legion  the manyheaded monster would have swallowed down every other species of tergiversation in taycho except a coalition with the detested favorite and the title of quo by which he formally renounced its society but these were articles which the mongrel could not digest the tidings of this union threw the beast into a kind of stupor from which it was roused by blisters and cauteries applied by gottomio twitzer zantific with his understrapper toks now reinforced by fikakaka and his discarded associates for their common hatred to yakstrot like the rod of moses swallowed up every distinction of party and every suggestion of former animosity and they concurred with incredible zeal in rousing legion to a due sense of taychos apostasy the beast so stimulated howled three days and three nights successively at taychos gate then was seized with a convulsion that went off with an evacuation upwards and downwards so offensive that the very air was infected  the horrid sounds of the beasts lamentation the noxious effluvia of its filthy discharge joined to the poignant remorse which taycho felt at finding his power over legion dissolved occasioned a commotion in his brain and this led him into certain extravagancies which gave his enemies a handle to say he was actually insane his former friends and partisans thought the best apology they could make for the inconsistency of his conduct was to say he was non compos and this report was far from being disagreeable to yakstrot because it would at any time furnish him with a plausible pretense to dissolve the partnership at which he inwardly repined for it was necessity alone that drove him to a partition of his power with a man so incapable of acting in concert with any colleague whatsoever  in the mean time gottomio and his associates left no stone unturned to acquire the same influence over legion which taycho had so eminently possessed but the beasts faculties slender as they were seemed now greatly impaired in consequence of that arch empirics practices upon its constitution in vain did gottomio hoop and hollow in vain did twitzer tickle its long ears in vain did zantific apply sternutatories and his bonze administer inflammatory glysters the monster could never be brought to a right understanding or at all concur with their designs except in one instance which was its antipathy to the ximian favorite this had become so habitual that it acted mechanically upon its organs even after it had lost all other signs of recognition as often as the name of yakstrot was pronounced the beast began to yell and all the usual consequences ensued but whenever his new friends presumed to mount him he threw himself on his back and rolled them in the kennel at the hazard of their lives  one would imagine there was some leaven in the nature of yakstrot that soured all his subalterns who were natives of niphon for howsoever they promised all submission to his will before they were admitted into his motion they no sooner found themselves acting characters in his drama than they began to thwart him in his measures so that he was plagued by those he had taken in and persecuted by those he had driven out the two great props which he had been at so much pains to provide now failed him taycho was grown crazy and could no longer manage the monster and quambacundono the fatzman whose authority had kept several puppets in awe died about this period these two circumstances were the more alarming as gottomio and his crew began to gain ground not only in their endeavors to rouse the monster but also in tampering with some of the acting puppets to join their cabal and make head against their master these exoterics grew so refractory that when he tried to wheel them to the right they turned to the left about and instead of joining hands in the dance of politics rapped their heads against each other with such violence that the noise of the collision was heard in the street and if they had not been made of the hardest wood in japan some of them would certainly have been split in the encounter  by this time legionbegan to have some sense of its own miserable condition the effects of the yeast potions which it had drank so liberally from the hands of taycho now wore off the fumes dispersed the illusion vanished the flatulent tumor of its belly disappeared with innumerable explosions leaving a hideous lankness and such a canine appetite as all the eatables of japan could not satisfy after having devoured the whole harvest it yawned for more and grew quite outrageous in its hunger threatening to feed on human flesh if not plentifully supplied with other viands in this dilemma yakstrot convened the council of twentyeight where in consideration of the urgency of the case it was resolved to suspend the law against the importation of foreign provisions and open the ports of japan for the relief of the blatant beast  as this was vesting the dairo with a dispensing power unknown to the constitution of japan it was thought necessary at the next assembly of the quos and quanbukus that constitute the legislature to obtain a legal sanction for that extraordinary exercise of prerogative which nothing but the salus populi could excuse upon this occasion it was diverting to see with what effrontery individuals changed their principles with their places taycho the quo happening to be in one of his lucid intervals went to the assembly supported by his two creatures prafffog and another limb of the law called lleynah surnamed gurggrog or cursemother and this triumvirate who had raised themselves from nothing to the first rank in the state by vilifying and insulting the kingly power and affirming that the dairo was the slave of the people now had the impudence to declare in the face of day that in some cases the emperors power was absolute and that he had an inherent right to suspend and supersede the laws and ordinances of the legislature  muraclami who had been for some time eclipsed in his judicial capacity by the popularity of prafffog did not fail to seize this opportunity of exposing the character of his upstart rival though he had been all his life an humble retainer to the prerogative he now made a parade of patriotism and in a tide of eloquence bore down all the flimsy arguments which the triumvirate advanced he demonstrated the futility of their reasoning from the express laws and customs of the empire he expatiated on the pernicious tendency of their doctrine and exhibited the inconsistency of their conduct in such colors that they must have hid their heads in confusion had they not happily conquered all sense of shame and been well convinced that the majority of the assembly were not a whit more honest than themselves muraclami enjoyed a momentary triumph but his words made a very slight impression for it was his misfortune to be a ximian and if his virtues had been more numerous than the hairs in his beard this very circumstance would have shaved them clean away from the consideration of the audience  taycho opening the floodgates of his abuse bespattered all that opposed him lleynah alias cursemother swore that he had got into the wrongbox then turning to prafffog brother praff cried he thou have now let down thy trowsers and every rascal in japan will whip thy a  se praff was afraid of the beasts resentment but taycho bestrid him like a colossus and he crept through between his legs into a place of safety this was the last time that the orator appeared in public immediately after this occurrence it was found necessary to confine him to a dark chamber and yakstrot was left to his own inventions  in this dilemma he had recourse to the old expedient of changing hands and as a prelude to this reform made advances to gottomio whom he actually detached from the opposition by providing his friends and dependants with lucrative offices and promising to take no steps of consequence without his privity and approbation a sop was at the same time thrown to twitzer zantific lulled with specious promises discarded toks the incendiary bonze lobkob signed a neutrality and old fikakaka was deprived of the use of speech  in a word the illcemented confederacy of strots exoteric foes fell asunder and legion had now no rage but the rage of hunger to be appeased but the ximian favorite was still thwarted in his operations behind the curtain for he had so often chopped and changed the figures that composed his motion that they were all of different materials so wretchedly sorted and so illtoned that when they came upon the scene they produced nothing but discord and disorder  the japonese colony of fatsisio had been settled above a century and in the face of a thousand dangers and difficulties raised themselves to such consideration that they consumed infinite quantities of the manufactures of japan for which they paid their mother country in gold and silver and precious drugs the produce of their plantations the advantages which japan reaped from this traffic with her own colonists almost equalled the amount of what she gained by her commerce with all the other parts of asia twitzer when he managed the finances of japan had in his great wisdom planned procured and promulgated a law saddling the fatsisians with a grievous tax to answer the occasions of the japonese government an imposition which struck at the very vitals of their constitution by which they were exempt from all burdens but such as they fitted for their own shoulders they raised a mighty clamor at this innovation in which they were joined by legion at that time under the influence of taycho who in the assembly of the people bitterly inveighed against the authors and abettors of such an arbitrary and tyrannical measure their reproach and execreation did not stop at twitzer but proceeded as usual to yakstrot who was the general butt at which all the arrows of slander scurrility and abuse were levelled the puppets with which he supplied the places of twitzer and his associates in order to recommend themselves to legion and perhaps with a view to mortify the favorite who had patronized the fatsisian tax insisted upon withdrawing this imposition which was accordingly abrogated to the no small disgrace and contempt of the lawgivers but when these new ministers were turned out to make way for taycho and his friends the interest of the fatsisians was again abandoned even the orator himself declaimed against them with an unembarrassed countenance after they had raised statues to him as their friend and patron and measures were taken to make them feel all the severity of an abject dependence upon the legislature of japan finally gottomio acceded to this system which he had formerly approved in conjunction with twitzer and preparations were made for using compulsory measures should the colonists refuse to submit with a good grace  the fatsisians far from acquiescing in these proceedings resolved to defend to the last extremity those liberties which they had hitherto preserved and as a proof of their independence agreed among themselves to renounce all the superfluities with which they had so long been furnished at a vast expense from the manufactures of japan since that nation had begun to act toward them with all the cruelty of a stepmother it was amazing to see and to hear how legion raved and slabbered and snapped its multitudinous jaws in the streets of meaco when it understood that the fatsisians were determined to live on what their own country afforded they were represented and reviled as ruffians barbarians and unnatural monsters who clapped the dagger to the breast of their indulgent mother in presuming to save themselves the expense of those superfluities which by the bye her cruel impositions had left them no money to purchase nothing was heard in japan but threats of punishing those ungrateful colonists with whips and scorpions for this purpose troops were assembled and fleets equipped and the blatant beast yawned with impatient expectation of being drenched with the blood of its fellow subjects  yakstrot was seized with horror at the prospect of such extremities for to give the devil his due his disposition was neither arbitrary nor cruel but he had been hurried by evil counselors into a train of false politics the consequences of which he did not foresee he now summoned council after council to deliberate upon conciliatory expedients but found the motley crew so divided by selfinterest faction and mutual rancour that no consistent plan could be formed all was nonsense clamor and contradiction the ximian favorite now wished all his puppets at the devil and secretly cursed the hour in which he first undertook the motion he even fell sick of chagrin and resolved in good earnest to withdraw himself entirely from the political helm which he was now convinced he had no talents to guide in the mean time he tried to find some temporary alleviation to the evils occasioned by the monstrous incongruity of the members and materials that composed his administration but before any effectual measures could be taken his evil genius ever active brewed up a new storm in another quarter which had wellnigh swept him and all his projects into the gulf of perdition  finis
