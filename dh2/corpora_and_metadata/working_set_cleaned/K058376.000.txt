essays upon several projects or effectual ways for advancing the interest of the nation  wherein are plainly laid down the means by which the subjects in general may be eased and enriched the poor relieved and trade increased in the most material branches of it viz in constituting seamen to theirs and the nations advantage for encouragement of merchants and merchandising for relief of the poor of friendly societies for discouraging vice and encouraging virtue the usefulness of banks and assurances to prevent bankrupts with the surest way to recover bad debts and many other considerable things profitable and conducing to the great advantage of the nation in general  london printed for thomas ballard at the rising sun in little britain   0   preface to dalby thomas esquire one of the commissioners for managing his majestys duties on glass etc sir this preface comes directed to you not as commissioner etc under whom i have the honor to serve his majesty nor as a friend though i have great obligations of that sort also but as the most proper judge of the subjects treated of and more capable than the greatest part of mankind to distinguish and understand them  books are useful only to such whose genius are suitable to the subject of them and to dedicate a book of projects to a person who had never concerned himself to think that way would be like music to one that has no ear  and yet your having a capacity to judge of these things no way brings you under the despicable title of a projector any more than knowing the practices and subtleties of wicked men makes a man guilty of their crimes  the several chapters of this book are the results of particular thoughts occasioned by conversing with the public affairs during the present war with france the losses and casualties which attend all trading nations in the world when involved in so cruel a war as this have reached us all and i am none of the least sufferers if this has put me as well as others on inventions and projects so much the subject of this book it is no more than a proof of the reason i give for the general projecting humor of the nation  one unhappiness i lie under in the following book viz that having kept the greatest part of it by me for near five years several of the thoughts seem to be hit by other hands and some by the public which turns the tables upon me as if i had borrowed from them  as particularly that of the seamen which you know well i had contrived long before the act for registring seamen was proposed and that of educating women which i think my self bound to declare was formed long before the book called advice to the ladies was made public and yet i do not write this to magnify my own invention but to acquit my self from grafting on other peoples thoughts if i have trespassed upon any person in the world it is upon your self from whom i had some of the notions about county banks and factories for goods in the chapter of banks and yet i do not think that my proposal for the women or the seamen clashes at all either with that book on the public method of registring seamen  i have been told since this was done that my proposal for a commission of enquiries into bankrupt estates is borrowed from the dutch if there is any thing like it among the dutch it is more than ever i knew or know yet but if so i hope it is no objection against our having the same here especially if it be true that twoud be so publicly beneficial as is expressed  what is said of friendly societies i think no man will dispute with me since one has met with so much success already in the practice of it i mean the friendly society for widows of which you have been pleased to be a governor  friendly societies are very extensive and as i have hinted might be carried on to many particulars i have omitted one which was mentioned in discourse with your self where a hundred tradesmen all of several trades agree together to buy whatever they want of one another and no where else prices and payments to be settled among themselves whereby every man is sure to have ninety nine customers and can never want a trade and i could have filled up the book with instances of like nature but i never designed to tire the reader with particulars  the proposal of the pensionoffice you will soon see offered to the public as an attempt for the relief of the poor which if it meets with encouragement will every way answer all the great things i have said of it  i had wrote a great many sheets about the coin about bringing in plate to the mint and about our standard but so many great heads being upon it with some of whom my opinion does not agree i would not adventure to appear in print upon that subject  ways and means also i have laid by on the same score only adhering to this one point that be it by taxing the wares they sell be it by taxing them in stock be it by composition which by the way i believe is the best be it by what way soever the parliament please the retailers are the men who seem to call upon us to be taxed if not by their own extraordinary good circumstances though that might bear it yet by the contrary in all other degrees of the kingdom  besides the retailers are the only men who could pay it with least damage because it is in their power to levy it again upon their customers in the prices of their goods and is no more than paying a higher rent for their shops  the retailers of manufactures especially so far as relates to the inland trade have never been taxed yet and their wealth or number is not easily calculated trade and land has been handled roughly enough and these are the men who now lie as a reserve to carry on the burden of the war  these are the men who were the land tax collected as it should be ought to pay the king more than that whole bill ever produced and yet these are the men who i think i may venture to say do not pay a twentieth part in that bill  should the king appoint a survey over the assessors and indict all those who were found faulty allowing a reward to any discoverer of an assessment made lower than the literal sense of the act implies what a register of frauds and connivances would be found out  in a general tax if any should be excused it should be the poor who are not able to pay or at least are pinched in the necessary parts of life by paying and yet here a poor labourer who works for twelvepence or eighteenpence a day does not drink a pot of beer but pays the king a tenth part for excise and really pays more to the kings taxes in a year than a country shopkeeper who is alderman of the town worth perhaps two or three thousand pounds brews his own beer pays no excise and in the land tax is rated it may be  00 l and pays   l   s per annum but ought if the act were put in due execution to pay    l per ann to the king  if i were to be asked how i would remedy this i would answer it should be by some method in which every man may be taxed in the due proportion to his estate and the act put in execution according to the true intent and meaning of it in order to which a commission of assessment should be granted to twelve men such as his majesty should be well satisfied of who should go through the whole kingdom three in a body and should make a new assessment of personal estates not to meddle with land  to these assessors should all the old rates parishbooks poorrates and highwayrates also be delivered and upon due enquiry to be made into the manner of living and reputed wealth of the people the stock or personal estate of every man should be assessd without connivance and he who is reputed to be worth a thousand pound should be taxed at a thousand pound and so on and he who was an overgrown rich tradesman of twenty or thirty thousand pounds estate should be taxed so and plain english and plain dealing be practiced indifferently throughout the kingdom tradesmen and landed men should have neighbors fare as we call it and a rich man should not be passed by when a poor man pays  we read of the inhabitants of constantinople that they suffered their city to be lost for want of contributing in time for its defense and pleaded poverty to their generous emperor when he went from house to house to persuade them and yet when the turks took it the prodigious immense wealth they found in it made em wonder at the sordid temper of the citizens  england with due exceptions to the parliament and the freedom wherewith they have given to the public charge is much like constantinople we are involved in a dangerous a chargeable but withal a most just and necessary war and the richest and moneyed men in the kingdom plead poverty and the french or king james or the devil may come for them if they can but conceal their estates from the public notice and get the assessors to tax them at an underrate  these are the men this commission would discover and here they should find men taxed at  00 l stock who are worth  0000 l here they should find a certain rich man near hackney rated to day in the taxbook at  000 l stock and to morrow offering   000 l for an estate  here they should find sir j  c  perhaps taxed to the king at  000 l stock perhaps not so much whose cash no man can guess at and multitudes of instances i could give by name without wrong to the gentlemen  and not to run on in particulars i affirm that in the land tax ten certain gentlemen in london put together did not pay for half so much personal estate called stock as the poorest of them is reputed really to possess  i do not enquire at whose door this fraud must lie it is none of my business  i wish they would search into it whose power can punish it but this with submission i presume to say  the king is thereby defrauded and horribly abused the true intent and meaning of acts of parliament evaded the nation involved in debt by fatal deficiencies and interests fellow subjects abused and new inventions for taxes occasioned  the last chapter in this book is a proposal about entering all the seamen in england into the kings pay a subject which deserves to be enlarged into a book it self and i have a little volume of calculations and particulars by me on that head but i thought them too long to publish in short i am persuaded was that method proposed to those gentlemen to whom such things belong the greatest sum of money might be raised by it with the least injury to those who pay it that ever was or will be during the war  projectors they say are generally to be taken with allowance of one half at least they always have their mouths full of millions and talk big of their own proposals and therefore i have not exposed the vast sums my calculations amount to but i venture to say i could procure a farm on such a proposal as this at three millions per ann and give very good security for payment such an opinion i have of the value of such a method and when that is done the nation would get three more by paying it which is very strange but might easily be made out  in the chapter of academies i have ventured to reprove the vicious custom of swearing i shall make no apology for the fact for no man ought to be ashamed of exposing what all men ought to be ashamed of practicing but methinks i stand corrected by my own laws a little in forcing the reader to repeat some of the worst of our vulgar imprecations in reading my thoughts against it to which however i have this to reply  first i did not find it easy to express what i mean without putting down the very words at least not so as to be very intelligible  secondly why should words repeated only to expose the vice taint the reader more than a sermon preached against lewdness should the assembly for of necessity it leads the hearer to the thoughts of the fact but the morality of every action lies in the end and if the reader by ill use renders himself guilty of the fact in reading which i designed to expose by writing the fault is his not mine  i have endeavored every where in this book to be as concise as possible except where calculations obliged me to be particular and having avoided impertinence in the book i would avoid it too in the preface and therefore shall break off with subscribing my self  sir your most obliged humble servant d f  introduction necessity which is allowed to be the mother of invention has so violently agitated the wits of men at this time that it seems not at all improper by way of distinction to call it the projecting age for though in times of war and public confusions the like humor of invention has seemed to stir yet without being partial to the present it is i think no injury to say the past ages have never come up to the degree of projecting and inventing as it refers to matters of negoce and methods of civil polity which we see this age arrived to  nor is it a hard matter to assign probable causes of the perfection in this modern art i am not of their melancholy opinion who ascribe it to the general poverty of the nation since i believe it is easy to prove the nation it self taking it as one general stock is not at all diminished or impoverished by this long this chargeable war but on the contrary was never richer since it was inhabited  nor am i absolutely of the opinion that we are so happy as to be wiser in this age than our forefathers though at the same time i must own some parts of knowledge in science as well as art has received improvements in this age altogether concealed from the former  the art of war which i take to be the highest perfection of human knowledge is a sufficient proof of what i say especially in conducting armies and in offensive engines witness the new ways of mines fougades entrenchments attacks elodgments and a long et cetera of new inventions which want names practiced in sieges and encampments witness the new sorts of bombs and unheard of mortars of seven to ten ton weight with which our fleets standing two or three miles off at sea can imitate god almighty himself and rain fire and brimstone out of heaven as it were upon towns built on the firm land witness also our newinvented child of hell the machine which carries thunder lightning and earthquakes in its bowels and tears up the most impregnable fortifications  but if i would search for a cause from whence it comes to pass that this age swarms with such a multitude of projectors more than usual who besides the innumerable conceptions which dye in the bringing forth and like abortions of the brain only come into the air and dissolve do really every day produce new contrivances engines and projects to get money never before thought of if i say i would examine whence this comes to pass it must be thus  the losses and depredations which this war brought with it at first were exceeding many suffered chiefly by the ill conduct of merchants themselves who did not apprehend the danger to be really what it was for before our admiralty could possibly settle convoys cruisers and stations for men of war all over the world the french covered the sea with their privateers and took an incredible number of our ships i have heard the loss computed by those who pretended they were able to guess at above fifteen millions of pounds sterling in ships and goods in the first two or three years of the war a sum which if put into french would make such a rumbling sound of great numbers as would fright a weak accomptant out of his belief being no less than one hundred and ninety millions of livres the weight of this loss fell chiefly on the trading part of the nation and amongst them on the merchants and amongst them again upon the most refined capacities as the insurers etc and an incredible number of the best merchants in the kingdom sunk under the load as may appear a little by a bill which once passed the house of commons for the relief of merchantinsurers who had suffered by the war with france if a great many fell much greater were the number of those who felt a sensible ebb of their fortunes and with difficulty bore up under the loss of great part of their estates these prompted by necessity rack their wits for new contrivances new inventions new trades stocks projects and any thing to retrieve the desperate credit of their fortunes that this is probable to be the cause will appear further thus france though i do not believe all the great outcries we make of their misery and distress if one half of which be true they are certainly the best subjects in the world yet without question has felt its share of the losses and damages of the war but the poverty there falling chiefly on the poorer sort of people they have not been so fruitful in inventions and practices of this nature their genius being quite of another strain as for the gentry and more capable sort the first thing a french man flies to in his distress is the army and he seldom comes back from thence to get an estate by painful industry but either has his brains knocked out or makes his fortune there  if industry be in any business rewarded with success it is in the merchandising part of the world who indeed may more truly be said to live by their wits than any people whatsoever all foreign negoce though to some it is a plain road by the help of custom yet it is in its beginning all project contrivance and invention every new voyage the merchant contrives is a project and ships are sent from port to port as markets and merchandises differ by the help of strange and universal intelligence wherein some are so exquisite so swift and so exact that a merchant sitting at home in his counting house at once converses with all parts of the known world this and travel makes a truebred merchant the most intelligent man in the world and consequently the most capable when urged by necessity to contrive new ways to live and from hence i humbly conceive may very properly be derived the projects so much the subject of the present discourse and to this sort of men it is easy to trace the original of banks stocks stockjobbing assurances friendly societies lotteries and the like  to this may be added the long annual enquiry in the house of commons for ways and means which has been a particular movement to set all the heads of the nation at work and i appeal with submission to the gentlemen of that honorable house if the greatest part of all the ways and means out of the common road of landtaxes polls and the like have not been handed to them from the merchant and in a great measure paid by em too  however i offer this but as an essay at the original of this prevaling humor of the people and as it is probable so it is also possible to be otherwise which i submit to future demonstration  of the several ways this faculty of projecting have exerted it self and of the various methods as the genius of the authors has inclined i have been a diligent observer and in most an unconcerned spectator and perhaps have some advantage from thence more easily to discover the faux pas of the actors if i have given an essay toward any thing new or made discovery to advantage of any contrivance now on foot all men are at the liberty to make use of the improvement if any fraud is discovered as now practiced it is without any particular reflection upon parties or persons  projects of the nature i treat about are doubtless in general of public advantage as they tend to improvement of trade and employment of the poor and the circulation and increase of the public stock of the kingdom but this is supposed of such as are built on the honest basis of ingenuity and improvement in which though i will allow the author to aim primarily at his own advantage yet with the circumstances of public benefit added  wherefore it is necessary to distinguish among the projects of the present times between the honest and the dishonest  there are and that too many fair pretenses of fine discoveries new inventions engines and i know not what which being advanced in notion and talked up to great things to be performed when such and such sums of money shall be advanced and such and such engines are made have raised the fancies of credulous people to such height that merely on the shadow of expectation they have formed companies chose committees appointed officers shares and books raised great stocks and cried up an empty notion to that degree that people have been betrayed to part with their money for shares in a newnothing and when the inventors have carried on the jest till they have sold all their own interest they leave the cloud to vanish of it self and the poor purchasers to quarrel with one another and go to law about settlements transferrings and some bone or other thrown among em by the subtlety of the author to lay the blame of the miscarriage upon themselves thus the shares at first begin to fall by degrees and happy is he that sells in time till like brass money it will go at last for nothing at all so have i seen shares in jointstocks patents engines and undertakings blown up by the air of great words and the name of some man of credit concerned to  00 l for a  00 th part or share some more and at last dwindle away till it has been stockjobbd down to  0        l a share and at last no buyer that is in short the fine new word for nothingworth and many families ruined by the purchase if i should name linnenmanufactures saltpeterworks coppermines divingengines dipping and the like for instances of this i should i believe do no wrong to truth or to some persons too visibly guilty  i might go on upon this subject to expose the frauds and tricks of stockjobbers engineers patentees committees with those exchangemountebanks we very properly call brokers but i have not gaul enough for such a work but as a general rule of caution to those who would not be tricked out of their estates by such pretenders to new inventions let them observe that all such people who may be suspected of design have assuredly this in their proposal your money to the author must go before the experiment and here i could give a very diverting history of a patentmonger whose cully was no body but my self but i refer it to another occasion  but this is no reason why invention upon honest foundations and to fair purposes should not be encouraged no nor why the author of any such fair contrivances should not reap the harvest of his own ingenuity out acts of parliament for granting patents to first inventors for fourteen years is a sufficient acknowledgment of the due regard which ought to be had such as find out any thing which may be of public advantage new discoveries in trade in arts and mysteries of manufacturing goods or improvement of land are without question of as great benefit as any discoveries made in the works of nature by all the academies and royal societies in the world  there is it is true a great difference between new inventions and projects between improvement of manufactures or lands which tend to the immediate benefit of the public and employing of the poor and projects framed by subtle heads with a sort of a deceptio visus and legerdemain to bring people to run needless and unusual hazards i grant it and give a due preference to the first and yet success has so sanctified some of those other sorts of projects that twoud be a kind of blasphemy against fortune to disallow em witness sir william phipss voyage to the wreck twas a mere project a lottery of a hundred thousand to one odds a hazard which if it had failed every body would have been ashamed to have owned themselves concerned in a voyage that would have been as much ridiculed as don quixots adventure upon the windmill bless us that folks should go three thousand miles to angle in the open sea for pieces of eight why they would have made ballads of it and the merchants would have said of every unlikely adventure twas like phips his wreckvoyage but it had success and who reflects upon the project  nothings so partial as the laws of fate erecting blockheads to suppress the great sir francis drake the spanish platefleet won he had been a pyrate if he had got none sir walter rawleigh strove but missd the plate and therefore did a traitor to the state endeavor bears a value more or less just as it is recommended by success the lucky coxcomb every man will prize and prosperous actions always pass for wise however this sort of projects comes under no reflection as to their honesty save that there is a kind of honesty a man owes to himself and to his family that prohibits him throwing away his estate in impracticable improbable adventures but still some hit even of the most unlikely of which this was one of sir william phips who brought home a cargo of silver of near  00000 l sterling in pieces of eight fished up out of the open sea remote from any shore from an old spanish ship which had been sunk above forty years  the history of projects when i speak of writing a history of projects i do not mean either of the introduction of or continuing necessary inventions or the improvement of arts and sciences before known but a short account of projects and projecting as the word is allowed in the general acceptance at this present time and i need not go far back for the original of the practice  invention of arts with engines and handycraft instruments for their improvement requires a chronology as far back as the eldest son of adam and has to this day afforded some new discovery in every age  the building of the ark by noah so far as you will allow it a human work was the first project i read of and no question seemed so ridiculous to the graver heads of that wise though wicked age that poor noah was sufficiently banterd for it and had he not been set on work by a very peculiar direction from heaven the good old man would certainly have been laughed out of it as a most senseless ridiculous project  the building of babel was a right project for indeed the true definition of a project according to modern acceptance is as is said before a vast undertaking too big to be managed and therefore likely enough to come to nothing and yet as great as they are it is certainly true of em all even as the projectors propose that according to the old tale if so many eggs are hatched there will be so many chickens and those chickens may lay so many eggs more and those eggs produce so many chickens more and so on thus twas most certainly true that if the people of the old world could have built a house up to heaven they should never be drowned again on earth and they only had forgot to measure the height that is as in other projects it only miscarrid or else twoud have succeeded  and yet when all is done that very building and the incredible height it was carried is a demonstration of the vast knowledge of that infantage of the world who had no advantage of the experiments or invention of any before themselves  thus when our fathers touched with guilt that huge stupendous staircase built we mock indeed the fruitless enterprise for fruitless actions seldom pass for wise but were the mighty ruins left they would show to what degree that untaught age did know i believe a very diverting account might be given of this but i shall not attempt it some are apt to say with solomon no new thing happens under the sun but what is has been yet i make no question but some considerable discovery has been made in these latter ages and inventions of human original produced which the world was ever without before either in whole or in part and i refer only to two cardinal points the use of the lodestone at sea and the use of gunpowder and guns both which as to the inventingpart i believe the world owes as absolutely to those particular ages as it does the working in brass and iron to tubal cain or the inventing of music to jubal his brother as to engines and instruments for handycraftmen this age i dare say can show such as never were so much as thought of much less imitated before for i do not call that a real invention which has something before done like it i account that more properly an improvement for handycraft instruments i know none owes more to true genuine contrivance without borrowing from any former use than a mechanic engine contrived in our time called a knitting frame which built with admirable symetry works really with a very happy success and may be observed by the curious to have a more than ordinary composition for which i refer to the engine it self to be seen in every stockingweavers garret  i shall trace the original of the projecting humor that now reigns no farther back than the year    0 dating its birth as a monster then though by times it had indeed something of life in the time of the late civil war i allow no age has been altogether without something of this nature and some very happy projects are left to us as a taste of their success as the waterhouses for supplying of the city of london with water and since that the newriver both very considerable undertakings and perfect projects adventured on the risque of success in the reign of king charles the first infinite projects were set on foot for raising money without a parliament oppressing by monopolies and privy seals but these are excluded our scheme as irregularities for thus the french are as fruitful in projects as we and these are rather stratagems than projects after the fire of london the contrivance of an engine to quench fires was a project the author was said to get well by and we have found to be very useful but about the year    0 began the art and mystery of projecting to creep into the world prince rupert uncle to king charles the second gave great encouragement to that part of it that respects engines and mechanical motions and bishop wilkins added as much of the theory to it as writing a book could do the prince has left us a metal called by his name and the first project upon that was as i remember casting of guns of that metal and boring them done both by a peculiar method of his own and which died with him to the great loss of the undertaker who to that purpose had with no small charge erected a watermill at hackneymarsh known by the name of the templemill which mill very happily performed all parts of the work and i have seen of those guns on board the royal charles a firstrate ship being of a reddish color different either from brass or copper i have heard some reasons of state assigned why that project was not permitted to go forward but i omit them because i have no good authority for it after this we saw a floating machine to be wrought with horses for the towing of great ships both against wind and tide and another for the raising of ballast which as unperforming engines had the honor of being made exposed tried and laid by before the prince died  if thus we introduce it into the world under the conduct of that prince when he died twas left a hopeless brat and had hardly any hand to own it till the wreckvoyage beforenoted performed so happily by captain phips afterward sir william whose strange performance set a great many heads on work to contrive something for themselves he was immediately followed by my lord mordant sir john narborough and others from several parts whose success made em soon weary of the work  the project of the pennypost so well known and still practiced i cannot omit nor the contriver mr dockwra who has had the honor to have the injury done him in that affair repaired in some measure by the public justice of the parliament and the experiment proving it to be a noble and useful design the author must be remembered wherever mention is made of that affair to his very great reputation  twas no question a great hardship for a man to be master of so fine a thought that had both the essential ends of a project in it public good and private advantage and that the public should reap the benefit and the author be left out the injustice of which no doubt discouraged many a good design but since an alteration in public circumstances has recovered the lost attribute of justice the like is not to be feared and mr dockwra has had the satisfaction to see the former injury disowned and an honorable return made even by them who did not the injury in bare respect to his ingenuity  a while before this several people under the patronage of some great persons had engaged in planting of foreign collonies as william pen the lord shaftsbury dr cox and others in pensilvania carolina east and west jersey and the like places which i do not call projects because twas only prosecuting what had been formerly begun but here began the forming of public jointstocks which together with the east india african and hudsonsbay companies before established begot a new trade which we call by a new name stockjobbing which was at first only the simple occasional transferring of interest and shares from one to another as persons alienated their estates but by the industry of the exchangebrokers who got the business into their hands it became a trade and one perhaps managed with the greatest intriegue artifice and trick that ever any thing that appeared with a face of honesty could be handled with for while the brokers held the box they made the whole exchange the gamesters and raised and lowered the prices of stocks as they pleased and always had both buyers and sellers who stood ready innocently to commit their money to the mercy of their mercenary tongues this upstart of a trade having tasted the sweetness of success which generally attends a novel proposal introduces the illigitimate wandering object i speak of as a proper engine to find work for the brokers thus stockjobbing nursed projecting and projecting in return has very diligently pimpd for its fosterparent till both are arrived to be public grievances and indeed are now almost grown scandalous  of projectors man is the worst of all gods creatures to shift for himself no other animal is ever starved to death nature without has provided them both food and clothes and nature within has placed an instinct that never fails to direct them to proper means for a supply but man must either work or starve slave or dye he has indeed reason given him to direct him and few who follow the dictates of that reason come to such unhappy exigencies but when by the errors of a mans youth he has reduced himself to such a degree of distress as to be absolutely without three things money friends and health he dies in a ditch or in some worse place an hospital  ten thousand ways there are to bring a man to this and but very few to bring him out again  death is the universal deliverer and therefore some who want courage to bear what they see before em hang themselves for fear for certainly selfdestruction is the effect of cowardice in the highest extreme  others break the bounds of laws to satisfy that general law of nature and turn open thieves housebreakers highwaymen clippers coiners etc till they run the length of the gallows and get a deliverance the nearest way at st tyburn  others being masters of more cunning than their neighbors turn their thoughts to private methods of trick and cheat a modern way of thieveing every jot as criminal and in some degree worse than the other by which honest men are gulled with fair pretenses to part from their money and then left to take their course with the author who sculks behind the curtain of a protection or in the mint or friars and bids defiance as well to honesty as the law  others yet urged by the same necessity turn their thoughts to honest invention founded upon the platform of ingenuity and integrity  these two last sorts are those we call projectors and as there was always more geese than swans the number of the latter are very inconsiderable in comparison of the former and as the greater number denominates the less the just contempt we have of the former sort bespatters the other who like cuckolds bear the reproach of other peoples crimes  a mere projector then is a contemptible thing driven by his own desperate fortune to such a straight that he must be delivered by a miracle or starve and when he has beat his brains for some such miracle in vain he finds no remedy but to paint up some bauble or other as players make puppets talk big to show like a strange thing and then cry it up for a new invention gets a patent for it divides it into shares and they must be sold ways and means are not wanting to swell the new whim to a vast magnitude thousands and hundreds of thousands are the least of his discourse and sometimes millions till the ambition of some honest coxcomb is wheedld to part with his money for it and then  nascitur ridiculus mus the adventurer is left to carry on the project and the projector laughs at him the diver shall walk at the bottom of the thames the saltpetermaker shall build tom t  ds pond into houses the engineers build models and windmills to draw water till funds are raised to carry it on by men who have more money than brains and then good night patent and invention the projector has done his business and is gone  but the honest projector is he who having by fair and plain principles of sense honesty and ingenuity brought any contrivance to a suitable perfection makes out what he pretends to picks no bodys pocket puts his project in execution and contents himself with the real produce as the profit of his invention  of banks banks without question if rightly managed are or may be of great advantage especially to a trading people as the english are and among many others this is one particular case in which that benefit appears that they bring down the interest of money and take from the goldsmiths scriveners and others who have command of running cash their most delicious trade of making advantage of the necessities of the merchant in extravagant discounts and premios for advance of money when either large customs or foreign remittances call for disbursements beyond his common ability for by the easiness of terms on which the merchant may have money he is encouraged to venture further in trade than otherwise he would do not but that there are other great advantages a royal bank might procure in this kingdom as has been seen in part by this as advancing money to the exchequer upon parliamentary funds and securities by which in time of a war our preparations for any expedition need not be in danger of miscarriage for want of money though the taxes raised be not speedily paid nor the exchequer burdened with the excessive interests paid in former reigns upon anticipations of the revenue landed men might be supplied with moneys upon securities on easier terms which would prevent the loss of multitudes of estates now ruined and devoured by insolent and merciless mortgagees and the like but now we unhappily see a royal bank established by act of parliament and another with a large fund upon the orphans stock and yet these advantages or others which we expected not answered though the pretensions in both have not been wanting at such time as they found it needful to introduce themselves into public esteem by giving out prints of what they were rather able to do than really intended to practice so that our having two banks at this time settled and more erecting has not yet been able to reduce the interest of money not because the nature and foundation of their constitution does not tend toward it but because finding their hands full of better business they are wiser than by being slaves to old obselete proposals to lose the advantage of the great improvement they can make of their stock  this however does not at all reflect on the nature of a bank nor of the benefit it would be to the public tradingpart of the kingdom whatever it may seem to do on the practice of the present we find four or five banks now in view to be settled i confess i expect no more from those to come than we have found from the past and i think i make no breach on either my charity or good manners in saying so and i reflect not upon any of the banks that are or shall be established for not doing what i mention but for making such publications of what they would do i cannot think any man had expected the royal bank should lend money on mortgages at   per cent nor was it much the better for them to make publication they would do so from the beginning of january next after their settlement since to this day as i am informed they have not lent one farthing in that manner  our banks are indeed nothing but so many goldsmiths shops where the credit being high and the directors as high people lodge their money and they the directors i mean make their advantage of it if you lay it at demand they allow you nothing if at time   per cent and so would any goldsmith in lombardstreet have done before but the very banks themselves are so awkward in lending so strict so tedions so inquisitive and withal so public in their taking securities that men who are any thing tender will not go to them and so the easiness of borrowing money so much designed is defeated for here is a private interest to be made though it be a public one and in short it is only a great trade carried on for the private gain of a few concerned in the original stock and though we are to hope for great things because they have promised them yet they are all future that we know of  and yet all this while a bank might be very beneficial to this kingdom and this might be so if either their own ingenuity or public authority would oblige them to take the public good into equal concern with their private interest  to explain what i mean  banks being established by public authority ought also as all public things are to be under limitations and restrictions from that authority and those limitations being regulated with a proper regard to the ease of trade in general and the improvement of the stock in particular would make a bank a useful profitable thing indeed  first a bank ought to be of a magnitude proportioned to the trade of the country it is in which this bank is so far from that it is no more to the whole than the least goldsmiths cash in lombardstreet is to the bank from whence it comes to pass that already more banks are contriving and i question not but banks in london will ere long be as frequent as lotteries the consequence of which in all probability will be the diminishing their reputation or a civil war with one another it is true the bank of england has a capital stock but yet was that stock wholly clear of the public concern of the government it is not above a fifth part of what would be necessary to manage the whole business of the town which it ought though not to do at least to be able to do and i suppose i may venture to say above one half of the stock of the present bank is taken up in the affairs of the exchequer  i suppose no body will take this discourse for an invective against the bank of england i believe it is a very good fund a very useful one and a very profitable one it has been useful to the government and it is profitable to the proprietors and the establishing it at such a juncture when our enemies were making great boasts of our poverty and want of money was a particular glory to our nation and the city in particular that when the paris gazette informed the world that the parliament had indeed given the king grants for raising money in funds to be paid in remote years but money was so scarce that no anticipations could be procured that just then besides three millions paid into the exchequer that spring on other taxes by way of advance there was an overplusstock to be found of   00 000 pounds sterling or to make it speak french of above fifteen millions which was all paid voluntarily into the exchequer in less than  besides this i believe the present bank of england has been very useful to the exchequer and to supply the king with remittances for the payment of the army in flanders which has also by the way been very profitable to it self but still this bank is not of that bulk that the business done here requires nor is it able with all the stock it has to procure the great proposed benefit the lowering the interest of money whereas all foreign banks absolutely govern the interest both at amsterdam genoa and other places and this defect i conceive the multiplicity of banks cannot supply unless a perfect understanding could be secured between them  to remedy this defect several methods might be proposed some i shall take the freedom to hint at  first that the present bank increase their stock to at least five millions sterling to be settled as they are already with some small limitations to make the methods more beneficial  five millions sterling is an immense sum to which add the credit of their cash which would supply them with all the overplusmoney in the town and probably might amount to half as much more and then the credit of runningbills which by circulating would no question be an equivalent to the other half so that in stock credit and bankbills the balance of their cash would be always ten millions sterling a sum that every body who can talk of does not understand  but then to find business for all this stock which though it be a strange thing to think of is nevertheless easy when it comes to be examined and first for the business this bank should enlarge the number of their directors as they do of their stock and should then establish several subcommittees composed of their own members who should have the directing of several offices relating to the distinct sorts of business they referred to to be overruled and governed by the governor and directors in a body but to have a conclusive power as to contracts of these there should be  one office for loan of money for customs of goods which by a plain method might be so ordered that the merchant might with ease pay the highest customs down and so by allowing the bank   per cent advance be first sure to secure the  0 l per cent which the king allows for prompt payment at the customhouse and be also freed from the troublesome work of finding bondsmen and securities for the money which has exposed many a man to the tyranny of extents either for himself or his friend to his utter ruin who under a more moderate prosecution had been able to pay all his debts and by this method has been torn to pieces and disabled from making any tolerable proposal to his creditors this is a scene of large business and would in proportion employ a large cash and it is the easiest thing in the world to make the bank the paymaster of all the large customs and yet the merchant have so honorable a possession of his goods as may be neither any diminution to his reputation or any hindrance to their sale  as for example  suppose i have  00 hogsheads of tobacco to import whose customs by several duties comes to  000 l and want cash to clear them i go with my bill of loading to the bank who appoint their officer to enter the goods and pay the duties which goods so entered by the bank shall give them title enough to any part or the whole without the trouble of bills of sale or conveyances defeazances and the like the goods are carried to a warehouse at the waterside where the merchant has a free and public access to them as if in his own warehouse and an honorable liberty to sell and deliver either the whole paying their disburse or a part without it leaving but sufficient for the payment and out of that part delivered either by notes under the hand of the purchaser or any other way he may clear the same without any exactions but of   l per cent and the rest are his own  the ease this would bring to trade the deliverance it would bring to the merchants from the insults of goldsmiths etc and the honor it would give to our management of public imposts with the advantages to the customhouse it self and the utter destruction of extortion would be such as would give a due value to the bank and make all mankind acknowledge it to be a public good the grievance of exactions upon merchants in this case is very great and when i lay the blame on the goldsmiths because they are the principal people made use of in such occasions i include a great many other sorts of brokers and moneyjobbing artists who all get a snip out of the merchant i my self have known a goldsmith in lumbardstreet lend a man  00 l to pay the customs of a hundred pipes of spanish wines the wines were made over to him for security by bill of sale and put into a cellar of which the goldsmith kept the key the merchant was to pay   l per cent interest on the bond and to allow  0 l per cent premio for advancing the money when he had the wines in possession the owner could not send his cooper to look after them but the goldsmiths man must attend all the while for which he would be paid   s a day if he brought a customer to see them the goldsmiths man must show them the money was lent for two months he could not be admitted to sell or deliver a pipe of wine out single or two or three at a time as he might have sold them but on a word or two spoken amiss to the goldsmith or which he was pleased to take so he would have none sold but the whole parcel together by this usage the goods lay on hand and every month the money remained the goldsmith demanded a guinea per cent forbearance besides the interest till at last by leakage decay and other accidents the wines began to lessen then the goldsmith begins to tell the merchant he is afraid the wines are not worth the money he has lent and demands further security and in a little while growing higher and rougher he tells him he must have his money the merchant too much at his mercy because he cannot provide the money is forced to consent to the sale and the goods being reduced to seventy pipes sound wine and four unsound the rest being sunk for filling up were sold for    l per pipe the sound and   l the unsound which amounted to     l together l s d the coopers bill came to  0 0 0 the cellerage a year and half to    0 0 interests on the bond to    0 0 the goldsmiths men for attendance 0  0 0 allowance for advance of the money and forbearance    0 0     0 0 principal money borrowed  00 0 0     0 0 due to the merchant    0 0     0 0  by the modetatest computation that can be these wines cost the merchant as follows first cost with charges on board l s d in lisbon    mill reis per pipe is   00 mill re exchange at   s   d per mill rei     0 0 freight to london  then at   l per ton   0 0 0 assurance on  00 l at   per c  0 0 0 petty charges 0  0 0   0 0 0  so that it is manifest by the extortion of this banker the poor man lost the whole capital with freight and charges and made but    l produce of a hundred pipes of wine  one other office of this bank and which would take up a considerable branch of the stock is for lending money upon pledges which should have annexed to it a warehouse and factory where all sorts of goods might publicly be sold by the consent of the owners to the great advantage of the owner the bank receiving   l per cent interest and   per cent commission for sale of the goods  a third office should be appointed for discounting bills tallies and notes by which all tallies of the exchequer and any part of the revenue should at stated allowances be ready money to any person to the great advantage of the government and ease of all such as are any ways concerned in public undertakings  a fourth office for lending money upon landsecurities at   per cent interest by which the cruelty and injustice of mortgagees would be wholly restrained and a register of mortgages might be very well kept to prevent frauds  a fifth office for exchanges and foreign correspondences  a sixth for inland exchanges where a very large field of business lies before them  under this head twill not be improper to consider that this method will most effectually answer all the notions and proposals of countybanks for by this office they would be all rendered useless and unprofitable since one bank of the magnitude i mention with a branch of its office set apart for that business might with ease manage all the inlandexchange of the kingdom  by which such a correspondence with all the tradingtowns in england might be maintained as that the whole kingdom should trade with the bank under the direction of this office a public cashier should be appointed in every county to reside in the capital town as to trade and in some counties more through whose hands all the cash of the revenue of the gentry and of trade should be returned on the bank in london and from the bank again on their cashier in every respective county or town at the small exchange of per cent by which means all loss of money carried upon the road to the encouragement of robbers and ruining of the country who are sud for those robberies would be more effectually prevented than by all the statutes against highwaymen that are or can be made  as to public advancings of money to the government they may be left to the directors in a body as all other disputes and contingent cases are and whoever examines these heads of business apart and has any judgment in the particulars will i suppose allow that a stock of ten millions may find employment in them though it be indeed a very great sum  i could offer some very good reasons why this way of management by particular offices for every particular sort of business is not only the easiest but the safest way of executing an affair of such variety and consequence also i could state a method for the proceedings of those private offices their conjunction with and dependence on the general court of the directors and how the various accounts should center in one general capital account of stock with regulations and appeals but i believe them to be needless at least in this place  if it be objected here that it is impossible for one joint stock to go thorough the whole business of the kingdom i answer i believe it is not either impossible or impracticable particularly on this one account that almost all the country business would be managed by runningbills and those the longest abroad of any their distance keeping them out to the increasing the credit and consequently the stock of the bank  of the multiplicity of banks what is touched at in the foregoing part of this chapter refers to one bankroyal to preside as it were over the whole cash of the kingdom but because some people do suppose this work fitter for many banks than for one i must a little consider that head and first allowing those many banks could without clashing maintain a constant correspondence with one another in passing each others bills as current from one to another i know not but it might be better performed by many than by one for as harmony makes music in sound so it produces success in business  a civil war among merchants is always the ruin of trade i cannot think a multitude of banks could so consist with one another in england as to join interests and uphold one anothers credit without joining stocks too i confess if it could be done the convenience to trade would be visible  if i were to propose which way these banks should be established i answer allowing a due regard to some gentlemen who have had thoughts of the same whose methods i shall not so much as touch upon much less discover my thoughts run upon quite different methods both for the fund and the establishment  every principal town in england is a corporation upon which the fund may be settled which will sufficiently answer the difficult and chargeable work of suing for a corporation by patent or act of parliament  a general subscription of stock being made and by deeds of settlement placed in the mayor and aldermen of the city or corporation for the time being in trust to be declared by deeds of uses some of the directors being always made members of the said corporation and joined in the trust the bank hereby becomes the public stock of the town something like what they call the rents of the townhouse in france and is managed in the name of the said corporation to whom the directors are accountable and they back again to the general court  for example  suppose the gentlemen or tradesmen of the county of norfolk by a subscription of cash design to establish a bank the subscriptions being made the stock is paid into the chamber of the city of norwich and managed by a court of directors as all banks are and chosen out of the subscribers the mayor only of the city to be always one to be managed in the name of the corporation of the city of norwich but for the uses in a deed of trust to be made by the subscribers and mayor and aldermen at large mentioned i make no question but a bank thus settled would have as firm a foundation as any bank need to have and every way answer the ends of a corporation  of these sorts of banks england might very well establish fifteen at the several towns hereafter mentioned some of which tho they are not the capital towns of the counties yet are more the center of trade which in england runs in veins like mines of metal in the earth canterbury salisbury exeter bristol worcester shrewsbury manchester newcastle upon tyne leeds or halifax or york nottingham warwick or birmingham oxford or reading bedford norwich colchester   every one of these banks to have a cashier in london unless they could all have a general correspondence and credit with the bankroyal  these banks in their respective counties should be a general staple and factory for the manufactures of the said county where every man that had goods made might have money at a small interest for advance the goods in the mean time being sent forward to market to a warehouse for that purpose erected in london where they should be disposed of to all the advantages the owner could expect paying only   per cent commission or if the maker wanted credit in london either for spanish wool cotton oil or any goods while his goods were in the warehouse of the said bank his bill should be paid by the bank to the full value of his goods or at least within a small matter these banks either by correspondence with each other or an order to their cashier in london might with ease so pass each others bills that a man who has cash at plymouth and wants money at berwick may transfer his cash at plymouth to newcastle in half an hours time without either hazard or charge or time allowing only per cent exchange and so of all the most distant parts of the kingdom or if he wants money at newcastle and has goods at worcester or at any other cloathingtown sending his goods to be sold by the factory of the bank of worcester he may remit by the bank to newcastle or any where else as readily as if his goods were sold and paid for and no exactions made upon him for the convenience he enjoys  this discourse of banks the reader is to understand to have no relation to the present posture of affairs with respect to the scarcity of current money which seems to have put a stop to that part of a stock we call credit which always is and indeed must be the most essential part of a bank and without which no bank can pretend to subsist at least to advantage  a bank is only a great stock of money put together to be employed by some of the subscribers in the name of the rest for the benefit of the whole this stock of money subsists not barely on the profits of its own stock for that would be inconsiderable but upon the contingences and accidents which multiplicity of business occasions as for instance a man that comes for money and knows he may have it tomorrow perhaps he is in haste and will not take it to day only that he may be sure of it to morrow he takes a memorandum under the hand of the officer that he shall have it whenever he calls for it and this memorandum we call a bill to morrow when he intended to fetch his money comes a man to him for money and to save himself the labor of telling he gives him the memorandum or bill aforesaid for his money this second man does as the first and a third does as he did and so the bill runs about a month two or three and this is that we call credit for by the circulation of a quantity of these bills the bank enjoys the full benefit of as much stock in real value as the supposititious value of the bills amounts to and wherever this credit fails this advantage fails for immediately all men come for their money and the bank must die of it self for i am sure no bank by the simple improvement of their single stock can ever make any considerable advantage  i confess a bank who can lay a fund for the security of their bills which shall produce first an annual profit to the owner and yet make good the passantbill may stand and be advantageous too because there is a real and a supposititious value both and the real always ready to make good the supposititious and this i know no way to bring to pass but by land which at the same time that it lies transferred to secure the value of every bill given out brings in a separate profit to the owner and this way no question but the whole kingdom might be a bank to it self though no ready money were to be found in it  i had gone on in some sheets with my notion of land being the best bottom for public banks and the easiness of bringing it to answer all the ends of money deposited with double advantage but i find my self happily prevented by a gentleman who has published the very same though since this was wrote and i was always master of so much wit as to hold my tongue while they spoke who understood the thing better than my self  mr john asgill of lincolns inn in a small tract entitled several assertions proved in order to create another species of money than gold and silver has so distinctly handled this very case with such strength of argument such clearness of reason such a judgment and such a style as all the ingenious part of the world must acknowledge themselves extremely obliged to him for that piece  at the sight of which book i laid by all that had been written by me on that subject for i had much rather confess my self incapable of handling that point like him than have convinced the world of it by my impertinence  of the highways it is a prodigious charge the whole nation groans under for the repair of highways which after all lie in a very ill posture too i make no question but if it was taken into consideration by those who have the power to direct it the kingdom might be wholly eased of that burden and the highways be kept in good condition which now lie in a most shameful manner in most parts of the kingdom and in many places wholly unpassable from whence arise tolls and impositions upon passengers and travelers and on the other hand trespasses and encroachments upon lands adjacent to the great damage of the owners  the rate for the highways is the most arbitrary and unequal tax in the kingdom in some places two or three rates of   d per l in the year in others the whole parish cannot raise wherewith to defray the charge either by the very bad condition of the road or distance of materials in others the surveyors raise what they never expend and the abuses exactions connivances frauds and embezlements are innumerable  the romans while they governed this island made it one of their principal cares to make and repair the highways of the kingdom and the chief roads we now use are of their marking out the consequence of maintaining them was such or at least so esteemed that they thought it not below them to employ their legionary troops in the work and it was sometimes the business of whole armies either when in winter quarters or in the intervals of truce or peace with the natives nor have the romans left us any greater tokens of their grandeur and magnificence than the ruins of those causways and streetways which are at this day to be seen in many parts of the kingdom some of which has by the visible remains been discovered to traverse the whole kingdom and others for more than an hundred miles are to be traced from colony to colony as they had particular occasion the famous highway or street called watlingstreet which some will tell you began at londonstone and passing that very street in the city which we to this day call by that name went on west to that spot where tyburn now stands and then turned northwest in so straight a line to st albans that it is now the exactest road in one line for twenty miles in the kingdom and though disused now as the chief yet is as good and i believe the best road to st albans and is still called the streetway from whence it is traced into shropshire above an hundred and sixty miles with a multitude of visible antiquities upon it discovered and described very acurately by mr cambden the fosse another roman work lies at this day as visible and as plain a high causway of above thirty foot broad ditchd on either side and copd and paved where need is as exact and every jot as beautiful as the kings new road through hidepark in which figure it now lies from near marshfield to cirencester and again from cirencester to the hill three miles on this side gloucester which is not less than twenty six miles and is made use of as the great road to those towns and probably has been so for a thousand years with little repairs  if we set aside the barbarity and customs of the romans as heathens and take them as a civil government we must allow they were the pattern of the whole world for improvement and increase of arts and learning civilizing and methodizing nations and countries conquered by their valor and if this was one of their great cares that consideration ought to move something but to the great example of that generous people i will add three arguments   it is useful and that as it is convenient for carriages which in a trading country is a great help to negoce and promotes universal correspondence without which our inland trade could not be managed and under this head i could name a thousand conveniences of a safe pleasant wellrepaird highway both to the inhabitant and the traveller but i think it is needless   it is easy i question not to make it appear it is easy to put all the high roads especially in england in a noble figure large dry and clean well dreind and free from floods unpassable sloughs deep cartrouts high ridges and all the inconveniences they now are full of and when once done much easier still to be maintained so   it may be cheaper and the whole assesment for the repairs of highways for ever be dropped or applied to other uses for the public benefit   here i beg the readers favor for a small digression  i am not proposing this as an undertaker or setting a price to the public for which i will perform it like one of the projectors i speak of but laying open a project for the performance which whenever the public affairs will admit our governors to consider of will be found so feasible that no question they may find undertakers enough for the performance and in this undertakingage i do not doubt but twoud be easy at any time to procure persons at their own charge to perform it for any single county as a pattern and experiment for the whole kingdom  the proposal is as follows  first that an act of parliament be made with liberty for the undertakers to dig and trench to cut down hedges and trees or whatever is needful for ditching dreining and carrying off water cleaning enlarging and levelling the roads with power to lay open or enclose lands to incroach into lands dig raise and level fences plant and pull up hedges or trees for the enlarging widening and dreining the highways with power to turn either the roads or watercourse rivers and brooks as by the directors of the works shall be found needful always allowing satisfaction to be first made to the owners of such lands either by assigning to them equivalent lands or payment in money the value to be adjusted by two indifferent persons to be named by the lord chancellor or lord keeper for the time being and no watercourse to be turned from any watermill without satisfaction first made both to the landlord and tenant  but before i proceed i must say a word or two to this article  the chief and almost the only cause of the deepness and foulness of the roads is occasioned by the standing water which for want of due care to draw it off by scouring and opening ditches and dreins and other watercourse and clearing of passages soaks into the earth and softens it to such a degree that it cannot bear the weight of horses and carriages to prevent which the power to dig trench and cut down etc mentioned above will be of absolute necessity but because the liberty seems very large and some may think it is too great a power to be granted to any body of men over their neighbors it is answered   it is absolutely necessary or the work cannot be done and the doing of the work is of much greater benefit than the damage can amount to   satisfaction to be made to the owner and that first too before the damage be done is an unquestionable equivalent and both together i think are a very full answer to any objection in that case   besides this act of parliament a commission must be granted to fifteen at least in the name of the undertakers to whom every county shall have power to join ten who are to sit with the said fifteen so often and so long as the said fifteen do sit for affairs relating to that county which fifteen or any seven of them shall be directors of the works to be advised by the said ten or any five of them in matters of right and claim and the said ten to adjust differences in the countries and to have right by process to appeal in the name either of lords of manors or privileges of towns or corporations who shall be either damaged or encroachd upon by the said work all appeals to be heard and determined immediately by the said lord chancellor or commission from him that the work may receive no interruption  this commission shall give power to the said fifteen to press wagons carts and horses oxen and men and detain them to work a certain limited time and within certain limited space of miles from their own dwellings and at a certain rate of payment no men horses or carts to be pressed against their consent during the times of haytime or harvest or upon marketdays if the person aggrieved will make affidavit he is obliged to be with his horses or carts at the said markets  it is well known to all who have any knowledge of the condition the highways in england now lie in that in most places there is a convenient distance of land left open for traveling either for driving of cattle or marching of troops of horse with perhaps as few lanes or defiles as in any countries the crossroads which are generally narrow are yet broad enough in most places for two carriages to pass but on the other hand we have on most of the highroads a great deal of wasteland thrown in as it were for an overplus to the highway which though it be used of course by cattle and travelers on occasion is indeed no benefit at all either to the traveller as a road or to the poor as a common or to the lord of the manor as a waste upon it grows neither timber nor grass in any quantity answerable to the land but tho to no purpose is trodden down poachd and overrun by drifts of cattle in the winter or spoiled with the dust in the summer and this i have observed in many parts of england to be as good land as any of the neighboring enclosures as capable of improvement and to as good purpose  these lands only being enclosed and manured leaving the roads to dimensions without measure sufficient are the fund upon which i build the prodigious stock of money that must do this work these lands which i shall afterward make an essay to value being enclosed will be either saleable to raise money or fit to exchange with those gentlemen who must part with some land where the ways are narrow always reserving a quantity of these lands to be let out to tenants the rent to be paid into the public stock or bank of the undertakers and to be reserved for keeping the ways in the same repair and the said bank to forfeit the lands if they are not so maintained  another branch of the stock must be hands for a stock of men is a stock of money to which purpose every county city town and parish shall be rated at a set price equivalent to eight years payment for the repair of highways which each county etc shall raise not by assessment in money but by pressing of men horses and carriages for the work the men horses etc to be employed by the directors in which case all corporal punishments as of whippings stocks pillories houses of correction etc might be easily transmitted to a certain number of days works on the highways and in consideration of this provision of men the country should for ever after be acquitted of any contribution either in money or work for repair of the highways building of bridges excepted  there lies some popular objection against this undertaking and the first is the great controverted point of england enclosure of the common which tends to depopulation and injures the poor    who shall be judges or surveyors of the work to oblige the undertakers to perform to a certain limited degree  for the first the enclosure of the common a clause that runs as far as to an incroachment upon magna charta and a most considerable branch of the property of the poor i answer it thus   the lands we enclose are not such as from which the poor do indeed reap any benefit or at least any that is considerable   the bank and public stock who are to manage this great undertaking will have so many little labors to perform and offices to bestow that are fit only for laboring poor persons to do as will put them in a condition to provide for the poor who are so injured that can work and to those who cannot may allow pensions for overseeing supervising and the like which will be more than equivalent   for depopulations the contrary should be secured by obliging the undertakers at such and such certain distances to erect cottages two at least in a place which would be useful to the work and safety of the traveller to which should be an allotment of land always sufficient to invite the poor inhabitant in which the poor should be tenant for life gratis doing duty upon the highway as should be appointed by which and many other methods the poor should be great gainers by the proposal instead of being injured   by this erecting of cottages at proper distances a man might travel over all england as through a street where he could never want either rescue from thieves or directions for his way   this very undertaking once duly settled might in a few years so order it that there should be no poor for the common and if so what need of a common for the poor of which in its proper place   as to the second objection who should oblige the undertakers to the performance   i answer their commission and charter should become void and all their stock forfeit and the lands enclosed and unsold remain as a pledge which would be security sufficient   the ten persons chosen out of every county should have power to inspect and complain and the lord chancellor upon such complaint to make a survey and to determine by a jury in which case on default they shall be obliged to proceed   the lands settled on the bank shall be liable to be extended for the uses mentioned if the same at any time be not maintained in the condition at first provided and the bank to be amercd upon complaint of the country   these and other conditions which on a legal settlement to be made by wiser heads than mine might be thought on i do believe would form a constitution so firm so fair and so equally advantageous to the country to the poor and to the public as has not been put in practice in these latter ages of the world to discourse of this a little in general and to instance in a place perhaps that has not its fellow in the kingdom the parish of islington in middlesex there lies through this large parish the greatest road in england and the most frequented especially by cattle for smithfieldmarket this great road has so many branches and lies for so long a way through the parish and withal has the inconvenience of a clayey ground and no gravel at hand that modestly speaking the parish is not able to keep it in repair by which means several crossroads in the parish lie wholly unpassable and carts and horses and men too have been almost buried in holes and sloughs and the main road it self has for many years lain in a very ordinary condition which occasioned several motions in parliament to raise a toll at highgate for the performance of what it was impossible the parish should do and yet was of so absolute necessity to be done and is it not very probable the parish of islington would part with all the waste land upon their roads to be eased of the intolerable assessment for repair of the highway and answer the poor who reap but a small benefit from it some other way and yet i am free to affirm that for a grant of waste and almost useless land lying open to the highway those lands to be improved as they might easily be together with the eight years assessment to be provided in workmen a noble magnificent causeway might be erected with ditches on either side deep enough to receive the water and dreins sufficient to carry it off which causway should be four foot high at least and from thirty to forty foot broad to reach from london to barnet paved in the middle to keep it copd and so supplied with gravel and other proper materials as should secure it from decay with small repairing  i hope no man would be so weak now as to imagine that by lands lying open to the road to be assigned to the undertakers i should mean that all finchlycommon should be enclosed and sold for this work but least somebody should start such a preposterous objection i think it is not improper to mention that wherever a highway is to be carried over a large common forest or waste without a hedge on either hand for a certain distance there the several parishes shall allot the directors a certain quantity of the common to lie parallel with the road at a proportioned number of feet to the length and breadth of the said road consideration also to be had to the nature of the ground or else giving them only room for the road directly shall suffer them to enclose in any one spot so much of the said common as shall be equivalent to the like quantity of land lying by the road thus where the land is good and the materials for erecting a causway near the less land may serve and on the contrary the more but in general allowing them the quantity of land proportioned to the length of the causway and forty rod in breadth though where the land is poor as on downs and plains the proportion must be considered to be adjusted by the country  another point for the dimensions of roads should be adjusted and the breadth of them i think cannot be less than thus  from london every way  0 miles the high postroad to be built full  0 foot in breadth and   foot high the ditches   foot broad and   foot deep and from thence onward  0 foot and so in proportion  cross roads to be  0 foot broad and ditches proportioned no lanes and passes less than   foot without ditches  the middle of the high causeways to be paved with stone chalk or gravel and kept always two foot higher than the sides that the water might have a free course into the ditches and persons kept in constant employ to fill up holes let out water open dreins and the like as there should be occasion a proper work for highwaymen and such malefactors as might on those services be exemptd from the gallows  it may here be objected that eight years assessment to be demanded down is too much in reason to expect any of the poorer sort can pay as for instance if a farmer who keeps a team of horse be at the common assessment to work a week it must not be put so hard upon any man as to work eight weeks together it is easy to answer this objection  so many as ate wanted must be had if a farmers team cannot be spared without prejudice to him so long together he may spare it at sundry times or agree to be assessd and pay the assessment at sundry payments and the bank may make it as easy to them as they please  another method however might be found to fix this work at once as suppose a bank be settled for the highways of the county of middlesex which as they are without doubt the most used of any in the kingdom so also they require the more charge and in some parts lie in the worst condition of any in the kingdom  if the parliament fix the charge of the survey of the highways upon a bank to be appointed for that purpose for a certain term of years the bank undertaking to do the work or to forfeit the said settlement  as thus  suppose the tax on land and tenements for the whole county of middlesex does or should be so ordered as it might amount to  0000 l per ann more or less which it now does and much more including the work of the farmers teams which must be accounted as money and is equivalent to it with some allowance to be rated for the city of london etc who do enjoy the benefit and make the most use of the said roads both for carrying of goods and bringing provisions to the city and therefore in reason ought to contribute toward the highways for it is a most unequal thing that the road from highgate to smithfieldmarket by which the whole city is in a manner supplied with live cattle and the road by those cattle horribly spoiled should lie all upon that one parish of islington to repair wherefore i will suppose a rate for the highways to be gathered through the city of london of  0000 l per ann more which may be appointed to be paid by carriers drovers and all such as keep teams horses or coaches and the like or many ways as is most equal and reasonable the waste lands in the said county which by the consent of the parishes lords of the manors and proprietors shall be allowed to the undertakers when enclosed and let out may the land in middlesex generally letting high amount to  000 l per ann more if then an act of parliament be procured to settle the tax of  0000 l per ann for eight years most of which will be levid in workmen and not in money and the waste lands for ever i dare be bold to offer that the highways for the whole county of middlesex should be put into the following form and the  000 l per ann land be bound to remain as a security to maintain them so and the county be never burdened with any further tax for the repair of the highways  and that i may not propose a matter in general like begging the question without demonstration i shall enter into the particulars how it may be performed and that under these following heads of articles   what i propose to do to the highways   what the charge will be   how to be raised   what security for performance   what profit to the undertaker     what i propose to do to the highways  i answer first not repair them and yet secondly not alter them that is not alter the course they run  but perfectly build them as a fabric and to descend to the particulars it is first necessary to note which are the roads i mean and their dimensions  first the high postroads and they are for the county of middlesex as follows miles from london to stanes which is    colebrook is from hounslow 0  uxbridge    bushy the old streetway  0 barnet or near it 0  walthamcross in ware road  0 bow 0      besides these there are crossroads byroads and lanes which must also be looked after and that some of them may be put into condition others may be wholly slighted and shut up or made driftways bridleways or footways as may be thought convenient by the countries  the crossroads of most repute are as follows miles from london to hackney old ford and bow 0  hackney dalston and islington 0  ditto hornsy muzzlehill to whetston 0  tottenham the chase southgate etc called greenlanes 0  enfieldwash enfieldtown whetston totteridge to egworth  0 london hamstead hendon and edgworth 0  edgworth stanmore to pinner to uxbridge 0  london harrow and pinnergreen    london chelsea fullham 0  brantford thistleworth twittenham and kingston 0  kingston stanes colebrook and uxbridge    ditto cherseybridge 0   0 overplus miles  0   0  and because there may be many parts of the crossroads which cannot be accounted in the number abovementioned or may slip my knowledge or memory i allow an overplus of  0 miles to be added to the  0 miles above which together makes the crossroads of middlesex to be   0 miles  for the bylanes such as may be slighted need nothing but to be ditchd up such as are for private use of lands for carrying off corn and driving cattle are to be looked after by private hands  but of the last sort not to be accounted by particulars in the small county of middlesex we cannot allow less in cross bylanes from village to village and from dwellinghouses which stand out of the way to the roads than  000 miles  so in the whole county i reckon up miles of the high postroad 00   of crossroads less public 0  0 of bylanes and passes  000   0   these are the roads i mean and thus divided under their several denominations  to the question what i would do to them i answer   for the    miles of high postroad i propose to throw up a firm strong causway well bottomed   foot high in the middle and   foot on the side faced with brick or stone and crowned with gravel chalk or stone as the several countries they are made through will afford being    foot in breadth with ditches on either side   foot broad and   foot deep so the whole breadth will be  0 foot if the ground will permit  at the end of every two miles or such like convenient distances shall be a cottage erected with half an acre of ground allowed which shall be given gratis with   s per week wages to such poor man of the parish as shall be approved who shall once at least every day view his walk to open passages for the water to run into the ditches to fill up holes or soft places  two riders shall be allowed to be always moving the rounds to view every thing out of repair and make report to the directors and to see that the cottagers do their duty    for the   0 miles of crossroad a like causway to be made but of different dimensions the breadth  0 foot if the ground will allow it the ditches   foot broad   foot deep the height in the middle   foot and on the sides   foot or   where it may be needful to be also crowned with gravel and   s per week to be allowed to the poor of every parish the constables to be bound to find a man to walk on the highway every division for the same purpose as the cottagers do on the greater roads  posts to be set up at every turning to note whither it goes for the direction of strangers and how many miles distant    for a  000 miles bylanes only good and sufficient care to keep them in repair as they are and to carry the water off by clearing and cutting the ditches and laying materials where it is wanted     this is what i propose to do to them and what if once performed i suppose all people would own to be an undertaking both useful and honorable    the second question i propose to give an account of is what the charge will be  which i account thus  the work of the great causway i propose shall not cost less than  0 s per foot supposing materials to be bought carriage and mens labor to be all hired which for    miles in length is no less than the sum of      0 pounds as thus  every mile accounted at    0 yards and   foot to the yard is    0 foot which at  0 s per foot is    0 l per mile and that again multiplied by    makes the sum of      0 into which i include the charge of watercourse mills to throw off water where needful dreins etc  to this charge must be added ditching to enclose land for  0 cottages and building  0 cottages at  0 l each which is   00 l  the work of the smaller causway i propose to finish at the rate of    d per foot which being for   0 miles in length at    0 foot per mile amounts to     0 l  ditching dreining and repairing  000 miles supposed at   s per rod as for   0000 rod is   000 l which added to the two former accounts is thus l the high postroads or the great cawsey    0 0 the small cawsey 0    0 by lanes etc 0  000    0 0  if i were to propose some measures for the easing this charge i could perhaps lay a scheme down how it may be performed for less than one half of this charge  as first by a grant of the court at the old bailey whereby all such criminals as are condemned to die for smaller crimes may instead of transportation be ordered a years work on the highways others instead of whippings a proportioned time and the like which would by a moderate computation provide us generally a supply of  00 workmen and coming in as fast as they go off and let the overseers alone to make them work  secondly by an agreement with the guineacompany to furnish  00 negroes who are generally persons that do a great deal of work and all these are subsisted very reasonably out of a public storehouse  thirdly by carts and horses to be bought not hired with a few able carters and to the other a few workmen that have judgment to direct the rest and thus i question not the great causway shall be done for   s per foot charge but of this by the by  fourthly a liberty to ask charirities and benevolences to the work    to the question how this money shall be raised i think if the parliament settle the tax on the county for eight years at  0000 l per ann no man need ask how it shall be raised  it will be easy enough to raise the money and no parish can grudge to pay a little larger rate for such a term on condition never to be taxed for the highways any more  eight years assessment at  0000 l per ann is enough to afford to borrow the money by way of anticipation if need be the fund being secured by parliament and appropriated to that use and no other  as to what security for performance  the lands which are enclosed may be appropriated by the same act of parliament to the bank and undertakers upon condition of performance and to be forfeit to the use of the several parishes to which they belong in case upon presentation by the grand juries and reasonable time given any part of the roads in such and such parishes be not kept and maintained in that posture they are proposed to be now the lands thus settled are an eternal security to the country for the keeping the roads in repair because they will always be of so much value over the needful charge as will make it worth while to the undertakers to preserve their title to them and the tenure of them being so precarious as to be liable to forfeiture on default they will always be careful to uphold the causways  lastly what profit to the undertakers for we must allow them to gain and that considerably or no man would undertake such a work  to this i propose first  during the work allow them out of the stock  000 l per ann for management  after the work is finished so much of the  000 l per ann as can be saved and the roads kept in good repair let be their own and if the lands secured be not of the value of  000 l a year let so much of the eight years tax be set apart as may purchase land to make them up if they come to more let the benefit be to the adventurers  it may be objected here that a tax of  0000 l for eight years will come in as fast as it can well be laid out and so no anticipations will be requisite for the whole work proposed cannot be probably finished in less time and if so l the charge of the country amounts to   0000 the lands saved eight years revenue 0 0000   0000 which is   000 l more than the charge and if the work be done so much cheaper as is mentioned the profit to the undertaker will be unreasonable  to this i say i would have the undertakers bound to accept the sallary of  000 l per ann for management and if a whole years tax can be spared either leave it unraisd upon the country or put it in bank to be improved against any occasion of building perhaps a great bridge or some very wet season or frost may so damnify the works as to make them require more than ordinary repair but the undertakers should make no private advantage of such an overplus there might be ways enough found for it  another objection lies against the possibility of enclosing the lands upon the waste which generally belongs to some manor whose different tenures may be so cross and so otherwise encumbred that even the lord of those manors though they were willing could not convey them  this may be answered in general that an act of parliament is omnipotent with respect to titles and tenures of land and can empower lords and tenants to consent to what else they could not as to particulars they cannot be answered till they are proposed but there is no doubt but an act of parliament may adjust it all in one head  what a kingdom would england be if this were performed in all the counties of it and yet i believe it is feasible even in the worst i have narrowly observed all the considerable ways in that unpassable county of sussex which especially in some parts in the wild as they very properly call it of the county hardly admits the country people to travel to markets in winter and makes corn dear at market because it cannot be brought and cheap at the farmers house because he cannot carry it to market yet even in that county would i undertake to carry on this proposal and that to great advantage if backed with the authority of an act of parliament  i have seen in that horrible country the road  0 to  00 yards broad lie from side to side all poachd with cattle the land of no manner of benefit and yet no going with a horse but at every step up to the shoulders full of sloughs and holes and covered with standingwater it costs them incredible sums of money to repair them and the very places that are mended would fright a young traveller to go over them the romans mastered this work and by a firm causeway made a highway quite through this deep country through darkin in surry to stansted and thence to okeley and so on to arundel its name tells us what it was made of for it was called stonestreet and many visible parts of it remain to this day  now would any lord of a manor refuse to allow  0 yards in breadth out of that road i mentioned to have the other  0 made into a firm fair and pleasant causeway over that wilderness of a country  or would not any man acknowledge that putting this country into a condition for carriages and travelers to pass would be a great work the gentlemen would find the benefit of it in the rent of their land and price of their timber the country people would find the difference in the sale of their goods which now they cannot carry beyond the first market town and hardly thither and the whole county would reap an advantage an hundred to one greater than the charge of it and since the want we feel of any convenience is generally the first motive to contrivance for a remedy i wonder no man ever thought of some expedient for so considerable a defect  of assurances assurances among merchants i believe may plead prescription and has been of use time out of mind in trade tho perhaps never so much a trade as now  it is a compact among merchants its beginning being an accident to trade and arose from the disease of mens tempers who having run larger adventures in a single bottom than afterward they found convenient grew fearful and uneasy and discovering their uneasiness to others who perhaps had no effects in the same vessel they offer to bear part of the hazard for part of the profit convenience made this a custom and custom brought it into a method till at last it becomes a trade  i cannot question the lawfulness of it since all risque in trade is for gain and when i am necessitated to have a greater cargo of goods in such or such a bottom than my stock can afford to lose another may surely offer to go a part with me and as it is just if i give another part of the gain he should run part of the risque so it is as just that if he runs part of my risque he should have part of the gain some object the disparity of the premio to the hazard when the ensurer runs the risque of  00 l on the seas from jamaica to london for  0 s which say they is preposterous and unequal though this objection is hardly worth answering to men of business yet it looks something fair to them that know no better and for the information of such i trouble the reader with a few heads  first they must consider the ensurer is out no stock  secondly it is but one risque the ensurer runs whereas the assured has had a risque out a risque of debts abroad a risque of a market and a risque of his factor and has a risque of a market to come and therefore ought to have an answerable profit  thirdly if it has been a trading voyage perhaps the adventurer has paid three or four such premios which sometimes make the ensurer clear more by a voyage than the merchant i my self have paid  00 l ensurances in those small premios on a voyage i have not gotten  0 l by and i suppose i am not the first that has done so neither  this way of assuring has also as other arts of trade have suffered some improvement if i may be allowed that term in our age and the first step upon it was an ensuranceoffice for houses to ensure them from fire common fame gives the project to dr barebone a man i suppose better known as a builder than a physician whether it were his or whose it was i do not enquire it was settled on a fund of groundrents to answer in case of loss and met with very good acceptance  but it was soon followed by another by way of friendly society where every one who subscribe pay their quota to build up any mans house who is a contributor if it shall happen to be burnt i will not decide which is the best or which succeeded best but i believe the latter brings in most money to the contriver  only one benefit i cannot omit which they reap from these two societies who are not concerned in either that if any fire happen whether in houses ensurd or not ensurd they have each of them a set of lusty fellows generally watermen who being immediately called up wherever they live by watchmen appointed are it must be confessed very active and diligent in helping to put out the fire  as to any further improvement to be made upon assurances in trade no question there may and i doubt not but on payment of a small duty to the government the king might be made the general ensurer of all foreign trade of which more under another head  i am of the opinion also that an office of ensurance erected to ensure the titles of lands in an age where they are so precarious as now might be a project not unlikely to succeed if established on a good fund but i shall say no more to that because it seems to be a design in hand by some persons in town and is indeed no thought of my own  ensuring of life i cannot admire i shall say nothing to it but that in italy where stabbing and poisoning is so much in vogue something may be said for it and on contingent annuities and yet i never knew the thing much approved of on any account  of friendlysocieties another branch of ensurance is by contribution or to borrow the term from that beforementioned friendlysocieties which is in short a number of people entering into a mutual compact to help one another in case any disaster or distress fall upon them  if mankind could agree as these might be regulated all things which have casualty in them might be secured but one thing is particularly required in this way of assurances none can be admitted but such whose circumstances are at least in some degree alike and so mankind must be sorted into classes and as their contingences differ every different sort may be a society upon even terms for the circumstances of people as to life differ extremely by the age and constitution of their bodies and difference of employment as he that lives on shore against him that goes to sea or a young man against an old man or a shopkeeper against a soldier are unequal i dont pretend to determine the controverted point of predestination the foreknowledge and decrees of providence perhaps if a man be decreed to be killed in the trenches the same foreknowledge ordered him to list himself a soldier that it might come to pass and the like of a seaman but this i am sure speaking of second causes a seaman or a soldier is subject to more contingent hazards than other men and therefore are not upon equal terms to form such a society nor is an annuity on the life of such a man worth so much as it is upon other men therefore if a society should agree together to pay the executor of every member so much after the decease of the said member the seamens executors would most certainly have an advantage and receive more than they pay so that it is necessary to sort the world into parcels seamen with seamen soldiers with soldiers and the like  nor is this a new thing the friendly society must not pretend to assume to themselves the contrivance of the method or think us guilty of borrowing from them when we draw this into other branches for i know nothing is taken from them but the bare word friendlysociety which they cannot pretend to be any considerable piece of invention neither  i can refer them to the very individual practice in other things which claims prescription beyond the beginning of the last age and that is in our marshes and fens in essex kent and the isle of ely where great quantities of land being with much pains and a vast charge recovered out of the seas and rivers and maintained with banks which they call walls the owners of those lands agree to contribute to the keeping up those walls and keeping out the sea which is all one with a friendlysociety and if i have a piece of land in any level or marsh though it bounds no where on the sea or river yet i pay my proportion to the maintenance of the said wall or bank and if at any time the sea breaks in the damage is not laid upon the man in whose land the breach happened unless it was by his neglect but it lies on the whole land and is called a levellot  again i have known it practiced in troops of horse especially when it was so ordered that the troopers mounted themselves where every private trooper has agreed to pay perhaps   d per diem out of his pay into a public stock which stock was employed to remount any of the troop who by accident should lose his horse  again the sailors contribution to the chest at chatham is another friendlysociety and more might be named  to argue against the lawfulness of this would be to cry down common equity as well as charity for as it is kind that my neighbor should relieve me if i fall into distress or decay so it is but equal he should do so if i agreed to have done the same for him and if god almighty has commanded us to relieve and help one another in distress sure it must be commendable to bind our selves by agreement to obey that command nay it seems to be a project that we are led to by the divine rule and has such a latitude in it that for ought i know as i said all the disasters in the world might be prevented by it and mankind be secured from all the miseries indigences and distresses that happen in the world in which i crave leave to be a little particular  first general peace might be secured all over the world by it if all the powers agreed to suppress him that usurped or encroachd upon his neighbor all the contingences of life might be fenced against by this method as fire is already as thieves floods by land storms by sea losses of all sorts and death it self in a manner by making it up to the survivor  i shall begin with the seamen for as their lives are subject to more hazards than others they seem to come first in view  of seamen sailors are les enfans perdue the forlorn hope of the world they are fellows that bid defiance to terror and maintain a constant war with the elements who by the magic of their art trade in the very confines of death and are always posted within shot as i may say of the grave it is true their familiarity with danger makes them despise it for which i hope no body will say they are the wiser and custom has so hardened them that we find them the worst of men though always in view of their last moment  i have observed one great error in the custom of england relating to these sort of people and which this way of friendlysociety would be a remedy for  if a seaman who enters himself or is pressed into the kings service be by any accident wounded or disabled to recompense him for the loss he receives a pension during life which the sailors call smartmoney and is proportioned to their hurt as for the loss of an eye arm leg or finger and the like and as it is a very honorable thing so it is but reasonable that a poor man who loses his limbs which are his estate in the service of the government and is thereby disabled from his labor to get his bread should be provided for and not suffered to beg or starve for want of those limbs he lost in the service of his country  but if you come to the seamen in the merchants service not the least provision is made which has been the loss of many a good ship with many a rich cargo which would otherwise have been saved  and the sailors are in the right of it too for instance a merchant ship coming home from the indies perhaps very rich meets with a privateer not so strong but that she might fight him and perhaps get off the captain calls up his crew tells them gentlemen you see how it is i dont question but we may clear our selves of this caper if you will stand by me one of the crew as willing to fight as the rest and as far from a coward as the captain but endowed with a little more wit than his fellows replies noble captain we are all willing to fight and dont question but to beat him off but here is the case if we are taken we shall be set on shore and then sent home and lose perhaps our clothes and a little pay but if we fight and beat the privateer perhaps half a score of us may be wounded and lose our limbs and then we are undone and our families if you will sign an obligation to us that the owners or merchants shall allow a pension to such as are maimed that we may not fight for the ship and go a begging our selves we will bring off the ship or sink by her side otherwise i am not willing to fight for my part the captain cannot do this so they strike and the ship and cargo is lost  if i should turn this supposed example into a real history and name the ship and the captain that did so it would be too plain to be contradicted  wherefore for the encouragement of sailors in the service of the merchant i would have a friendlysociety erected for seamen wherein all sailors or seafaringmen entering their names places of abode and the voyages they go upon at an office of ensurance for seamen and paying there a certain small quarteridge of   s per quarter should have a sealed certificate from the governors of the said office for the articles hereafter mentioned    if any such seaman either in fight or by any other accident at sea come to be disabled he should receive from the said office the following sums of money either in pension for life or ready money as he pleased l l for the loss of an eye    or   per ann for life both eyes  00   one leg  0   both legs  0   right hand  0   left hand  0   right arm  00   left arm  0   both hands   0    both arms  00    any broken arm or leg or thigh toward the cure  0 l if taken by the turks  0 l toward his ransom if he become infirm and unable to go to sea or maintain himself by age or sickness   l per ann to their wives if they are killed or drowned  0 l  in consideration of this every seaman subscribing to the society shall agree to pay to the receipt of the said office his quota of the sum to be paid whenever and as often as such claims are made the claims to be entered into the office and upon sufficient proof made the governors to regulate the division and publish it in print  for example  suppose  000 seamen subscribe to this society and after six months for no man should claim sooner than six months a merchants ship having engaged a privateer there comes several claims together as thus l a was wounded and lost one leg  0 b blown up with powder and has lost an eye    c had a great shot took off his arm  00 d with a splinter had an eye struck out     00 e was killed with a great shot to be paid to his wife  0   0  the governors hereupon settle the claim of these persons and make publication that whereas such and such seamen members of the society have in an engagement with a french privateer been so and so hurt their claims upon the office by the rules and agreements of the said office being adjusted by the governors amounts to   0 l which being equally divided among the subscribers comes to   s   d each which all persons that are subscribers to the said office are desired to pay in for their respective subscriptions that the said wounded persons may be relieved accordingly as they expect to be relieved if the same or the like casualty should befall them  it is but a small matter for a man to contribute if he gave   s   d out of his wages to relieve five wounded men of his own fraternity but at the same time to be assured that if he is hurt or maimed he shall have the same relief it is a thing so rational that hardly any thing but a harebraind fellow that thinks of nothing would omit entering himself into such an office  i shall not enter further into this affair because perhaps i may give the proposal to some persons who may set it on foot and then the world may see the benefit of it by the execution  ii for widows the same method of friendlysociety i conceive would be a very proper proposal for widows  we have abundance of women who have been bred well and lived well ruined in a few years and perhaps left young with a house full of chidren and nothing to support them which falls generally upon the wives of the inferior clergy or of shopkeepers and artificers  they marry wives with perhaps  00 l to  000 l portion and can settle no jointure upon them either they are extravagant and idle and waste it or trade decays or losses or a thousand contingences happen to bring a tradesman to poverty and he breaks the poor young woman it may be has three or four children and is driven to a thousand shifts while he lies in the mint or friars under the dilemma of a statute of bankrupt but if he dies then she is absolutely undone unless she has friends to go to  suppose an office to be erected to be called an office of ensurance for widows upon the following conditions  two thousand women or their husbands for them enter their names into a register to be kept for that purpose with the names age and trade of their husbands with the place of their abode paying at the time of their entering   s down with   s   d per quarter which is to the setting up and support of an office with clerks and all proper officers for the same for there is no maintaining such without charge they receive every one of them a certificate sealed by the secretary of the office and signed by the governors for the articles hereafter mentioned  if any one of the women become a widow at any time after six months from the date of her subscription upon due notice given and claim made at the office in form as shall be directed she shall receive within six months after such claim made the sum of  00 l in money without any deductions saving some small fees to the officers which the trustees must settle that they may be known  in consideration of this every woman so subscribing obliges her self to pay as often as any member of the society becomes a widow the due proportion or share allotted to her to pay toward the  00 l for the said widow provided her share does not exceed the sum of   s  no seaman or soldiers wives to be accepted into such a proposal as this on the account beforementioned because the contingences of their lives are not equal to others unless they will admit this general exception supposing they do not die out of the kingdom  it might also be an exception that if the widow that claimed had really bona fide left her by her husband to her own use clear of all debts and legacies  000 l she should have no claim the intent being to aid the poor not add to the rich but there lies a great many objections against such an article as   it may tempt some to forswear themselves   people will order their wills so as to defraud the exception   one exception must be made and that is either very unequal matches as when a woman of nineteen marries an old man of seventy or women who have infirm husbands i mean known and publicly so to remedy which two things are to be done   the office must have moving officers without doors who shall inform themselves of such matters and if any such circumstances appear the office should have    days time to return their money and declare their subscriptions void   no woman whose husband had any visible distemper should claim under a year after her subscription   one grand objection against this proposal is how you will oblige people to pay either their subscription or their quarteridge  to this i answer by no compulsion though that might be performed too but altogether voluntary only with this argument to move it that if they do not continue their payments they lose the benefit of their past contributions  i know it lies as a fair objection against such a project as this that the number of claims are so uncertain that no body knows what they engage in when they subscribe for so many may die annually out of two thousand as may make my payment  0 or    l per ann and if a woman happen to pay that for twenty years though she receives the  00 l at last she is a great loser but if she dies before her husband she has lessened his estate considerably and brought a great loss upon him  first i say to this that i would have such a proposal as this be so fair and so easy that if any person who had subscribed found the payments too high and the claims fall too often it should be at their liberty at any time upon notice given to be released and stand obliged no longer and if so volenti non fit injuria every one knows best what their own circumstances will bear  in the next place because death is a contingency no man can directly calculate and all that subscribe must take the hazard yet that a prejudice against this notion may not be built on wrong grounds let us examine a little the probable hazard and see how many shall die annually out of  000 subscribers accounting by the common proportion of burials to the number of the living  sir william petty in his political arithmetic by a very ingenious calculation brings the account of burials in london to be   in  0 annually and proves it by all the proper rules of proportioned computation and i will take my scheme from thence  if then one in forty of all the people in england die that supposes fifty to die every year out of our two thousand subscribers and for a woman to contribute   s to every one would certainly be to agree to pay    l  0 s per ann upon her husbands life to receive  00 l when he did and lose it if she did first and yet this would not be a hazard beyond reason too great for the gain  but i shall offer some reasons to prove this to be impossible in our case first sir william petty allows the city of london to contain about a million of people and our yearly bill of mortality never yet amounted to   000 in the most sickly years we have had plague years excepted sometimes but to  0000 which is but one in fifty now it is to be considered here that children and ancient people make up one time with another at least one third of our bills of mortality and our assurances lies upon none but the midling age of the people which is the only age wherein life is any thing steady and if that be allowed there cannot die by his computation above one in eighty of such people every year but because i would be sure to leave room for casualty i will allow one in fifty shall die out of our number subscribed  secondly it must be allowed that our payments falling due only on the death of husbands this one in fifty must not be reckoned upon the two thousand for it is to be supposed at least as many women shall die as men and then there is nothing to pay so that one in fifty upon one thousand is the most that i can suppose shall claim the contribution in a year which is twenty claims a year at   s each and is   l per ann and if a woman pays this for twenty year and claims at last she is gainer enough and no extraordinary loser if she never claims at all and i verily believe any office might undertake to demand at all adventures not above   l per ann and secure the subscriber  00 l in case she come to claim as a widow  i forbear being more particular on this thought having occasion to be larger in other prints the experiment being resolved upon by some friends who are pleased to think this too useful a project not to be put in execution and therefore i refer the reader to the public practice of it  i have named these two cases as special experiments of what might be done by assurances in way of friendly society and i believe i might without arrogance affirm that the same thought might be improved into methods that should prevent the general misery and poverty of mankind and at once secure us against beggars parishpoor almshouses and hospitals and by which not a creature so miserable or so poor but should claim subsistence as their due and not ask it of charity  i cannot believe any creature so wretchedly base as to beg of mere choice but either it must proceed from want or sordid prodigious covetousness and thence i affirm there can be no beggar but he ought to be either relieved or punished or both if a man begs for mere covetousness without want it is a baseness of soul so extremely sordid as ought to be used with the utmost contempt and punished with the correction due to a dog if he begs for want that want is procured by slothfulness and idleness or by accident if the latter he ought to be relieved if the former he ought to be punished for the cause but at the same time relieved also for no man ought to starve let his crime be what it will  i shall proceed therefore to a scheme by which all mankind be he never so mean so poor so unable shall gain for himself a just claim to a comfortable subsistence whenever age or casualty shall reduce him to a necessity of making use of it there is a poverty so far from being despicable that it is honorable when a man by direct casualty sudden providence and without any procuring of his own is reduced to want relief from others as by fire shipwreck loss of limbs and the like  these are sometimes so apparent that they command the charity of others but there are also many families reduced to decay whose conditions are not so public and yet their necessities as great innumerable circumstances reduce men to want and pressing poverty oblige some people to make their cases public or starve and from thence came the custom of begging which sloth and idleness has improved into a trade but the method i propose thoroughly put in practice would remove the cause and the effect would cease of course  want of consideration is the great reason why people do not provide in their youth and strength for old age and sickness and the ensuing proposal is in short only this that all persons in the time of their health and youth while they are able to work and spare it should lay up some small inconsiderable part of their gettings as a deposit in safe hands to lie as a store in bank to relieve them if by age or accident they come to be disabled or incapable to provide for themselves and that if god so bless them that they nor theirs never come to need it the overplus may be employed to relieve such as shall  if an office in the same nature with this were appointed in every county in england i doubt not but poverty might easily be prevented and begging wholly suppresd  the proposal is for a pensionoffice that an office be erected in some convenient place where shall be a secretary a clerk and a searcher always attending  that all sorts of people who are laboring people and of honest repute of what calling or condition soever men or women beggars and soldiers excepted who being sound of their limbs and under fifty years of age shall come to the said office and enter their names trades and places of abode into a register to be kept for that purpose and shall pay down at the time of the said entering the sum of sixpence and from thence one shilling per quarter shall every one have an assurance under the seal of the said office for these following conditions   every such subscriber if by any casualty  drunkenness and quarrels excepted they break their limbs dislocate joints or are dangerously maimed or bruised able surgeons appointed for that purpose shall take them into their care and endeavor their cure gratis   if they are at any time dangerously sick on notice given to the said office able physicians shall be appointed to visit them and give their prescriptions gratis   if by sickness or accident as aforesaid they lose their limbs or eyes so as to be visibly disabled to work and are otherwise poor and unable to provide for themselves they shall either be cured at the charge of the office or be allowed a pension for subsistence during life   if they become lame aged bedrid or by real infirmity of body  the pox excepted are unable to work and otherwise incapable to provide for themselves on proof made that it is really and honestly so they shall be taken into a college or hospital provided for that purpose and be decently maintained during life   if they are seamen and die abroad on board the merchants ships they were employed in or are cast away and drowned or taken and die in slavery their widows shall receive a pension during their widowhood   if they were tradesmen and paid the parish rates if by decay and failure of trade they break and are put in prison for debt they shall receive a pension for subsistence during close imprisonment   if by sickness or accidents they are reduced to extremities of poverty for a season on a true representation to the office they shall be relieved as the governors shall see cause   it is to be noted that in the  th article such as by sickness and age are disabled from work and poor shall be taken into the house and provided for whereas in the  d article they who are blind or have lost limbs etc shall have pensions allowed them  the reason of this difference is this  a poor man or woman that has lost his hand or leg or sight is visibly disabled and we cannot be deceived whereas other infirmities are not so easily judged of and every body would be claiming a pension when but few will demand being taken into an hospital but such as are really in want  and that this might be managed with such care and candor as a design which carries so good a face ought to be i propose the following method for putting it in practice  i suppose every undertaking of such a magnitude must have some principal agent to push it forward who must manage and direct every thing always with direction of the governors  and first i will suppose one general office erected for the great parishes of stepney and whitechappel and as i will lay down afterward some methods to oblige all people to come in and subscribe so i may be allowed to suppose here that all the inhabitants of those two large parishes the meaner laboring sort i mean should enter their names and that the number of them should be a  00000 as i believe they would be at least  first there should be named  0 of the principal inhabitants of the said parishes of which the churchwardens for the time being and all the justices of the peace dwelling in the bounds of the said parish and the ministers resident for the time being to be part to be governors of the said office  the said  0 to be first nominated by the lord mayor of london for the time being and every vacancy to be supplied in  0 days at farthest by the majority of voices of the rest  the  0 to choose a committee of    to sit twice a week of whom   to be a quorum with a chief governor a deputy governor and a treasurer  in the office a secretary with clerks of his own a register and   clerks   searchers a messenger one in daily attendance under salary a physician a surgeon and   visitors  in the hospital more or less according to the number of people entertained a housekeeper a steward nurses a porter and a chaplain  for the support of this office and that the deposite money might go to none but the persons and uses for whom it is paid and that it might not be said officers and salaries was the chief end of the undertaking as in many a project it has been i propose that the manager or undertaker who i mentioned before be the secretary who shall have a clerk allowed him whose business it shall be to keep the register take the entries and give out the tickets sealed by the governors and signed by himself and to enter always the payment of quarteridge of every subscriber and that there may be no fraud or connivance and too great trust be not reposed in the said secretary every subscriber who brings his quarteridge is to put it into a great chest locked up with    locks every member of the committee to keep a key so that it cannot be opened but in the presence of them all and every time a subscriber pays his quarteridge the secretary shall give him a sealed ticket thus christmas    which shall be allowed as the receipt of quarteridge for that quarter  note the reason why every subscriber shall take a receipt or ticket for his quarteridge is because this must be the standing law of the office that if any subscriber fail to pay their quarteridge they shall never claim after it until double so much be paid nor not at all that quarter whatever befalls them  the secretary should be allowed to have   d for every ticket of entry he gives out and   d for every receipt he gives for quarteridge to be accounted for as follows one third to himself in lieu of salary he being to pay three clerks out of it one third to the clerks and other officers among them and one third to defray the incident charge of the office thus calculated per ann l s d  00000 subscribers paying   d each every quarter is          one third to the secretary per ann and three clerks         l per ann one third to a register  00   0 0 0 to a clerk  0 to   searchers  00 to a physician  00 to a surgeon  00 to four visitors  00 one third to incident charges such as to ten committee men   s each sitting twice per week is   0   0      to a clerk of committees  0 to a messenger  0 a house for the office  0 a house for the hospital  00 contingencies  0    s   d           all the charge being thus paid out of such a trifle as   d per quarter the next consideration is to examine what the incomes of this subscription may be and in time what may be the demands upon it l s d if  00 000 persons subscribe they pay down at their entering each   d which is   00 00 00 and the first years payment is in stock at   s per quarter  0000 00 00 it must be allowed that under three months the subscriptions will not be well complete so the payment of quarteridge shall not begin but from the day after the books are full or shut up and from thence one year is to pass before any claim can be made and the money coming in at separate times i suppose no improvement upon it for the first year except of the   00 which lent to the king on some good fund at   l per cent interest advances the first year     00 00 the quarteridge of the second year abating for  000 claims    00 00 00 and the interest of the first years money at the end of the second year lent to the king as aforesaid at   per cent interest is       0 00 the quarteridge of the third year abating for claims    00 00 00 the interest of former cash to the end of the third year      0  00 income of three years          00  note any person may pay   s up to   s quarterly if they please and upon a claim will be allowed in proportion  to assign what shall be the charge upon this where contingency has so great a share is not to be done but by way of political arithmetic a probable guess may be made  it is to be noted that the pensions i propose to be paid to persons claiming by the third fifth and sixth articles are thus every person who paid   s quarterly shall receive    d weekly and so in proportion every    d paid quarterly by any one person to receive so many shillings weekly if they come to claim a pension  the first year no claim is allowed so the bank has in stock completely    00 l from thence we are to consider the number of claims  sir william petty in his political arithmetic supposes not above one in  0 to dye per ann out of the whole number of people and i can by no means allow that the circumstances of our claims will be as frequent as death for these reasons   our subscriptions respect all persons grown and in the prime of their age past the first and providing against the last part of danger sir williams account including children and old people which always makes up one third of the bills of mortality   our claims will fall thin at first for several years and let but the money increase for ten years as it does in the account for three years twould be almost sufficient to maintain the whole number   allow that casualty and poverty are our debtorside health prosperity and death are the creditorside of the account and in all probable accounts those three articles will carry off three fourth parts of the number as follows if   in  0 shall dye annually as no doubt they shall and more that is   00 a year which in  0 years is  0000 of the number i hope i may be allowed one third to be out of condition to claim apparently living wihtout the help of charity and one third in health of body and able to work which put together makes       so it leaves       to make claims of charity and pensions in the first  0 years and one half of them must according to sir william petty die on our hands in  0 years so there remains but        but to put it out of doubt beyond the proportion to be guessed at i will allow they shall fall thus  the first year we are to note none can claim and the second year the number must be very few but increasing wherefore i suppose l one in every  00 shall claim the second year which is  00 the charge whereof is  00 one in every  00 the third year is  000 the charge   00 together with the former  00  00  000 to carry on the calculation l s d we find the stock at the end of the   d year          0 the quarteridge of the   th year abating as before   000 00 0 interest of the stock           the quarteridge of the   th year    00 00 0 interest of the stock      00 0             l s d the charge  000 00 0  000 to fall the   th year  000 00 0 and the old continued  000 00 0  000 the   th year  000 00 0 the old continued   000 00 0   000 00 0  by this computation the stock is increased above the charge in five years       l    s   d and yet here are sundry articles to be considered on both sides of the account that will necessarily increase the stock and diminish the charge l s d first in the five years time   00 having claimed charity the number being abated for in the reckoning above for stock it may be allowed new subscriptions will be taken in to keep the number full which in five years amounts to   00 00 0 their sixpences is     00 0      00 0 which added to        l    s   d augments the stock to             l s d six thousand two hundred persons claiming help which falls to be sure on the aged and infirm i think at a modest computation in five years time  00 of them may be dead which without allowing annually we take at an abatement of  000 l out of the charge  000 00 0 which reduces the charge to   000 00 0  besides this the interest of the quarteridge which is supposed in the former account to lie dead till the year is out which cast up from quarter to quarter allowing it to be put out quarterly as it may well be amounts to by computation for five year    0 l  from the   th year as near as can be computed the number of pensioners being so great i make no doubt but they shall die off of the hands of the undertaker as fast as they shall fall in excepting so much difference as the payment of every year which the interest of the stock shall supply  for example l s d at the end of the fifth year the stock in hand            the payment of the sixth year  0000 00 0 interest of the stock   0  0  0   00        l s d allow an overplus charge for keeping in the house which will be dearer than pensions  0000 l per ann  0000 00 0 charge of the   th year    00 00 0 balance in cash              00         this also is to be allowed that all those persons who are kept by the office in the house shall have employment provided for them whereby no persons shall be kept idle the works to be suited to every ones capacity without rigor only some distinction to those who are most willing to work the profits of the said work to the stock of the house  besides this there may great and very profitable methods be found out to improve the stock beyond the settled interest of   per cent which perhaps may not always be to be had for the exchequer is not always borrowing money but a bank of  0000 l employed by faithful hands need not want opportunities of great and very considerable improvement  also it would be a very good object for persons who die rich to leave legacies to which in time might be very well supposed to raise a standing revenue to it  i will not say but various contingencies may alter the charge of this undertaking and swell the claims beyond proportion further than i extend it but all that and much more is sufficiently answered in the calculations by above  0000 l in stock to provide for it  as to the calculation being made on a vast number of subscribers and more than perhaps will be allowed likely to subscribe i think the proportion may hold good in a few as well as in a great many and perhaps if  0000 subscribed it might be as effectual i am indeed willing to think all men should have sense enough to see the usefulness of such a design and be persuaded by their interest to engage in it but some men have less prudence than brutes and will make no provision against age till it comes and to deal with such two ways might be used by authority to compel them   the churchwardens and justices of peace should send the beadle of the parish with an officer belonging to this office about to the poorer parishioners to tell them that since such honorable provision is made for them to secure themselves in old age from poverty and distress they should expect no relief from the parish if they refused to enter themselves and by sparing so small a part of their earnings to prevent future misery   the churchwardens of every parish might refuse the removal of persons and families into their parish but upon their having entered into this office   all persons should be publicly desired to forbear giving any thing to beggars and all common beggars suppressed after a certain time for this would effectually suppress beggary at last   and to oblige the parishes to do this on behalf of such a project the governor of the house should secure the parish against all charges coming upon them from any person who did subscribe and pay the quarteridge and that would most certainly oblige any parish to endeavor that all the laboring meaner people in the parish should enter their names for in time twoud most certainly take all the poor in the parish off of their hands  i know that by law no parish can refuse to relieve any person or family fallen into distress and therefore to send them word they must expect no relief would seem a vain threatening but thus far the parish may do they shall be esteemed as persons who deserve no relief and shall be used accordingly for who indeed would ever pity that man in his distress who at the expense of two pots of beer a month might have prevented it and would not spare it  as to my calculations on which i do not depend neither i say this if they are probable and that in five years time a subscription of a hundred thousand persons would have       l    s   d in cash all charges paid i desire any one but to reflect what will not such a sum do for instance were it laid out in the million lottery tickets which are now sold at   l each and bring in   l per ann for fifteen years every  000 l so laid out pays back in time   00 l and that time would be as fast as it would be wanted and therefore be as good as money or if laid out in improving rents as groundrents with buildings to devolve in time there is no question but a revenue would be raised in time to maintain one third part of the number of subscribers if they should come to claim charity  and i desire any man to consider the present state of this kingdom and tell me if all the people of england old and young rich and poor were to pay into one common bank   s per ann a head and that   s duly and honestly managed whether the overplus paid by those who die off and by those who never come to want would not in all probability maintain all that should be poor and for ever banish beggary and poverty out of the kingdom  of wagering wagering as now practiced by polities and contracts is become a branch of assurances it was before more properly a part of gaming and as it deserved had but a very low esteem but shifting sides and the war providing proper subjects as the contingences of sieges battles treaties and campaigns it increased to an extraordinary reputation and offices were erected on purpose which managed it to a strange degree and with great advantage especially to the officekeepers so that as has been computed there was not less gaged on one side and other upon the second siege of limerick than two hundred thousand pound  how it is managed and by what trick and artifice it became a trade and how insensibly men were drawn into it an easy account may be given  i believe novelty was the first wheel that set it on work and i need make no reflection upon the power of that charm it was wholly a new thing at least upon the exchange of london and the first occasion that gave it a room among public discourse was some persons forming wagers on the return and success of king james for which the government took occasion to use them as they deserved  i have heard a bookseller in king jamess time say that if he would have a book sell he would have it burnt by the hand of the common hangman the man no doubt valued his profit above his reputation but people are so addicted to prosecute a thing that seems forbid that this very practice seemed to be encouraged by its being contraband  the trade increased and first on the exchange and then in coffeehouses it got life till the brokers those vermin of trade got hold of it and then particular offices were set apart for it and an incredible resort thither was to be seen every day  these offices had not been long in being but they were thronged with sharpers and setters as much as the groomporters or any gamingordinary in town where a man had nothing to do but to make a good figure and prepare the keeper of the office to give him a credit as a good man and though he had not a groat to pay he should take guineas and sign polities till he had received perhaps   or  00 l in money on condition to pay great odds and then success tries the man if he wins his fortune is made if not he is a better man than he was before by just so much money for as to the debt he is your humble servant in the temple or whitehall  but besides those who are but the thieves of the trade there is a method as effectual to get money as possible managed with more appearing honesty but no less art by which the wagerer in confederacy with the officekeeper shall lay vast sums great odds and yet be always sure to win  for example  a town in flanders or elsewhere during the war is besieged perhaps at the beginning of the siege the defense is vigorous and relief probable and it is the opinion of most people the town will hold out so long or perhaps not be taken at all the wagerer has two or three more of his fort in conjunction of which always the officekeeper is one and they run down all discourse of the taking the town and offer great odds it shall not be taken by such a day perhaps this goes on a week and then the scale turns and though they seem to hold the same opinion still yet underhand the officekeeper has orders to take all the odds which by their example was before given against the taking the town and so all their firstgiven odds are easily secured and yet the people brought into a vein of betting against the siege of the town too then they order all the odds to be taken as long as they will run while they themselves openly give odds and sign polities and oftentimes take their own money till they have received perhaps double what they at first laid then they turn the scale at once and cry down the town and lay that it shall be taken till the length of the first odds is fully run and by this manage if the town be taken they win perhaps two or three thousand pounds and if it be not taken they are no losers neither  it is visible by experience not one town in ten is besieged but it is taken the art of war is so improved and our generals are so wary that an army seldom attempts a siege but when they are almost sure to go on with it and no town can hold out if a relief cannot be had from abroad  now if i can by first laying  00 l to  00 l with a that the town shall not be taken wheedle in b to lay me  000 l to  000 l of the same and after that by bringing down the vogue of the siege reduce the wagers to evenhand and lay  000 l with c that the town shall not be taken by this method it is plain if the town be not taken i win   00 l and lose  000 l if the town be taken i win  000 l and lose   00 l   this is gaming by rule and in such a knot it is impossible to lose for if it is in any mans or company of mens power by any artifice to alter the odds it is in their power to command the money out of every mans pocket who has no more wit than to venture  of fools of all persons who are objects of our charity none move my compassion like those whom it has pleased god to leave in a full state of health and strength but deprived of reason to act for themselves and it is in my opinion one of the greatest scandals upon the understanding of others to mock at those who want it upon this account i think the hospital we call bedlam to be a noble foundation a visible instance of the sense our ancestors had of the greatest unhappiness which can befall human kind since as the soul in man distinguishes him from a brute so where the soul is dead for so it is as to acting no brute so much a beast as a man but since never to have it and to have lost it are synonimous in the effect i wonder how it came to pass that in the settlement of that hospital they made no provision for persons born without the use of their reason such as we call fools or more properly naturals  we use such in england with the last contempt which i think is a strange error since though they are useless to the commonwealth they are only so by gods direct providence and no previous fault  i think twould very well become this wise age to take care of such and perhaps they are a particular rentcharge on the great family of mankind left by the maker of us all like a younger brother who though the estate be given from him yet his father expected the heir should take some care of him  if i were to be asked who ought in particular to be charged with this work i would answer in general those who have a portion of understanding extraordinary not that i would lay a tax upon any mans brains or discourage wit by appointing wise men to maintain fools but some tribute is due to gods goodness for bestowing extraordinary gifts and who can it be better paid to than such as suffer for want of the same bounty  for the providing therefore some subsistence for such that natural defects may not be exposed  it is proposed  that a foolhouse be erected either by public authority or by the city or by an act of parliament into which all that are naturals or born fools without respect or distinction should be admitted and maintained  for the maintenance of this a small stated contribution settled by the authority of an act of parliament without any damage to the persons paying the same might be very easily raised by a tax upon learning to be paid by the authors of books every book that shall be printed in folio from  0 sheets and upwards to pay at the licensing for the whole impression   l under  0 sheets  0 s every quarto  0 s every octavo of  0 sheets and upward  0 s every octavo under  0 sheets and every bound book in   s  0 s every stitched pamphlet reprinted copies the same rates   s  this tax to be paid into the chamber of london for the space of twenty years would without question raise a fund sufficient to build and purchase a settlement for this house  i suppose this little tax being to be raised at so few places as the printingpresses or the licensers of books and consequently the charge but very small in gathering might bring in about   00 l per annum for the term of twenty years which would perform the work to the degree following  the house should be plain and decent for i dont think the ostentation of buildings necessary or suitable to works of charity and be built somewhere out of town for the sake of the air  the building to cost about  000 l or if the revenue exceed to cost  000 l at most and the salaries mean in proportion  in the house a steward  0 l per ann a purveyor  0 a cook  0 a butler  0 six women to assist the cook and clean the house   l each    six nurses to tend the people   l each    a chaplain  0     a hundred almspeople at   l per ann diet etc  00     l per ann the table for the officers and contingences and clothes for the almspeople and firing put together  00 l per ann an auditor of the accounts a committee of the governors and two clerks  here i suppose   00 pounds per ann revenue to be settled upon the house which it is very probable might be raised from the tax aforesaid but since an act of parliament is necessary to be had for the collecting this duty and that taxes for keeping of fools would be difficultly obtained while they are so much wanted for wise men i would propose to raise the money by voluntary charity which would be a work would leave more honor to the undertakers than feasts and great shows which our public bodies too much diminish their stocks with  but to pass all suppositious ways which are easily thought of but hardly procured i propose to maintain fools out of our own folly and whereas a great deal of money has been thrown about in lotteries the following proposal would very easily perfect our work  a charitylottery  that a lottery be set up by the authority of the lord mayor and court of aldermen for a hundred thousand tickets at twenty shillings each to be drawn by the known way and method of drawing lotteries as the millionlottery was drawn in which no allowance to be made to any body but the fortunate to receive the full sum of one hundred thousand pounds put in without discount and yet this double advantage to follow   that an immediate sum of one hundred thousand pounds shall be raised and paid into the exchequer for the public use   a sum of above twenty thousand pounds be gained to be put into the hands of known trustees to be laid out in a charity for the maintenance of the poor   that as soon as the money shall be come in it shall be paid into the exchequer either on some good fund if any suitable or on the credit of exchequer and that when the lottery is drawn the fortunate to receive tallies or bills from the exchequer for their money payable at four years  the exchequer receives this money and gives out tallies according to the prizes when it is drawn all payable at four years and the interest of this money for four years is struck in tallies proportioned to the time and given to the trustees which is the profit i propose for the work  thus the fortunate have an immediate title to their prizes at four years without interest and the hospital will have also an immediate title to  000 l per ann for four years which is the interest at   per cent per ann  if any should object against the time of staying for their prizes it should be answered thus that whoever did not like to stay the time for the money upon discounting four years interest at   per cent should have their money down  i think this specimen will inform any body what might be done by lotteries were they not hackneyd about in private hands who by fraud and ill management put them out of repute and so neither gain themselves nor suffer any useful handsome design to succeed  twould be needless i suppose to mention that such a proposal as this ought to be set on foot by public approbation and by men of known integrity and estates that there may be no room left for a suspicion of private advantage  if this or any equivalent proposal succeeded to raise the money i would have the house established as aforesaid with larger or smaller revenues as necessity obliged then the persons to be received should be without distinction or respect but principally such as were really poor and friendless and any that were kept already by any parishcollection the said parish should allow forty shillings yearly toward their maintenance which no parish would refuse that subsisted them wholly before  i make no question but that if such an hospital was erected within a mile or two of the city one great circumstance would happen viz that the common sort of people who are very much addicted to rambling in the fields would make this house the customary walk to divert themselves with the objects to be seen there and to make what they call sport with the calamity of others as is now shamefully allowed in bedlam  to prevent this and that the condition of such which deserves pity not contempt might not be the more exposed by this charity it should be ordered that the steward of the house be in commission of the peace within the precincts of the house only and authorized to punish by limited fines or otherwise any person that shall offer any abuse to the poor almspeople or shall offer to make sport at their condition  if any person at reading of this should be so impertinent as to ask to what purpose i would appoint a chaplain in an hospital of fools i could answer him very well by saying for the use of the other persons officers and attendants in the house  but besides that pray why not a chaplain for fools as well as for knaves since both though in a different manner are incapable of reaping any benefit by religion unless by some invisible influence they are made docible and since the same secret power can restore these to their reason as must make the other sensible pray why not a chaplain idiots indeed were denied the communion in the primitive churches but i never read they were not to be prayed for or were not admitted to hear  if we allow any religion and a divine supreme power whose influence works invisibly on the hearts of men  as he must be worse than the people we talk of who denies it we must allow at the same time that power can restore the reasoningfaculty to an idiot and it is our part to use the proper means of supplicating heaven to that end leaving the disposingpart to the issue of unalterable providence  the wisdom of providence has not left us without examples of some of the most stupid natural idiots in the world who have been restored to their reason or as one would think had reason infused after a long life of ideotism perhaps among other wise ends to confute that sordid supposition that idiots have no souls  of bankrupts this chapter has some right to stand next to that of fools for besides the common acceptance of late which makes every unfortunate man a fool i think no man so much made a fool of as a bankrupt  if i may be allowed so much liberty with our laws which are generally good and above all things are tempered with mercy lenity and freedom this has something in it of barbarity it gives a loose to the malice and revenge of the creditor as well as a power to right himself while it leaves the debtor no way to show himself honest it contrives all the ways possible to drive the debtor to despair and encourages no new industry for it makes him perfectly incapable of any thing but starving  this law especially as it is now frequently executed tends wholly to the destruction of the debtor and yet very little to the advantage of the creditor    the severities to the debtor are unreasonable and if i may so say a little inhuman for it not only strips him of all in a moment but renders him for ever incapable of helping himself or relieving his family by future industry if he escapes from prison which is hardly done too if he has nothing left he must starve or live on charity if he goes to work no man dare pay him his wages but he shall pay it again to the creditors if he has any private stock left for a subsistence he can put it no where every man is bound to be a thief and take it from him if he trusts it in the hands of a friend he must receive it again as a great courtesy for that friend is liable to account for it i have known a poor man prosecuted by a statute to that degree that all he had left was a little money which he knew not where to hide at last that he might not starve he gives it to his brother who had entertained him the brother after he had his money quarrels with him to get him out of his house and when he desires him to let him have the money lent him gives him this for answer i cannot pay you safely for there is a statute against you which run the poor man to such extremities that he destroyed himself nothing is more frequent than for men who are reduced by miscarriage in trade to compound and set up again and get good estates but a statute as we call it for ever shuts up all doors to the debtors recovery as if breaking were a crime so capital that he ought to be cast out of human society and exposed to extremities worse than death and which will further expose the fruitless severity of this law it is easy to make it appear that all this cruelty to the debtor is so far generally speaking from advantaging the creditors that it destroys the estate consumes it in extravagant charges and unless the debtor be consenting seldom makes any considerable dividends and i am bold to say there is no advantage made by the prosecuting of a statute with severity but what might be doubly made by methods more merciful and though i am not to prescribe to the legislators of the nation yet by way of essay i take leave to give my opinion and my experience in the methods consequences and remedies of this law  all people know who remember any thing of the times when that law was made that the evil it was pointed at was grown very rank and breaking to defraud creditors so much a trade that the parliament had good reason to set up a fury to deal with it and i am far from reflecting on the makers of that law who no question saw twas necessary at that time but as laws though in themselves good are more or less so as they are more or less seasonable squared and adapted to the circumstances and time of the evil they are made against so twere worth while with submission for the same authority to examine   whether the length of time since that act was made has not given opportunity to debtors   to evade the force of the act by ways and shifts to avoid the power of it and secure their estates out of the reach of it   to turn the point of it against those whom it was made to relieve since we see frequently now that bankrupts desire statutes and procure them to be taken out against themselves   whether the extremities of this law are not often carried on beyond the true intent and meaning of the act it self by persons who besides being creditors are also malicious and gratify their private revenge by prosecuting the offender to the ruin of his family   if these two points are to be proved then i am sure twill follow that this act is now a public grievance to the nation and i doubt not but will be one time or other repealed by the same wise authority which made it    time and experience has furnished the debtors with ways and means to evade the force of this statute and to secure their estate against the reach of it which renders it often insignificant and consequently the knave against whom the law was particularly bent gets off while he only who fails of mere necessity and whose honest principle will not permit him to practice those methods is exposed to the fury of this act and as things are now ordered nothing is more easy than for a man to order his estate so that a statute shall have no power over it or at least but a little  if the bankrupt be a merchant no statute can reach his effects beyond the seas so that he has nothing to secure but his books and away he goes into the friars if a shopkeeper he has more difficulty but that is made easy for there are men and carts to be had whose trade it is and who in one night shall remove the greatest warehouse of goods or cellar of wines in the town and carry them off into those nurseries of rogues the mint and friars and our constables and watch who are the allowdmagistrates of the night and who shall stop a poor little lurking thief that it may be has stole a bundle of old clothes worth   s shall let them all pass without any disturbance and fee a hundred honest men robbed of their estates before their faces to the eternal infamy of the justice of the nation  and were a man but to hear the discourse among the inhabitants of those dens of thieves when they first swarm about a new comer to comfort him for they are not all hardened to a like degree at once  well says the first come dont be concerned you have got a good parcel of goods away i promise you you need not value all the world ah would i had done so says another i would a laughed at all my creditors ay says the young proficient in the hardened trade but my creditors damn the creditors says a third why there is such a one and such a one they have creditors too and they will not agree with them and here they live like gentlemen and care not a farthing for them offer your creditors half a crown in the pound and pay it them in old debts and if they will not take it let them alone they will come after you never fear it o but a statute says he again o but the devil cries the minter why it is the statutes we live by say they why if twere not for statutes creditors would comply and debtors would compound and we honest fellows here of the mint would be starved prithee what need you care for a statute a thousand statutes cannot reach you here this is the language of the country and the new comer soon learns to speak it for i think i may say without wronging any man i have known many a man go in among them honest that is without ill design but i never knew one come away so again  then comes a graver sort among this black crew for here as in hell are fiends of degrees and different magnitude and he falls into discourse with the new comer and gives him more solid advice look you sir i am concerned to see you melancholy i am in your circumstance too and if you will accept of it i will give you the best advice i can and so begins the grave discourse  the man is in too much trouble not to want counsel so he thanks him and he goes on send a summons to your creditors and offer them what you can propose in the pound always reserving a good stock to begin the world again which if they will take you are a freeman and better than you were before if they will not take it you know the worst of it you are on the better side of the hedge with them if they will not take it but will proceed to a statute you have nothing to do but to oppose force with force for the laws of nature tell you you must not starve and a statute is so barbarous so unjust so malicious a way of proceeding against a man that i do not think any debtor obliged to consider any thing but his own preservation when once they go on with that  for why says the old studid wretch should the creditors spend your estate in the commission and then demand the debt of you too do you owe any thing to the commission of the statute no says he why then says he i warrant their charges will come to  00 l out of your estate and they must have  0 s a day for starving you and your family i cannot see why any man should think i am bound in conscience to pay the extravagance of other men if my creditors spend  00 l in getting in my estate by a statute which i offered to surrender without it i will reckon that  00 l paid them let them take it among them for equity is due to a bankrupt as well as to any man and if the laws do not give it us we must take it  this is too rational discourse not to please him and he proceeds by this advice the creditors cannot agree but take out a statute and the man that offered at first it may be  0 s in the pound is kept in that cursed place till he has spent it all and can offer nothing and then gets away beyond sea or after a long consumption gets off by an act of relief to poor debtors and all the charges of the statute falls among the creditors thus i knew a statute taken out against a shopkeeper in the country and a considerable parcel of goods too seized and yet the creditors what with charges and two or three suits at law lost their whole debts and   s per pound contributionmoney for charges and the poor debtor like a man under the surgeons hand died in the operation    another evil that time and experience has brought to light from this act is when the debtor himself shall confederate with some particular creditor to take out a statute and this is a masterpiece of plot and intriegue for perhaps some creditor honestly received in the way of trade a large sum of money of the debtor for goods sold him when he was sui juris and he by consent shall own himself a bankrupt before that time and the statute shall reach back to bring in an honest mans estate to help pay a rogues debt or a man shall go and borrow a sum of money upon a parcel of goods and lay them to pledge he keeps the money and the statute shall fetch away the goods to help forward the composition these are tricks i can give too good an account of having more than once suffered by the experiment i could give a scheme of more ways but i think it is needless to prove the necessity of laying aside that law which is pernicious to both debtor and creditor and chiefly hurtful to the honest man who it was made to preserve  the next enquiry is whether the extremities of this law are not often carried on beyond the true intent and meaning of the act it self for malicious and private ends to gratify passion and revenge  i remember the answer a person gave me who had taken out statutes against several persons and some his near relations who had failed in his debt and when i was one time dissuading him from prosecuting a man who owed me money as well as him i used this argument with him you know the man has nothing left to pay that is true says he i know that well enough to what purpose then said i will you prosecute him why revenge is sweet said he  now a man that will prosecute a debtor not as a debtor but by way of revenge such a man is i think not intentionally within the benefit of our law  in order to state the case right there are four sorts of people to be considered in this discourse and the true case is how to distinguish them   there is the honest debtor who fails by visible necessity losses sickness decay of trade or the like   the knavish designing or idle extravagant debtor who fails because either he has run out his estate in excesses or on purpose to cheat and abuse his creditors   there is the moderate creditor who seeks but his own but will omit no lawful means to gain it and yet will hear reasonable and just arguments and proposals   there is the rigorous severe creditor that values not whether the debtor be honest man or knave able or unable but will have his debt whether it be to be had or no without mercy without compassion full of ill language passion and revenge   how to make a law to suit to all these is the case that a necessary favor might be shown to the first in pity and compassion to the unfortunate in commiseration of casualty and poverty which no man is exempt from the danger of that a due rigor and restraint be laid upon the second that villainy and knavery might not be encouraged by a law that a due care be taken of the third that mens estates may as far as can be secured to them and due limits set to the last that no man may have an unlimited power over his fellow subjects to the ruin of both life and estate  all which i humbly conceive might be brought to pass by the following method to which i give the title of  a court of enquiries  this court should consist of a select number of persons to be chosen yearly out of the several wards of the city by the lord mayor and court of aldermen and out of the several inns of court by the lord chancellor or lord keeper for the time being and to consist of to be chosen by the rest and named every year also a president a secretary a treasurer a judge of causes for the proof of debts fifty two citizens out of every ward two of which number to be twelve merchants two lawyers baristers at least out of each of the inns of court   that a commission of enquiry into bankrupts estates be given to these confirmed and settled by act of parliament with power to hear try and determine causes as to proof of debts and disputes in accounts between debtor and creditor without appeal  the office for this court to be at guildhall where clerks should be always attending and a quorum of the commissioners to sit de die in diem from three to six a clock in the afternoon  to this court every man who finds himself pressed by his affairs so that he cannot carry on his business shall apply himself as follows  he shall go to the secretarys office and give in his name with this short petition to the honorable the president and commissioners of his majestys court of enquiries the humble petition of a b of the parish of in the haberdasher shows that your petitioner being unable to carry on his business by reason of great losses and decay of trade and being ready and willing to make a full and entire discovery of his whole estate and to deliver up the same to your honors upon oath as the law directs for the satisfaction of his creditors and having to that purpose entered his name into the books of your office on the  of this instant  your petitioner humbly prays the protection of this honorable court and shall ever pray etc   the secretary is to lay this petition before the commissioners who shall sign it of course and the petitioner shall have an officer sent home with him immediately who shall take possession of his house and goods and an exact inventory of every thing therein shall be taken at his entrance by other officers also appointed by the court according to which inventory the first officer and the bankrupt also shall be accountable  this officer shall supersede even the sheriff in possession excepting by an extent for the king only with this provision  that if the sheriff be in possession by warrant on judgment obtained by due course of law and without fraud or deceit and bona fide in possession before the debtor entered his name in the office in such case the plaintiff to have a double dividend allotted to his debt for it was the fault of the debtor to let execution come upon his goods before he sought for protection but this not to be allowed upon judgment confessed  if the sheriff be in possession by fieri facias for debt immediately due to the king the officer however shall quit his possession to the commissioners and they shall see the kings debt fully satisfied before any division be made to the creditors  the officers in this case to take no fee from the bankrupt nor to use any indecent or uncivil behavior to the family which is a most notorious abuse now permitted to the sheriffs officers whose fees i have known on small executions on pretense of civility amount to as much as the debt and yet behave themselves with unsufferable insolence all the while  this officer being in possession the goods may be removed or not removed the shop shut up or not shut up as the bankrupt upon his reasons given to the commissioners may desire  the inventory being taken the bankrupt shall have fourteen days time and more if desired upon showing good reasons to the commissioners to settle his books and draw up his accounts and then shall deliver up all his books together with a full and true account of his whole estate real and personal to which account he shall make oath and afterward to any particular of it if the commissioners require  after this account given in the commissioners shall have power to examine upon oath all his servants or any other person and if it appears that he has concealed any thing in breach of his oath to punish him as is hereafter specified  upon a fair and just surrender of all his estate and effects bona fide according to the true intent and meaning of the act the commissioners shall return to him in money or such of his goods as he shall choose at a value by a just appraisement   l per cent of all the estate he surrendered to him together with a full and free discharge from all his creditors  the remainder of the estate of the debtor to be fairry and equally divided among the creditors who are to apply themselves to the commissioners the commissioners to make a necessary enquiry into the nature and circumstances of the debts demanded that no pretended debt be claimed for the private account of the debtor in order to which enquiry they shall administer the following oath to the creditor for the proof of the debt  i a b do solemnly swear and attest that the account hereto annexed is true and right and every article therein rightly and truly stated and charged in the names of the persons to whom they belong and that there is no person or name named concealed or alterd in the said account by me or by my knowledge order or consent and that the said  does really and bona fide owe and stand indebted to me for my own proper account the full sum of  mentioned in the said account and that for a fair and just value made good to him as by the said account expressed and also that i have not made or known of any private contract promise or agreement between him the said  or any body for him and me or any person whatsoever  so help me god upon this oath and no circumstances to render the person suspected the creditor shall have an unquestioned right to his dividend which shall be made without the delays and charges that attend the commissions of bankrupts for   the goods of the debtor shall upon the first meeting of the creditors be either sold in parcels as they shall agree or divided among them in due proportion to their debts   what debts are standing out the debtors shall receive summonss from the commissioners to pay by a certain time limited and in the mean time the secretary is to transmit accounts to the persons owing it appointing them a reasonable time to consent or disprove the account   and every six months a just dividend shall be made among the creditors of the money received and so if the effects lie abroad authentic procurations shall be signed by the bankrupt to the commissioners who thereupon correspond with the persons abroad in whose hands such effects are who are to remit the same as the commissioners order the dividend to be made as before every six months or oftener if the court see cause  if any man thinks the bankrupt has so much favor by these articles that those who can dispense with an oath have an opportunity to cheat their creditors and that hereby too much encouragement is given to men to turn bankrupt let them consider the easiness of the discovery the difficulty of a concealment and the penalty on the offender    i would have a reward of  0 per cent be provided to be paid to any person who should make discovery of any part of the bankrupts estate concealed by him which would make discoveries easy and frequent   any person who should claim any debt among the creditors for the account of the bankrupt or his wife or children or with design to relieve them out of it other or more than is bona fide due to him for value received and to be made out or any person who shall receive in trust or by deed of gift any part of the goods or other estate of the bankrupt with design to preserve them for the use of the said bankrupt or his wife or children or with design to conceal them from the creditors shall forfeit for every such act  00 l and have his name published as a cheat and a person not fit to be credited by any man this would make it very difficult for the bankrupt to conceal any thing   the bankrupt having given his name and put the officer into possession shall not remove out of the house any of his books but during the fourteen days time which he shall have to settle the accounts shall every night deliver the books into the hands of the officer and the commissioners shall have liberty if they please to take the books the first day and cause duplicates to be made and then to give them back to the bankrupt to settle the accounts   if it shall appear that the bankrupt has given in a false account has concealed any part of his goods or debts in breach of his oath he shall be set in the pillory at his own door and be imprisoned during life without bail   to prevent the bankrupt concealing any debts abroad it should be enacted that the name of the bankrupt being entered at the office where every man might search gratis should be publication enough and that after such entry no discharge from the bankrupt should be allowed in account to any man but whoever would adventure to pay any money to the said bankrupt or his order should be still debtor to the estate and pay it again to the commissioners and whereas wiser heads than mine must be employed to compose this law if ever it be made they will have time to consider of more ways to secure the estate for the creditors and if possible to tie the hands of the bankrupt yet faster  this law if ever such a happiness should arise to this kingdom would be a present remedy for a multitude of evils which now we feel and which are a sensible detriment to the trade of this nation    with submission i question not but it would prevent a great number of bankrupts which now fall by diverse causes for   it would effectually remove all crafty designed breakings by which many honest men are ruined and   of course twoud prevent the fall of those tradesmen who are forced to break by the knavery of such   it would effectually suppress all those sanctuaries and refuges of thieves the mint friars savoy rules and the like and that these two ways   honest men would have no need of it here being a more safe easy and more honorable way to get out of trouble   knaves should have no protection from those places and the act be fortified against those places by the following clauses which i have on purpose reserved to this head  since the provision this court of enquiries makes for the ease and deliverance of every debtor who is honest is so considerable it is most certain that no man but he who has a design to cheat his creditors will refuse to accept of the favor and therefore it should be enacted  that if any man who is a tradesman or merchant shall break or fail or shut up shop or leave off trade and shall not either pay or secure to his creditors their full and whole debts twenty shillings in the pound without abatement or deduction or shall convey away their books or goods in order to bring their creditors to any composition or shall not apply to this office as aforesaid shall be guilty of felony and upon conviction of the same shall suffer as a felon without benefit of clergy  and if any such person shall take sanctuary either in the mint friars or other pretended priviledgeplace or shall convey thither any of their goods as aforesaid to secure them from their creditors upon complaint thereof made to any of his majestys justices of the peace they shall immediately grant warrants to the constable etc to search for the said persons and goods who shall be aided and assisted by the traindbands if need be without any charge to the creditors to search for and discover the said persons and goods and whoever were aiding in the carrying in the said goods or whoever knowingly received either the goods or the person should be also guilty of felony  for as the indigent debtor is a branch of the commonwealth which deserves its care so the wilful bankrupt is one of the worst sort of thieves and it seems a little unequal that a poor fellow who for mere want steals from his neighbor some trifle shall be sent out of the kingdom and sometimes out of the world while a sort of people who defye justice and violently resist the law shall be suffered to carry mens estates away before their faces and no officers to be found who dare execute the law upon them  any man would be concerned to hear with what scandal and reproach foreigners do speak of the impotence of our constitution in this point that in a civilized government as ours is the strangest contempt of authority is shown that can be instanced in the world  i may be a little the warmer on this head on account that i have been a larger sufferer by such means than ordinary but i appeal to all the world as to the equity of the case what the difference is between having my house broken up in the night to be robbed and a man coming in good credit and with a proffer of ready money in the middle of the day and buying  00 l of goods and carry them directly from my warehouse into the mint and the next day laugh at me and bid me defiance yet this i have seen done i think it is the justest thing in the world that the last should be esteemed the greater thief and deserves most to be hanged  i have seen a creditor come with his wise and children and beg of the debtor only to let him have part of his own goods again which he had bought knowing and designing to break i have seen him with tears and entreaties petition for his own or but some of it and be taunted and swore at and denied by a saucy insolent bankrupt that the poor man has been wholly ruined by the cheat it is by the villainy of such many an honest man is undone families starved and sent a begging and yet no punishment prescribed by our laws for it  by the aforesaid commission of enquiry all this might be most effectually prevented an honest indigent tradesman preserved knavery detected and punished mints friars and privilegeplaces suppressed and without doubt a great number of insolences avoided and prevented of which many more particulars might be insisted upon but i think these may be sufficient to lead any body into the thought and for the method i leave it to the wise heads of the nation who know better than i how to state the law to the circumstances of the crime  of academies we have in england fewer of these than in any part of the world at least where learning is in so much esteem but to make amends the two great seminaries we have are without comparison the greatest i will not say the best in the world and though much might be said here concerning universities in general and foreign academies in particular i content my self with noting that part in which we seem defective the french who justly value themselves upon erecting the most celebrated academy of europe owe the luster of it very much to the great encouragement the kings of france have given to it and one of the members making a speech at his entrance tells you that it is not the least of the glories of their invincible monarch to have engrossed all the learning of the world in that sublime body  the peculiar study of the academy of paris has been to refine and correct their own language which they have done to that happy degree that we see it now spoken in all the courts of christendom as the language allowed to be most universal  i had the honor once to be a member of a small society who seemed to offer at this noble design in england but the greatness of the work and the modesty of the gentlemen concerned prevailed with them to desist an enterprise which appeared too great for private hands to undertake we want indeed a richlieu to commence such a work for i am persuaded were there such a genius in our kingdom to lead the way there would not want capacities who could carry on the work to a glory equal to all that has gone before them the english tongue is a subject not at all less worthy the labor of such a society than the french and capable of a much greater perfection the learned among the french will own that the comprehensiveness of expression is a glory in which the english tongue not only equals but excels its neighbors rapin st evremont and the most eminent french authors have acknowledged it and my lord roscommon who is allowed to be a good judge of english because he wrote it as exactly as any ever did expresses what i mean in these lines for who did ever in french authors see the comprehensive english energy the weighty bullion of one sterling line drawn to french wire would through whole pages shine   and if our neighbors will yield us as their greatest critic has done the preference for sublimity and nobleness of style we will willingly quit all pretensions to their insignificant gaiety  it is great pity that a subject so noble should not have some as noble to attempt it and for a method what greater can be set before us than the academy of paris which to give the french their due stands foremost among all the great attempts in the learned part of the world  the present king of england of whom we have seen the whole world writing panegyricks and encomiums and whom his enemies when their interest does not silence them are apt to say more of than our selves as in the war he has given surprising instances of a greatness of spirit more than common so in peace i dare say with submission he shall never have an opportunity to illustrate his memory more than by such a foundation by which he shall have opportunity to darken the glory of the french king in peace as he has by his daring attempts in the war  nothing but pride loves to be flattered and that only as it is a vice which blinds us to our own imperfections i think princes as particularly unhappy in having their good actions magnified as their evil actions covered but king william who has already won praise by the steps of dangerous virtue seems reserved for some actions which are above the touch of flattery whose praise is in themselves  and such would this be and because i am speaking of a work which seems to be proper only for the hand of the king himself i shall not presume to carry on this chapter to the model as i have done in other subjects only thus far  that a soceiety be erected by the king himself if his majesty thought fit and composed of none but persons of the first figure in learning and twere to be wished our gentry were so much lovers of learning that birth might always be joined with capacity  the work of this society should be to encourage polite learning to polish and refine the english tongue and advance the so much neglected faculty of correct language to establish purity and propriety of style and to purge it from all the irregular additions that ignorance and affectation have introduced and all those innovations in speech if i may call them such which some dogmatic writers have the confidence to foster upon their native language as if their authority were sufficient to make their own fancy legitimate  by such a society i dare say the true glory of our english style would appear and among all the learned part of the world be esteemed as it really is the noblest and most comprehensive of all the vulgar languages in the world  into this society should be admitted none but persons eminent for learning and yet none or but very few whose business or trade was learning for i may be allowed i suppose to say we have seen many great scholars mere learned men and graduates in the last degree of study whose english has been far from polite full of stiffness and affectation hard words and long unusual coupling of syllables and sentences which sound harsh and untuneable to the ear and shock the reader both in expression and understanding  in short there should be room in this society for neither clergyman physician or lawyer not that i would put an affront upon the learning of any of those honorable employments much less upon their persons but if i do think that their several professions do naturally and severally prescribe habits of speech to them peculiar to their practice and prejudicial to the study i speak of i believe i do them no wrong nor do i deny but there may be and now are among some of all those professions men of style and language great masters of english whom few men will undertake to correct and where such do at any time appear their extraordinary merit should find them a place in this society but it should be rare and upon very extraordinary occasisions that such be admitted  i would therefore have this society wholly composed of gentlemen whereof twelve to be of the nobility if possible and twelve private gentlemen and a class of twelve to be left open for mere merit let it be fonnd in who or what sort it would which should lie as the crown of their study who have done something eminent to deserve it the voice of this society should be sufficient authority for the usage of words and sufficient also to expose the innovations of other mens fancies they should preside with a sort of judicature over the learning of the age and have liberty to correct and censure the exorbitance of writers especially of translators the reputation of this society would be enough to make them the allowed judges of style and language and no author would have the impudence to coin without their authority custom which is now our best authority for words would always have its original here and not be allowed without it there should be no more occasion to search for derivations and constructions and twoud be as criminal then to coin words as money  the exercises of this society would be lectures on the english tongue essays on the nature original usage authorities and differences of words on the propriety purity and cadence of style and of the politeness and manner in writing reflections upon irregular usages and corrections of erroneous customs in words and in short every thing that would appear necessary to the bringing our english tongue to a due perfection and our gentlemen to a capacity of writing like themselves to banish pride and pedantry and silence the impudence and impertinence of young authors whose ambition is to be known though it be by their folly  i ask leave here for a thought or two about that inundation custom has made upon our language and discourse by familiar swearing and i place it here because custom has so far prevailed in this foolish vice that a mans discourse is hardly agreeable without it and some have taken upon them to say it is pity it should not be lawful it is such a grace in a mans speech and adds so much vigor to his language  i desire to be understood right and that by swearing i mean all those cursory oaths curses execrations imprecations asseverations and by whatsoever other names they are distinguished which are used in vehemence of discourse in the mouths almost of all men more or less of what sort soever  i am not about to argue any thing of their being sinful and unlawful as forbid by divine rules let the parson alone to tell you that who has no question said as much to as little purpose in this case as in any other but i am of the opinion that there is nothing so impertinent so insignificant so senseless and foolish as our vulgar way of discourse when mixed with oaths and curses and i would only recommend a little consideration to our gentlemen who have sense and wit enough and would be ashamed to speak nonsense in other things but value themselves upon their parts i would but ask them to put into writing the commonplaces of their discourse and read them over again and examine the english the cadence the grammar of them then let them turn them into latin or translate them into any other language and but see what a jargon and confusion of speech they make together  swearing that lewdness of the tongue that scum and excrement of the mouth is of all vices the most foolish and senseless it makes a mans conversation unpleasant his discourse fruitless and his language nonsense  it makes conversation unpleasant at least to those who do not use the same foolish way of discourse and indeed is an affront to all the company who swear not as he does for if i swear and curse in company i either presume all the company likes it or affront them who do not  then it is fruitless for no man is believed a jot the more for all the asseverations damnings and swearings he makes those who are used to it themselves do not believe a man the more because they know they are so customary that they signify little to bind a mans intention and they who practice them not have so mean an opinion of those that do as makes them think they deserve no belief  then they are the spoilers and destroyers of a mans discourse and turn it into perfect nonsense and to make it out i must descend a little to particulars and desire the reader a little to foul his mouth with the brutish sordid senseless expressions which some gentlemen call polite english and speaking with a grace  some part of them indeed though they are foolish enough as effects of a mad inconsiderate rage are yet english as when a man swears he will do this or that and it may be adds god damn him he will that is god damn him if he dont this though it be horrid in another sense yet may be read in writing and is english but what language is this  jack god damn me jack how do do thou little dear son of a whore how have thou done this long time by god  and then they kiss and the the other as lewd as himself goes on  dear tom i am glad to see thee with all my heart let me dye come let us go take a bottle we must not part so prithee let us go and be drunk by god   this is some of our new florid language and the graces and delicacies of style which if it were put into latin i would fain know which is the principal verb  but for a little further remembrance of this impertinence go among the gamesters and there nothing is more frequent than god damn the dice or god damn the bowls  among the sportsmen it is god damn the hounds when they are at a fault or god damn the horse if he bauks a leap they call men sons of bitches and dogs sons of whores and innumerable instances may be given of the like gallantry of language grown now so much a custom  it is true custom is allowed to be our best authority for words and it is fit it should be so but reason must be the judge of sense in language and custom can never prevail over it words indeed like ceremonies in religion may be submitted to the magistrate but sense like the essentials is positive unalterable and cannot be submitted to any jurisdiction it is a law to it self it is ever the same even an act of parliament cannot alter it  words and even usages in style may be altered by custom and proprieties in speech differ according to the several dialects of the country and according to the different manner in which several languages do severally express themselves  but there is a direct signification of words or a cadence in expression which we call speaking sense this like truth is sullen and the same ever was and will be so in what manner and in what language soever it is expressed words without it are only noise which any brute can make as well as we and birds much better for words without sense make but dull music thus a man may speak in words but perfectly unintelligible as to meaning he may talk a great deal but say nothing but it is the proper position of words adapted to their significations which makes them intelligible and conveys the meaning of the speaker to the understanding of the hearer the contrary to which we call nonsense and there is a superfluous crowding in of insignificant words more than are needful to express the thing intended and this is impertinence and that again carried to an extreme is ridiculous  thus when our discourse is interlind with needless oaths curses and long parentheses of imprecations and with some of very indirect signification they become very impertinent and these being run to the extravagant degree instanced in before become perfectly ridiculous and nonsense and without forming it into an argument it appears to be nonsense by the contradictoriness and it appears impertinent by the insignificancy of the expression  after all how little it becomes a gentleman to debauch his mouth with foul language i refer to themselves in a few particulars  this vicious custom has prevailed upon good manners too far but yet there are some degrees to which it is not yet arrived  as first the worst slaves to this folly will neither teach it to nor approve of it in their children some of the most careless will indeed negatively teach it by not reproving them for it but sure no man ever ordered his children to be taught to curse or swear    the grace of swearing has not obtained to be a mode yet among the women god damn ye does not sit well upon a female tongue it seems to be a masculine vice which the women are not arrived to yet and i would only desire those gentlemen who practice it themselves to hear a woman swear it has no music at all there i am sure and just as little does it become any gentleman if he would suffer himself to be judged by all the laws of sense or good manners in the world  it is a senseless foolish ridiculous practice it is a mean to no manner of end it is words spoken which signify nothing it is folly acted for the sake of folly which is a thing even the devil himself dont practice the devil does evil we say but it is for some design either to seduce others or as some divines say from a principle of enmity to his maker men steal for gain and murder to gratify their avarice or revenge whoredoms and ravishments adulteries and sodomy are committed to please a vicious appetite and have always alluring objects and generally all vices have some previous cause and some visible tendency but this of all vicious practices seems the most nonsensical and ridiculous there is neither pleasure nor profit no design pursued no lust gratified but is a mere frenzy of the tongue a vomit of the brain which works by putting a contrary upon the course of nature  again other vices men find some reason or other to give for or excuses to palliate men plead want to extenuate theft and strong provocations to excuse murders and many a lame excuse they will bring for whoring but this sordid habit even those that practice it will own to be a crime and make no excuse for it and the most i could ever hear a man say for it was that he could not help it  besides as it is an inexcusable impertinence so it is a breach upon good manners and conversation for a man to impose the clamor of his oaths upon the company he converses with if there be any one person in the company that does not approve the way it is an imposing upon him with a freedom beyond civility as if a man should fart before a justice or talk bawdy before the queen or the like  to suppress this laws acts of parliaments and proclamations are bawbles and banters the laughter of the lewd party and never had as i could perceive any influence upon the practice nor are any of our magistrates fond or forward of putting them in execution  it must be example not penalties must sink this crime and if the gentlemen of england would once drop it as a mode the vice is so foolish and ridiculous in it self twoud soon grow odious and out of fashion  this work such an academy might begin and i believe nothing would so soon explode the practice as the public discouragement of it by such a society where all our customs and habits both in speech and behavior should receive an authority all the disputes about precedence of wit with the manners customs and usages of the theater would be decided here plays should pass here before they were acted and the critics might give their censures and damn at their pleasure nothing would ever dye which once received life at this original the two theaters might end their jangle and dispute for priority no more wit and real worth should decide the controversy and here should be the infallible judge  the strife would then be only to do well and he alone be crowned who did excel ye called them whigs who from the church withdrew but now we have our stagedissenters too who scruple ceremonies of pit and box and very few are sound and orthodox but love disorder so and are so nice they hate conformity though it is in vice some are for patenthierarchy and some like the old gauls seek out for elbowroom their arbitrary governors disown and build a conventiclestage of their own phanatick beaus make up the gaudy show and wit alone appears incognito wit and religion suffer equal fate neglect of both attends the warm debate for while the parties strive and countermine wit will as well as piety decline next to this which i esteem as the most noble and most useful proposal in this book i proceed to academies for military studies and because i design rather to express my meaning than make a large book i bring them all into one chapter  i allow the war is the best academy in the world where men study by necessity and practice by force and both to some purpose with duty in the action and a reward in the end and it is evident to any man who knows the world or has made any observations on things what an improvement the english nation has made during this seven years war  but should you ask how dear it first cost and what a condition england was in for a war at first on this account how almost all our engineers and great officers were foreigners it may put us in mind how necessary it is to have our people so practiced in the arts of war that they may not be novices when they come to the experiment  i have heard some who were no great friends to the government take advantage to reflect upon the king in the beginning of his wars in ireland that he did not care to trust the english but all his great officers his generals and engineers were foreigners and though the case was so plain as to need no answer and the persons such as deserved none yet this must be observed though it was very strange that when the present king took possession of this kingdom and seeing himself entering upon the bloodiest war this age has known began to regulate his army he found but very few among the whole martial part of the nation fit to make use of for general officers and was forced to employ strangers and make them englishmen as the counts schomberg ginkel solms ruvigny and others and yet it is to be observed also that all the encouragement imaginable was given to the english gentlemen to qualify themselves by giving no less than sixteen regiments to gentlemen of good families who had never been in any service and knew but very little how to command them of these several are now in the army and have the rewards suitable to their merit being majorgenerals brigadeers and the like  if then a long peace had so reduced us to a degree of ignorance that might have been dangerous to us had we not a king who is always followed by the greatest masters in the world who knows what peace and different governors may bring us to again  the manner of making war differs perhaps as much as any thing in the world and if we look no further back than our civil wars it is plain a general then would hardly be fit to be a colonel now saving his capacity of improvement the defensive art always follows the offensive and though the latter has extremely got the start of the former in this age yet the other is mightily improving also  we saw in england a bloody civil war where according to the old temper of the english fighting was the business to have an army lying in such a post as not to be able to come at them was a thing never heard of in that war even the weakest party would always come out and fight dunbar fight for instance and they that were beaten to day would fight again to morrow and seek one another out with such eagerness as if they had been in haste to have their brains knocked out encampments intrenchments batteries countermarchings fortifying of camps and cannonadings were strange and almost unknown things and whole campaigns were past over and hardly any tents made use of battles surprises storming of towns skirmishes sieges ambuscades and beating up quarters was the news of every day now it is frequent to have armies of fifty thousand men of a side stand at bay within view of one another and spend a whole campaign in dodging or as it is genteely called observing one another and then march off into winter quarters the difference is in the maxims of war which now differ as much from what they were formerly as long perukes do from piqued beards or as the habits of the people do now from what they then wore the present maxims of the war are never fight without a manifest advantage and always encamp so as not to be forced to it and if two opposite generals nicely observe both these rules it is impossible they should ever come to fight  i grant that this way of making war spends generally more money and less blood than former wars did but then it spins wars out to a greater length and i almost question whether if this had been the way of fighting of old our civil war had not lasted till this day their maxim was wherever you meet your enemy fight him  but the case is quite different now and i think it is plain in the present war that it is not he who has the longest sword so much as he who has the longest purse will hold the war out best europe is all engaged in the war and the men will never be exhausted while either party can find money but he who finds himself poorest must give out first and this is evident in the french king who now inclines to peace and owns it while at the same time his armies are numerous and whole but the sinews fail he finds his exchequer fail his kingdom drained and money hard to come at not that i believe half the reports we have had of the misery and poverty of the french are true but it is manifest the king of france finds whatever his armies may do his money will not hold out so long as the confederates and therefore he uses all the means possible to procure a peace while he may do it with the most advantage  there is no question but the french may hold the war out several years longer but their king is too wise to let things run to extremity he will rather condescend to peace upon hard terms now than stay longer if he finds himself in danger to be forced to worse  this being the only digression i design to be guilty of i hope i shall be excused it  the sum of all is this that since it is so necessary to be in a condition for war in a time of peace our people should be inured to it it is strange that every thing should be ready but the soldier ships are ready and our trade keeps the seamen always taught and breeds up more but soldiers horsemen engineers gunners and the like must be bred and taught men are not born with muskets on their shoulders nor fortifications in their heads it is not natural to shoot bombs and undermine towns for which purpose i propose  a royal academy for military exercises  the founder the king himself the charge to be paid by the public and settled by a revenue from the crown to be paid yearly  i propose this to consist of four parts   a college for breeding up of artists in the useful practice of all military exercises the scholars to be taken in young and be maintained and afterward under the kings care for preferment as their merit and his majestys favor shall recommend them from whence his majesty would at all times be furnished with able engineers gunners firemasters bombardiers miners and the like the second college for voluntary students in the same exercises who should all upon certain limited conditions be entertained and have all the advantages of the lectures experiments and learning of the college and be also capable of several titles profits and settlements in the said college answerable to the fellows in the universities the third college for temporary study into which any person who is a gentleman and an englishman entering his name and conforming to the orders of the house shall be entertained like a gentleman for one whole year gratis and taught by masters appointed out of the second college the fourth college of schools only where all persons whatsoever for a small allowance shall be taught and entered in all the particular exercises they desire and this to be supplied by the proficients of the first college   i could lay out the dimensions and necessary incidents of all this work but since the method of such a foundation is easy and regular from the model of other colleges i shall only state the economy of the house  the building must be very large and should rather be stately and magnificent in figure than gay and costly in ornament and i think such a house as chelseacollege only about four times as big would answer it and yet i believe might be finished for as little charge as has been laid out in that palacelike hospital  the first college should consist of one general five colonels twenty captains  being such as graduates by preferment at first named by the founder and after the first settlement to be chosen out of the first or second college with apartments in the college and salaries  the general  00 l per ann the colonels  00 the captains  0   000 scholars among whom shall be the following degrees governors  00 allowed  0 l per an directors  00   exempts  00   proficients  00 juniors  000  the general to be named by the founder out of the colonels the colonels to be named by the general out of the captains the captains out of the governors the governors from the directors and the directors from the exempts and so on  the juniors to be divided into ten schools the schools to be thus governed every school has  00 juniors in  0 classes every class to have   directors  00 classes of juniors is  000 each class   directors  00   00  the proficients to be divided into five schools every school to have  0 classes of  0 each every class   governors  0 classes of proficients is  00 each class   governors is  00  00  the exempts to be supernumerary having a small allowance and maintained in the college till preferment offer  the second college to consist of voluntary students to be taken in after a certain degree of learning from among the proficients of the first or from any other schools after such and such limitations of learning who study at their own charge being allowed certain privileges as chambers rentfree on condition of residence commons gratis for certain fixed terms preferment on condition of a term of years residence use of libraries instruments and lectures of the college   this college should have the following preferments with salaries a governor  00 l per ann a president  00  0 collegemajors  0  00 proficients  0  00 voluntary students without allowance  the third and fourth colleges consisting only of schools for temporarary study may be thus  the third being for gentlemen to learn the necessary arts and exercises to qualify them for the service of their country and entertaining them one whole year at the public charge may be supposed to have always one thousand persons on its hands and cannot have less than  00 teachers who i would thus order  every teacher shall continue at least one year but by allowance two years at most shall have  0 l per ann extraordinary allowance shall be bound to give their constant attendance and shall have always   collegemajors of the second college to supervise them who shall command a month and then be succeeded by   others and so on  0 l per ann extraordinary to be paid them for their attendance  the gentlemen who practice to be put to no manner of charge but to be obliged strictly to the following articles   to constant residence not to lie out of the house without leave of the collegemajor   to perform all the collegeexercises as appointed by the masters without dispute   to submit to the orders of the house   to quarrel or give ill language should be a crime to be punished by way of fine only the collegemajor to be judge and the offender be put into custody till he ask pardon of the person wronged by which means every gentleman who has been affronted has sufficient satisfaction  but to strike challenge draw or fight should be more severely punished the offender to be declared no gentleman his name posted up at the collegegate his person expelled the house and to be pumped as a rake if ever he is taken within the collegewalls  the teachers of this college to be chosen one half out of the exempts of the first college and the other out of the proficients of the second  the fourth college being only of schools will be neither chargeable nor troublesome but may consist of as many as shall offer themselves to be taught and supplied with teachers from the other schools  the proposal being of so large an extent must have a proportionable settlement for its maintenance and the benefit being to the whole kingdom the charge will naturally lie upon the public and cannot well be less considering the number of persons to be maintained than as follows  first college l per an the general  00   colonels at  00 l per ann each  00  0 captains at  0   00  00 governors at  0  000  00 directors at    000  00 exempts at    000  000 heads for subsistence at  0 l per head per ann including provision and all the officers salaries in the house as butlers cooks purveyors nurses maids laundresses stewards clerks servants chaplains porters and attendants which are numerous  0000 second college a governor  00 a president  00  0 collegemajors at  0 l per an   00  00 proficients at  0 l  000 commons for  00 students during times of exercises at   l per an each   00  00 proficients subsistence reckoning as above  000 third college the gentlemen here are maintained as gentlemen and are to have good tables who shall therefore have an allowance at the rate of    l per head all officers to be maintained out of it which is   000  00 teachers salary and subsistence ditto   00  0 collegemajors at  0 l per ann is  00 annual charge    00 l the building to cost  0000 furniture beds tables chairs linen etc  0000 books instruments and utensils for experiments  000 so the immediate charge would be   000 l per an the annual charge    00 to which add the charges of exercises and experiments   00  0000  the kings magazines to furnish them with  00 barrels of gunpowder per an for the public uses of exercises and experiments  in the first of these colleges should remain the governingpart and all the preferments be made from thence to be supplied in course from the other the general of the first to give orders to the other and be subject only to the founder  the government should be all military with a constitution for the same regulated for that purpose and a council to hear and determine the differences and trespasses by the collegelaws  the public exercises likewise military and all the schools be disciplined under proper officers who are so in turn or by order of the general and continue but for the day  the several classes to perform several studies and but one study to a distinct class and the persons as they remove from one study to another to change their classes but so as that in the general exercises all the scholars may be qualified to act all the several parts as they may be ordered  the proper studies of this college should be the following geometry astronomy history navigation decimal arithmetic trigonometry dialing gauging mining fireworking bombarding gunnery fortification encamping entrenching approaching attacking delineation architecture surveying and all arts or sciences appendixes to such as these  with exercises for the body to which all should be obliged as their genius and capacities led them as   swimming which no soldier and indeed no man whatever ought to be without   handling all sorts of firearms   marching and countermarching in form   fencing and the long staff   riding and managing or horsemanship   running leaping and wrestling   and herewith should also be preserved and carefully taught all the customs usages terms of war and terms of art used in sieges marches of armies and encampments that so a gentleman taught in this college should be no novice when he comes into the kings armies though he has seen no service abroad i remember the story of an english gentleman an officer at the siege of limerick in ireland who though he was brave enough upon action yet for the only matter of being ignorant in the terms of art and knowing not how to talk camplanguage was exposed to be laughed at by the whole army for mistaking the opening of the trenches which he thought had been a mine against the town  the experiments of these colleges would be as well worth publishing as the acts of the royal society to which purpose the house must be built where they may have ground to cast bombs to raise regular works as batteries bastions halfmoons redoubts hornworks forts and the like with the convenience of water to draw round such works to exercise the engineers in all the necessary experiments of dreining and mining under ditches there must be room to fire great shot at a distance to canonade a camp to throw all sorts of fireworks and machines that are or shall be invented to open trenches form camps etc  their public exercises will be also very diverting and more worth while for any gentlemen to see than the sights or shows which our people in england are so fond of  i believe as a constitution might be formed from these generals this would be the greatest the gallantest and the most useful foundation in the world the english gentry would be the best qualified and consequently best accepted abroad and most useful at home of any people in the world and his majesty should never more be exposed to the necessity of employing foreigners in the posts of trust and service in his armies  and that the whole kingdom might in some degree be better qualified for service i think the following project would be very useful  when our military weapon was the longbow at which our english nation in some measure excelled the whole world the meanest countreyman was a good archer and that which qualified them so much for service in the war was their diversion in times of peace which also had this good effect that when an army was to be raised they needed no disciplining and for the encouragement of the people to an exercise so publicly profitable an act of parliament was made to oblige every parish to maintain buts for the youth in the country to shoot at  since our way of fighting is now altered and this destructive engine the musket is the proper arms for the soldier i could wish the diversion also of the english would change too that our pleasures and profit might correspond it is a great hindrance to this nation especially where standingarmies are a grievance that if ever a war commence men must have at least a year before they are thought fit to face an enemy to instruct them how to handle their arms and newraised men are called raw soldiers to help this at least in some measure i would propose that the public exercises of our youth should by some public encouragement  for penalties will not do it be drawn off from the foolish boyish sports of cocking and cricketing and from tippling to shooting with a firelock an exercise as pleasant as it is manly and generous and swimming which is a thing so many ways profitable besides its being a great preservative of health that methinks no man ought to be without it    for shooting the colleges i have mentioned above having provided for the instructing the gentry at the kings charge the gentry in return of that favor should introduce it among the countreypeople which might easily be done thus  if every countreygentleman according to his degree would contribute to set up a prize to be shot for by the town he lives in or the neighborhood about once a year or twice a year or oftener as they think fit which prize not single only to him who shoots nearest but according to the custom of shooting  this would certainly set all the young men in england a shooting and make them marksmen for they would be always practicing and making matches among themselves too and the advantage would be found in a war for no doubt if all the soldiers in a battalion took a true level at their enemy there would be much more execution done at a distance than there is whereas it has been known now that a battalion of men has received the fire of another battalion and not lost above  0 or  0 men and i suppose it will not easily be forgot how at the battle of agrim a battalion of the english army received the whole fire of an irish regiment of dragoons but never knew to this day whether they had any bullets or no and i need appeal no further than to any officer that served in the irish war what advantages the english armies made of the irish being such wonderful marksmen  under this head of academies i might bring in a project for  an academy for women  i have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs in the world considering us as a civilized and a christian country that we deny the advantages of learning to women we reproach the sex every day with folly and impertinence while i am confident had they the advantages of education equal to us they would be guilty of less than our selves  one would wonder indeed how it should happen that women are conversible at all since they are only beholding to natural parts for all their knowledge their youth is spent to teach them to stitch and sow or make bawbles they are taught to read indeed and perhaps to write their names or so and that is the height of a womans education and i would but ask any who slight the sex for their understanding what is a man a gentleman i mean good for that is taught no more  i need not give instances or examine the character of a gentleman with a good estate and of a good family and with tolerable parts and examine what figure he makes for want of education  the soul is placed in the body like a rough diamond and must be polished or the luster of it will never appear and it is manifest that as the rational soul distinguishes us from brutes so education carries on the distinction and makes some less brutish than others this is too evident to need any demonstration but why then should women be denied the benefit of instruction if knowledge and understanding had been useless additions to the sex god almighty would never have given them capacities for he made nothing needless besides i would ask such what they can see in ignorance that they should think it a necessary ornament to a woman or how much worse is a wise woman than a fool or what has the woman done to forfeit the privilege of being taught does she plague us with her pride and impertinence why did we not let her learn that she might have had more wit shall we upbraid women with folly when it is only the error of this inhuman custom that hindered them being made wiser  the capacities of women are supposed to be greater and their senses quicker than those of the men and what they might be capable of being bred to is plain from some instances of femalewit which this age is not without which upbraids us with injustice and looks as if we denied women the advantages of education for fear they should vye with the men in their improvements  to remove this objection and that women might have at least a needful opportunity of education in all sorts of useful learning i propose the draught of an academy for that purpose  i know it is dangerous to make public appearances of the sex they are not either to be confined or exposed the first will disagree with their inclinations and the last with their reputations and therefore it is somewhat difficult and i doubt a method proposed by an ingenious lady in a little book called advice to the ladies would be found impracticable for saving my respect to the sex the levity which perhaps is a little peculiar to them at least in their youth will not bear the restraint and i am satisfied nothing but the height of bigotry can keep up a nunnery women are extravagantly desirous of going to heaven and will punish their pretty bodies to get thither but nothing else will do it and even in that case sometimes it falls out that nature will prevail  when i talk therefore of an academy for women i mean both the model the teaching and the government different from what is proposed by that ingenious lady for whose proposal i have a very great esteem and also a great opinion of her wit different too from all sorts of religious confinement and above all from vows of celibacy  wherefore the academy i propose should differ but little from public schools wherein such ladies as were willing to study should have all the advantages of learning suitable to their genius  but since some severities of discipline more than ordinary would be absolutely necessary to preserve the reputation of the house that persons of quality and fortune might not be a fraid to venture their children thither i shall venture to make a small scheme by way of essay  the house i would have built in a form by it self as well as in a place by it self  the building should be of three plain fronts without any jettings or bearingwork that the eye might at a glance see from one coin to the other the gardens walled in the same triangular figure with a large moat and but one entrance  when thus every part of the situation was contrived as well as might be for discovery and to render intrieguing dangerous i would have no guards no eyes no spies set over the ladies but shall expect them to be tried by the principles of honor and strict virtue  and if i am asked why i must ask pardon of my own sex for giving this reason for it  i am so much in charity with women and so well acquainted with men that it is my opinion there needs no other care to prevent intrieguing than to keep the men effectually away for though inclination which we prettily call love does sometimes move a little too visibly in the sex and frailty often follows yet i think verily custom which we miscall modesty has so far the ascendant over the sex that solicitation always goes before it  custom with women stead of virtue rules it leads the wisest and commands the fools for this alone when inclinations reign though virtues fled will acts of vice restrain only by custom it is that virtue lives and love requires to be asked before it gives for that which we call modesty is pride they scorn to ask and hate to be denied it is custom thus prevails upon their want they will never beg what asked they easily grant and when the needless ceremonys over themselves the weakness of the sex discover if then desires are strong and nature free keep from her men and opportunity else twill be vain to curb her by restraint but keep the question off you keep the saint in short let a woman have never such a comingprinciple she will let you ask before she complies at least if she be a woman of any honor  upon this ground i am persuaded such measures might be taken that the ladies might have all the freedom in the world within their own walls and yet no intrieguing no indecencies nor scandalous affairs happen and in order to this the following customs and laws should be observed in the colleges of which i would propose one at least in every county in england and about ten for the city of london  after the regulation of the form of the building as before   all the ladies who enter into the house should set their hands to the orders of the house to signify their consent to submit to them   as no woman should be received but who declared her self willing and that it was the act of her choice to enter her self so no person should be confined to continue there a moment longer than the same voluntary choice inclined her   the charges of the house being to be paid by the ladies every one that entered should have only this encumbrance that she should pay for the whole year though her mind should change as to her continuance   an act of parliament should make it felony without clergy for any man to enter by force or fraud into the house or to solicit any woman though it were to marry while she was in the house and this law would by no means be severe because any woman who was willing to receive the addresses of a man might discharge her self of the house when she pleased and on the contrary any woman who had occasion might discharge her self of the impertinent addresses of any person she had an aversion to by entering into the house   in this house  the persons who enter should be taught all sorts of breeding suitable to both their genius and their quality and in particular music and dancing which it would be cruelty to bar the sex of because they are their darlings but besides this they should be taught languages as particularly french and italian and i would venture the injury of giving a woman more tongues than one  they should as a particular study be taught all the graces of speech and all the necessary air of conversation which our common education is so defective in that i need not expose it they should be brought to read books and especially history and so to read as to make them understand the world and be able to know and judge of things when they hear of them  to such whose genius would lead them to it i would deny no sort of learning but the chief thing in general is to cultivate the understandings of the sex that they may be capable of all sorts of conversation that their parts and judgments being improved they may be as profitable in their conversation as they are pleasant  women in my observation have little or no difference in them but as they are or are not distinguished by education tempers indeed may in some degree influence them but the main distinguishing part is their breeding  the whole sex are generally quick and sharp i believe i may be allowed to say generally so for you rarely see them lumpish and heavy when they are children as boys will often be if a woman be wellbred and taught the proper management of her natural wit she proves generally very sensible and retentive and without partiality a woman of sense and manners is the finest and most delicate part of gods creation the glory of her maker and the great instance of his singular regard to man his darling creature to whom he gave the best gift either god could bestow or man receive and it is the sordidst piece of folly and ingratitude in the world to withhold from the sex the due luster which the advantages of education gives to the natural beauty of their minds  a woman well bred and well taught furnished with the additional accomplishments of knowledge and behavior is a creature without comparison her society is the emblem of sublimer enjoyments her person is angelick and her conversation heavenly she is all softness and sweetness peace love wit and delight she is every way suitable to the sublimest wish and the man that has such a one to his portion has nothing to do but to rejoice in her and be thankful  on the other hand suppose her to be the very same woman and rob her of the benefit of education and it follows thus  if her temper be good want of education makes her soft and easy  her wit for want of teaching makes her impertinent and talkative  her knowledge for want of judgment and experience makes her fanciful and whimsical  if her temper be bad want of breeding makes her worse and she grows haughty insolent and loud  if she be passionate want of manners makes her termagant and a scold which is much at one with lunatic  if she be proud want of discretion which still is breeding makes her conceited fantastic and ridiculous  and from these she degenerates to be turbulent clamorous noisy nasty and the devil  methinks mankind for their own sakes since say what we will of the women we all think fit one time or other to be concerned with em should take some care to breed them up to be suitable and serviceable if they expected no such thing as delight from em bless us what care do we take to breed up a good horse and to break him well and what a value do we put upon him when it is done and all because he should be fit for our use and why not a woman since all her ornaments and beauty without suitable behavior is a cheat in nature like the false tradesman who puts the best of his goods uppermost that the buyer may think the rest are of the same goodness  beauty of the body which is the womens glory seems to be now unequally bestowed and nature or rather providence to lie under some scandal about it as if twas given a woman for a snare to men and so make a kind of a shedevil of her because they say exquisite beauty is rarely given with wit more rarely with goodness of temper and never at all with modesty and some pretending to justify the equity of such a distribution will tell us it is the effect of the justice of providence in dividing particular excellencies among all his creatures share and share alike as it were that all might for something or other be acceptable to one another else some would be despised  i think both these notions false and yet the last which has the show of respect to providence is the worst for it supposes providence to be indigent and empty as if it had not wherewith to furnish all the creatures it had made but was fain to be parcimonious in its gifts and distribute them by piecemeal for fear of being exhausted  if i might venture my opinion against an almost universal notion i would say most men mistake the proceedings of providence in this case and all the world at this day are mistaken in their practice about it and because the assertion is very bold i desire to explain my self  that almighty first cause which made us all is certainly the fountain of excellence as it is of being and by an invisible influence could have diffused equal qualities and perfections to all the creatures it has made as the sun does its light without the least ebb or diminution to himself and has given indeed to every individual sufficient to the figure his providence had designed him in the world  i believe it might be defended if i should say that i do suppose god has given to all mankind equal gifts and capacities in that he has given them all souls equally capable and that the whole difference in mankind proceeds either from accidental difference in the make of their bodies or from the foolish difference of education    from accidental difference in bodies i would avoid discoursing here of the philosophical position of the soul in the body but if it be true as philosophers do affirm that the understanding and memory is dilated or contracted according to the accidental dimensions of the organ through which it is conveyed then though god has given a soul as capable to me as another yet if i have any natural defect in those parts of the body by which the soul should act i may have the same soul infused as another man and yet he be a wise man and i a very fool for example if a child naturally have a defect in the organ of hearing so that he could never distinguish any sound that child shall never be able to speak or read though it have a soul capable of all the accomplishments in the world the brain is the center of the souls actings where all the distinguishing faculties of it reside and it is observable a man who has a narrow contracted head in which there is not room for the due and necessary operations of nature by the brain is never a man of very great judgment and that proverb a great head and little wit is not meant by nature but is a reproof upon sloth as if one should by way of wonder say fie fie you that have a great head have but little wit that is strange that must certainly be your own fault from this notion i do believe there is a great matter in the breed of men and women not that wise men shall always get wise children but i believe strong and healthy bodies have the wisest children and sickly weakly bodies affect the wits as well as the bodies of their children we are easily persuaded to believe this in the breeds of horses cocks dogs and other creatures and i believe it is as visible in men  but to come closer to the business the great distinguishing difference which is seen in the world between men and women is in their education and this is manifested by comparing it with the difference between one man or woman and another  and herein it is that i take upon me to make such a bold assertion that all the world are mistaken in their practice about women for i cannot think that god almighty ever made them so delicate so glorious creatures and furnished them with such charms so agreeable and so delightful to mankind with souls capable of the same accomplishments with men and all to be only stewards of our houses cooks and slaves  not that i am for exalting the female government in the least but in short i would have men take women for companions and educate them to be fit for it a woman of sense and breeding will scorn as much to encroach upon the prerogative of the man as a man of sense will scorn to oppress the weakness of the woman but if the womens souls were refined and improved by teaching that word would be lost to say the weakness of the sex as to judgment would be nonsense for ignorance and folly would be no more to be found among women than men i remember a passage which i heard from a very fine woman she had wit and capacity enough an extraordinary shape and face and a great fortune but had been cloistered up all her time and for fear of being stolln had not had the liberty of being taught the common necessary knowledge of womens affairs and when she came to converse in the world her natural wit made her so sensible of the want of education that she gave this short reflection on her self  i am ashamed to talk with my very maids says she for i dont know when they do right or wrong i had more need go to school than be married  i need not enlarge on the loss the defect of education is to the sex nor argue the benefit of the contrary practice it is a thing will be more easily granted than remedied this chapter is but an essay at the thing and i refer the practice to those happy days if ever they shall be when men shall be wise enough to mend it  of a courtmerchant i ask pardon of the learned gentlemen of the long robe if i do em any wrong in this chapter having no design to affront em when i say that in matters of debate among merchants when they come to be argued by lawyers at the bar they are strangely handled i my self have heard very famous lawyers make sorry work of a cause between the merchant and his factor and when they come to argue about exchanges discounts protests demorages charterparties fraights portcharges assurances barratries bottomries accounts current accounts in commission and accounts in company and the like the solicitor has not been able to draw a brief nor the council to understand it never was young parson more put to it to make out his text when he is got into the pulpit without his notes than i have seen a council at the bar when he would make out a cause between two merchants and i remember a pretty history of a particular case by way of instance when two merchants contending about a long factorageaccount that had all the niceties of merchandising in it and laboring on both sides to instruct their council and to put them in when they were out at last they found them make such ridiculous stuff off it that they both threw up the cause and agreed to a reference which reference in one week without any charge ended all the dispute which they had spent a great deal of money in before to no purpose  nay the very judges themselves no reflection upon their learning have been very much at a loss in giving instructions to a jury and juries much more to understand them for when all is done juries which are not always nor often indeed of the wisest men are to be sure ill umpires in causes so nice that the very lawyer and judge can hardly understand them  the affairs of merchants are accompanied with such variety of circumstances such new and unusual contingences which change and differ in every age with a multitude of niceties and punctilios and those again altering as the customs and usages of countries and states do alter that it has been found impracticable to make any laws that could extend to all cases and our law it self does tacitly acknowledge its own imperfection in this case by allowing the custom of merchants to pass as a kind of law in cases of difficulty  wherefore it seems to me a most natural proceeding that such affairs should be heard before and judged by such as by known experience and long practice in the customs and usages of foreign negoce are of course the most capable to determine the same  besides the reasonableness of the argument there are some cases in our laws in which it is impossible for a plaintiff to make out his case or a defendant to make out his plea as in particular when his proofs are beyond seas for no protests certifications or procurations are allowed in our courts as evidence and the damages are infinite and irretrievable by any of the proceedings of our laws  for the answering all these circumstances a court might be erected by authority of parliament to be composed of six judges commissioners who should have power to hear and decide as a court of equity under the title of a courtmerchant  the proceedings of this court should be short the trials speedy the fees easy that every man might have immediate remedy where wrong is done for in trials at law about merchants affairs the circumstances of the case are often such as the long proceedings of courts of equity are more pernicious than in other cases because the matters to which they are generally relating are under greater contingences than in other cases as effects in hands abroad which want orders ships and seamen lying at demoreage and in pay and the like  these six judges should be chosen of the most eminent merchants of the kingdom to reside in london and to have power by commission to summon a council of merchants who should decide all cases on the hearing of both parties with appeal to the said judges  also to delegate by commission petty councils of merchants in the most considerable ports of the kingdom for the same purpose  the six judges themselves to be only judges of appeal all trials to be heard before the council of merchants by methods and proceedings singular and concise  the council to be sworn to do justice and to be chosen annually out of the principal merchants of the city  the proceedings here should be without delay the plaintiff to exhibit his grievance by way of brief and the defendant to give in his answer and a time of hearing to be appointed immediately  the defendant by motion shall have liberty to put off hearing upon showing good cause not otherwise  at hearing every man to argue his own cause if he pleases or introduce any person to do it for him  attestations and protests from foreign parts regularly procured and authentickly signified in due form to pass in evidence affidavits in due form likewise attested and done before proper magistrates within the kings dominions to be allowed as evidence  the party grieved may appeal to the six judges before whom they shall plead by council and from their judgment to have no appeal  by this method infinite controversies would be avoided and disputes amicably ended a multitude of present inconveniences avoided and merchandizingmatters would in a merchantlike manner be decided by the known customs and methods of trade  of seamen it is observable that whenever this kingdom is engaged in a war with any of its neighbors two great inconveniences constantly follow one to the king and one to trade    that to the king is that he is forced to press seamen for the manning of his navy and force them involuntarily into the service which way of violent dragging men into the fleet is attended with sundry ill circumstances as   our naval preparations are retarded and our fleets always late for want of men which has exposed them not a little and been the ruin of many a good and welllaid expedition   several irregularities follow as the officers taking money to dismiss able seamen and filling up their complement with raw and improper persons   oppressions quarrelings and oftentimes murders by the rashness of pressmasters and the obstinacy of some unwilling to go   a secret aversion to the service from a natural principle common to the english nation to hate compulsion   kidnapping people out of the kingdom robbing houses and picking pockets frequently practiced under pretense of pressing as has been very much used of late with various abuses of the like nature some to the king and some to the subject    to trade by the extravagant price set on wages for seamen which they impose on the merchant with a sort of authority and he is obliged to give by reason of the scarcity of men and that not from a real want of men for in the height of a press if a merchantman wanted men and could get a protection for them he might have any number immediately and none without it so shye were they of the public service  the first of these things has cost the king above three millions sterling since the war in these three particulars   charge of pressing on sea and on shore and in small craft employed for that purpose   ships lying in harbor for want of men at a vast charge of pay and victuals for those they had   keeping the whole navy in constant pay and provisions all the winter for fear of losing the men against summer which has now been done several years besides bountymoney and other expenses to court and oblige the seamen   the second of these viz the great wages paid by the merchant has cost trade since the war above twenty millions sterling the coaltrade gives a specimen of it who for the first three years of the war gave   l a voyage to common seamen who before sailed for    s which computing the number of ships and men used in the coaltrade and of voyages made at   hands to a vessel does modestly accounting make    000 l difference in one year in wages to seamen in the coaltrade only  for other voyages the difference of sailors wages is  0 s per month and    s per month to foremastmen who before went for    s per month besides subjecting the merchant to the insolence of the seamen who are not now to be pleased with any provisions will admit no halfpay and command of the captains even what they please nay the king himself can hardly please them  for cure of these inconveniences it is the following project is proposed with which the seamen can have no reason to be dissatisfied nor are not at all injured and yet the damage sustained will be prevented and an immense sum of money spared which is now squandered away by the profuseness and luxury of the seamen for if prodigality weakens the public wealth of the kingdom in general then are the seamen but ill commonwealthsmen who are not visibly the richer for the prodigious sums of money paid them either by the king or the merchant  the project is this  that by an act of parliament an office or court be erected within the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty and subject to the lord high admiral or otherwise independent and subject only to a parliamentary authority as the commission for taking and stating the public accounts  in this court or office or the several branches of it which to that end shall be subdivided and placed in every seaport in the kingdom shall be listed and entered into immediate pay all the seamen in the kingdom who shall be divided into colleges or chambers of sundry degrees suitable to their several capacities with pay in proportion to their qualities as boys youths servants men able and raw midshipmen officers pilots old men and pensioners  the circumstantials of this office   no captain or master of any ship or vessel should dare to hire or carry to sea with him any seaman but such as he shall receive from the office aforesaid   no man whatsoever seaman or other but applying himself to the said office to be employed as a sailor should immediately enter into pay and receive for every able seaman    s per month and juniors in proportion to receive halfpay while unemployd and liberty to work for themselves only to be at call of the office and leave an account where to be found   no sailor could desert because no employment would be to be had elsewhere   all ships at their clearing at the customhouse should receive a ticket to the office for men where would be always choice rather than scarcity who should be delivered over by the office to the captain or master without any trouble or delay all liberty of choice to be allowed both to master and men only so as to give up all disputes to the officers appointed to decide note by this would be avoided the great charge captains and owners are at to keep men on board before they are ready to go whereas now the care of getting men will be over and all come on board in one day for the captain carrying the ticket to the office he may go and choose his men if he will otherwise they will be sent on board him by tickets sent to their dwellings to repair on board such a ship    for all these men that the captain or master of the ship takes he shall pay the office not the seamen    s per month which   s per month overplus of wages will be employed to pay the halfpay to the men out of employ and so in proportion of wages for juniors   all disputes concerning the mutinying of mariners or other matters of debate between the captains and men to be tried by way of appeal in a court for that purpose to be erected as aforesaid   all discounting of wages and time all damages of goods avarages stopping of pay and the like to be adjusted by stated and public rules and laws in print established by the same act of parliament by which means all litigious suits in the court of admiralty which are infinite would be prevented   no ship that is permitted to enter at the customhouse and take in goods should ever be refused men or delayed in the delivering them above five days after a demand made and a ticket from the customhouse delivered general cases as arrests and embargoes excepted   the consequences of this method    by this means the public would have no want of seamen and all the charges and other inconveniences of pressing men would be prevented   the intolerable oppression upon trade from the exorbitance of wages and insolence of mariners would be taken off   the following sums of money should be paid to the office to lie in bank as a public fund for the service of the nation to be disposed of by order of parliament and not otherwise a committee being always substituted in the intervals of the session to audit the accounts and a treasury for the money to be composed of members of the house and to be changed every session of parliament   four shillings per month wages advanced by the merchants to the office for the men more than the office pays them   in consideration of the reducing mens wages and consequently fraights to the former prices or near them the owners of ships or merchants shall pay at the importation of all goods  0 s per ton freight to be stated upon all goods and ports in proportion reckoning it on wine tonnage from canaries as the standard and on special freights in proportion to the freight formerly paid and half the said price in times of peace  note this may well be done and no burden for if freights are reduced to their former prices or near it as they will be if wages are so too then the merchant may well pay it as for instance freight from jamaica to london formerly at   l  0 s per ton now at    and  0 l from virginia at   l to   l  0 s now at       and    l from barbados at   l now at    l from oporto at   l now at   l and the like  the payment of the abovesaid sums being a large bank for a fund and it being supposed to be in fair hands and currently managed the merchants shall further pay upon all goods shipped out and shipped on board from abroad for and from any port of this kingdom   l per cent on the real value bona fide to be sworn to if demanded in consideration whereof the said office shall be obliged to pay and make good all losses damages avarages and casualties whatsoever as fully as by the custom of assurances now is done without any discounts rebates or delays whatsoever the said   l per cent to be stated on the voyage to the barbados and enlarged or taken off in proportion to the voyage by rules and laws to be printed and publicly known  reserving only that then as reason good the said office shall have power to direct ships of all sorts how and in what manner and how long they shall sail with or wait for convoys and shall have power with limitations to lay embargoes on ships in order to compose fleets for the benefit of convoys  these rules formerly noted to extend to all trading by sea the coasting and homefishing trade excepted and for them it should be ordered  first for coals the colliers being provided with men at    s per month and convoys in sufficient number and proper stations from tinmouthbar to the river so as they need not go in fleets but as wind and weather presents run all the way under the protection of the men of war who should be continually cruising from station to station they would be able to perform their voyage in as short time as formerly and at as cheap pay and consequently could afford to sell their coals at    s per chaldron as well as formerly at    s  wherefore there should be paid into the treasury appointed at newcastle by bond to be paid where they deliver  0 s per chaldron newcastle measure and the stated price at london to be    s per chaldron in the pool which is  0 s at the buyers house and is so far from being dear a time of war especially as it is cheaper than ever was known in a war and the officers should by proclamation confine the seller to that price  in consideration also of the charge of convoys the ships bringing coals shall all pay   l per cent on the value of the ship to be agreed on at the office and all convoymoney exacted by commanders of ships shall be relinquished and the office to make good all losses of ships not goods that shall be lost by enemies only  these heads indeed are such as would need some explication if the experiment were to be made and with submission would reduce the seamen to better circumstances at least twoud have them in readiness for any public service much easier than by all the late methods of encouragement by registring seamen etc  for by this method all the seamen in the kingdom should be the kings hired servants and receive their wages from him whoever employed them and no man could hire or employ them but from him the merchant should hire them of the king and pay the king for them nor would there be a seaman in england out of employ which by the way would prevent their seeking service abroad if they were not actually at sea they would receive halfpay and might be employed in works about the yards stores and navy to keep all things in repair  if a fleet or squadron was to be fitted out they would be manned in a weeks time for all the seamen in england would be ready nor would they be shye of the service for it is not an aversion to the kings service nor it is not that the duty is harder in the men of war than the merchantmen nor it is not fear of danger which makes our seamen lurk and hide and hang back in a time of war but it is wages is the matter    s per month in the kings service and  0 to  0 s per month from the merchant is the true cause and the seaman is in the right of it too for who would serve his king and country and fight and be knocked of the head at    s per month that can have  0 s without that hazard and till this be remedied in vain are all the encouragements which can be given to seamen for they tend but to make them insolent and encourage their extravagance  nor would this proceeding be any damage to the seamen in general for    s per month wages and to be kept in constant service or halfpay when idle is really better to the seamen than    s per month as they now take it considering how long they often lie idle on shore out of pay for the extravagant price of seamens wages though it has been an intolerable burden to trade has not visibly enriched the sailors and they may as well be content with    s per month now as formerly  on the other hand trade would be sensibly revived by it the intolerable price of freights would be reduced and the public would reap an immense benefit by the payments mentioned in the proposal as     s per month upon the wages of all the seamen employed by the merchant which if we allow  00000 seamen always in employ as there cannot be less in all the ships belonging to england is  0000 l per month    0 s per ton freight upon all goods imported     per cent on the value of all goods exported or imported    0 s per chaldron upon all the coals shipped at newcastle and   per cent on the ships which carry them   what these four articles would pay to the exchequer yearly twoud be very difficult to calculate and i am too near the end of this book to attempt it but i believe no tax ever given since this war has come near it  it is true out of this the public would be to pay halfpay to the seamen who shall be out of employ and all the losses and damages on goods and ships which though it might be considerable would be small compared to the payment aforesaid for as the premio of   per cent is but small so the safety lies upon all men being bound to insure for i believe any one will grant me this it is not the smallness of a premio ruins the ensurer but it is the smallness of the quantity he insures and i am not at all ashamed to affirm that let but a premio of   l per cent be paid into one mans hand for all goods imported and exported and any man may be the general ensurer of the kingdom and yet that premio can never hurt the merchant neither  so that the vast revenue this would raise would be felt no where neither poor nor rich would pay the more for coals foreign goods would be brought home cheaper and our own goods carried to market cheaper owners would get more by ships merchants by goods and losses by sea would be no loss at all to any body because repaid by the public stock  another unseen advantage would arise by it we should be able to outwork all our neighbors even the dutch themselves by sailing as cheap and carrying goods as cheap in a time of war as in peace an advantage which has more in it than is easily thought of and would have a noble influence upon all our foreign trade for what could the dutch do in trade if we could carry our goods to cadiz at  0 s per ton freight and they give   or  0 l and the like in other places whereby we could be able to sell cheaper or get more thau our neighbors  there are several considerable clauses might be added to this proposal some of great advantage to the general trade of the kingdom some to particular trades and more to the public but i avoid being too particular in things which are but the product of my own private opinion  if the government should ever proceed to the experiment no question but much more than has been hinted at would appear nor do i see any great difficulty in the attempt or who would be aggrieved at it and there i leave it rather wishing than expecting to see it undertaken  the conclusion upon a review of the several chapters of this book i find that instead of being able to go further some things may have suffered for want of being fully expressed which if any person object against i only say i cannot now avoid it i have endeavored to keep to my title and offered but at an essay which any one is at liberty to go on with as they please for i can promise no supplement as to errors of opinion though i am not yet convinced of any yet i no where pretend to infallibility however i do not willingly assert any thing which i have not good grounds for if i am mistaken let him that finds the error inform the world better and never trouble himself to animadvert upon this since i assure him i shall not enter into any pen and ink contest on the matter  as to objections which may lie against any of the proposals made in this book i have in some places mentioned such as occurred to my thoughts i shall never assume that arrogance to pretend no other or further objections may be raised but i do really believe no such objection can be raised as will overthrow any scheme here laid down so as to render the thing impracticable neither do i think but that all men will acknowledge most of the proposals in this book would be of as great and perhaps greater advantage to the public than i have pretended to  as for such who read books only to find out the authors faux pas who will quarrel at the meanness of style errors of pointing dullness of expression or the like i have but little to say to them i thought i had corrected it very carefully and yet some mispointings and small errors have slipped me which it is too late to help as to language i have been rather careful to make it speak english suitable to the manner of the story than to dress it up with exactness of style choosing rather to have it free and familiar according to the nature of essays than to strain at a perfection of language which i rather wish for than pretend to be master of  finis errata introduction page
