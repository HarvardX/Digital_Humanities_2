purposely put off hitherto one important but disastrous subject to the last moment although i have now for the space of some years in my different traversings of the continent been placed as it were in the very eye and ear of it you feel that i mean the dreadful public and yet more fatal private wars of this and many other countries on this unhappy side of the english channel  what my loved friend is the matter with them all  sure it is the very error of the moon she comes more near the earth than she was wont and makes men mad does it proceed from the sacred flame of liberty which exalts the human almost to the divine nature or are the nations filled with clamours for that which no man felt the want of and with care for freedom which has never been in danger springs it from a due sense of that proud principle within us which points at the right which every honest individual has to rank with the loftiest of the species when measured by the standard of nature or from that factious and discontented spirit which prompts the worst of mankind to trouble the repose and plunder the possessions of the best comes it from true patriotism or from that party rage which robs it of its good name it proceeds from all these but with respect to equality on the literal idea as the mob are encouraged for reasons they cannot penetrate to conceive it was there ever such a daydream to make the absurdity more egregious yet more palateable it is called natural equality preposterous as false what dear friend in nature is equal survey her productions from the first to the last from the most gigantic to the most minute as well in animals as man what is there which she has not created unequal even by express order of the creator and by that very inequality intending to promote the wisdom force and felicity of the whole amongst the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field the grand line of subordination drawn by nature goes on would you give to the linnet the wing of the eagle or to the turnspit the speed of the greyhound to what end would not nature by that exchange be violated in her general laws and would the beings themselves be the better for it am i told that all these creatures were put under the subjection of man and that he as the lord of all below can have naturally no superior but the god that gave him life the argument rests then it seems on the natural equality of human creatures fallacious again for of all the beings in the scale of the universe man if we except his origin concerning the equality of which he has no more right to be proud than the worm that devours his carcass is the most subject to the laws of natural inequality the point which places him at the top of the creation is certainly his soul for his body whether a masterpiece of beauty or a mass of deformity is alike corruptible and rather an object of humiliation than triumph but were you disposed to select from the diversified works of nature any specimen of her wonderful variety and irregularity could you fix on any thing so proper to display that irregularity that variety as the human mind so far from there being herein an universal equality there is nothing so unequal amongst all the performances of creation the strength of the lion is not more remote from the feebleness of the gnat nor the swiftness of the reindeer from the tardiness of the snail than the distance between the power and weakness velocity and slowness of mens souls and understandings nature by uncontrollable laws has established that to one man should be given an head to plan govern and command to another hands to toil and obey innumerable are the gradations from those who guide the helm of the state to those who regulate the steerage of a simple skiff from the noblest architect to the most ordinary artificer the harmonies of civil society are carried on by the joint assistance of all these in their proper places take them out of which and transpose them put the one into the station of another and in short jumble them together on the plea of natural equality according to the new system and what results from all this what becomes of civil society and of the world does not such a farce upon the decent subordinations and arrangements of nature fill it with discords disorders and death look into the page of ancient annals and into the more sanguinary history of modern times  what do they exhibit but a tissue of absurdity horror and blood  can it be supposed that were these at length to subside by the establishment of republicanism on the ruins of monarchy that the happiness of mankind which ought to be the aim and end of all governments would be the effect let the toiling hand govern and the projecting head obey would not confusion be indeed confounded or shall all men have an equal share in the direction of human affairs shall there be no governors no governed shall families societies states and empires be without an head shall all be common right and common fellowship the comet my friend were it to rush lawless through the void would not trail so much mischief in its course as such a number of licentious orbits out of their proper spheres the wolves and tigers of the forests acknowledge it is true no superior and they sometimes troop in grim association and fell bandittl to lay waste the countries through which they pass they are it must be owned notable republicans and are unanimous to destroy whatever they meet with but they destory each other also and are bad examples of the success of an universal republic instituted on the levelling principle the wolves and tigers of human kind if suffered to roam through the wilderness of life without any check on passions more fierce and fatal than any bestial appetite  or if controuled only by those laws which are instituted by what are called patriots only because they avowedly differ from and oppose any order in a creation that is sustained by order only  would soon make the universe more intolerable to its inhabitants than any abuse which power has yet introduced into the government of the world and the most disloyal being would again call out like the frogs in the fable for a king and rather than any longer be left to the anarchy of being delivered over to themselves would pray for one tyrant supposing no honest prince would then accept of them in exchange for an universe of despots  but farther how egregiously absurd my friend is this new doctrine are not all large bodies of men compelled to have governors and chiefs and do not these imply command and obedience and do not these argue in their very name and nature authority and subjection what are the admirals generals colonels captains and subalterns of the present french armies but heads what are the soldiers and sailors they govern or direct but subordinate members in what consists the difference betwixt these and former commanders whether ministerial or military alas nothing but the whistlings of a name call it aristocracy and the gentlest government becomes tyranny give it the name of democracy and there is no slavery too hard to be endured nay the very men who are such sticklers for equality who have even fought and bled for it continue to this very hour to make the proudest distinctions amongst men even in a state of mutual captivity the first thing that struck me in my visit to weyzel a celebrated town as you know of westphalia was the seeing a number of republican french officers prisoners walking on the parade attended by their servants two of these latter were receiving the orders of their masters with their heads uncovered and their bodies bent in a very unrepublican manner what in a state of common calamity are these nice distinctions to be made thought i are brother prisoners to keep up this lofty difference are those who have levelled the earth so soon unmindful of their leading maxim all men are equal one of the superiors i thought there were to be no superiors grew angry chid his domestic and sent him from his presence could the old constitution  could despotism do more i saw the obedient slave with the most servile shrug of his country and of his condition go slinking away so much for confraternity  my friend a skilful use of words substituting one for another as time and circumstance may require will apparently change the nature of things but real liberty and slavery are the same beautiful and bitter potions denominate them what you will and the tyrant is not less an oppressor for altering his name to that of a friend to freedom indeed some of the worst enemies that freedom ever had in all ages and countries have assumed this sacred character  point out to me the despot that has not called himself a lover of his people and of his country under this specious mask i have within a few years been an eyewitness to no less than two formidable insurrections in this little republic on the verge of which i am now writing i am far from being sure that i shall not be spectator of a the third has come to pass third though one would have thought either of the two former might have written on the hearts of the people the wisdom of content in characters of blood that which raged in      is so well and faithfully written by an english author who calls his work an history of the late dutch revolution that i shall not only refer but recommend you to a perusal of it a few of the miserable particulars i shall give you on the authority of personal knowledge but not till i again resume the pen to assure you amidst the storm of contending nations  the wrecks of matter and the almost crush of worlds i am affectionately yours  letter lvii to the same we talk much and with much reason of the wild excesses of our english mobs my dear friend their sanguinary disposition has been compared to that of our english bulldogs which are said to be insatiate of blood when they have once drawn it from the objects of their attack our british insurrections are no doubt marked like others by some of the prominent features of rebellion in all countries devastation flames and untimely death but i did not know how great an enemy man could be to man nor had i a clear idea to what an extent human beings could go in the destruction of one another although i am not unread in the bloody story of my own country till i began to glean the more dreadful annals of others the six years that have elapsed since i beheld in holland the demon of civil fury associated with party madness far from having abated the memory of their dire effects are felt methinks with a stronger horror from having observed similar outrages in other quarters of the agitated globe unhappy holland while one party were attempting to destroy thee and themselves by fire and sword rapine and slaughter the other were wreaking vengeance against thy best fairest and most innocent possessions  upon thy wives and children  while one side i say my friend were thus outraging all order decency and compassion the other manifested no less fury the party of the stadtholder and that of the patriots were alike infected with the poison of the times it reached the bosoms even of the gentler sex as an instance of which pardon me if i make your nature recoil even as mine did on the day my flowing eyes bore testimony to it a party of patriots had taken and killed in the town of boisleduc one of the princes adherents who had been active in the cause of the stadtholder his defeat was therefore a kind of triumph a groupe of people soon gathered round the body yet struggling betwixt life and death amongst the rest were two women who had been fetching water from the public fountains one of these no sooner understood the cause of the mobs collecting than she poured out about two thirds of the water from her pail which she placed under the wounds of the murdered citizen whose blood was thus mingled with the water when pledging the surrounding populace she exclaimed as she drank with more than savage fury may rivers of this flow through the streets till our enemies are vanquished and to such a pitch of enthusiasm was this carried that as one more example i must inform you another patriot quarrelled with the beautiful rainbow and shot at it because the orange mingled in its hues this was nearly as mad and irreverent as the dressing up the figure of the virgin mary with a red bonnet and writing under the cross of our savior the man jesus the cidevant redeemer of the world  all comments of the moralist my friend are lost and all effusions of the peaceful lover of mankind absorbed on occasions like these for breaches of this sort in nations like old and incurable wounds though they are often skinned over conceal an unsubdued venom which gathers strength and virulence and then again break out private families we know may after some imminent and deadly breach reunite from policy or principle or from some relics of affection but even this is a patched up accommodation and after a violent open rupture whether in empires or the little domestic commonwealths that form them the whole history of mankind furnish few examples where the parties have sincerely forgiven one another many months after the princes party had been reinstated in its privileges and the patriot faction not only yielded to authority but appeared to have forgot its animosity i had but too many illustrations of the foregone remark on the breaking out of the rebellion in other countries i again heard the voice of sedition and the more than murmurs of disaffection in various parts of these disunited states sacred be the love of rational liberty but the fever of freedom is a wildfire that is more desolating than any other contagion that of constantinople is not so suddenly imbibed nor does it travel with unimpaired venom so far or so fast it is a pest that seizes distant nations and strikes with the rapidity and the force of lightning even when holland seemed to have got the better of this political plague its poisons were undermining her constitution and like those fires which are burning in the bowels of the earth unseen are inwardly consuming its entrails and making their way to the surface i was in holland when she was precisely in this situation prepared for her second shock and waiting only for the signal of her expatriated firebrarnds the banished dutch patriots then forming a part of the french army to give the explosion breda was taken gorcum was inundated and the cannonade of williamstadt thundered to the very sea and prepared the patriots of the provinces for the reception of their exiled friends  in my way to helveotsluice in order to embark for england every countenance i looked into carried the marks of fear loyalty ambition or revolt notwithstanding the cautious jealousy natural to power and all the vigilance of the magistrates little knots of people were to be observed gathered together in corners of the street and in byeplaces where it was thought the eye of authority would not penetrate my wandering steps which so often led me into unfrequented places and thereby as you have seen make me tread upon many a secret led me to the haunts of these dutch malcontents they were always to be seen in that earnest and earapproaching whisper which so often betrays its treasons the forefinger extended the button caught at and held fast or shook most rebelliously the mouth of the speaker contracted so as to send forth only the unbetraying voice of conspiracy and that of the hearer on the contrary opened to its width to swallow the treason while the eyes of the party communicating like a pair of sentinels ordered to defend the door of the lips seemed to keep double watch lest as shakspeare says the babbling gossips of the air should prate of their whereabout  artizans burgomasters priests and peasants were thus insidiously or fearfully gathered together either to express their apprehension their hope or their despair were to be detected in these communities and had not the whole country been threatened with a very serious calamity it would not have been unamusing to a gleaner who delights to catch the living manners as they rise  it is not unentertaining to see the little shifts which persons engaged in secret conversations of any kind make to prevent being discovered the immediate change they make on the first view of an intruder  the sudden alteration from an aweful to a careless air as the said intruder approaches the tones varied from almost in distinct whispers and portentous meetings to louder accents now walking on now stopping a little as if engaged in ordinary conversation the subject of which while you have an eye on them is changed as often as their positions i took notice while i paused at helveotsluice that as their friends on the other side of the water that is to say the enemies of their country were more rapid in their advances while their very fires were in sight and the patriots on the helveot side were almost opening their arms to receive them these secret meetings were less visible it is a crisis at which the mind of a conspiracy is made up the component parts of which perfectly understanding their plans lie in wait to put them in execution assuming in the mean time the mask of welldissembled loyalty for strange as it may seem vice when swelled to its height and just about to show itself borrows the semblance of its opposite virtue in the robes of which it is then most assiduous to cover itself thus drunkenness affects temperance incontinence chastity avarice generosity detraction candor impiety religion and faction which would hurl a sovereign from his throne in that moment is the loudest to sing forth the praises of royalty  but treachery my dear friend is never so perilous never so fatal as when it thus hides itself and would seem the thing it is not from a foe whom i observe taking aim at me i may escape by accident by courage or by address but from the stroke of an assassin whom though i once knew him to be my enemy my believing heart at length considers as a penitent friend i am so far from being guarded that to use the words of one of our old poets i lay my sleeping life within his arms  thus it was with the several inhabitants of holland they had done speaking and were now prepared to act and the moment of that action was waited for with the sullen malignity and gloomy pastime which characters a cold and determined nature such as many of the natives of holland possess they waited for their longwished revenge in silence but it was a silence that resembled the fearful stillness of the sky when the thunder is gathering force but the silence of a hollander when once his part is taken is more to be apprehended than the thunder itself of which i gleaned an instance that is in reserve for you perhaps i have raised your curiosity and therefore you shall have this dire example of dutch revenge here  two brothers on some very slight occasion quarrelled and from being inmates separated houses neighborhood and at length broke connection their alienation was neither softened nor embittered by correspondence after about eleven years past in this manner one of the brothers married a beautiful woman the single brother who had been watching his opportunity of vengeance made his appearance very unexpectedly on the wedding day and desiring an interview with the married man in a separate apartment was no sooner perceived than welcomed the latter taking it for granted he came to be reconciled and had chosen this distinguished day to render it more acceptable the bachelor thus addressed the bridegroom brother we have not met since our disagreement divided us this day eleven years i come now to remind you of the circumstance  thus  striking a poniard into the heart of the bridegroom who had just power to gain the apartment of his bride who was then dancing with one of her husbands friends scarcely could he exclaim that he was murdered ere he sunk down and expired at her feet and while the company and servants were employed about their friend and master the assassin coolly mounted his horse and made his escape  alas my friend it is with the patriotism that embraces all my fellow creatures and their happiness that i apprize you that our present sheaf must be deeply spotted with their blood the mingled blood of beauty and deformity innocence and guilt the scenery which is yet in store was partly painted amidst the tranquillity of returning peace and partly amidst the horrors of returning war  often have i been within sight not seldom within hearing of two of the fiercest oppositions that ever desolated the works of man and god you will not be surprised to learn that the impression which such scenes has made upon an eye and earwitness should have filled his mind with materials that lie fresh in his memory and bleed in his heart how many towns villages and all that they inherit have i seen blooming on the one day with beauty wealth content and happy countenances despoiled deformed impoverished and deluged in tears and in blood upon another the pictures of these taken both in the one position and in the other must be given they shall be delineated with simple historical truth for neither romance nor fable in their wildest warmest colorings could can or has ever reached them  possibly the gleaner is the first traveller who has yet described the happiness of nations at peace and the misery of such nations at war in a residence immediately before and after the violations of public tranquillity he has viewed as well the havoc of battle in its most intense rage as the cold horrors that succeeded conquest he has luxuriated in countries when the horn of plenty filled them with fertility and fragrance and deplored even as if his property were mingled in the common wreck the withering effects of victory after the enemy had torn up all the works of nature and of man the most fair and the most cherished he has been amongst the last to quit and the first to revisit a threatened country and evacuated town and has observed the labors of a life a century annihilated in a single day the desolations of every work of art and the more affecting ruins of human beings before he set out on this last tour of which he has here drawn the faint outline he had seen public misery and felt its effects his reading had furnished him with recorded horrors in the bloody history of his own country but all this was but the shadow of the disaster which the excursion alluded to has brought closer under his eye and yet closer to his heart  descending by degrees in a step that receded in proportion as the enemy advanced i found myself almost imperceptibly once more in holland whose armies still freezing upon the banks of the maise and lower rhine must perhaps again have recourse to the assistance of her great waterdog to whom she has more than once owed the salvation of her republic and indeed this sturdy guardian ought to do infinite good since he cannot be let loose upon the enemies of the state without abundant mischief  an inundation of the country being next to captivity and its consequences the greatest evil would you believe after all which has happened since my former gleaning of the united states after all the faithful traditions of horror bloodshed pillage and blasphemy which have been placed before them that i find again here the self same spirit of disaffection grown more gigantic and with increase of ferocity proportioned to augmentation of force for the disaffection of more arbitrary states of france herself for instance i can more easily allow and account but one would have thought that a republic  attached as is that of holland to all those things which the french people now most hold in scorn person property life and religion and with the bleeding testimonies of rapine devastation and death before their eyes  one would have thought i say that in such a country amongst such a people who have much to lose and nothing to gain the fury of party by which they have so often unmercifully suffered and are suffering at this moment in every limb and artery of the republic might have been moderated if not destroyed surely the desperation of liberty like that of love baffles all reasoning and mocks at all sober laws even the richest merchants of the united provinces men who must on the very principles of equality at least divide the labors and gains of life with those who subsist only by an opposite set of principles which levels idleness and industry  even such men pant for the complete triumph of the common enemy and are ready to sacrifice not only their fortunes but their families  to what to false ideas of freedom and to revenge what could they acquire the gratification of an ancient grudge what must they lose every thing else but so cold and so dark is their feeling on this subject they would consider it as a cheap the purchase has been made we shall see how long they continue pleased with their bargain purchase  but the spreading flame is not confined to holland the gleaner has traced its progress through the provincial petty towns of austria where a slender passage of the rhine separates the inhabitants from their utterly ruined neighbors friends and countrymen on the other side he has seen and heard the look and tone of determined revolution and if he has at one moment observed one man retreating with fear he has in the next noticed more than one remaining fixed to his household in hope of the destroyer in numberless places believe me a protecting army is an object of silent yet obvious hate and one which menaces captivity is welcome along the banks of the maise as of the rhine even though their waves may be almost said from the alchemy of commerce to flow with gold the very worshippers of that precious mischief would gladly tinge its billows with blood in westphalia in prussia he has followed in every direction the like power you cannot get into a publichouse boat or carriage but the water and the land reechoes with the illdissembled voice or loyalty or the avowed and bolder tones of faction  in short the fever is more universal than any other that has yet raged in the world it seizes on all ages sexes and countries and though millions have already died of it the fury rather increases than abates i have seen old fellows in their grand climacteric to whom an easy chair and a warm peaceful hearth one would think might comprise all the liberty sighed for i have seen such receive with exultation every account of a fortress destroyed a village burned or a city desolated even though adjoining their own like the malignant zanga but unsupported by zangas motives of revenge they love the rocking of the battlements it suits the gloomy habit of their souls in a word in a circuit of many hundred leagues i have seen a spirit of revolt to the ruling power whether emperor stadtholder or king that rises amongst the ruins and stirs up insurrection amidst the very ashes of thrones and dominions adieu  letter lviii to the same you told me i remember in one of your late favors that i had mingled in my sheaves many a bloody wreath alas it is but the blushing signal of those events which are doomed to outrage the feelings of every gentle heart in the character of an historical gleaner i shall ere long be called upon to afflict the reader and my friend yet more the most terrifying truths are to be told truths over which i have wept and shuddered but over which i nevertheless hope should the peruser of these pages shed a tear and shudder also he will find a balm sufficient to the wound amidst the pangs of general philanthropy every britonborn reader at least will feel at his heart the beatitude of his particular happiness in being a member of that island which although by comparative extent it measures but as a speck in the map of the world is the natal residence of the fortunate and the almost sole sanctuary of the unhappy proportions of the globe  but however my countrymen and my friends are to be felicitated on this circumstance i sorrow to distress them by delineating the sad reverse and therefore will spare the telling since it be a pain as long as possible  the hurry and agitation of public affairs have led me to some anticipations the crouding incidents of the moment the now gathering now dispersing storms of war have made me break in upon my reserves prematurely and that to the neglect of many a more pacific and smiling scene to these i shall return with a satisfaction that i flatter myself you will share as it will for a while suspend every more turbulent subject and empower me to conduct you gradually along till you almost forget we are approaching scenes of devastation by such means too i shall rather break the blow upon your feelings than take them by surprise nay more as our paths to the seats of war lie through some of the most charming parts of westphalian prussia i shall even strew those paths with flowers  i am now again addressing you from nimeguen the last considerable town of the dutch territory where after having employed the rest of this letter in a few gleanings properly belonging to holland and the provinces we will journey onward sedate to think and watching each event and with our accustomed privileges try what the open what the covert yields  you have in recollection i trust my gleanings of the dutch theater when the ghost of hamlet stalked upon the stage of holland during the hague fair on a revisitation of that celebrated town some days ago i found that a troop of german actors had been permitted to take possession of the playhouse situated in the casuarystreet which the french comedians convicted of jacobinism as i informed you had evacuated the first piece at the representation of which i attended was called i think the robber in which amongst several very finewrought and as fine acted scenes was one turning upon an event so preposterous that i must relate it to you the hero of the performance is a young man who in the first instance robs his own father and eloping from his paternal house carries his plunder to a desperate banditti who have their haunts in a deep forest and with such associates he shares the plunder and the crimes notwithstanding his companions have had strength enough over the virtues of his youth to extinguish his sense of duty to an aged and almost helpless parent and one of the tenderest that ever bore the name and even to make him forego the endearing society of a lady to whom he was powerfully attached they had not force of seduction sufficient to eradicate entirely the vital principle of nature and conscience which at various periods broke forth in sighs of remorse and blushes of shame the cunning of the scene affords many displays of these and in the lucid returns of his heavilysmitten heart he rescues that very parent and that very muchloved though deserted mistress from the barbarity and machinations of an elder brother this brother is also by his means and by the most equitable laws of human life as well as of the drama brought to just punishment and by arrangements no less proper the father is restored to the freedom and honors which his eldest son had ravished from him and the young lady is preserved from violation by such means the parties long divided by the vices are brought together by the virtues of this heroic robber forgiveness of the father and of the mistress are matters of course and the reconciliatory scenes which exhibit these are as naturally sustained as the incidents by which they are brought about are artfully contrived every thing is in the fairest way of being settled to the satisfaction of the characters and of the audience i never witnessed the denouement of a tragedy more comfortably arranged for the feelings but the author was of a different opinion for in the moment that you are about to congratulate this good ending of as bad a beginning the poet starts a difficulty which i conceive neither nature or reason suggested to him the almost converted robber even while supported on the one hand by the love of a father and on the other by that of an adored mistress finds out that having sworn to live and die with his forest companions he cannot violate his oath and that even if he could his delicacy would not suffer him to carry pollution into the arms of an innocent woman  now if you approve of this stroke of delicacy i could wish to stop at it but as a faithful gleaner i must proceed to inform you that our delicate hero by no means contents himself with this declaration but while his hand is joined by a parent to that of a mistress who covers it with tears of joy and kisses of love he literally threws it like a noisome weed away observing that although he feels it impossible to marry the lady himself he cannot endure the thought of her living for another this new misfortune sinks the father to the ground upon which he is left to die on one side of the stage while the lady stands statuestruck with grief on the other neither of these objects go to the heart of our hero on the contrary he intimates that there is no way left to pacify his fears on this curious point of delicacy but the death of this beloved mistress hereupon the poet makes her obligingly take the hint by throwing herself into an attitude to receive the blow from the hand of her lover who however rather hesitates about it upon which the lady presents her beautiful bosom all heroines you know must be beautiful to any of the robbers none of whom can be found to scar that whiter skin of here is than monumental alabaster when men who live by pillage and murder are thus tenderhearted i am justified in applying the quotation though i should consider myself as having a sufficient sanction on the determined laws of the drama to enrol amongst their unities those of heroism and personal beauty  the ruffians however all unsheath their swords and might perhaps have been wrought upon to cut in twain the silken bonds of humanity that held them a moment uplifted had not the hero come forth in all the might of his delicacy in the shape of a rant loud and vehement as ever pierced the ears of the groundlings to assert his sole and exclusive claim to the assassination saying which and a great deal more he takes the woman of his heart gently in his arms then buries his dagger gently in her breast then supports her gently as she sinks on the earth where gently placing her on the side opposite that of his dead father on whose body by the bye dying or dead he never bestows a glance and then gently embracing his robberfriends he stalks off to kill himself at a more convenient season and thus concludes this gentle piece of business of which if any thing could add to the absurdity it would be the circumstance of having just before found himself wholly incapable of stabbing his worthless brother because though stained with the foulest offenses against his dear father and dearer mistress he was forsooth a good for nothing  brother if this is not refining upon refinement and outsentimentizing sentimentality the deuce is in it few of my readers but must allow this was carrying the point of delicacy a little too far and for my part if this is the german method of settling the point i remain a steady admirer of the coarse english fashion of stabbing any body and indeed almost every body rather than the woman of ones heart  but the truth is this is not the german mode any more than it is ours as i have shown and shall still show in various instances it is the act and deed solely of the author of this drama who has therein not only put his heroine to death for his own amusement but has committed an assassination upon a much greater character even nature herself and this is one example out of an hundred that has made me wish gentlemen who have the life and death of their characters as dramatick writers in their hands would be a little less lavish of human at least of poetical blood without showing cause in the courts of reason nature and conscience not that i mean to attach this strain upon dramatic or natural laws to the productions of the german poets in general they very frequently write and act with the most accurate knowledge of the human heart and seldom fail to find their way to it when their purpose is to interest its affections  i was indeed soon recompensed for the above related outrage of probability by the performance which i saw at the same theater a few nights after when all was nature to advantage dressed it was properly speaking a gala play being represented in honor of the prince stadtholders birthday one of the few very occasional events which bring a sufficient number of people to fill the hague theater for although it is not larger than colmans in the haymarket there is rarely audience enough to pay for the few pounds of candle bestowed to illumine the gloom and doubtless this is one reason why there is not more light thrown upon the audience of the hague on this great occasion however there were about half as many lamps stuck over the stadtholders box as would have been placed on the board of his britannick majestys corncutter on the  th of june and even the under tier of sconces that usually stand unoccupied were filled with wax in a word i beheld the astonishing circumstance of a dutch theater crowded and instead of  the beggarly account of empty boxes i found myself amongst the flower and fashion of the hague  after being waited for by the actors and the audience the decent time that is just long enough to wind up expectation to the proper pitch without straining its springs his serene highness and his royalblooded partner made their appearance the first in a modest suit of slightlyornamented blue broad cloth the last according to the etiquette made and provided in these cases glittering in white silver tissue brunswicks eldest hope was shining at their side and his duchess attended the graceful and lovely princess hereditary in the stagebox decorated for that night only to receive them  but alas all this was but the gay disguise of a concealed anxiety or rather it was but the trapping and encumbrance of a comfortless situation too mighty for disguises three days and nights previous to this theatrical exhibition of themselves had the prince princess and train been made the illustrious victims of this anniversary martyrdom and every moment that was not devoted to the bendings bowings and other pliabilities of the court was seized upon by the camp for it was the time when above a thousand soldiers were preparing to replace the devastations of the last campaign in flanders the stadtholder is indefatigable in his military duties and these happening to fall at the period when he was to receive the compliments of the nobility and gentry on gaining the fortysixth year of his age you will not wonder to hear that he brought to the playhouse a weary head and perhaps an aching heart the more especially as it was said an heavy piece of public news had been received from the frontiers which it was necessary to hush up in his own mind and in that of his august partner in distress lest it should check the ardour of the troops about to take their departure there is you know a crisis in splendid as well as other misery at which the oppressed spirits and faculties take refuge in sleep it appeared to be exactly this crisis when the party abovementioned gained the theater for scarce had the natal salutations been received and acknowledged than a deep sleep fell upon both their highnesses and upon the prince of brunswick never did i see three illustrious personages so oddly disposed of they sunk subdued into a comfortable nap as if it had been a preconcerted thing to refresh themselves at the theater with a doze of this sort and which to say the truth they stood sadly in need of it seems they had been exhausting themselves in public affairs and ceremonies from five in the morning to midnight of the preceding day but that the anodyne was very powerful may be gathered from their enjoying it almost unbroken through the three long acts of a german opera spun to the length of as many german miles once indeed his serene highness opened half an eye and cast it in a dizzy way first at the sleeping princess then at the snoring duke as if to explore the cause that roused him but perceiving it was only the crash of instruments in a general chorus by way of finale to the second act he again bid adieu to unwelcome recollections in the oblivious arms of that power which is very justly called the kind restorer of nature i could not help a reflection on the different allotments of human kind as i saw the most illustrious of the audience the only parts of it which were unable to enjoy either the harmony or the pleasantry of the entertainment and altogether insensible to the surrounding splendours we rave about and we are bleeding at every pore and fermenting in every vein for equality my dear friend we are hearing perpetually of the necessity of bringing the poor on a level with the rich nobles with peasants and kings with beggars  ah god of them all with how little reason with how little recollection of the history of human conditions the worst and the most unhappy is probably that which winds up the climax and so on of the series since it is most likely the houseless beggar who eats his morsel of alms under a hedge of thorns when the rude hand of winter had torn off every sheltering leaf in remembrance of the day that brought into the world the brat which he buckles to his back has a more exquisite relish of that morsel and is more soothed by the gratulations of his weatherbeaten companions than the prince and princess of the republic of holland sleeping amidst the felicitations of a theater or in truth any prince or princess in these times equality alas were all men reduced to a level like this how soon would those who till then perhaps without being conscious of it had experienced the blessings of an humble state wish again for the refuge and distinction of poverty whosoever has looked on the fatigues weight and peril of the elevations amongst mankind must know this and it is strange there should be found any one so unreasonable as to envy the exalted this gilding of their care and misery as to the eminent examples in question happy to see them enjoy this temporary respite i was sorry when the fall of the curtain awakened and dismissed them to new fatigues  whatever might be their fate for the rest of that night to new fatigues the stadtholder at least was destined the succeeding morning the troops which had cost him so much trouble to make ready were to march at eight oclock without using literary privileges which allow authors to blot out the sun or command him to send forth his most effulgent beam having you know a charter from parnassus to do as we please with the elements i assure you in the prose simplicity of truth that really the dawn was overcast the morning lowrd and heavily in clouds brought on the day nay more those clouds very soon after the stadtholder reached the parade broke on his unsheltered head for the indispensible ceremonies of a fieldday were to be exchanged and his royal highness princes not counting amongst their prerogatives the liberty of controlling the skies to their purpose got a ducking more severe than that i have recorded in a former letter one would again be led to think that there was more in these matters than philosophy can find out for really had the clouds been in combination against him they could not have spouted down a more inauspicious torrent it was not however of sufficient vehemence to damp his martial attention neither had it the force to chill public curiosity consequently it was set at defiance by powers stronger than either curiosity or martial ardour never on any public occasion did i see such a collection of human beings every passion of the heart and every feeling of nature were here met together in the form either of patriots princes men wives mistresses children officers or soldiers you might have observed hate allegiance love hope and despair you might have remarked also a few smiles of heroism amidst many bitter tears of apprehension the disasters of the last campaign were had in bleeding remembrance and there were those amongst the disaffected inhabitants who exclaimed see what a brave show of fellows are waiting orders to march to the shambles alas this exclamation has since proved in some late instance so late as the   th and   th of april last but too prophetic and although the military enter of the young imperial monarch has been marked with glory one cannot but regret it has been marked with so much of the blood of his allies many of the very men whom the gleaner beheld that day leaving their country have bade it an eternal adieu it is the fate of war but one shrinks from the thought and i wish i had not een them all alive it is weakness perhaps but forgive me   insidious whisperings of this kind had been in circulation for some time and several desertions had taken place in consequence upwards of twenty on the night immediately preceding their march nor was this the worst a dispiriting kind of alarm pervaded the soldiery who performed their military preparations with reluctant delay i had noticed many of them standing the day before their departure by the side of their baggage wagons as if they were taking a survey of their hearses filling them with their beds etc as if they presaged they would prove their beds of death others were following these vehicles with all their marching apparatus not with eyes that anticipated victory but with downcast looks and solemn steps to dirgelike measure as if they were moving after the coffin of a comrade and the beat of the drum that acts so wonderfully upon the spirits in certain moments now seemed to sound in their ears the dead march  examples of every kind are known to be contagious in no instance perhaps more than in their influence upon our hopes and fears courage and cowardice are communicated in a moment they are even transferred with electric rapidity from one man to another the bosom of the brave catching an unwonted apprehension and the breast of the dastard glowing with even an unnatural ardour as the poisonous breath of disaffection or the exhilarating powers of loyalty are diffused amongst them it is a lamentable thing when private houses or public empires are set against themselves states are only large families united by the same laws and bound by the same interest the connexions of the nearest ties in private life are scarce more close nor ought they to be more sacred as the welfare of man and wife so the prosperity of nations my friend when those whom heaven ordains to will the same look different ways unmindful of each other think what a train of wretchedness ensues unfortunately for the well being of these united states which by the bye is and has long been a misnomer the two parties that are dismembering it are in perpetual counteraction while the one is diligently laboring to knit the provinces together the other perhaps more industrious for mischief is a very active power works day and night though working often underground to render that honest diligence ineffectual and vigilant malignity will always be more or less successful  on this important morning however the stadtholder rallied the halfseduced energies of his soldiers he saluted them first generally then particularly he complimented and with great justice their martial appearance cheered them with a princes smile distributed amongst them a princes bounty bestowed with welltimed address a princes eulogy on their known valor etc etc  a little flattery sometimes does well he manifested by fifty little attentions that he considered them as the faithful defenders of the republic and in short put in motion every wheel of a good general a goodnatured prince and a good man his deportment had a visible effect on the troops into whose countenances there came as if by reflection a sudden and promising brightness the morning itself began to look more cheerfully and the officers with their men duly equipped from the orange branches in their hats to the neat knapsack at their backs took their march through the streets leading to schedam  their first days march  accompanied to the outer gate of the town by tens of thousands of spectators  if some few of those thousands heaved a sincere sigh of loyalty for the return of the troops victorious and uninjured how many secretly or to say the truth openly desired and hoped they might be vanquished and cut to pieces how strange does this seem how unnatural does it sound  is it not as if this mouth would tear this hand for lifting food to it with respect to the hollanders the liberty to say and do what they like in defiance of all inhibited things and as usual with the more eager audacity because forbidden is not one of the motives that urged the french people had the dutch to spur the sides of their intent save vaulting ambition which the gleaner thinks will in their case at least be found to have oerleapd itself theirs and as to their being taxed do they consider that they live in a country made by industry in despite of nature who intended it to be only one of her enormous bogs while the ancestors of this grumbling but hardworking hive set doggedly to it as dr johnson says to make it into productive land and a more productive water a pile of stupendous art from one end to the other and not to be kept in repair without extraordinary taxation do they grudge this would they let the edifice run to ruins and be buried amongst them would they heap up their money bags to sink them with themselves more profoundly in the returning bog will the french or their native patriots mend either their country or their commerce let them try ingenious laborious absurd wise foolish preposterous people  here then let us bid a long and probably a last adieu to the united provinces on which we have bestowed more liberal observation than they have been wont to receive but not more than they have deserved as the most curious and astonishing efforts of a patient powerful and vigilant people a like farewell to guelderland for whose prosperity i shall have a warm wish were it only for the sake of the opportunity it gives of losing ones way and finding the man of the forest blessed be every leaf of every tree which comes under the axe of that man and blessed be you my friend aye and ye my readers westphalia invites but i cannot quit one country and take you into another without separating them and their inhabitants by a little pause in our correspondence  letter lix to the same i have in a former gleaning noted the wonderful progressive relief from low to high land and from wet to dry from stagnant canals to running streams as you proceed in your journey from the united provinces to the upper countries this is less sensibly felt after a few days or weeks ramble in guelderland but could the traveller be suddenly transported from the province of what is properly called holland to those blooming edges of westphalia to which i am now conducting you he would imagine that one was the purgatory of sinful and the other the paradise of happy souls the fabled waters of the styx and of elysium are not more strongly contrasted the very air as well as the water takes a purer breath not that in point of vegetable or rural grandeur westphalian prussia is to be compared to several parts of dutch guelderland but in point of unambitious and eversmiling scenery i have never seen any thing superior the houses and the land and indeed the inhabitants of holland resemble nothing but themselves the charming duchy of cleves and all that it inherits resembles the most beautiful unassuming parts of england you have scarce reached the first prussian town which is midway betwixt nimeguen and cleves the name of which is cuylenberg ere your native country presses on your heart you seem to be carried by some magician into the midst of its alluring scenery its whited cottages comfortable farms and cultured grounds are all within your view you are struck at almost every step with the similitude it is the agreeable and beautiful but not the sublime of nature there is nothing of hill or vale water or wood to astonish the traveller but there are numbers of objects always fresh and always charming and a prospect of great abundance i am speaking here of the duchy of cleves in a circumference of its best possessions a coup doeil of more than fifty miles for on a clear day your eye can travel to this extent if it takes sight from any of the delightful little eminences near the town of cleves particularly from a mount in the wood which gives you the command of half a dozen noble avenues each a mile in length at the end of which your view is bounded by the prettiest towns in the circle of westphalia and province of guelderland the eye rests satisfied and refreshed it wishes not to penetrate beyond these beautiful limits the cleves wood is in itself full of charms artificial and natural but by the former i only mean the stately and somewhat formal rows of trees which shade and canopy the almost numberless paths that are cut through it yet admitting this to be an objection to the lover of nature in all her graceful wildness there are to be found in this wood an infinity of byewalks where nature is permitted to enjoy her utmost romance and to sport her virgin fancies and which perhaps derive additional charms from the contrast with the more disciplined vegetation this fine wood is fenced round with the old englishlooking parkpaling thatched as it were with gray moss as with us and as with us the chaffinch greenfinch goldfinch and all the other finches of the grove as the critic says are seen pecking at it on a fine spring morning to build the outworks of their nests i have haunted this wood at all times and seasons and trust therefore you will be pleased with both a summer and winter account of it there appears to be something remarkable in the foliage of westphalia to be observed in the most dreary months with us even in our most extended forests the trees and bushes are almost stripped of their withered foliage in great britain and in holland autumn scarce leaves a trace behind her when the surly winter as our poet of nature beautifully calls him with his ruffian train has usurped her empire it is far otherwise in westphalia the underwood not only of the enduring oaks but of all other sorts of more tender shrub wood scarcely sustain the loss of a leaf a general russet such as we see in the english groves when they put on their november robes covers whole acres till the end of march when it is most likely nature is arrayed in her spring dress in great britain respecting the trees of forest growth they are here as in the general roads of france and in the avenues that lead to our antique mansions of england planted in the straight line but their regularity as to height and extent gives them one appearance at the present moment singular and agreeable three or four days of rain with the intervals of a dry southern air have given them such an universal blush that though nothing like a leaf is to be seen in alleys of several thousand trees cut into different roads at right angles and is simply the effect of a swell amongst the buds you have the promise that the very next sunny day will invert shakspeares muchcriticised expression making the green one red by making the red one green for on cropping one of these blooming twigs and pressing the buds with your finger you perceive them bursting into infant vegetation  eight and forty hours of genial weather so changes these glowing branches that the eye regales in a prospect of that tender verdure which in vegetable as in human life gives the freshness and complexional delicacy which belongs only to the most early youth of nature so sweet to behold and alas so soon destroyed neither the broad foliage of a more advanced spring nor the rich expansion and coloring of confirmed summer offer any thing so pure there are you know the same changes productive of the same effects in the progress of life in the several stages of its spring summer and autumn  suffer me now to carry you about cleves land imagine that you are seated on one of the rustic benches in a retired part of its delicious wood while i recount to you the gleanings of several tours in its neighborhood  the town of cleves in itself has nothing to recommend it but the excessive beauty of its situation it is a large straggling illpaved place with many good houses and more bad it is however the capital of the duchy and under the domination of his prussian majesty though so near to holland and with such an example of neatness before their eyes the inhabitants of cleves by no means deign to follow it on the contrary they are in their houses streets and not unfrequently in their persons the most disgusting contrasts  but of these disagreeable matters hereafter  as i reached the environs of the town the first day my affections were very singularly interested indeed i know not when they have been more powerfully called forth where the objects of their sympathy were taken not from the human species but from the animal world about a mile from the westerngate i perceived a man and boy busied in doing something to the most beautiful ox i ever beheld as i came nearer i found they were adorning it with a great variety of fanciful ornaments a large collar of yew branches tied with ribbon and wreathed with other evergreens were thrown over its neck painted papers on which were drawn herds flocks and shepherds and folded into large beau knots were fixed i am afraid pinned with large corkers to its skin in various parts of the body bunches of the same were tied to the tail braided into the mane and the brows were hung with a garland of holly of which there was a twist fastened by red filleting even to the horns on the tips of which were stuck little maybushes in bloom  my attention was presently called off from this by the bleat of a sheep and its lamb those creatures were bound to an hedge in a corner of the same enclosure they were dressed nearly in the taste of the ox with this variation in the lamb a collar of several early spring flowers of the field and some twigs of hawthorn in bud and which betwixt sport and earnest it was trying to get into its mouth on asking the cause of all this finery i was told it was upon account of its being a jourdefete and also the day before that of the greatest beef mutton and lamb market in the whole year  and pray friend said i where is the necessity of dressing the animals in that manner  it is our custom sir replies the man driving the ox toward the town and the boy with the sheep and lamb now unbound following his example  i had not time for more interrogatories being wholly taken up with the anticks of the lamb which frolicking sometimes with its mother and sometimes with the boy and sometimes even with its own shadow brought so close under my eye and so near indeed to my very heart the fine lines of mr pope that i repeated them over and over every image of his description had its immediate illustration in the objects before me the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day had he thy reason would he skip and play pleased to the last he crops the flowery food and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood   we gained cleves as i pronounced for the tenth time that impressive verse which gives the moral of the former stanza  o blindness to the future kindly given  the animals were led or rather driven through the principal streets literally for a show it being the practice of westphalia for the butchers to exhibit their meat alive the day preceding the slaughter i pretend to question neither the use nor the necessity of all this nor by any means to stretch pity or feeling beyond their bound i only observe to you that my affections followed these creatures in their funeral procession through the town of cleves and could not leave them till on turning a narrow lane i saw with a kind of emotion you will easily guess the door of the place destined for their destruction it being a practice in this country to slaughter their meat and a very filthy one it is the same vise custom prevails in several parts of holland in the open street the pavements and kennels of which are stained and running with blood  i will carry you no farther into this little adventure than just to note that being the next day obliged to pass the end of the street where i took leave of my poor dumb companions i observed not only several parts of them hang upon hooks at the butchers shop but several of the ornaments even the flowers that were wreathed about the face of the lamb were now crowded into its mouth and spotted with its harmless blood poor little fellow said i thou were yesterday the merriest of the frisking tribe would i never had met thee  if in the course of the week it was my lot to eat any part of these animals at the tables where i then visited as it is most probable was the case consider poor human nature and forgive me i am not preposterous enough to advise a being who is made up of appetites to abstain from the gratification of such as are necessary to existence but while we yield to the stern laws of our mortality let us not you i am sure will not spurn all sort of feeling like the man who on seeing some lambs at sport in a meadow exclaimed  ah ye dear innocent beautiful creatures would to heaven i had a joint of ye today for dinner with nice spinnage and butter  a very different sentiment sprung up in my mind as i surveyed the amputated limbs of these my late associates you remember what the heartmelting otway says on the subject lead lead me like a tame lamb to sacrifice thus in his fatal garlands fine and pleased the wanton skips and plays  trots by the enticing flattering priestess side and much transported with his little pride forgets his dear companions of the plain till by her bound he is on the altar lain and then too hardly bleats   never can this affecting passage be more touchingly illustrated than in the case of my lamb of westphalia  the sheep of this very beautiful country however are not so welllooking nor so good in point of food as might be expected from the rich abundance of their pasturage and the purity of their air they are longer in the visage body and legs than ours their fleeces are more ragged and dirty how different in color and countenance from the fair flocks gleaned in our first sheaf that climb the mountains and frisk along the valleys of our cambria a sheep in wales is really an interesting being you see its mild face peep unexpectedly from the fissure of a rock in the midst of an enormous pile of ruinous stones or you have a full length view as it reposes at the mouth of a fine natural cave or you observe it looking down upon you from a stupendous ridge of rocks on the extreme verge of which it seems to hang till you feel something like an apprehension it should tumble into the vale below and be destroyed but even while your sympathy is thus engaged in its welfare the wanton creature wild as the wind that bleaches it and romantic as the spots on which it feeds will bound from the dizzy precipice where it stood to an height yet more fearful and projecting its neck beyond where you imagine it possible for it to keep the due equilibrium will crop the herbage that vegetates amongst the stony ruins or the flower that makes its flinty bed in the rocks and will continue to climb and descend places the perpendicular of which makes your eyes ache and your head giddy but the cambrian sheep takes its pastime amongst these apparent dangers with so much ease and gaiety you are soon convinced it is rather an object of your envy than compassion  now in westphalia and in most other parts of prussia and germany these animals after they have outlived the frolicks of lambhood have less of this playfulness and indeed become very soon a set of serious ruminating ragged and solemn creatures  the dog that guards them however is generally a very pleasant fellow he is taught to dance and has many other laughable humors and accomplishments but in his business is indefatigable wholly unlike the curs of england where the apathy of the master seems contagious and where even when following their flock both appear to be walking in their sleep the shepherd dogs of this country are like so many perpetual motions if the shepherd wishes to have them driven from one part of pasturage to another to divide to congregate or to conduct them to their fold his dog begins his office which is performed in the following manner he runs round them in a circle or rather three parts of a circle leaving the fourth part open for their passage and he barks all the time if any straggler loiters by the way he enlarges his round till it includes the wanderer who is brought up with the rest he does his work in two equal spaces of ground running from right to left and from left to right it is truly a curious operation and not a little fatiguing since it sometimes continues an hour together without a moments respite from barking and running but like many others it is for the most part labor in vain the sheep are so much in the habit of hearing this eternal yelper that so far from attending to his cries i question whether they hear his voice like those persons who live within the sound of bells at any rate they pay no regard to it for while he is in full cry the sheep step as leisurely as if he was six feet under ground even the ox i have mentioned in a former part of this letter and my poor lamb round whom he galloped in the same way heeded him not the first turned him as it were into contempt and the last into ridicule looking at him without fear while his mouth was wide open and full of antic joining him in his race so that i begin to think our english shepherds cur does the business more effectually  while i am upon the subject of the canine race of which you know i am a professed friend and admirer let me not forget to inform you of an excellent custom prevalent in holland and in westphalia respecting those animals in the dog days namely the law which enacts their being shut up during the sultry season the appearance of a dog of any kind in the streets at such times is punished with just severity now as canine madness perhaps the most lamentable distemper incident to human kind is very rarely heard of in the various parts of the continent that are the objects of these gleanings we must impute it principally to the caution here described go and do likewise is an admonition worthy the adoption of the people of england who suffer deplorable instances of distraction and death arising from the want of some regulation on this subject  far far from the friend of my heart be every malady of the body and of the mind  letter lx to the same cleves may be enrolled amongst the watering places but as those waters contain nothing to distinguish them from a thousand others whose basis is steel with a certain mixture of salts and sulphur i know you will easilydispense with a description of them neither will i take up your time by a detail of the dinner or tea parties in the very wood i have now placed you these sort of accounts resemble the pictures which were censured for being though vastly pretty all alike water drinking or dipping places have in themselves but one character and a description of any will like mr garricks prologues serve as well for one place as another if you turn to any book of travels through any part of modern europe for mineral or salt water to save trouble look in the index and take that which comes first to hand  no matter for the country  you will have a description in point for what has been said and done on these occasions since waterdiving and drinking came into fashion the same talkings walkings intrigues divorces matches made and matches broken covert whispers and open scandals and all the old story of little and great conspiracies since the passions first came into public there is not left a remark generally speaking on these subjects worth a single wheatear so we will pass them by without gleaning just noting one or two particular habits of pleasure that obtain in the neighborhood of the cleves wood  it is the practice for the clevelanders to crowd on a fine sunday to some very good teadrinking houses situate in the park to see tumbling boys and girls and dancing dogs and learned pigs and poultry the spectators place themselves in extensive alcoves open at both ends they almost all are to be seen in the hottest weather drinking the hottest tea with a dozen and often two dozen redhot teaurns under their very noses by way of auxiliary to this heat the men all smoke and take alternately a sup of tea a slice of bread or cake and a whiff of tobacco the married women snuff in proportion the spinsters born and educated amidst fire and smoke disperse the clouds with which their lovers and parents thus envelope them sighs of tenderness and whiffs of the best virginia are puffed forth and mingle in the same breath and the young lady melts in the midst of them i do assure you a kitchen fire in the dog days is dewdropping coolness to the being enclosed in this long green oven and what with the scalding water on the one hand and of the burning fires on the other a stranger finds himself almost suffocated the first time that i myself was stuck betwixt this scylla and charibdis i feelingly saw the force of custom which reconciled the most delicate young women for in point of form and feature westphalia has many such to boast to this hideous practice they seem as collected during this double attack as generalissimos of an army in the heat of action after staying till i was almost boiled on one side and smokedried on the other i fought my escape in the wood the most beautiful paths of which as well public as private where nature breathed the sweetest air displayed the most enchanting pictures and sung the songs of gratitude and joy among her branches were comparatively deserted i am sorry to say that all the concerts societies clubs and other social meetings are deformed by those insufferable fumigations with which every house shop and even every garden is infested  it is thought to be salutary had it been confined to holland i might have possibly come into this notion as a corrector of bad air but when i found it laid all germany in smoke and ashes and thereby spread over countries where every breeze is health i set it down as a vile custom that seeks to hide its filthiness in a weak apology  i cannot but reckon it lefs excuseable than the stoves amongst women  a practice not less universal but which the dampness of the air in the provinces of holland may render necessary it is attended also by worse consequences for there is nothing so rare amongst the dutch prussians or germans as a good set of teeth and as boys accustom themselves to the use of a pipe almost as soon as they can fill hold and light it their teeth are discolored at a time of life when the youth of other countries are alike pure in mind and person this defect is the more obvious in the german young men because the females of the same age are remarkable for exhibiting rows of that pearly whiteness which in europe at least has been usually thought such a constituent in personal beauty the ladies however of prussia and germany being in the habit of seeing a couple of black ranges in the mouths of their lovers and husbands and to receive a whiff of smoke in their faces almost every time they associate or are spoken to by the opposite sex for immediately before and after and sometimes at meals they smoke do not seem to feel the contrast  i particularly remember to have been present at this very town of cleves when amongst other company were two young people who had been given out as passionately fond of one another the lady was playing at her forte piano her lover holding a pipe in one of the filthiest mouths i ever saw and accompanying her in a very pretty german air this air showed the ladys fine rows of ivory to advantage while it exposed her coridons ebony no less to view and at the end of the song a sly and quiet gleaner like myself could perceive that the company were so well pleased with the performers and the performers with themselves that not contented with the general acclamation of the friends they sealed the private applause they bestowed upon one another with so close an approach of faces that though their conscious satisfaction was not expressed and sealed in a kiss heard or hardly seen it certainly was in a kiss felt no one who had been a spectator of this scene would have agreed with the father of the fairfaced desdemona in calling the love she manifested for the moor unnatural she had like the pretty clevelander looked away the sable hue of othello and since she could not find his mind in his visage discovered his visage in his mind poetry and especially the poetry of shakspeare which can do every thing can of course do this but nothing except that custom which the same immortal bard informs us can make the flinty and steel couch of war a thricedrivenbed of down or what is yet even stronger than custom allcommanding love could make a junction of the whitest and blackest fairest and foulest teeth a matter of delight  before i take you from this fair wood into the town of cleves i must prepare you for a few other customs which you will meet with there and in other parts of the duchy and indeed in most places of germany  expect in the first place to find the inhabitants here as in holland too civil by half the courtesy of hatpulling prevails in westphalia to a degree really painful it is a settled point for all natives to make bows to strangers of almost every description so that a traveller has little more to do in the considerable towns than to cover and uncover his head indeed the hats themselves sufficiently show the prevalence of the custom being all of them squeezed into a long roll as compact as a polonie on the takeoff side with the continual gripe of civility in one of my first excursions into this country i took part of a carriage with a young man just come from the independent states of america and glowing with all the unrestrained spirit of his country his objections went to almost every thing he heard or saw in monarchies they began with the head and descended to the feet for he neither endured the uncovering of the one nor the flexibility of the other i honored this ardour of his principles but wished to make them relax a little to the customs of a country i began with the affair of the hat which he swore should be inveterately fixed on his head in his passage through holland adding that he looked upon obeisance to every body without distinction as a servility below the dignity of mans nature let me advise you my friend and my readers to be courteous and to give into this somewhat fatiguing practice it will repay itself by many little urbanities you will wish for and find the germans and westphalians are an obliging race and their excess of hat civility is better than the contrary extreme but civility abroad is by no means confined to making you a passingbow and if it were it is a slight tax upon a traveller to endure and return it  i recollect being much pleased in holland with a union of two things that rarely meet in any country during my hague gleaning i was at the playhouse when the beauty of two ladies both on travel excited the attention of the audience more than the performance but the obscurity and gloom of the hague theater not clearly ascertaining that beauty a great number of the spectators were anxious to see more of the truth and accordingly had arranged themselves after the play in two mighty rows as if by common consent to see the fair strangers pass from their box to their carriage in itself this set and determined stare was certainly one of the rudenesses of curiosity but in order to smoothe away its rough edges the passing meteors no sooner appeared within the lines than as if by common consent also every hat was taken off and every head bowed respectfully to greet them even if the curiosity which beauty very naturally excites did not carry in some degree its excuse along with it it would have been impossible for that beauty to have been offended in the present instance it produced just as it should do a blush of courtesy and consciousness as it passed along not resenting though not inviting the homage which it drew  who is there my friend that ever has past b a single winter in london but must have often seen the heroes of the boxlobby forming themselves into a phalanx hats on heads and opera glasses at eyes to stare out of countenance and out of the house perhaps amidst indecent observations both beauty and innocence let us not quarrel then with civilities that soften away our disgust nor even with public curiosity when it is tempered with public respect  be prepared also for the kissing ceremony which you will find begin in prussian westphalia and extend over every part of the german territories neither treat it with ridicule or disrespect for although it is the custom for both sexes to embrace and to present both sides of the face for salutation after passing only an hour together and though but next door neighbors it means no more than our exchanging the customary civilities of the moment en passant in our own country it signifies in short about as much as the mode of professing ourselves the obedient very humble servan  those indifferent people we meet with in  street or address by letter of business  ceremony  i must repeat that these national habits ought always to be complied with an obstinat refusal in a young countryman of mine  accept of a salute was intended by him  express a scorn of the custom itself particularly in suffering his cheek to come into momentary contact with that of a man but by the gentleman who offered the salute it was construed into his having a bad breath and a fear to discover it  now as an imputation of this kind would be more wounding to the selflove of our petitmaitres and maitresses than perhaps an expulsion from kissing all the days of their lives i advise them to give and lend their cheeks for the kiss of custom without any farther hesitation  i feel it my duty likewise to prepare you for a little imposition in the hotels and private lodgings before you enter them as well as for the counterbalancing agremens  i must lay it down as a first general principle that a prussian and german landlord if he possibly can will overreach you not so much i believe from dishonesty as from an almost innate idea of considering the word englishman sinonimous with the word riches an italian french and every other traveller even a dutchman whom generally speaking they know is well able to pay up to any price demanded may always get accommodated at half price in comparison of the british wanderer  that selfdevoted victim of vanity and folly of this i will give you an instance not produced in resentment for it was rather a subject of pleasantry but in order to put you your friends and every one into whose hands these gleanings may fall on guard  on my first tour to cleves i wished to make a stop of a few months and not readily suiting myself in an hotel i sought private apartments a tradesman of whom i had bought some trifling articles and who spoke very good french offered to attend me to the house of a man who he said had rooms to let and added that he would have the honor to be my interpreter  we went accordingly and i desired my interpreter to ask the price of the rooms when by way of answer came forth another question  master of the house the gentleman i suppose is french  interpreter no  master of the house dutch  interpreter no english  this information consisting only of two monosyllables had the effect of a volume on the mans mind he intended however to be cautious and manage the intelligence but his features betrayed him  he doubled upon me every article as i shall presently show i caused him to be informed that on the receipt of my next letters from england i should be able to decide whether i remained in the town or proceeded farther up the country observing that if i became his inmate it would be impossible to do without a slip of carpeting or some covering by the bed side  that may be had quoth the landlord and so we parted  the expected letters arrived and finding it convenient to pursue my route as far as emeric on the other side of the rhine i gave him notice two days earlier than my promise that as i should be absent a month or six weeks i would not hazard the letting his apartments to a more stationary tenant should any such offer now that this notice might be formal it was translated and delivered by my interpreter here i supposed we had done with one another but the next morning when every thing was ready for my departure the master of the inn where i had slept presented me with a reply to my billet written with a majesty of style that would have better suited the grand frederic who by the way would have given a much more courteous answer than the little great man who was the author or rather dictator for he understood even less of the french than i of the german and was at the expense of a notary  voila le decret despotique de mon maitre dhotel  but as all great events in which great personages are concerned are ushered in with due decorum i shall allot a separate gleaning to it  letter lxi to the same peutetre monsieur que vous vous imaginez quil va ici comme en angleterre ou chaquun joue son roll comme il veut non nous vivons sous le regne dun tell roi qui maintient son plus bas sujet ainsi aucun anglois ne doit simaginer quil peut exercer le roll de langleterre aux etats prussiens  je ne vous ai pas appelle vous etes venu de vous meme aupres moi et vous avez love les chambres et parceque vous lavez desire que je mettrois des tappis sur les planches je les ai achete le lit demonte est remonte et puisque vous avez voulu deja occuper dimanche les chambres je me suis forte derange a mes affairs pour les arranger  pour toutecela jepretend detre dedommage puisque vous navez pas envy de les occuper et je vous demand par celle ci ou vous avez envy de payer le love pour trois mois ou non si non alors je chercherai mon droit a la justice  mitsdorffer cleves ce    mars  as a prussian curiosity you will accept a literal translation of it courteous reader if peradventure thou art not sufficiently in practice with the french language to feel the might and majesty of the sentiments you i know my dear friend can relish them in all their original bombast  translation perhaps sir you imagine you may act here as you do in england where every one does just as he pleases no we live under the government of a king  such a king who supports the rights of his meanest subjects and whosoever dares to suppose he may play the game he does in great britain within the territory of his prussian majesty will find himself mistaken it was not at my invitation you came to my house it was an act of your own free will and you have hired my chambers you desired i would cover the boards with a carpet a carpet i have bought and the boards are covered my bed too has been taken down in one place and put up in another to please you and i am thereby disarranged for all this i expect to have my damages made good and as you do not choose to occupy the lodgings i desire to know whether you choose to pay for them i speak of the three months for which they are let to you if yes well if no i shall seek my right from the laws of the land whereof i have the honor to be a member  boooo  there is for you was ever the popes bull fulminated with more vengeance  mine here said my landlord had better postpone his journey till this little ugly affair is settled for there is no answering to the lengths this hotheaded man may go and to be stopped on the road by the officers of justice would be disagreeable officers of justice officers of nonsense said i i sent for my interpreter who though a native of the place did not by good luck take the part of his townsman on the contrary he accompanied me swearing all the way in high dutch never to have made any mention of three months nor any contract whatsoever he increased his pace in proportion as he increased his oaths and these running affidavits presently brought us to the scene of action the landlord was in the very chamber in dispute which we found sure enough sufficiently deranged had a score of swine herded in them they could not have been in a more filthy situation neither curtains nor mat nor carpet nor any furniture but that of which i had at first complained the fury of the interpreter was equal to the dismay of the prussian dictator our visit to the latter was so unexpected and our detection of him so unequivocal that he could not reply to the denunciations of my linguist who pursuing his advantages laid about him like a drawcansir the host at last felt himself galled and ventured the retort uncourteous this produced a rejoinder that again a replication which ran through the whole vocabulary of angry eloquence in the heat of which i left the combatants and with great coolness departed for emeric but on passing cleves some months after i fell in company with the very gentleman who occupied these memorable apartments for the use of which his board inclusive he paid to a stiver per month what had been demanded of me per week but then he was a prussian and i  an englishman  i cannot write this latter name without an almost equal mixture of pride and indignation pleasure and regret i grieve that it is rendered less respectable abroad than at home and that by the purseproud vanity or dissipated pageantry of individuals the character of an whole nation suffers more than once in the course of these gleanings have i been forced upon this unwelcome subject and i must now take it up again because i can no other way my loved friend account to you or to the public for a multitude of impositions which lie in reserve which are absolutely in waiting for my countrymen the moment they have crossed the channel and which like costly and troublesome companions fasten themselves to his pursestrings till they leave not a rack behind for all which i am sorry to say englishmen have nobody to blame but themselves  in the first place they take over with them english ideas of expense into other countries  secondly they take over also a large cargo of national pride wishing to spread the general received notion of english wealth being greater than that of other countries  thirdly they are in a habit of prodigality at home which is too inveterate in waste to make economical retrenchments abroad and even if they set out on a saving principle they soon glide into the extravagant passion  now from a cooperation of all these it is really wonderful to consider how wide the mischief is disfused a swiss officer and prussian gentleman counciled me to let a friend of theirs make my bargains and purchases as we were to travel some time in company and make stops at the same places i yielded to this good advice but counteracted its effect by being his associate it was found out by some means or another that i was an englishman and that was more than enough the persons  whether dutch prussians or germans  mean not to overreach you they intend only to ask up to the character our countrymen have established for riches they even design sometimes an extortion as a compliment because it presupposes the preeminent wealth of our nation they argue too that while you come so many hundred or thousand leagues from home it is not possible you should want money since if you did you would naturally stay at home  thus a foolish ambition of keeping up a false reputation begins on the other side of the water and travels with you to the end both of water and land taking london as the center it has gone in as many directions as there are great post roads even to the once cheap parts of the british empire yorkshire scotland and wales in every inch of these you feel the heavy hand of an english travellers profusion forced into your pocket those necessaries of life which thirty years back might be comfortably procured for the third of their present purchase at an english market soon mounted to the half then they rose to three parts and now unless you enter into engagements very advisedly the difference of english expenditure will scarcely warrant the charge of taking so long a journey shall i be answered that the difference in these gradations arises from the difference of the times refinements luxuries etc certainly these increase the evil but even at this day as i stated to you in a former letter the great articles of life are to be had at more than an half in half average with the english market it will assuredly be granted that fish flesh fowl eggs butter and houserent are the chief of those articles and all these are to be had as i have before described the fair inference is that where taxation or refinement have levied one impost national pride and habitual folly have levied twenty the natives themselves both in the above countries and in those more remote have candor enough to acknowledge this but now the habit of charge is as strong as the profusion by which it was at first created and the simplicity and economy of a place once destroyed like a wounded character never recovers itself on the contrary extortion and extravagance erect a sort of temple to folly on their ruins and an imposition taught to others by ourselves becomes the custom of a country till in the end foreigners think they have a presumptive right to cheat you the same spirit that induces us to spoil the places nearer home enables us to ruin our residences and accommodations abroad our profusion traverses the whole continent of europe the alps and pyrennees sink before it and wherever as in westphalia from the natural abundance of a country or the want of traffic or distance from a public mart the necessaries of life are still to be got at half price they would i am convinced have remained at a third less than at present had it not been for english profusion english pride and english prejudice  under these comfortless prospects of being imposed upon by our own countrymens folly even when out of england  for i insist on it they are the aggressors  i do not think i can render to my countrymen at this distance from them  or to you my friend whom i suppose to be so near a greater service  than to note the actual rates of living and the comparative dearness or cheapness of the several countries in which i have resided this is certainly another very humble office but a no less useful one and either on account of its humility or utility has been strangely misrepresented or overlooked  once more making england a centrical point of traveling the expenditure will be found to ascend in a series as you pass along i e the farther removed from the center the less you spend  supposing a less influence from examples of english extravagance  the difference of charge even to perfect strangers  and making allowances for a predetermination almost every where to overreach you to the verge of the laws of the land  is almost incredible what english traveling at home comes to i need not state either in lodgings at inns or on the road houseing you safe on this side of the water you immediately would perceive the difference were you disposed to begin your estimate for although you may be chagrined at the necessity of keeping your purse in the hand in your tour through holland were you to separate one charge from another you would even admitting some extortion find the balance in favor of dutch imposition no my friend thrown without the arms of language acquaintance or experience of customs on the mercy of the hollanders you would last longer that is you would be less speedily devoured by the dutch than by your own countrymen under like circumstances but though your devoration would be more slow it would not be less sure i e were you not to buy and dearly buy knowledge as you go on and had you no honest and diligent wayfaring traveller to glean the paths before you  leaving you however as just observed undefended amongst the hollanders you would not so soon be swallowed up as by the english the difference of charges is remarkable in going only from one province to another and when you have left the dutch boundaries and gained the prussian dominions you perceive the cheating of one country so much more endurable than that of another that in this instance at least whatever may be your political principles you would prefer the despotic states to the republics  and exclaim with poor lear the wicked compared with the more wicked seem beautiful and not to be the worst stands in some rank of praise i believe i have used this quotation in some former letter but it becomes apposite again and you will excuse repetition how well it applies at present you shall immediately judge at the best inn of cleves my charge for twelve days was little more than a guinea sterling and for which i was accommodated with a very good bedroom the use of the general sittingroom and an excellent table adorned with the best company as well residents as travelers at one of the largest inns of the hague it cost me precisely that sum a guinea for one days worse living worse lodging and worse attendance having mentioned to you the name of the more reasonable hague landlord i trust your faith in my account will lead you to choose the good and to avoid the bad and therefore it becomes unnecessary to specify the person by whom i was thus overcharged but justice requires i should tell you and the world that the name of the cleves landlord is nysa  to prevent the trouble of enquiry and the vexation of being reduced to contests at a place of public accommodation i will take this opportunity to set down the sixed prices of all the most reputable table dhotes public eatinghouses and hotels in the provinces of holland and in prussian westphalia  holland florins stivers doits breakfast 0   0 dinner   0 0 bottle of rhine or bourdeaux wine   0 0 bed 0    0 fire if in your own room per day 0    0 westphalia florins stivers doits breakfast 0   0 bed fire included 0   0 dinner 0  0 0 bottle of wine 0  0 0  in holland the train of waiters shoeboys etc are at the heels of your bill and interrupt though not with equal boldness of authority your way to the horse or carriage in westphalia these supernumeraries are all paid by their master and included in their wages the above statement then will serve you through both countries from helveotsluice or the hague to the farthest end of the prussian states and the variations are unimportant in your route to berlin on the one hand and to vienna on the other  it should be noted that the money of holland is nominally double that of prussia i say nominally because in the exchange it makes little to a travellers advantage but in purchase of the articles of life it is half in half indeed the coin more especially the silver is of so base materials that the circulation is almost wholly confined to prussia it is refused currency even on the frontiers of holland the cleves money will not pass even at nimeguen where there is a constant reciprocal communication  it will be proper to mention to you the names and valuation of the cleves and prussian coins i shall here however make a general observation on the subject of the coins of prussia and germany the natives i mean thereby the common tradesmen who are ever upon the watch for strangers admit that the dutch money is in effect double the value of theirs such for instance as that forty stivers prussia are given for twenty holland but that it is fair to charge four stivers for a commodity which may be had in holland for two a piece of logic which they justify on the ground of your ignorance being greater than their cunning luckily however the price of public boats and public carriages are settled by ordinance though even this is liable to abuse and the seller sometimes passes a cheat on the buyer under the pretended sanction of government i had occasion to stop at an inn of maiseland sluice in holland with a good deal of baggage and i also took my dinner or rather luncheon being too late for one barge and too soon for another when i came to pay the bill i found so many extra charges that i resisted payment till i had asked a few questions  gleaner what is the meaning of this charge   hotelkeeper it is by order of the states general   gleaner and this   hotelkeeper the ordinance is also by the states general   gleaner and this   hotelkeeper is settled by the states general   gleaner i can only say then that the states general are aiders and abetters if not principals in the most enormous plunder upon a strangers property of any people on earth   to this remark the hotelkeeper smiled assent but plundered on i complained of several particulars to the commissary of the town who redressed both my wrongs and those of the republic by assuring me every iota was imposition for which he sentenced the landlord to deductions on almost every article and attended me in person to see justice duly administered i certainly enjoyed not a little the confusion of the extortioner and was malicious enough to remind him at every refund that he paid me back the extorted money by order of the states general   that you may be prepared and compare them with those of holland they shall be given in the supplementary pages of this closing sheaf where a number of pickingsup shall be thrown into one or two general letters properly speaking a letter of scraps on different subjects gathered in different countries valuable perhaps when made into a collection but too minute to stand alone i have many of these lieing in slips of paper on the backs or edges of letters in my drawer of memorandas which i fill as i empty my pockets after a walk a ride a visit etc etc and i shall set apart a stayathomeday to arrange and transmit them meantime we are just now too much in the heat of business in gleaning the things of the first necessity alas poor dear human nature of what eating and drinking and other frail materials art thou compounded to amuse ourselves with affairs less solid if a traveller wishes to become residentiary for a few weeks or months in any of the pleasant german towns and brings with him his family the best way is to make an agreement with a traiteur a cook and live with him if as is often the case he happens to have a good house this besides the accommodation of having your repast comfortable and warm is cheaper by nearly half as it includes the price of a room i know a gentleman who says he is well served with breakfasts and dinners suppers are rarely taken abroad and two good chambers for twentyone florins about one guinea at par per month in a very popular part of prussian westphalia but even if you take private lodgings and are only supplied from a traiteurs with eatables you gain importantly on england  as thus dinners which imply a sufficiency for suppers as you always are entitled to keep what is sent you are twelve holland stivers ahead  about a shilling english it is called one portion it consists of four covered dishes which with bread cheese butter and sallads that are always found by yourself contain enough for two meals as two portions do for four  i was present at a bargain of this kind being made at cleves with one of the many public cooks of that place he was on the edge of becoming a victim to his ignorance in these matters when an honest prussian who was present with a friendly presence of mind observed to the cook  certainement monsieur est un peu catholic il ne mange pas de viande tous les jours i took the hint and told the man that when i wanted a double portion he should know it in time to make the necessary addition this reduced the monthly charge which had previously been made to about one pound fifteen shillings  let me not fail to apprize you moreover that the buying your wine of a merchant and of an hotelkeeper or cook is on an average difference of more than half in half in holland prussia and germany  at the inns of holland you will pay for tablewine one florin ten stivers half a crown at those of prussia and germany from sixteen stivers to one florin and at the merchants of the first country for the same wine eight stivers and in the two other countries so low as six stivers or seven at most and let it not be forgotten that the eight penny wine is precisely the same as to quality for which with duties on foreign spirits you pay in england from five to seven shillings a bottle  there are certain articles so incredibly cheap even in these times of general scarcity every where that i want almost confidence in my own conviction or in my trust of your candor to make just report of them in various provincial towns both in the neighborhood of the upper and lower rhine the best butter is sold in the month of may at twopence per pound a very fine young fowl at four and five pence a duck the same butchers meat at twopence and twopence halfpenny a full grown hare at eight nine or tenpence sometimes at still less a goose or turkey at tenpence when at the dearest and the finest westphalia ham from threepence to fourpence per pound houserent is in proportion i leave you therefore to judge how comfortable a family pinched for necessaries and perhaps struggling betwixt the extremes of pride and poverty in england may live in the german territories and yet i still cannot help giving wales the preference for two reasons  first because it is nearly as cheap and in a part of my own country and does not take money out of the british dominions and secondly because it contains more general beauty than any thing to be met with without taking a long journey which with a family is in itself the expenditure of more than could be expected from a twelvemonths savings as the retreat of an unconnected person or of a family resolved to establish in a new country and as dr young says fixing would be fixed it would be really a saving without abridgement of comforts and even luxuries of thirty or forty per cent eggs are frequently fifteen for twopence and seldom less than ten and firing is proportionably cheap bread however is nearly the same price as in england i mean such as is made from the white flour but they grow an inferior kind considerably darker when baked than our farmhouse loaves which is eaten with a farmhouse appetite not only by the peasantry but most other people by way of qualifying its bitter and sour taste the better sorts of folks place their butter betwixt a slice of the black and a slice of the white bread and when they wish to luxuriate as on a dainty or to distinguish their hospitality to a friend a two penny loaf of the entire white is brought forth and cut into as many morsels as there are persons to be regaled  it will seem incredible to an english reader whatever be his situation to be told that a german bill of fare consists of little more than what is appointed for a meagre day rigidly maintained insomuch that the westphalians prussians and germans in general may be duly and truly said to keep lent all the year i am authorized by truth to assure you from long experience of their table that the yearly expenditure of a large family in any of the abovenamed countries would scarce exceed if it could reach that of an english farmers household consisting of an equal number of people for a single month an enormous dish of potatoes cabbages carrots beans and other vegetables forms the basis of their dinner which with all ranks is taken at twelve oclock it is a very great luxury when half a pound of pork bacon or butchers meat is stuck in the midst of this medley as the grand center of attraction and yet this precious morsel is rather for ornament than use rather to be admired and gazed on like other forbidden fruit than eaten a variety of trifles from the garden forms the desert which is rather tasted than enjoyed if there happens to be any thing more recherche more valuable than a nut or an apple and a small platefull even of these become so familiar to the eye that they pall upon the sense before you are presented with a fresh supply i protest to you that i was so accustomed to look on a fruit plate and its contents for such a length of time at a table in westphalia that i knew every speck and freckle about them as well as the faces of the family indeed i had opportunities to see them so constantly and closely that each apple and pear became a memento mori to the family  in the beginning of the week they came fresh from the tree with their best look and blooming complexions a very few of them alas were cut off in this the prime of their lives the rest were brought on the second day not much altered in their shapes or air on the third there was a visible alteration  nevertheless the young folks of the family for there were many children sighed and looked sighed and looked sighed and looked and sighed again but alas sighed and looked looked and sighed sighed and longed in vain it was written in the fathers face  ye may not eat while the indulgent matron cut one into as many quarters as she had sons and daughters and the next day the father being in a frolicsome humor threw an apple and a pear after dinner amongst them on the floor where they were as much fought for as josephs coat and produced as much shame to the vanquished and triumph to the conquerors as if they were heroes and kings battling it away for thrones and dominions perhaps on the true estimate as little worthy of contest toward the end of the week my old friends in the fruitplate began to drop off one by one and though it is amongst my habits never to eat of those things which the master of the house discovers to me by his manner he considers as a rarity in compassion to these poor things i took off their dusty coats and thereby prevented a more lingering death  some weeks after i dined at the same gentlemans house and though to be sure a man would not choose to swear to an apple i could all but make oath that i observed amongst the reenforcements of the well remembered fruitplate one pippen which was so palpable by his marks that i recognized him as an old acquaintance the moment he came in my view  now be it known to you this was by no means in the season of the year when apples are laid up like honey in the hive for winter provision but when they would in england have come fresh from the tree at every meal it is strict economy that urges this extreme forbearance in almost every thing that regards in short that either smells or tastes like a luxury and it is imposed by a very stern necessity for germany and poverty are almost synonimous terms and though in particular instances such a thing as wealth is to be found the general run of people in all conditions are reduced to observe a most scrupulous frugality in all things their income being usually such as to inhibit the least article of profusion  nor is this economy confined to the appetites it extends to the ornaments of life i had almost said to its vanities but it may be done in effect to promote these you shall decide on this after i have informed you it is the universal practice to undress after a visit a lady or gentleman no sooner returns home than they lay aside their costly robes and get into their slippers nightgowns yea and nightcaps also and appear extremely surprised to learn it is a general custom in england to keep on their out of door dresses as they are called in germany when they are amongst family friends nor could i easily reconcile them to my following the custom of my country in this particular till i had assured them changing my dress frequently gave me cold they call this stripping practice putting themselves at their ease but it is in truth purely done for economy  frugality is an early part of education in these countries insomuch that it is common to observe a wellbred young lady in some of the best families wash up the teathings immediately after they are done with and in the midst of the company who have been using them at first i supposed this was a menial office imposed by a cross papa or overmanaging mamma but when i became a residentiary gleaner i saw it so much the fashion of every family that i inform you of it as a general rule not only in germany but in holland also  the natives of these places not only eat sparingly as having little to eat but they eat seldom  and drink as often as they can the custom of slight breakfasts vegetable or rather hodgepodge dinners and yet slighter frequently no suppers has its beginning in holland travels to westphalia like a slender current narrowing as it goes with respect to quantum and is at its perfection of economy in the empire the only thing in which they yield to profusion at their own expense is in the article of tea and coffee this they take almost every hour but without sugar the women snuff and the men smoke over it but they usually drink it out of cups that scarce hold so much as an acorn and though from the quantity taken this custom gives perpetual trouble they still prefer these diminutive machines which would scarce serve a fairy to sip dew drops to think of a wide dutch mouth screwed up to the dimensions of such a sprite  it is i find very true that the english are every where looked on to be exceedingly carnivorous and it is true also that an englishman will devour more solid flesh in a day and pour down his throat more inflammatory liquid than a prussian german or dutchman in three days an english traveller however soon assimilates to the general temperance of the country the consequence of which is that instead of wasting an whole afternoon in an hot room amidst the fumes of the table or sleeping to relieve an overloaded stomach he feels alert either for business or pleasure and seems to wonder at this change of himself  i have just mentioned to you the early dinners on this part of the continent but forgot to note to you that the reason assigned for it is exactly the reverse of what is given out for a four or five oclock repast in great britain we eat at midday says the foreigner that we may have a long afternoon we eat in the evening says the englishman that we may have a long morning the customs of a country ought certainly to give and receive allowances but i have found this difference in the hours productive of great difficulties between some of my countrymen and foreigners the first insisting that as twelve oclock was too late for breakfast and too soon for dinner it could be considered only as the hour proper for a luncheon and the other declaring that sitting down to table at such an unseasonable time was insupportable for my own part i am blessed with so social an appetite that it seems made for a ready compliance with the customs of all countries is it the fashion of the family to eat at noon i sit down and forget that i had not been used to think about dinner till nearer night does my meal make its appearance with the candles be it so i eat heartily if i am well and if i am sick i play with my knife and fork to keep those who are better company now this versatility in my disposition leads me into many pleasures and contentments which less accommodating tempers can never hope to enjoy it is peculiarly estimable in traveling for can it be reasonably expected that without being well paid for it people will come into the customs of a stranger and forego their own will you tell them it is polite to go to dinner when they are going to supper or as an individual are you to derange a family who in turn could tell you that the politeness of their country settles these matters on very different principles who is to adjust this knotty point you fall out with your dinner and with each other how easily would a little candor and courtesy place it just where it should be  o good humor thou least difficult yet brightest of the social virtues  thou creator and supporter of every other  where is the land the habit the manners which are not reconciled to the heart by thy assuasive and smiling power inspired by thee i feel myself disposed to be happy and i am so to impart it to all with whom i mix in this now jarring world and i succeed  and did the fond parent know thy value as i know it he would pray that his darling child was rather filled with thee than favored by beauty genius or fortune for what are these but the miserable children of conceit pride and folly unprotected and uninspired by thee  from what has been said on the very necessary though very much neglected subject of eating and drinking it will i trust appear manifest that if a traveller will be content to buy a little experience which is no where to be had without paying for and if he will not be too much in a hurry to make his arrangements and while they are adjusting indulge his heart in a few effusions of that good humor i have been addressing he may be very comfortable to himself and no less acceptable to others but if he will be stubborn and inflexibly attached to his own opinions manners and customs and not come into those of other people in other countries he has nothing to do but to live by himself according to his fancy and  pay accordingly  but i forget that all this time while i have been discussing the subjects of the table i have seated you in the cleves wood and left you in a worse situation even than the germans without any dinner at all rise then my friend and that you may no longer want an opportunity i put an end to my letter with the usual assurances of being affectionately yours  letter lxii to the same taking it for granted that you will feel yourself refreshed before you sit down to the perusal of another letter and that all those who may become its readers will bring along with them good spirits and goodnature i will invite your attention to some further gleanings on the circle of westphalia  you are not now to learn that prussia is a catholic country where however protestantism in the presbyterian form is largely interspersed the churches are every where the objects that first catch the eyes of travelers for which reason i suppose it is that you meet so many steeples and towers monuments and escutcheons in almost every book of modern travels  catholic churches in particular as being more ornamental have been so often described by publishing travelers that they are perhaps the only objects in the wide field of foreign observation which have been measured with an accuracy that leaves nothing for the gleaner open the books of these authors at whatever page you may and it is odds but you see half a dozen spires followed by a long history of their founders destroyers rebuilders redestroyers revolutions etc two churches and a castle to a leaf is moderate reckoning and it is well if you get off without a morsel of choice biography on the quarrels and rogueries virtues and vices of the prince bishops beggarly priests or despotic lords of the castle for the cacoethes describendi if i may be allowed to sport with the latinity is as strong in some wandering biographers as in juvenile poets when first they fancy themselves in love and present you with that picture of their idols which imagination has drawn for them for myself and i suppose others may feel like me on the occasion i never without trembling observe a traveled author set in for a long story of churches chapels chateaus and picture galleries with a determination to give their moving accidents by flood and fire during the wear and tear and traditionary lying of half a score centuries and what after all are you presented with but a meagre account into which the mind and memory of the reader vainly look for something whereon to rest  something more worthy the human faculties than annals of the intriguing abbots mischievous priests and grinding seigniors buried under their ruins i venerate antiquity but must have something that comes closer to the soul the understanding or the affections than this collection of literary brickwork and traveling stone masonry peace to the ashes of the mouldering universe unless surviving virtues or immortal actions lie amongst the ruins and like the phoenix only want an honest helping hand to clear away the earthy obstructions to spring above them i would not rescue an altar or the canonized bones of a saint from oblivion unembalmed by such virtues and such actions the dust of a monarch and the dust of the earth that covers him is to me exactly the same thing and as to the relics of a worthless being to what good end could they be brought from the tomb but as a maukin to show the villains of the present generation that to such complexion must they come at last  in that light only have i sometimes as in the instance of a john of leyden burst the searments of the grave and gleaned the coffin of a scoundrel  respecting church matters therefore i shall certainly not swell the list of historians but after i have made one general observation shall content myself with the relation of a single circumstance  it is really a most heartaffecting satisfaction in a circuit of some hundreds of leagues such as i have taken over different catholic countries to see the decent impression that is made on the peasantry which is ever the most numerous body of a state by religion of the higher ranks who lose their principles and their education too often in the pride of philosophy i shall here say nothing but the influence of the catholic faith on the subordinate ranks is almost without an exception a sober and sincere attention to the duties it enjoins the earnest yet tempered zeal with which the common labourer leaves his business or his pleasure to commune with his maker is amongst the comfortable sights that every traveller must surely have noticed and noticing must have enjoyed in the plebeian part of the community at least it must be genuine the infidel philosophy of the great is happily above their reach the hypocritical mummery or profounder chicane of the yet perhaps more infidel priesthood i speak of the catholic churchmen is still more happily above the understanding of the peasant he can have no views from interest from the worlds applause or from the worlds disapprobation his religion after education has settled it in his mind becomes one of the strongest habits  it soon ripens into his most powerful principles it is presently a voluntary offering and one of perfect free will to his god he accepts its pains and penalties and never resists their infliction he is told by his confessor of a sin and he suffers for it willingly neither does he perform its duties so mechanically as may be supposed  he goes to the church at all times and seasons the gates of the temple are always open but he is not forced to enter at the stated stroke of the pendulum or chime of the bell if his soul feels not the impulse if it prefers the sacred moment when the hour of public worship is past he can withdraw himself from the gaze of the world and converse as it were with his creator face to face and in the catholic churches which i have gleaned even with a suspicious vigilance this is very frequently done and always with reverence strangers drawn by curiosity only may pass in groupes from all quarters of the earth and dressed in all the different habits of their country without seducing the kneeling catholic peasant from his duty his posture is unaltered his prayer unbroken he rarely lends an ear to conversation which is too often irreverently loud and not often an eye to their persons  from this exterior decency it is fair to infer an internal piety it is to be sure a world replete with subtle stratagem and false appearances but if ever there can be supposed to be a principle unmixed with baser matter this surely is the most free from alloy and if one could select from the mass of enormities which the present governors of france have committed and single out an act more foul more cruel than the rest i should not hesitate to pronounce their attempt to convert the simple heart to equality of atheism  the augean stable of the catholic church so far as it was connected with politics no doubt wanted cleansing and possibly some of its most aspiring heads well deserved le glaive de la loi the sword of justice but to my feelings and it has arisen out of my observation better far better had the convent and the cloister been polluted by the whole chicane of the priesthood than that so many hundreds of thousands of blameless beings should not only want in future the comfort of a refuge in misery and of a guide in happiness but should be taught that the benefits and blessings of the past derived from this sacred source were the trick of a designing race and that for the time to come the laws of reason and nature that is infidelity and licentiousness are to supersede those of a savior and redeemer of the world then by way of proving their proselytism and faith in the new creed they are instead of bowing the knee to the cross they are to turn from it in mockery like the revilers of old or to level it with the dust glorious revolution and more glorious revolutionists to lay the foundations of a republic in human blood and erect a temple to infidelity on the ruins of religion in the ancient fabric were there defects why not repair them must it fall that a worse may be raised  but i forget myself  a scourge was wanted in the land and ye were perhaps the proper instruments to deal destructions for who can punish iniquity like the wicked  but i promised you to close with the relation of a circumstance which i owe to the catholic church half an hours walking by the side of the cleves wood brings you to a little village chapel whose bell was ringing out for evening vespers just as i paid it my first visit only a few of the congregation were then gathered together i had therefore time to make an unobtrusive gleaning amongst the usual decorations of pictures paintings flowers and crucifixes i could not but take notice of the virgin in a chintzpattern linen gown over a full dress hoop of immense circumference ornamented with three distinct rows of silver crosses the middle row abundantly the largest the crown upon her head was formed of broken beads and pieces of lookingglass the child jesus held an apple in his hand partly eaten to express what eve had fraudulently accepted and shared with the devil  i might have yielded up my gravity at the burlesque manner in which this part of sacred story was caricatured had not the ridicule it was so well calculated to excite been checked by my observing an old man and woman two young men and two female children kneeling with every mark of devotion round the figures they are of one house said a person who stood near me and in the sequel i found that that house had to boast an holy family the very moment that i looked upon them the spirit of mockery died within me and a much better spirit came upon me in its stead i had no longer eyes to criticize the figures nor an heart to break a jest on their absurdity as representatives of the blessed virgin and redeemer of the world they filled me with awe and i caught so much of unaffected holiness from these humble suppliants as to hold sacred the coarsest imitations and symbols of things divine  it happened to be the jour de pacque on the evening of which festival there prevails in westphalia a custom that i felt was worth gleaning for you and for the public you shall have it here the prussian peasants commemorate the solemn event of our saviors resurrection in a singular manner in each village of the circle are to be seen three or four large bonfires which the inhabitants have been preparing at their intervals of daily labor during the preceding week the fires are lighted about nine at night about ten when they are in full blaze the populace and indeed people of all distinctions go out of the cleves gates to view them i was lucky enough at the moment to be on a visit to a gentleman who at a small distance from the western port had a summer house that commanded the country to the extent of twenty leagues every quarter or half league has a village and the whole twenty leagues were illuminated it was in itself an interesting novelty but when the occasion was contemplated and combined with it the heart glowed like the horizon in the midst of the scenery rose the moon she was at full but at the moment of rising seemed another bonfire beginning to kindle and ascend she soon however asserted her superiority and when she had gained her proper station in the hemisphere i could not help repeating to myself a few words applicable to both  hide your diminished heads ye feeble works of mens hands but thou cynthia art of god no wonder then at thy luster but even as i pronounced this i corrected my rashness my injustice  and so are ye ye feeble fires  added i  of god also and every humble spark shall ascend to heaven  letter lxiii to the same i have already more than once in the course of this correspondence attempted to check the heady current of national prejudice which appropriates all that is estimable in human nature to itself and leaves to the rest of the world only its vices vanities and insignificancies i have given many examples of urbanity that have been the growth of soils less celebrated than that of britain or than what once was france i have shown it flourishing even in the unwholesome clime of holland let me now offer you an instance of its blooming power in westphalia in truth it is a flower appropriate to no particular country but will prosper wherever it is duly cultivated its natural soil is the human heart in which it springs up and thrives very soon after that heart begins to beat and would continue till there is no longer motion were not passions and prejudices for ever at work to check its growth or kill it in the hud  in one of the most profound recesses of this beautiful country at the distance of at least forty leagues from a court thirty from a city and at least ten miles from a market town i once found urbanity that would have given luster to them all i found her in a cottage of clay at the foot of a prussian forest under covert of which i was shaded from observation it was on one of the most lovely evenings a wanderer like myself could have defird and according to my emigrant disposition i had enjoyed it from the uprise even to the downgoing of the sun the sun indeed of that distinguished day was making a golden set just as i reached the precincts of the wood where i had not reposed many minutes ere i heard the sound of a flute accompanied by a voice whose natural sweetness excelled it in melody the notes were indeed assisted by many harmonizing circumstances you who are a lover of nature know what a variety of soothing sounds pervade the air at eventide in the summer  the pure breath of the zephir the distant rivulet that seems by its indolent lapse and subdued murmur to partake of human sensations  the drowsy hum of the beetle which the poet has immortalized and the general sighing of the leaves with perhaps the horn of the herdboy and the lowing of his cattle obedient to his summons  and above all those founds which imagination herself creates  all these contribute to form that twilight enchantment which a tender heart and a benevolent disposition so much delights in and which men of the world consider as the daydreams of madmen  had i time to spare from my cottagers it would be amusing to run at some length the parallel betwixt a lover of nature and a man of the world and to examine the estimate that each makes of the objects assembled in the last passage to attempt this in abridgement    st the man of the world would never be tempted to leave the cheerful haunts of men without what is called a jolly party five out of the six of which probably wishing themselves as many different ways before half the day is over and at last going yawning home thoroughly tired with if not hating one another for i have so often observed a party of pleasure to be so painful a plot upon the members that compose it that were i to compile a new dictionary in which definitions were honestly to be given i should under the words party of pleasure inform the reader that it is meant to signify the association of a set of persons met together with tastes and tempers frequently discordant and interests in opposition yet determined to congregate for the purpose of teasing one another under the mask of social goodfellowship which mask generally drops or is torn off in the course of a few hours to the discovery of the whole conspiracy  such is the mere man of the worlds party of pleasure yes and womans of the world also   nd a man of the world has no conception of the breath or sounds of  or in the air in the way that a lover of nature feels and enjoys them a man of the world indeed observes that it is cursed hot and throws up the sashes or cursed cold and pulls down the blinds  the inflammatory bottles ten times more burning than the sunbeams are still on the table  yet at the fashionable hour he goes forth  where  to the public walks  for what purpose  to see the public  but goes he not into the beautiful woods  yes into the public parts of them where he has a chance to see the world he loves so well  and is he never led by his fancy or his feelings into the sequestered parts where nature modestly and humbly displays her genius and graces no my friend ladies and gentlemen of the world usually avoid these byeroad beauties unless carried thither by some passion that shuns the day  and as to claybuilt cottages woodland inhabitants rustic songs and lazy waterfalls they are passed by as fit only for country corydons or shepherdesses bemusd far different is the attractive scenery of a worlds man and woman  the broad and beaten track amidst the crush and clatter of coaches which are so wedged together that they move as if in funeral procession  walks so crammed that you cannot pass without difficulty  a cluster of glaring lamps stuck upon trees to the blush of the moon beam  the sun himself shut out to make way for a parcel of artificial lights brought into an unwholesome room crowded with company and card tables  a kind of elegant pesthouse where people infect one another by common consent and are suffocated on principles of politeness  these are the appreciated scenes of men and women of the world  and i ought not to sail observing that amongst these wellbred broiled and roasted who sit with the perseverance of an hatching hen as if nailed to the sides of the card table  there are always a certain number of sentimental misses who affect to have souls superior to such waste of time and build up a sort of reputation on never touching a card but when politeness or a dowager mamma insists on her making up the set  these damsels fidget or glide about the rooms and ogle their fair images in the pier glasses till picked up by stray batchelors or cut out married men or songtranscribing young striplings who get into prattling parties or file off into corners ser a touch of the patheticks or construct the horn work of a future fiege in a whispered tete a tete most of these light troops assure you of their detestation of the town but yet run their pretty faces into one or other of its hothouses every night and go through a summer campaign amidst more fire and smoke than would melt down the constitution of the whole body of aldermen mean time there is another set dispersed here and there insidiously laying a mine to blow up reputations and while the game of the other parties goes on these engineers prepare a very notable masked battery and play off their artillery as if only in a mock action at your wife or daughter till they almost surrender at discretion before your face the play amongst the card veterans becomes too intense for observing on any stratagems but their own the card passions are all at work breaking the unlucky chairs of some biting the lips gnashing the teeth slapping the foreheads or stamping the feet of others and while the honors are lost by one and the odd trick gained by another the mistress of the house slaves in hospitality and struggles through the elegant mob with more toil and difficulty than a landlady at an election dinner  but somewhat too much of this let us fly from these artificial beings to the children of nature and the heart suffer me to reconduct you to the simple yet everblooming paths from which these worldwarped tribes have too long led us astray  allow me to place you once more within sight of the flute and voice i mentioned to you before and listen to the magic that ensued the wood notes wild as they were charmed me i rose and advanced a few paces brought me within sight of a cottage door which was wide open the song and music proceeded mingled with dancing of which i could rather hear the happy step than perceive the enlivening figure but i was presently observed and actually as fair a maid accompanied by as blooming a youth as arcadia ever fancied tripped forward without quitting hands to invite me into their dwelling you are here prepared for the white washed wall the nicely sanded floor the decent clock that clickd behind the door etc all these and more were to be seen but the insides of cottages in all countries have been so many thousand times furnished and unfurnished either by real tourmakers or those who like the virtuoso in the comedy only travel in books then publish their travels through other peoples books all which you know may be very commodiously done at home without stirring out of their elbowchairs and moreover bookcottages are all so much alike for neatness accommodation arrangement and furniture that i could rather wish you would upon this as upon a former occasion make choice of the description you like best out of the whole collection of voyages and travels that may be in your library and assure yourself that whatever comes nearest to a simplicity which does not exclude convenience will give you a just idea of my westphalian cot  as the first day of the carme was solemnizing while i was at the village chapel so that on which i entered this woodland habitation was the last of that festival and this peasant family were then celebrating it religion therefore no less than hospitality and both under guidance of sincerity invited me to assist at the felicity every simple delicacy of fruit and flower was in an instant placed before me their discourse was so provincial that probably a german citizen of cleves might have found a difficulty to decypher it but the language of bounty like that of love is universal all heads can reach it and all hearts conceive it is the volume of nature one of its fairest pages was spread open had i run i could have read it and believe me my generous friend it exhibited instruction well worth the observance of those who live in prouder dwellings i found here no broad coarse ridicule at my ignorance none at my intrusion i was a stranger within the gate but i received the welcome of a friend i discovered no wish to know from whence i came or whither i was going save a short expressed assurance that when i myself found it proper for me to depart i might be sure of being put into the right way a very old man and woman a labourer who was the musician the youth and maiden whom i have before mentioned and three more couple of lads and lasses formed the assembly soon after my entrance every body sound something to do for me expressive of good will the aged man gave up his rush arm chair and insisted on my occupying it the matron his wife contributed a cushion from a wicker one that stood opposite the eldest daughter still in a dancing step the carriage of the lightest articles disputed by her attendant youth in his dancing measures also brought to the table and spread on it a cloth white even as her apparent innocence another presented me with a bowl of new milk another with fruits another came bounding in with flowers moistened by the evening dewdrop bread butter and slices of ham were added to the banquet and when i had nothing left to be done for me my entertainers did not stand like many even british rustics so taken by surprise to stare me out of appetite and with wide opened mouths as if they could themselves swallow all that they had set before me but wishing me good appetite resumed their festivities never was the banquet of a monarch more harmonious  seldom so disinterestedly but all at once i missed the musician and one of the dancers supplied his place the old man nodded time with his head then beat it with his stick and the matron accompanied with her foot time flew insensibly  the sun was in an other hemisphere  the moon set  the stars became clouded and the combining influence of these several circumstances forced on me the consideration then first remembered that i was a benighted gleaner several leagues from the town whence i had wandered by innumerable cross paths just as fancy had carried me the good people read my embarrassment and chased it away by fresh dances songs and music in the midst of which up rose the veteran and with an air of gallantry giving his hand to the aged dame who had literally been his partner for eight and fifty years hobbled an alamande with much more agility than could have been expected he then run into a dance which they call schleifern consisting simply in two persons of either sex taking hold of each others dress behind and moving in a circle to slow music a waylost man in a stormy night upon an heath would have forgot his condition while this dance was performing had he reflected on the occasion of it which was a genuine effusion of hospitality to man and gratitude to god the young folks became almost wild with pleasure and struck into many artless gaities till they encircled the old ones in a kind of spontaneous dance which gradually contracted the circle so that in the end they had the aged couple closed within their arms every one present formed a part of the loveknot and had share of the embrace it was one of the prettiest impromptus of gaity and affection i ever beheld and i repeat that a traveller who had unknown leagues at midnight to measure back without a guide must have forgot his fears when the frolic was over the good veteran led his ancient dame back to her chair with the same courtesy and natural grace he had conducted her from it and as she sat down there was a transitory glow in her cheeks which exercise and felicity had called into them it was a momentary renovation of her youthful days in which she must have been extremely handsome for time that had robbed her of the colorings had committed less violent ravage on the proportions of her beauty her husband looked at her with affection and then at the company with some little elevation of selflove at the feats he had performed  before these animating trifles of great figure in domestic happiness had time to grow cold the original musician whom i told you was the labourer returned introducing an old soldier who saluted me at first sight in excellent french which almost in the next instant he translated into very interpretable though ungrammatical english he lost no time in telling me that the cottager had fetched him from an house where he had been passing part of the carme above a leagues distance for no other reason than to conduct me back to the place from whence i came promising me at the same time said the soldier a suitable reward for my trouble but that i shall not accept of seeing i have the honor sir to be your countryman  consider my friend awhile the unbought nay unsollicited hospitality of this groupe of poor peasants  take a retrospect of their behavior  finish the picture by supposing you see the old man and his wife thanking me for the pleasure they had in entertaining me fail not to paint on the canvass the old soldier offering himself to me as a voluntary guide in case i should persist in refusing the bed which both the aged and the young would have yielded to me then on setting out under favor of the rising moon let your imagination give form and figure to the whole groupe of youths and maidens attending me part of the way still dancing while the honest minstrel labourer completed the midnight serenade and the whole was performed with so much sport glee and goodwill to the sounds of which a thousand woodland echoes responded that the veriest misanthrope would have been converted into a lover of mankind i do protest to you i never felt my pulses vibrate with more enthusiasm it was with difficulty i forced upon the musical labourer a small present or rather payment for fetching the soldier and when all but the last left me a sentiment of regret struck my bosom and grew more and more comfortless as the sound of their retreating footsteps and voices diminished on my ear and when even on standing a moment to listen  a pause to which my grateful heart impelled me  they could be heard no more the sensation swelled almost into tears  the soldier seemed to feel a sort of sympathy and amused the way with the adventures of his life they did not however begin to interest me so soon as they might have done had they been related at any other season he told me however that he had lived so many years out of his native country that he had almost forgot his mother tongue as you may perceive sir said he by my bad english he added that he had served his late prussian majesty the grand frederick almost seven and thirty years and had the honor to have been shot in almost every battle and part of the human body but was still as heartwhole and carefree as any man in the circle of westphalia the grand frederick sir continued he has settled upon me a little pension and given me a snug apartment in the chateau of cleves where should your honor deign to come i have always a glass of good rhenish to offer an englishman aye and any other honest man and where if your honor pleases we will drink the kings of england and prussia for they now happen to be good friends you know in a bumper before we get into bed thus ended my little jubilee to the infinite content of my heart and i trust of yours at least i can wish you no greater good than that each of your future days may be crowned like this and that your after slumbers may be as sweet  letter lxiv to the same the weekly visitation of the begging friars and sunday assemblies are amongst the things which should be recommended to the notice of those who go into westphalia being both really curious in their kind  in regard to the first it is an invariable rule for one or other of the mendicant brothers to make the tour of the town in or near which his convent is situated sanctioned by the custom of his country he gains admittance into every house whether public or private and is happy to catch you just at dinnertime he moves round the table with his little box into which every one puts or appears to put something but evidently more as a thing of course than charity he neither speaks nor is spoken to he glides almost unheard and unseen behind your chair and having finished his collections which are probably scanty enough he bows off as he bowed on  the second circumstance viz the sunday evening card route is full as singular but by no means so silent it is composed of thirty and forty frequently more of the most respectable persons of the town who after the devotions of the sabbath which they perform with great exactness almost indeed to rigor assemble at the best inn and pass the evening partly over a pack of cards and partly over a good supper the last time i was at the city of cleves where i have now in fancy set you down i was an eyewitness to this supplement to the sunday duties there being at that time no less than seven tables well furnished with preparations for the nocturnal association travelers of any decent appearance are always welcome there is never any thing like a debauch and the company separate about twelve the singularity of all this consists only in its opposition to our modes of doing the same thing in great britain and we may truly say the matter is more elegantly conducted in london would it not be thought very odd for the nobility and gentry of both sexes and of the first character to meet at a tavern in that great city where the moment a lady made her appearance a stove full of hot coals was placed under her petticoats and on the entrance of each man of fashion an immense pipe with a spitting box  how often in the traverse of different countries has a traveller occasion to exclaim with the poet i see full plainly custom forms us all and in truth it requires the strongest power of our habits to reconcile us to some things that will rise up in our way as we journey along  amongst other preparations with which my zeal has armed you let me not omit to beseech that you will make up your mind to the dirty doings of westphalian prussia and indeed in certain cases of the whole germanic empire i have in a former letter invited your observation to a comparative view of the countries of holland and prussia in respect of the gradual relief which the eye receives from the fatiguing uniformity of the one to the rising diversities of the other but this is not the only matter that awaits your attention o ye readers of this history and ye sojourners in this land would ye see placed before you one of the most striking contrasts in the world behold it in the general neatness of the hollander and almost universal filth of the prussian and german  it is impossible for an englishman whose eyes are by no means unaccustomed to the decencies of life in his own country to withhold the tribute of his admiration on the peculiar niceties of the towns within and without from his first landing in holland to his taking leave of its seven provinces the doorways the passages the windows the inner apartments the kitchen the very lumberrooms where by the bye every stick board and other unoccupied thing is laid in a picturesque manner as if by the hand of symmetry the warehouses where industry is for ever at hard and very often at dirty work the very outhouses which frequently connect with the general sittingroom and in which perhaps twenty cows are stalled on the one side and as many horses stabled on the other and in which all sorts of domestic fowls nay where not seldom the very pigs are nourished each and all of these places are kept in such order disposed in such arrangement and with such uniform cleanliness that whether it proceeds from the necessity of the climate in regard to the influence which its humidity otherwise might have upon the health or whether from a principle or only an habit of neatness it is certainly a charming custom more honored in the observance than the breach but the offensive reverse is forced upon you almost immediately on your quitting the confines of the stadtholder the disgusting contrast will strike you in almost every particular so that if you please to reperuse the list of the items above stated taking their opposite that is reading dirty for clean as you go on you will have before you a picture of dutch nicety and prussian nastiness  and the remark is to be extended to persons as well as things notwithstanding the incessant toil which an unremitting attention to neatness in a flat foggy country must occasion there is in the midst of their labors an air of proprete the common servants even in their drudgery are always to be seen with clean stockings which are always shown to the middle of the leg slippers which notwithstanding the violent motion of the mop and pail hang on the foot as if by magic and head dresses which are oftener seen without hat or bonnet be the weather what it may whereas in the neighboring countries the houses are more mal propre than the stables of holland and the sunday apparel of the common people females more especially is worse got up and worse put on than the saturday night workingdresses of the dutch peasantry  in your perusal of this and every other similar account i must once again warn you that i confine myself principally to the inns hotels and other public places to which a traveller must of necessity first repair or to those private lodgings which if he makes any stop are usually his second movement but it may be received as a general rule that if all these places are in one country neat inviting and regular and in another utterly different it is fair and candid to draw this inference that dirt is the general characteristic of the one country and cleanliness of the other certain it is i have seen regularity elegance and delicacy in the circle of westphalia and i have also witnessed the reverse of these in holland but these can be considered only as exceptions to the general rule  no human being is more aware than yourself my dear friend that there are certain decencies in civil society which are always very charming and in certain cases not a little embarrassing but without the adroit performance of which human nature in some of its highest luxuries no less than in several of its lowest necessities is but a very dirty piece of business amongst these decencies is one concerning which an english traveller not yet assimilated to the manners of other countries and retaining and ever wishing to retain a respect for the decorums of his own is at a loss how to write particularly when those writings will probably come under the eyes of his delicate countrywomen yet a little adventure on this ticklish subject met me on the way so extremely characteristic of the manners of at least one half of the civilized globe and so extremely uncharacteristic of one comfortable corner of the earth where the personal delicacies if not the graces have taken up their abode that i cannot in fair description help going over this trembling ground to give you its gleanings now yorick would have made no difficulty on this occasion he could you know reconcile his readers to whatever matter he thought proper to set before them but as i by no means possess the magic of that illustrious traveller i do not feel myself entitled to the indulgences which such magic claims and shall therefore not presume to take the same liberties  in a certain fair district then within and but just within the circle of westphalia there stands a pleasant and very considerable town situated on the banks of the lower rhine yclept emerick its extreme beauty excited in me a first sight wish to make a stop of some weeks and being arrived just at that period of life when the comfort of a good nights rest in a good bed is considered as one of the necessaries of life in however tumultuary a manner one passes the day i preferred private to public lodgings and accordingly after due refreshment went out in search of them my broken german dialect stood me in good stead on this occasion i soon saw a lodging bill and knocked at the door but the master and mistress of it being from home i had to blunder out my meaning to four domestics who i fancy babbled a jargon less intelligible than my own though no country could appropriate it it was a mixture of all but the proportions of the compound went more to dutch clevesland and german than to any other language in this patois they gave me to understand as well as they could that the heads of the house being absent nothing could be done till their return on the morrow i was by convention with a party of acquaintance to sleep that night at the distance of two leagues and left the house without any favorable prepossessions resolving to take a future opportunity to look for other lodgings but judge of my surprise when the lord of this unpromising habitation made his appearance in my chamber before i had risen the next morning to assure me he was in despair at my disappointment in not seeing his apartments which he protested to god were the most pleasant most airy and most beautiful of any in the westphalian circle and he verily believed in the german territory then ensued the following question and answer conversation which i will endeavor to render intelligible without a says i or says he to the irksome repetition of which i have as mortal an objection as marmontel himself would i could as happily prove it expletive are these apartments well furnished  delightfully in every part of them  then i wish my little temporary menage to be sometimes at home is this possible  every earthly convenience sir  perhaps then i might now and then dine en famille  nothing so easy  you have no doubt a proper table  i only wish you would do me the honor to come and judge for yourself i honor the english and live very much in the english fashion roast bif on the table every sunday  it were needless then to ask if you can give me a good bed  the best and softest in the circle  that is all  indeed then they need not be better  no truly and i have had such lodgers to lie upon them no less than the flower of the nobility of all nations  le comte de a  la comtesse de b  madame la duchess de c  the duke of d  the earl of e  bishop f  baroness g  and a string of the first titles all the way to z  as the man ran through these illustrious instials in alphabetical order i begged to know if he was indulging himself in a laugh upon that stale trick of travelers the assuming false titles while they were making the grand tour  and if so the satire was well enough directed against such a pettifogging ambition which however was pretty well punished already as these fictitious grandenrs are generally charged in every bill upon the road  laugh no i never was more serious as to the whole alphabet of great folks having at different times occupied my apartments although they did not happen to come into them in the exact dictionary form and order aforesaid and as to a traveling title while a lady or gentleman pays up to the price of nobility there is no question but she or he are right noble and honorable  although i now perceived there was a spice of the wag in mine host i began to think there might be some part of his house which did not at first strike the view and which might spurn all sort of connection with the miserable shop at the door of which i had entered in short i now feared that instead of finding the mansion too bad i should find it for a quiet observing and unobserved gleaner too good with that kind of alteration of air and tone therefore which an honest and welltempered man glides into when he supposes he has undervalued any thing by an overhasty judgment i informed the master that i was apprehensive his rooms would be too spacious and splendid for my purpose  that i was by no means any one of the superb personages of his alphabet but simply an englishman in pursuit of health and the pure air and water which so greatly contribute to them but for which i could not afford to pay too dear a price  by no means too dear you will have them sir in a manner for nothing  and as for air and water i say nothing  vous verrez  i wont say any thing  not a syllable  perdie yous verrez  you will see  i do not suppose there is such air in the heavens nor such water under them  vous verrez  that is all  then you may expect me at emerick the next morning  i kept my word mine host was standing in expectation at his door and scarce gave me time to speak before he ran with me through the shop before commemorated and which after all was the only way of entrance then he took me into a poor whitewashd brick bottomed rough paved back room with one window opening to the rhine but so loaded with iron bars without and so guarded by a net work of rusty wire that you could only get a peep at the river au traverse then recommencd the dialogue there is an apartment for you sir  there is a salle superbe a manger ou pour voir le monde  yes there is a noble dining room or to receive company  not allowing me a moments time to reply he dashed with me into a sort of kitchen at the back of this superbe salle and throwing open a door at one end of it bade me take care of my head which was a very necessary caution the doorway making it convenient to save that head from being broke by doubling the rest of the body he mounted a ladder and taking my hand hawld me after him up we both went as absolute a perpendicular of near forty stairs as ever led to the mainmast head of a first rate man of war i do assure you the strong wing of a pigeon would have required a little breathing as it ascended my landlord allowed of none but kept exclaiming  now now we shall come to a charmante kamer  a charming chamber  at the end of our clambering we reached a room that had neither bed chair or glass i was about to express my surprise at this when anxious to show me all his lions my hurry scurry guide hurried me to a very little apartment indeed the door of which he was proceeding to open with his accustomed rapidity when a voice from within exclaimed in a tranquillizd tone  arrete un petit moment sil vous plait monfieur stop a moment sir if you please to which courteous request the landlord recognizing the voice and bowing toward the door replied ne vous derangez pas mademoifelle pray miss dont disturb yourself  and while the young lady settles this little assair we may look about us sir quoth he  there you see good sir is the rhine again and you have it also as you shall presently see in the room adjoining what do you think of my water now sir and as for air can any thing be better contrived  do but observe the delectable situation of this same  ah sa  continued he addressing the late occupier of the very little apartment who now made her appearance  ah sa  now you shall judge of the agremens of my lodgings  be so good to step in sir  there is neatness  marble pavement  sides of best dutch tileing  and observe still the delicious rhine rolling under you  here he pointed to another outlet where i must confess i should never have thought of looking for a prospect  but the master of the mansion absolutely piqued himself upon it  there sir what do you think of that  in your very bed chamber  almost within reach of your bed monsieur  there is comfort  there is recommendation  assurement bien commode said the young lady joining in the conversation with all the ease in the world  indeed she had left the door open on her coming out purely with a design to assist the great character her friend and relation as i afterward understood he was had given it  the man concluded his eulogy by again entreating to know what i thought of it hereupon i observed to him that though i could not say they settle these matters better in westphalia than in england yet they do settle them in the former place much more at their ease  the lady had just left the room so that my answer was addressed only to my officious groom of the chamber who was extremely surprised when i told him that the little adventure of the little lady in the little apartment could never gain credit were i to relate it in my country nay could never have happened in any decent part of the kingdom of england except by an accident which would have covered even a girl of ten years old with confusion and made a female of maturer age ashamed to lift her eye to the discoverer if he happened to be a man for some days after i added that the sense of decency was so nice in my country that very serious illnesses had sometimes been incurred from the dread of some such exposure ma foi cela est bien bisarre in faith that is whimsical enough said the man  he then showed off the rest of his house in the same inflated style of panegyric and pray where are the superb beds they may be had sir in a month and i might have the beautiful salle below and the charming chamber above and the delicious apartment thereunto belonging for so very trifling a sum as seven hundred florins a year and my diet for seven hundred more the enormity of the demand being no less a sum than would purchase the feesimple of the whole house shop and little apartment into the bargain brought our discourse to a short conclusion i could not but feel it as an insult levelled at his opinion of english folly and left his house with telling him i was sorry we had taken up so much of each others time to so little purpose he seemed to think so too and dropping his vivacity and his courtesy at once suffered me to depart even without a bow my friend i beg pardon and yours my good reader i dare say you are nice but i presume also you are wise  the delicacies of your country  the graceful decency of its manners and customs deserve to be appreciated but inasmuch as they are brought into comparison and contrast with the disgusting freedoms of other nations they will be yet more valued and appear more amiable  in truth people of both sexes on this side the water have scarce and idea of those decencies which by habit if not by principle discover themselves even in the lowest domestics of great britain throughout holland prussia and the empire even more than in france the men and women display almost ostentatiously those objects which we conceal with the greatest care as if proud of the natural defects that are considered as humiliating with us you will see them carrying to and fro in open day and as a sort of pageantry of display all the arcana of the bedchamber whether you are in sickness or in health it is the same thing and i have remarked that the servants who preside over these shows in england they would be mysteries and disposed of as if by magic  the servants i say generally choose to exhibit their machines at breakfast by passing from one room to another not so much as supposing it possible your delicacy can be distressed about the matter our sense of propriety on this occasion passes for manvaise honte may it never be exchanged for either confident impudence or habitual grossness which though less culpable is not less offensive in a word may that shamefacedness which the holy writers have used to signify one of the most lovely virtues in opposition to the boldest vice ever continue to be reckoned amongst the prejudices of british education a prayer in which i am sure your own modest nature and chastened manners will heartily join your affectionate friend  letter lxv to the same in our first sheaf i collected for you a gleaning of the village superstitions of wales i will now offer you those of germany especially in the country of juliers le mark etc bordering on westphalia the country people of those places have the most solemn faith in sorceries and witches who though in their proper shape are only a pack of very old women can assume any form either bestial or human but are it seems most fond of appearing in the character of cats some of this witchery is carried to such excess that many people in the country of juliers will on no consideration intermarry with a person who may be supposed of having a sorcerers blood in his veins nay the most advantageous matches have been refused and the attractions of love itself been resisted rather than a daughter should go to the arms of a man who has ever had a witch in his family and the geneological tree was never more cautiously examined and traced by a birthproud noble to escape the disgrace of pollution than it is to avoid an alliance with a sorcerer or sorceress if there can be found in the history of twenty generations only twigs sufficient to make up one hereditary besom or broomstic on which the witch by descent might horse two of her singers not only the shuddering parent but the trembling lover would consider it as strong a bar to his marriage as if his mistress had been taken in incest  they believe also in loupgarous or menwolves a gentleman of the first character here for learning and integrity but who unhappily for his country is now no more mr bauman of the privy council of cleves and first pastor of the reformed church related to me the story of a man at cologne who assumed the character of a loupgarou and who lived by the pillage of whatever in that character he could lay his hands on for many years insomuch that he had amassed great wealth as well in money as valuable movables but he was at last assaulted and taken by a country man who swore he defied the devil and all his works and who had been long marked with a general opprobrium for this daring disbelief of evil spirits this man was encountered by the loupgarou on the day he was known to have sold a quantity of corn at the cologne market and to have received the money but so far was he from tamely yielding up his honest profits to either man or beast that instead of flying with terror before the wolfman or dropping his moneybag he held the said bag at the extent of his arm which was a powerful one and felled the thief to the earth with that very gold and silver which he would have purloined when he somewhat recovered the blow our heroic farmer threw him like a stunned calf over his horse even in his wolves clothing and delivered him over to the magistrate who after the due course of law ordered him to be hanged in his loupgarou dress in the public marketplace of cologne one would have thought this disaster would have opened the eyes of superstition but alas eyes has she and sees not neither are her votaries to be driven from the steadfast faith that was in them by the detection of a single impostor on the contrary the colognians believe at least they have a tradition at this day that the real loupgarou being angry with the man that was hanged got into him and in order to be revenged put it into the head of the farmer that he might be taken up as a thief and come to an untimely end but that the instant the halter was round the pretenders neck the spirit of the real wolfman slipped out of him again and enjoyed his triumph to think how cleverly he had brought his enemy to the gallows thus the very circumstances that ought to weaken supersution give it strength  their credulity embraces also feveral other imaginary beings particularly of the fairy tribe these however differ from ours in some of their manners and customs they are of the same species but inhabitants of a different country you know the most popular of the fairies of germany are supposed to be little men and women who inhabit the iron and copper mines and are in general very gracious and obliging for instance they will come in the night time into houses and when a maid servant happens to be on good terms with them that is when she believes in their power with all her might they will clean her plates and dishes after an entertainment put her rooms in order and even give her an idea of it in her sleep so that as a fairy was never known in this country to fib though with us they are somewhat given to lying she indulges herself with a nap extraordinary and is sure to find all her work done to her hands when she comes down they come also into shops warehouses etc with the same industrious and good natured intention the tailor rises and finds the half finished suit ready to take home the cobbler his shoes etc nevertheless when illtreated these powerful little spirits are cruelly vindictive and will hide mangle and destroy every thing before them instead of assisting the artisan they will pull his work to pieces instead of befriending the poor maid servant they will trepan her with fair promises that thus cajoled they may tempt her to lie in bed that she may get a good scolding in fine those persons who take any delight in knowing our neighbors are on the whole upon a level with ourselves may please themselves with the thought that if foreigners have all the virtues they have likewise all the weaknesses of human nature  i should not forget under the article supersition to mention that in the pretty country of  uthward of westphalia they have an idea that cats are to be reconciled to a new residence only by coercive measures in pursuance of which notion a widow woman at whose house i lodged imprisoned a poor cat three nights and days in a dark room to the entire destruction of my rest and almost to the cats insanity in order to make her in love with her new house now in england you know where cats are not a whit more remarkable for an amiable disposition we should have stroked the poor animal till she purred approbation we should have permitted her to feed and sleep the first night by our fireside and so hospitably treated her that at the breakfast table next morning she would have found herself one of the family  not that i would have you suppose i am an advocate for the feline race except on general principles of justice and mercy a dog is often an example to his master and a proper object of his love honor imitation and good faith but a cat i take to be with very rare exceptions indeed both a traitor and a sycophant she is won to you only by fawnings and if you punish her on ever so just a cause she either strikes immediately or owes you a grudge the unexecuted malice of which she can hold till an opportunity of vengeance occurs even when you imagine you have gained her affections she will desert you like a faithless lover and elope from your arms  perhaps you may not think this the proper moment to introduce an anecdote of one of these insidious creatures you may suspect me of imitating the grimalkin disposition by sitting down in malice were i about to become an accuser it might be so but what i have now to mention exhibits no charge though it will report an unlucky event  in this very town of cleves which with its environs will detain us some time longer i was residing with a prussian family during the time of the fair which i shall pass over having nothing remarkable to distinguish it from other annual meetings where people assemble to stare at cheat each other and divert themselves and to spend the years savings in buying those bargains which would have been probably better bought at home one day after dinner as the desert was just brought on the table the traveling german musicians who commonly ply the houses at these times presented themselves and were suffered to play and just as they were making their bows for the money they received for their harmony a birdcatcher who had rendered himself famous for educating and calling forth the talents of the feathered race made his appearance and was well received by our party which was numerous and benevolent the musicians who had heard of this birdcatchers same begged permission to stay and the master of the house who had a great share of goodnature indulged their curiosity a curiosity indeed which every body participated for all that we have heard or seen of learned pigs asses dogs and horses was said to be extinguished in the wonderful wisdom which blazed in the genius of this birdcatchers canary the canary was produced and the owner harangued him in the following manner placing him upon his forefinger bijou jewel you are now in the presence of persons of great sagacity and honor take heed you do not deceive the expectations they have conceived of you from the worlds report you have got laurels beware their withering in a word deport yourself like the bijou the jewel of canary birds as you certainly are  all this time the bird seemed to listen and indeed placed himself in the true attitude of attention by sloping his head to the ear of the man and then distinctly nodding twice when his master left off speaking and if ever nods were intelligible and promissory these were two of them  that is good says the master pulling off his hat to the bird now then let us see if you are a canary of honor give us a tune  the canary sung pshaw that is too harsh it is the note of a raven with a hoarseness upon him something pathetic the canary whistled as if its little throat was changed to a lute faster says the man  slower  very well  but what a plague is this foot about and this little head  no wonder you are out mr bijou when you forget your time that is a jewel  bravo bravo my little man  all that he was ordered or reminded of did he do to admiration his head and foot beat time  humoured the variations both of tone and movement and the sound was a just echo to the sense according to the strictest laws of poetical and as it ought to be of musical composition  bravo bravo reechoed from all parts of the dining room  the musicians swore the canary was a greater master of music than any of their band and do you not show your sense of this civility sir cries the birdcatcher with an angry air the canary bowed most respectfully to the great delight of the company his next achievement was going through martial exercise with a straw gun after which my poor bijou says his owner thou have had hard work and must be a little weary a few performances more and thou shall repose show the ladies how to make a curtsey  the bird here crossed his taper legs and sunk and rose with an ease and grace that would have put half our subscription assembly belles to the blush  that is my fine bird  and now a bow head and foot corresponding here the striplings for ten miles round london might have blushed also let us finish with an hornpipe my brave little fellow  that is it  keep it up keep it up  the activity glee spirit and accuracy with which this last order was obeyed wound up the applause in which all the musicians joined as well with their instruments as their clappings to the highest pitch of admiration bijou himself seemed to feel the sacred thirst of fame and shook his little plumes and carolled an io paean that sounded like the conscious notes of victory  thou have done all my biddings bravely said the master caressing his feathered servant now then take a nap while i take thy place hereupon the canary went into a counterfeit slumber so like the effect of the poppied god first shutting one eye then the other then nodding then dropping so much on one side that the hands of several of the company were stretched out to save him from falling and just as those hands approached his feathers suddenly recovering and dropping as much on the other at length the sleep seemed to fix him in a steady posture whereupon the man took him from his finger and laid him flat upon the table where the man assured us he would remain in a good sound sleep while he himself had the honor to do his best to fill up the interval accordingly after drinking a glass of wine in the progress of taking off which he was interrupted by the canary bird springing suddenly up to assert his right to a share really putting his little bill into the glass and then laying himself down to sleep again the owner called him a saucy fellow and began to show off his own independent powers of entertaining the forte of these lay chiefly in balancing with a tobacco pipe while he smoked with another and several of the positions were so difficult to be preserved yet maintained with such dexterity that the general attention was fixed upon him but while he was thus exhibiting an huge black car who had been no doubt on the watch from some unobserved corner sprung upon the table seized the poor canary in its mouth and rushed out of the window in despite of opposition though the dining room was emptied in an instant it was a vain pursuit the life of the bird was gone and its mangled body was brought in by the unfortunate owner in such dismay accompanied by such looks and language as must have awaked pity in a misanthrope he spread him halflength over the table and mourned his canarybird with the most undissembled sorrow well may i grieve for thee poor little thing well may i grieve more than four years have thou fed from my hand drank from my lip and flept in my bosom i owe to thee my support my health my strength and my happiness without thee what will become of me thou it was who ensured my welcome in the best company it was thy genius only made me welcome but thy death is a just punishment for my vanity had i relied only on thy happy powers all had been well and thou had been perched on my finger or lulled in my breast at this moment but trusting to my own talents and glorifying myself in them a judgment has fallen upon me and thou art dead and mangled on this table accursed be the hour i entered this house and more accursed the detestable monster that killed thee accursed be myself for i contributed i ought not to have taken away my eyes when thine were closed in frolic o bijou my dearest only bijou would i were dead also  as near as the spirit of his disordered mind can be transfused such was the language and sentiment of the forlorn birdcatcher whose despairing motion and frantic air no words can paint he took from his pocket a little green bag of faded velvet and taking out of it some wool and cotton that were the wrapping of whistles bird calls and other instruments of his trade all of which he threw on the table as in scorn and making a couch placed the mutilated limbs and ravaged feathers of his canary upon it and renewed his lamentations  these were now much softened as is ever the case when the rage of grief yields to its tenderness when it is too much overpowered by the effect to advert to the cause it is needless to observe to you that every one of the company sympathised with him but none more than the band of musicians who being engaged in a profession that naturally keeps the sensibilities more or less in exercise felt the distress of the poor birdman with peculiar force it was really a banquet to see these people gathering themselves into a knot and after whispering wiping their eyes and blowing their noses depute one from amongst them to be the medium of conveying into the pocket of the birdman the very contribution they had just before received for their own efforts the poor fellow perceiving them took from the pocket the little parcel they had rolled up and brought out with it by an unlucky accident another little bag at the sight of which he was extremely agitated for it contained the canary seed the food of the dear lost companion of his art there is no giving language to the effect of this trifling circumstance upon the poor fellow he threw down the contribution money that he brought from his pocket along with it not with an ungrateful but with a desperate hand he opened the bag which was fastened with red tape and taking out some of the seed put it to the very bill of the lifeless bird exclaiming  no poor bijou no  thou can not peck any more out of this hand that has been thy feeding place so many years  thou can remember how happy we both were when i bought this bag full for thee had it been filled with gold thou had deserved it it shall be filled  and with gold said the master of the house if i could afford it  the good man rose from his seat which had long been uneasy to him and gently taking the bag put into it some silver saying as he handed it to his nearest neighbor who will refuse to follow my example it is not a subscription for mere charity it is a tribute to one of the rarest things in the whole world namely to real feeling in this sophistical pretending parading age if ever the passion of love and gratitude was in the heart of man it is in the heart of that unhappy fellow and whether the object that calls out such feelings be bird beast fish or man it is alike virtue and  ought to be rewarded  said his next neighbor putting into the bag his quota it is superfluous to tell you that after the seed had been taken wholly away and put very delicately out of the poor mans sight every body most cheerfully contributed to make up a purse to repair as much as money could the birdmans loss the last person applied to was a very beautiful german young lady who as she placed her bounty into the bag closed it immediately after and blushed as there are all sorts of blushes at least one to every action of our lives that is worth any characteristic feeling supposing the actor can feel at all suspicion would have thought this young lady who was so anxious to conceal her gift gave little or nothing but candor who reasons in a different manner would suppose what was really the case  that it was a blush not of avarice and deception but of benevolence graced by modesty curiosity however caught the bag opened it and turned out its contents amongst which was a golden ducat that by its date and brightness had been hoarded ah ha said curiosity who does this belong to i wonder guilt and innocence avarice and benignity are alike honest in one point since they all in the moment of attack by some means or another discover what they wish to conceal there was not in the then large company a single person who could not have exclaimed to this young lady with assurance of the truth  thou art the woman there was no denying the fact it was written on every feature of her enchanting face she struggled however with the accusation almost to tears but they were such tears as would have given luster to the finest eyes in the world for they gave luster to here is and would have added effulgence to a ray of the sun  well then if no body else will own this neglected ducat cried the master of the house who was uncle to the lady abovementioned i will whereupon he took it from the heap and exchanged it for two others which enriched the collection  while the business of the heart was thus carrying on the poor birdman who was the occasion and object of it was at first divided by contrary emotions of pain and pleasure his eye sometimes directed to the massacred canary and sometimes to the company at length generosity proved the stronger emotion and grief ebbed away he had lost a bird but he had gained the goodwill of many human beings that bird it is true was his pride and support but this was not the crisis any longer to bewail its fate he accepted the contributionpurse by one means or another filled like the sack of benjamin even to the brim and bowed but spoke not then folding up the corpse of the canary in its wool and cotton shroud departed with one of those looks that the moment it is seen is felt and understood but for which being too powerful for description no language has yet been provided on going out he beckoned the musicians to follow they did so striking a few chords that would have graced the funeral of juliet my very soul pursued the sounds and so did my feet i hasted to the outer door and saw the birdman contending about returning the money which the founders of the benevolence for such were the musicians had subscribed  i have nothing to add to this gleaning but a piece of information that belongs to it the very next morning i was a witness to two traits of the heart of the master of the mansion where these transactions had past a nobler minded man lived not  alas he is no more on my coming down to breakfast the day after i saw the footman departing with the cat who killed the bird not said the gentleman to put her to death for an act that was natural to her but to put her where i know she will be out of my fight for i never could look at her again without being reminded of the most uncomfortable part of yesterdays adventure poor bijou i have not a doubt but all we have done atones but scantily for the loss of such a friend just as he said this the niece whose person and mind i have already gleaned for you came into the breakfast room and now said the old gentleman to finish this business look ye henrietta i gave you this new ducat to lay out at the fair in any manner you liked best and though i think the way in which you disposed of it the very best you could have chosen nay no more blushing i think it never ought to go out of our family for do you know that i have taken it into my old superstitious head that the blessing of the giver of all good will stay with us while such a ducat remains amongst us i therefore bought it back cheaply with two others age is superstitious you know my dear indulge me then love and take care of it while i live after which it shall be yours  and in the meantime that you may not lose your fairing in this little purse are ten others that though not so distinguished by what to my old heart is more precious than the gold of ophir may serve well enough the common purposes of life  much of this was spoken with tender difficulty and the gift was received with more but she loved the hand which in the first instance had enabled her to be generous too well not to reward it was not this indeed an illustration of the virtue of the man of ross who did good yet blushed to find it fame to apologize to you for this story as i have said on former occasions would be to insult you and myself i rather expect your thanks  letter lxvi to the same and you tell me i am not disappointed i have your thanks under such encouragements i resume the pen with alacrity it is inconsistent with the plan of this correspondence to set down a formal list of roads or routes or to present a meagre catalogue of cities towns and villages when you are at a centrical place as cleves for instance you can scarce take an unpleasant course in such a duchy and if you are disposed to make the tour of westphalia on a plan of pleasure or health it is nearly immaterial whether from this its capital you verge toward the south or to the west the east or the north so abundant are the beauties on every side but previous to a more extensive excursion there are in reserve for the deliberate traveller a great variety of rural beauties which lie entirely out of the ordinary track and which are therefore generally past not only unseen but unheard of to some of these i shall direct you because they deserve your attention and will probably never otherwise have it a stranger no sooner gains cleves than he sets off for dusseldorf maestricht aix la chapelle or spa and all the sweet side scenery and enchanting villages behind are left neglected because they do not happen to lie in the broad high road of a large town and to drive from one large town to another seems to be one of the grand resolutions of modern travel for this reason i presume it is that a real lover of the still small voice of nature may reside in an outoftheway village in any part of the dutch prussian or german dominions and never so much as hear it mentioned even amongst the traditions of the place that an english traveller had sojourned therein for a single day hence to speak only of the hundreds of deliciouslysequestered spots that are situated in the neighborhood of arnheim and of nimeguen one way and of cleves and emeric another you may as well look for the emperor of morocco as for an elegant foreigner or any resident foreigner at all except here and there a straggling family whom necessity has driven into retreat but whether observed or not by the dustloving eyes of vanity and fashion nature goes silently and bloomingly on i would recommend you my friend and all other of her genuine admirers to seek her in the agreeable country of kuyh in the little principality of boxmeer and in the enchanting bounds of prussian guelderland all of these indeed possess beauties that to be won must be wooed for they are several leagues out of the common or if you please of the fashionable track but then they are in the direct road to nature and their paths are peace  i performed the whole tour of prussian guelderland on foot and i know not the period of my life that has been so truly pastoral i stopped at every town and village and verily think i should have been welcome at every house you are convinced of the general fertility of the soil by the abundant fleeces of the sheep and of the salubrity of the air by the florid countenances of the people though the country must in a general view be called level it is furnished with great variety long meandring green lanes pleasant interspersed thickets principally of fir and oak arcadianlooking cottages all in the best repair venerable castles an infinity of towers steeples spires convents and ancient abbeys meadowgrounds often compacted into little verdant enclosures often expanded into spacious fields the whole fertilized by delicious streams fed by their parent flood the maise which were it near my natal banks would become a rival to the thames  all these attracting objects diversify the view it must be owned that a league of uniformly dreary heath ground frequently intervenes but even this is relieved by herds flocks and shepherds and by the power of contrast the sterility becomes a not uninteresting object in a travellers picture  for the inhabitants i scruple not to propose them in addition to my former observations amongst the models of imitation for the good people of england in point of pleasantry and useful courtesy i should be worse than ungenerous i should be ungrateful were i to refuse them their merits on this head in the course of one days gleaning as if destiny had planned it on purpose to show me some specimens of real urbanity amongst a set of persons who had certainly never studied it as an art of politeness but cultivated it as a gift of nature i was blessed with the happy faculty of losing my way frequently as i passed along from a little village called geysteren to another named venrai a shepherd perceiving me long before i saw him came running to assure me that i was out of all tracks and then enquiring my destination attended me on my way till it was too direct for any one but a man who deviates by design to miss his sheepdog quarrelled with my little spaniel and the shepherd desirous to teach him some of his own good manners held him by the collar and harangued him on the subject of rudeness to strangers during which eloquence he growled yet more as cross creatures generally do when forced to hear good advice by that happy knack of getting into a wrong road with which i am gifted i was obliged to ask for the right just at sunsetting i saw a peasant at his door pray friend is this the way to venrai  this is the first house that belongs to quite a different town sir you are a mile further to the left than you ought to be off set my peasant without saying another word and did not stop till we had gained the first house of the hamlet i had enquired for you must now go right out sir said the guide and before i had time to thank or reward him he was out of sight  earlier in the day i had enquired of an ancient woman on her way to the church the road to a little village called well on the banks of the maise she informed me but suspecting i might not understand her she stood unasked till i had taken the right path the good woman then went away satisfied that she had done me a service by a sort of characteristic fatality i made the second turning the reverse of my information to the right about sir quoth the old woman who espied me from another place where she had made a stand you my friend who know my methods will not wonder to hear that i followed the impulse which led me to run across the fields purely to take hold of her hand and give her the thanks of my heart by an impulse no less genuine and perhaps more generous she went back to my ground with me and would not leave me till she had made as one would have thought another mistake impossible  yet i contrived it the bewitching story of marmontels shepherdess of the alps which i read to relieve a long walk over a heath conducted me just at the termination of the said heath and of the said story into a farmers yard being sabbath day the farmer was regaling himself with folded arms and a short pipe in his mouth supposing i had business with him he conducted me into his house which was surely kept by the goddess of proprete neatness if such a divinity there be i explained and apologized he smiled and thanked me  but you must be weary sir repose and refresh in an instant as if by magic the table was spread and so white a cloth bread butter and milk so good and a welcome so cordial that i must beg of you if ever you make the tour of prussian guelderland to attempt wandering by happy negligence or if that fails you by welltimed contrivance into a farmers yard no matser where as this man is but a specimen of his countrymen  nor were these examples of urbanity all at noon of the same day i was rescued from the most imminent danger by a good natured fellow who informed me i was making the best of my way into a quagmire nor is this courtesy confined to the peasantry it extends to all classes at no ungleanable distance from my proper path i was attracted by a magnificent castle and relying on the courteous general character of the country i entered its venerable and aweinspiring gate the family were at liege the domestic chaplain only remained at home he was saying grace and crossing himself just as i entered his apartment  pardon the illtimed visit of a curious english stranger  was my opening speech  welltimd i hope it will prove as i am sure it is welcome was his reply rising from his seat and placing me in it i had already in my kind of running way taken refreshments at half a dozen cottages an apple at one a cake at another a cordial at a third and so on but the good chaplain so gaily pressed and smiled as he set a clean cover napkin silver fork and spoon before me i could not but accept the invitation after our repast learning the object of my visit he made with me the tour of the chateau which had it been inspected by a critic in paintings pictures and an amateur of gothic architecture would have been the journey of a day in our way back to his room we passed into a very noble garden with the fruits and flowers of which he loaded my pockets and hands and when after a parting glass of wine i left the apartment in which i had first seen him  remember sir this has been parsons fare the next visit you make the owners of the castle whom i so faintly represent and who are to be here tonight will do you more honor the name of this fine castle is well on the west side of a very picturesque little prussian village upon the banks and almost upon the brims of the rhine that majestic river which you know common geography tells you nd truly tells rises from two springs in the alps and runs north to the lake of constance then west to basil afterward north between swabia and alsace then passing through the palatinate the electorate and the duchy of cleves at last enters the netherlands five miles below cleves where it becomes broad and rapid the direct course of this noble river is above  00 miles it is generally one quarter and in some places half a mile broad and from one and a half to seven fathoms in depth it is navigable to bafil in switzerland which is four hundred miles by long boats with round bottoms which commonly go at the rate of four miles an hour and in these passengers are conveyed at the easy rate of one stiver one penny for five miles but the navigation of the rhine like that of the danube is interrupted by nine cataracts the principal of which is at shaffhausan in switzerland where the whole river falls from an height of    feet but what is there in the whole of this description my friend that fills the imagination or warms the heart like the philanthropy of the chaplain of the castle the simple stream of good will that flowed from his bounty to me indicated a soul whose genial current had it not been checked by more obstructions than the cataracts of the danube or the rhine would have fertilized and enriched more than those mighty waters i have pursued the course of both these rivers for many a beautiful league i have gazed with all the fondness of a real lover of nature and with something of a poets eye on their numerous objects i have painted with an ardent pencil some of their landscapes i have often wondered and admired but never yet did i see or feel on their bosoms or on their banks unless proceeding from similar sources  the sources of philanthropy  any thing so touching as the little scenery of an hour in and about the chateau of well so true it is that an honest mans the noblest work of god but alas fortune according to her caprices is either the lavish fountain that feeds the stream of human benevolence or the stupendous and immovable cataract that contracts its course and circumscribes its power of our prussian priest i have only further to say that every look word and action proved large was his bounty and his soul sincere and i have not a doubt that heaven has as large a recompense bestowed in the testimony of his own conscience  friends he ought to have in abundance but he has gained one more while there is the breath of life in the gleaner nay i am willing to extend the date of my gratitude toward him beyond the grave for if any thing that has been done in this sublunary sphere is worthy to be remembered in another it is surely the fair deeds and authors of a generosity that is free from being polluted by the drossy materials of the present world if so what a claim has the unbought and unsullied act of this blameless priest on the memory of your friend when his powers of recollection shall be immortal since the day on which i received the bounty i have not seen the benefactor but i often please myself by reflecting that my sense of his goodness will be amongst the sacred pleasures that i may reasonably hope shall not quit me when i die  we must not take leave of the rhine till i have mentioned the amusement in reserve for you on the borders of that imperial river the continual commerce and passage of people over the different ferrys of that as well as its neighbor the maise is very diverting and though you sometimes seem in a country where if one of the villages was emptied of its inhabitants they would scarcely fill a boat you will perceive multitudes almost every half hour during the summer pouring in shoals to the strand i was much entertained in a ramble i made to the pretty village of elton which is in the neighborhood of cleves and one of the most distinguished beauties of the duchy part standing upon an almost cambrianlooking mountain and part in a delightful valley it is situate on the other side of the lower rhine on passing which i found myself in the pontvolant flyingbridgeboat with at least an hundred people the greater part of whom were singing hymns psalms and avemarys in chorus never did i behold such a collection of sorrowful countenances nor hear such a concert of solemn cries and i should have been justified in supposing the whole party to be mad had i not been told they were only penitential they were prussian peasants come from their pilgrimage to kaveler a village where i may use the word millions in speaking of the numbers which yearly receives the homage of the german people of all ranks and sexes it is the mecca of this quarter of the globe the groupe in question were just come from a confession of their sins and were filled with compunction or with conscious absolution and as the first or last of these operated they were sunk to the dust with shame or treading in air with joy on their landing they formed themselves into two bands singing in procession and with their hats off i gleaned them all the way from elton in the vale to elton on the hill and never beheld so moving a curiosity nevertheless a small circumstance happened that for a moment disconcerted the gravity of their progress in ascending the steep one of the penitents made a false step and came down in so unlucky a way that religion herself must have smiled as indeed she did in the persons of those her sternest and perhaps truest votaries for there is a certain spark of waggery in human nature that can no more help the force of ridicule on the sight of a ludicrous object than hunger can resist appeasing appetite when the means are in its power and this fall was ludicrous enough being indeed an exposure of what has by proscription and by habit been long considered as the most ridiculous part of human nature at least the one that has been most subject and obnoxious to ridicule the poor penitent indeed would i believe have laughed herself but that she looked on her fall as a judgment and so contented herself with doubling her avemarias and continuing the procession with more zeal than ever  i will not trouble you with the long list of religious miracles believed to be wrought by the virgin in favor of the good catholics that resort to kaveler however great these may be the present race of french certainly have no faith in them but on the contrary when the armies of the republic took possession of this place the plunder was not only carried to the holy altars but to the sacred figure itself the shrine was stripped of all its long collected treasures and as scarce any votary goes empty handed these were immense besides which a rigorous contribution was levied on the inhabitants an exorbitant supply of stockings boots shoes blankets muskets etc for the army was insisted on the image of the virgin was sacrilegiously polluted and that of the savior of the world very narrowly escaped the mock ceremony of the guillotine the modern israelites however repeated their unhallowed practice which i think i have before mentioned somewhere of placing the red cap of licentiousness on its head and writing on its side as resolving to refuse even the son of god his title voila notre cidevant seigneur  behold he who was formerly our lord his sacred head was ransomed at no small cost when this place was retaken by the austrians the visits of congratulation and condolence drew together an almost incalculable multitude of supplicants from every quarter of the german empire perhaps the devotion on that occasion must go into some excesses but i leave you to judge whether the extreme of penitence or of plunder is the evil most to be palliated  the day succeeding this i strolled some leagues farther into the country and being overtaken by one of those passing showers which in spring time collect drop and disperse almost in the same instant i took shelter in a roadside hut in which i caught the laborers just sitting themselves down to dinner there were thirteen persons including the maid servant who having set the food on the table took her chair amongst them their repast consisted of nothing but one very large dish of potatoes for which they returned god both before and after eating as much possibly more thanks than he receives from many of his creatures on whom he bestows the richest delicacies of his creation it was truly a picture and a very beautiful one drawn by the faithful hand of nature of social happiness and religious decency for which the peasantry of germany are remarkable amidst the heavy duties and toils of life i have only given you a single specimen of a universal and invariable practice  with respect to government all kings and high authorities will have at least an equal number of enemies and friends of the former the present prussian monarch has his share and yet as far at least as the interior regulation of his kingdom is concerned there seems very little just cause of complaint where a standing army is enormous and perpetual there must be proportionate levies on some part of the people to support that division of the citizens that take up arms in protection of the rest yet i know not the part of the earth where more liberty of speech or action is indulged than in the prussian territories political subjects are indeed forbidden but this as usual only gives edge to the desire of doing what is inhibited accordingly the monarch is cut up and carved at every public table in prussia with as much freedom of abuse as even a modern patriot could well long for the ease with which the little folks appear to live notwithstanding the exaction of royal rights might be envied by the great folks of any nation their houses and cottages are actually overstocked crowded with furniture and although there is little or no sotting in the common public houses each ordinary beerhouse i am convinced contains double the quantity of pots glasses china etc which would be necessary to equip an english kitchen in short the only miserystruck houses to be seen in prussia or generally speaking in the german empire are those of the nobility and gentry in declining circumstances in their abodes indeed your generous heart would in vain seek for the comforts and accommodations of the peasantry dismantled castles chateaus in decay without and nearly empty within tawdry beds time or motheaten tapestry rusty armories broken pillars and every sign of high birth in low circumstances are exhibited to your aching sight yet the labor and difficulty with which the proprietors of these fragments endeavor to conceal these distresses is wonderful to such as have feeling hearts it is even pitiable they keep up the family carriage the family train of domestics and the family liveries which are overloaded with ornament and almost starve themselves to feed their vanity hence on a going out day the magnificence of which is the economy the almost famine of a month a passing spectator would mistake gaiety for happiness and grandeur as only a superfluity of wealth but never could it more truly be said that all which glitters is not gold all this inconvenience and indigence arises from the cruel necessity they are under to preserve the ways of men of family without the means a prussian gentleman may not consistently with ancestral dignity enter into any sort of profitable commerce to eke out a slender patrimony for trade though it might enrich the pocket is thought very much to impoverish the blood on which account these martyrs to family honors go half naked and more than half unfed and while the proprietors of a few miserable and mortgageeaten acres are starving upon their inherited pittance and are right honorably in want of the necessaries of life the plebeians who are not forbid to make their blood still poorer in order to preserve its purity may carry on all the gainful arts without any other loss than the chance of being starved upon principles of goodbreeding  the little signiory of boxmeer about seven leagues from cleves and five from nimeguen has claim to much of your attention it is singularly situated it is only a short mile distant from a part of holland you have but to ferry across the maise and you are in prussia on the other side of a small hamlet you are in the dominions of the emperor to the right and left about a league you are in two other distinct signiories and in itself it is a principality so absolute that life and death is in the power of the reigning prince who is of the illustrious house of hollenzollen and whose disposition makes his despotic power a mere shadow of authority for he is the parent of the people and they enjoy all the privileges of an happy republic yet even in this little well governed state there are patriots who have been once visited and plundered by the french yet who are still wishing the return of those ravages how unaccountable  the boxmeer farmers cultivate a most beauful seed they call sparcette which yields two crops in the season and the after one is generally the best the verdure is more exquisite than any thing i have ever seen it resembles in figure our wheat when very young but surpasses it abundantly in color the cows prefer it to grass and return for it most excellent butter  there are two carmelite convents in boxmeer one of which is for women this latter i gleaned the other has nothing gleanworthy at the gate of the convent for the men i met a gentleman with whom i had been formerly acquainted he appeared very pensive and begged i would defer my visit to the convent till the next day and take my coffee at his house i attended him on our way to his villa he told me that the object of his visit at the convent was to converse with the superior on the subject of his niece who was to enter upon her noviciate the next day you remember fanchette perhaps sir the handsome girl whom on your former visit to this village you used to call the boxmeer blossom her sister if you recollect had buried herself alive for you know my opinion on the subject  some little time before you left us  and tomorrow she finishes her career by taking the veil so that i shall lose both my domestic comforts for ever without any hope of seeing them again and you know how dear their company was to me especially since my son continues a profligate and has deserted me  i was both affected and surprised at this intelligence for the boxmeer blossom was fresh in my remembrance and i recollect the regret with which i saw her sister pursue the fancy she had taken on enclosing herself this latter indeed was somewhat of a pensive cast and had if i may so say a bias to seclusion with the supposed incitement of a tender disappointment but the former was gay by nature even to excentricity and was addressed by the man of her heart with the sanction of her uncle who was both able and willing to unite fortune with love  on entering the uncles house we were told by a servant that fanchette was gone on a circuit to her neighbors to pay them her eternal adieus but left word that she should return to make her uncles coffee she performed her promise with so much exactness that as the words uncles coffee were pronounced she was almost in the act of pouring it out her air had lost none of its pleasantry her features none of their beauty she was still the blossom of boxmeer  i will relieve you again from the irksome iteration of says i says he and says she by giving you our chat in dialogue  uncle i began to fear fanchette that you would have been seduced from my coffee table on this alas last evening by some of your young companions   niece o fie how could you think so though every body asked me and on refusal would have accompanied me here but there was so much weeping and wailing about nothing that i really begged of them to stay at home   gleaner nothing do you call it my blossom to know one of their friends is going out of the world tomorrow morning   niece ah ha sir so you are come back why really by all your regrets one would think i was already at the point of death and going to be buried  it is as vain lsuppose to tell you as i have told others that i am going to be happier than i have yet ever been   uncle but is it not both death and burial   gleaner i ask the same question   niece and i make just the same answer that i have already done to hundreds but as you are resolved to have it so my death let it be i hope however sir you will do me the honor to assist at my funeral i will present you with a ticket of admission to the ceremony and in the mean time as i have a great deal to do as you must consider all my worldly affairs are to be settled to night we must make haste and get the coffee over   gleaner what is yet omitted then i shall be sorry to lose your company   niece that is very obliging but you know that when i am to be buried in a few hours it takes some little time to prepare ones self   soon after this she made her exit but in a few minutes came back to beg i would indulge her with a moments conversation in the garden  i remember you perfectly said she and feel uncomfortable that you should imagine i treat lightly the act i am about to do but besides that from my very inmost soul i look upon as a festival what my friends call a funeral i love my uncle most dearly though he continues to oppose my happiness in the only point wherein it consists and as i cannot resist his tears though i can his arguments i have no other way but an apparent unconcern comfort him therefore as the last favor i entreat of you persuade him to reconcile himself to my felicity  and god preserve you  she hereupon gave me her hand and waving it so as to forbid reply went smiling out of the garden and sought her chamber  the next morning she rose the second in the house as i am usually the first of every family go where i will from a longindulged habit of enjoying the cool the fragrant hour we had another short teteatete in which she informed me she had just come from taking an everlasting leave of a featherbed sheets and shift which were to be exchanged for very opposite pieces of furniture the ceremony of throwing away her dress cap and all its plumery as a sign of her renouncing the vanities of the world was still to be performed as had previously been settled  her deportment was more aweful than on the former day but her attempered air and sober step took nothing from her personal attractions  i soon lost sight of her on a promise to attend her in her last moments she said the necessity as well as the time of assumed vivacity was now past but that she felt a wish i should gratify my curiosity and again recommended her good uncle to my care observing that though he was too fond of the world he was one of the worthiest persons in it she then departed for the convent which indeed almost joined to her uncles house and i found that the ceremony would begin in two hours  you will perceive that i had an interest in becoming witness to a scene like this and i feel while i write that you are not without a wish to receive a faithful gleaning of it depend upon it then in my next in the interval and always your wishes are mine  letter lxvii to the same just as i was entering into reflections on the subject of my last and had brought myself to believe that every individual ought to be the architect of his or her own happiness seeing the ideas about it were as different as mens minds features and understandings the bereaved uncle came down stairs in deep mourning the idea of an interment had settled itself in his soul and he indulged it i could perceive he had been weeping and that it was not only the customary suit of solemn black which he had put on he took me by the hand after more than an hours pause during which he either rocked himself up and down in his chair  covered his face with his hand  or sighed heavily  it is amongst the solemn maxims of my life never to reason with a man in this kind of situation one may as well talk of sobriety to an intoxicated person as of patience and resignation or the folly of grieving to a mind overborne by sorrow the conventbell arousd him and still holding my hand his own trembling as he spoke  hark the poor fanchettes funeralbell tolls  we must be going i obeyed in silence a great multitude were waiting in the antichamber of the convent but by favor and by interest both which have their effect even in the temples devoted to those who have renounced the world we were immediately admitted into the gallery and obtained seats that commanded the chapel wherein the ceremony was to be performed indeed our places were directly in front of the very part where the sisters were to take their station  only two of the novices were in the chapel and those were strewing the floor with freshgathered flowers and evergreens and at that end of the apartment where the chief objects of the day were to be displayed was a large piece of green carpeting soon after these preliminary preparations which have all their effect on the mind as tending to inflate curiosity the ceremonies of the entrance which were not a little imposing likewise began first came in the superior of the convent then the nuns according to their order and then the two sisters who were conducted by two sisters to a little altar in the center of the room separated from the gallery only by a slight and open partition isabel so was the elder sister named was placed on the right and fanchette on the left we had a complete view of both each had a lighted taper in her hand and their headdresses were distinguished by the blue hood and the white there was enough of family similitude left in their features to discover their relationship it had been much stronger but the resemblance was in great measure diminished by their opposite situations in life isabel had now been twelve months in a manner out of the world and in the practice of all the austerities of the carmelite order and though these are not so rigid as some others the regulations they prescribe are more than sufficient to take out of the cheek that bloom which human society nature and the heart so liberally bestow upon youth besides which isabel had something of a constitutional pale corresponding to the pensive color of her mind  if i may so express myself fanchette on the contrary although she had yielded to a sentiment that determined her to devote herself had too recently taken her leave of the world and of the gay and freshning air it breathes  in the country at least  and was moreover by disposition so impassioned that the contrast betwixt her and isabel was the more striking the eyes of both were extremely dark but although those of isabel were from the extinguished complexion of her cheeks more deep and perhaps more interesting than fanchettes they were of a more subdued and dying luster fanchettes were as the radiance of the risen day and her sisters as the parting beam of a sun prematurely clouded even at noon  on their reaching the altar the superior of the mens convent addressed the two sisters in an exhortation replete with unaffected eloquence and to which they gave the most fixed attention this done isabel who was to take the veil arose and between two of the sisters came forward to make her profession which though in latin was delivered with the most admirable articulation and classical propriety kneeling before the priest then followed the prayers appointed for the occasion  the priest having laid the proper dresses of the order on a table before him assorted them meantime the superior took off the white or noviciate veil and enrobed isabel in black but over this under vestment was placed the white cloth cloak and the neck and head dress of black linen a broad belt and the beads were then settled the priest dipped a brush in holy water with which he sprinkled the devotee and during this ceremony the most solemn airs were played on the organ in which the professed joined apparently with her whole soul she was reconducted to her seat where she remained at her devotions while her sister underwent the ceremonies of the noviciate these differ little from the other except that she was invested with the white head cloth instead of the black  but previous to the assumption of these she delivered a box to the priest from which were taken the richest ornaments she had made use of while in the world the holy father threw them on the floor with an air of disdain and with yet greater indignation fanchette trampled them under her feet as objects unworthy her future attention in a former part of the ceremonials while her sister was putting on the eternal veil i observed that the before animated countenance of fanchette became suddenly pallid but while she was renouncing these her worldly ornaments the blood sallied into her charming face as if to give in a more powerful evidence of her entire disavowal of all the pomps and vanities of life and now succeeded several grand and truly spiritstirring chorusses of priests nuns and of the congregation high mass was next performed in the body of the convent below this pageant with all its priestly ornaments tingling of bells and the seducing apparatus of incense and of sacrifice are so well known and have been so well described by various authors that i shall pass on to more new and interesting objects amongst these your heart will distinguish the two sincere and sorrowstruck lovers of these beauteous victims both were present the one in the vain hope of prevailing on fanchette even while at the altar to change her cruel resolution the other to attempt this also or at worst to enjoy the afflicting luxury of seeing this isabel tear herself from his hope for ever not as i was informed without a faint idea of the possibility that the sudden sight of him whom she had once fondly loved might change her vow in these the last moments of her power to consecrate it to love instead of religion these young men were both of respectable connexions of decent fortunes and of blameless characters the name of isabels lover was bernard and that of fanchette lacrew  they had both placed themselves so as perfectly to see but only one of them to be seen by the beloved object lacrew relied upon an open attack and therefore kept constantly in view of the fair citadel bernard conceived more hope from an ambuscade and therefore by way of masked battery entrenched himself behind a pillar on one side of the gallery from whence he could make a sortie at the moment he judged most favorable his motive for thus attempting to carry the place by surprise was strong he had been extremely ill and isabel to whom a report had been made of it had reason to suppose herself the cause particularly as his sickness increased from the day that in reply to his strongest urgency to spare his life while yet in her power she had refused but confessed to a confidential friend that though she felt more emotion at the account of his distress than she ought to do she could not suffer him to work her from her pious purpose but the person who carried this account to him conveyed it in the usual way of secrets to another confidential friend who deposited it in solemn trust also to a third who with the like sacred injunction communicated it to bernard himself and although this report at the time that it indicated some remains of feeling for him denoted her resolution to seclude herself for ever from his sight by an act which as before observed would put it beyond her power to make him happy he conceived from it what cannot lovers imagine that since she was thus arousd to some sensibility of his sufferings only at a description of them how would it be called forth at the unexpected sight of a once beloved and now agonized object whom she had every reason to suppose in his sick chamber at the distance of thirty leagues he resided at the farthest part of the country of juliers and she had every reason to imagine he was unable to leave his room and so indeed except to accomplish an achievement of desperation he was  but those who have ever felt the influence of the fairest hope in the moment almost of such desperation will not wonder that the poor bernard in opposition to the advice of his medical and other friends and even of his own weakness at other times now found himself strong enough to leave an apartment wherein he had in a manner been bedridden several weeks and to throw himself not only into the open air but into an open postwaggon as they here call the publicstage and which being without windows and undefended from wind or weather and very absurdly constructed is a disease in itself he gained the village of the convent it seems late in the evening that preceded the morning big with the fate of his heart yet that heart prompted him to take a moonlight view of the outside of the convent which contained his treasure he appeared not to have suffered from these exertions or at least the suffrance and agitation within absorbed every external disaster for the moment so true is the remark of our great master of human nature that   when the minds free the bodys delicate  and this unhappy lover might justly exclaim with old lear in the storm the tempest in my mind does from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there for where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt   lacrew who lived in the village and was almost a next door neighbor had less occasion for stratagem and having had almost daily denials from his mistress was more reconciled even to the loss of her not without a mental resource however that he firmly believed a woman of her disposition would soon sicken of a monastic life and that long before her year of trial had past she would return to the world and of course to him for she professed to love him better than any thing in that world yet she fancied something yet dearer to her out of it  her lover indeed expected as he afterward acknowledged to me and the uncle that she would even during the ceremonies of initiation find something in them too formidable for the gaiety of her character especially if he placed himself full in her view in this however he was mistaken his mistress had him almost the whole time under her eye but seldom looked toward him and when she did she withdrew herself with an haste and resolution that confounded and chagrined her admirer  the sisters having gone through the accustomed ceremonies rose from their kneeling attitude and retiring some paces back each threw herself with a determined earnestness but not in the mockery of tragic violence at full length upon the carpet and on their faces and had this falling scene been in rehearsal actually on the stage by the most expert tumblers and posture masters and mistresses of the theater for six weeks it could not have been more adroitly performed thus humbled to the ground they imprinted on it an audible kiss to express their lowliness of spirit and to signify they had renounced the lofty follies of the world to whose pomps and vanities they were henceforth dead the better to carry on which idea two of the nuns the one in her noviciate the other in her veiled state tolled the passing bell even while the bodies of the sisters thus symbolically buried alive were covered with a pall as if the breath of life was really gone from them  it was at this interesting and awful moment that the lover of isabel broke from his concealment and showed to the astonished spectators a countenance in which was painted every passion of the heart in despair but he did not speak  the burialservice was chanted to the notes of the organ which assisted by the vocal powers of the priests nuns etc might be truly said to enter the spirit and elevate the soul it was impossible for an english auditor whom the gods have made somewhat poetical not to apply to the occasion the beautiful description of pope and for an instant not to adopt the doctrine it inculcates o grace serene o virtue heavenly fair divine oblivion of lowthoughted care fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky and faith our early immortality enter each mild each amiable guest receive and wrap me in eternal rest the whole congregation were indeed extrely affected at this part of the ceremony i was touched even to tears as the veiled isabel rose her eye settled for an instant on bernard who had pressed forward by this time through the crowd and stood with his face directly parallel to his mistress who might be almost said to rise from the dead considering circumstances he must to her appear in nearly the same situation and the sensation might have been something like what we may suppose affected william when margarets ghost stood at his feet  and now it was isabel discovered that human nature was not yet extinct in her and that all the imagination of pope was converted into truths which shook her frame and agonized her heart what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart its long forgotten heat yet yet i love these questions and this answer certainly succeeded each other in her bosom in the language of nature though not expressed in numbers  it was plain to see  she had not yet forgot herself to stone bernard was quicksighted enough in the midst of his grief to perceive this and attempted to turn it to his advantage abelard himself could not with more address have opposed himself to heaven or more dexterously assisted rebel nature to hold out half her heart though from what followed you will see bernard had not like the abovementioned lover the power to teach her twas no sin to love it was manifest nevertheless back through the paths of pleasing sease she run and it is no less certain for the instant that not on the cross her eyes were fixed but on him  yet though thus assailed by the unexpected view of as she thought an expiring lover and at a time when every principle and every feeling of her soul had surmounted trials which required every assistance from surrounding objects rather than to find amongst them wherewithal to distress her in perhaps the only vulnerable part  her pity for the misery of which she might well suppose herself the occasion  although i say these strong events might for a short time blot out each bright idea of the skies far from indulging in the oblivious draughts of passion or reiterating the loose imagery of eloisa or avowing with her that from the full choir when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice love found an altar for forbidden fires the transitory terror tenderness alarm or sorrow which she felt at the sight of poor bernard at such a time in such a place might well claim absolution if not assent from the power who had just received her vows devotions self might steal a thought from heaven one human tear might drop and be forgiven she did not long however suffer the once dear object of her love to dispute her heart which assuredly a life past in chastity and innocence long before she dedicated it to her god had rendered more acceptable than that whose supposed effusions the poet has so enchantingly poured forth  after she had gazed about half a minute in which short space more was painted in the face that at any former period of my life i had seen though the work of hours she closed her fine and humid eyes with a fortitude which might have induced the angels to sanction the momentary and human sympathy which had bathed them with tears but she was unable to repress one gentle sigh the weight of which was felt by my whole heart as it issued from her very lovely lips whether it was the sigh tender or penitential the sigh of regret for the sufferings of her lover or of selfreproach for having allowed it to escape  it was the most graceful most penetrating i have ever known it will heave for ever in my memory and isabels face was on her rising from the ground so near me that i stood within the very breath of it had i not frequently seen that the gayest minds and manners take with occasion a more firm and solemn cast than those from whose general gravity one expects the most fixed and unmoved conduct i should have been surprised at the unaltered mein of fanchette who though more airy more ely an inhabitant of the world and who warm in youth had bid that world farewell her approved lover still before her exhibiting himself in the most pitymoving attitudes fanchette relaxed nothing of her attention to the business or duty of the day on the contrary her look to isabel denoted all the admonitory council which the moral echoes or as the poet calls them more than echoes talked along the walls eloisa could never have heard or fancy that she heard the hollow sound from the shrine more distinctly than i thought i perceived the sense of that sound in the charming features of this lovely girl come sister come they said or seemed to say thy place is here sad sister come away once like thyself i trembled wept and prayed loves victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in our eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep even superstition loses every fear for god not man absolves our frailties here how applicable to the occasion nor was it long ere isabel as if these verses had actually been recited illustrated those which follow them in the celebrated epistle of the lovers of paraclete i come i come prepare your roseate bowers celestial palms and everblooming flowers how happy is the blameless vestals lot etc not so the lovers  bernard after a long struggle with his heart exclaimed in sad and broken accents  ah god  ah god and ran out of the convent nor was it long ere his example was followed by lacrew  the ceremonies thus interrupted were soon resumed the sistervotaries were reconducted to their chairs where both joined in the prayers most devoutly  and now the holy wafers were given and the solemnities of the catholic church in the sacrament began these ended the sisters rose kissed the robes of the priest bowed themselves before the crucifix embraced each other then the superior the nuns noviciates and pensioners all of whom were received with smiles that seraphs seemed to have assisted while a dozen handsome girls residents for a convent education strewed flowers over them as they advanced to the last ceremony namely that of crowning emblematic of that crown of glory with which we are assured the good are to be distinguished in the world to come  by way of supplementary matter it is to be noted that the ceremony was performed on the birthday of the veiled sister a circumstance that gave it additional solemnity the rest of this aweful day was past agreeable to custom in all manner of innocent festivity by way of testifying that so far from feeling any regret for having renounced the world the sensations were in unison with the ceremonies and indeed had it not been for the affair of the heart in the cases of the two luckless lovers i should believe that custom and example had their usual effect in conjunction with zeal and imagination to make a monastic life preferable to every other in the estimate of the inhabitants of the convent what confirms me the rather in this is that the year following being at the selfsame monastery i beheld the selfsame fanchette after her twelve probationary months residence volunteer the same sort of ceremony and with the same apparent satisfaction and though she had lost some of those complexional roses which seem to bloom best in the world she had gained more of those lillies which never fail to grow in the cheeks of a nun either from seclusion or severity or a mixture of both there was an air of peculiar content in fanchette at this confirmation of the choice she had made in the beginning of the former year nor was there less satisfaction in the countenance of isabel in short the most scrutinizing eye might have assured the heart these two sisters in changing their plan of life had only varied not diminished their happiness  on bidding them as probably it will prove an everlasting adieu at this second visit to their convent i borrowed once more an applicable passage from our great poet and i cannot but believe every line found its echo in the minds of the beautiful devotees nor do i think since the epistle of eloisa was written there can have happened such an exact illustration of its best and most interesting sentiments since in the sister nuns were demonstrated all the spirit the softness and the beauty of abelards mistress without any of her cupidity sensuality and libertinism and the exquisite apostrophe which follows was the work only of fancy in eloisa but of feeling in isabel and fanchette  how happy is the blameless vestals lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayer accepted and each wish resigned labor and rest that equal periods keep obedient slumbers that can wake and weep desires composed affections ever even tears that delight and sighs that waft to heaven grace shines around her with serenest beams and whispering angels prompt her golden dreams for her the unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymeneals sing to sounds of heavenly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day since my first idea of poetical excellence my senses and my heart have attested the beauty of this passage and indeed of the whole poem but never has it been so impressive as since the abovedescribed incidents  amidst the whole however of the fascination i could not but notice a small spice of worldly vanity in certain parts of the ceremony such as one of the poor lowly brothers being appointed to place the embroidered robes of the high priest over the backs of the chairs to give them a more graceful flow as the wearer sat down i observed also methought something of earthly pageantry lurking in the caution with which the female veil whether white or black was fixed before and folded behind as well as in the attention to graceful posture with which the professed threw herself on the carpet for though as i before said it did not partake of the nature of a theatrical exhibition it had the air of having been a little studied because it was impossible not to see that some care had been taken that the vestal garment might preserve an interesting negligence but when we consider that the same kind of regard to attitude and position was betrayed by the dying pompey we may certainly allow it to two fine young women who gave up for ever the conquests of their charms at a period of life when victory most solicited them and after all their attentions to external finery were but the ashes of human vanity  a few remaining sparks that just showed themselves and were then extinguished for ever  the cost of the festival is always defrayed by the nun or novice and the friends relations and a few chosen priests from the neighboring convent composed the guests to this eating and drinking scene a little masquerade in which all the nuns are allowed to assume borrowed characters ensues this done the guests retire such i mean as are not of the convent the religious withdraw to their cells and the next morning recommence those duties which know no recess throughout the revolving year till a similar occasion produces a similar jubilee  it was a sad and sorrowful day for the uncle of these sisters he endured not to remain in an house stripped of its chief ornaments and associates and which had the further desagrement of standing as before noted in full view of the convent which he considered as at once the prison and the tomb of his relations in a few weeks therefore he removed to another part of the country where he still bears about a discontented and repining spirit  but such an effect might naturally enough arise from such a cause far very far from both be the bosom of my friend  letter lxvii to the same adjoining the little signiories of boxmeer is the pleasant country of cuych herman de cuych gave name to this country in  0   john the son of wennemaer yielded it long after in exchange of other territories to william of guelderland but at length the dukes of burgundy becoming proprietors they united it to brabant after this again it was given as a pledge to the count of buren whose only daughter and heiress married william of orange in      thus it was that the charming caych country became annexed to the possessions of the prince stadtholders  a small but productive territory once in the possession of spain but now a part of what is called the generality a country subject to the prince of orange and an object worth gleaning it may be about the size of hertfordshire and is like that replete with unpretending graces you would feel its resemblance to england even more closely than the other parts of westphalia  the same pleasant pathways meandring through cornfields  the same soft pasturage  modest risings  humble and flowery hedgerows  the woods and copses filled with the same kind of birds  the river meuse no less fertilising than the thames nor less beautiful  the same sort of whited cottages moss and houseleek growing over the thatch  if a footpath and riverbank traveller is disposed occasionally to survey this country he will find a thousand beautiful scenes which crowds had never yet to boast  it is extremely pleasant to trace as one journeys on these similitudes and dissimilitudes of ones native land here recognizing in certain objects our old acquaintance there paying in others our first salutation to entire strangers and whether these happen to be of the vegetable or animal world a tree a flower a wood a meadow a stream a river a flock an herd a cottage or its inhabitants the generous heart extends to greet whatever has delighted him at home or entertained him abroad  in turning over a little corner in my traveling writingcase i find a small bundle of papers superscribed materials for a scrap letter which is to consist of various minute gleanings too insignificant to stand alone but which collected and tied together may be of some value after the long ears of corn have been gathered you have seen the patient gleaners return from the field with a few handsfull not of stem or substance to be bound with the rest of the sheaves and yet too good to be lost  to these minutiae therefore i shall consecrate the remainder of the present letter desiring you will indulge them with the favor by which you have distinguished the rest  in holland westphalia germany and their dependencies it is customary for the common tradesmen and servants to drop their sabots slippers or shoes at the threshold of the apartment where their employers masters or mistresses are sitting and pad along with a trembling sort of circumspection as if in fear of leaving a plebeian mark of their footsteps behind them and at every word you speak their hats whether in the house or the open air are so painfully doffed and pinched by their veneration or their custom that i have a thousand times smilingly put their hats on their heads and requested they would consider a good rub of their shoes at the doorway was a sufficient passport to any room wherein they might be introduced to me but the habit or civility is inveterate and i verily believe they would pay the same homage to the empty apartments had they occasion to enter them in absence of their supposed superiors i repeat that i am no advocate for indiscriminate familiarities nor for republican rudenesses but i love the poor at least as well as the rich and i feel myself as an individual of a majestic species humbled in their degradation i would have them subordinate because i think society demands its classes but i cannot endure they should be servile and after all it is often affected for sometimes i have at a second or third gleaning of these bowing bareheaded and footed gentlemen and ladies found heard of seen them as saucy proud and vainglorious as if they knew how to descend from their heights only to promote their interests in the hope of overreaching you in a miserable sous or stiver  in each of the above countries you will be obliged as before observed to have one man to dress the hair on your head my good reader and another if peradventure thou art of the bearded sex to scrape it from thy face but the last mentioned personage whom they call surgeon is every where so insufferably vain formal and mal adroit that a penny barber in england does his business ten times better and twenty times more expeditiously the continental shaver whether dutch westphalian or german is one quarter of an hour bringing his instruments of surgery out of his pocket and arranging them another in the apparatus of wipeing whetting setting and proving upon his hand before he puts the razor on your chin another in the operation and at least the fourth quarter in putting his surgical matters up again and all this you must go through patiently or worse will follow every resistance costs you a drop of blood remonstrance is not even listened to and a request of haste is a slice from your chin or a gash in your throat i have had more reason to bewail a nervous complaint that shakes my hand since i came into these countries than ever i certainly mangle myself deliciously whenever i attempt to atchieve this daily labor myself but i yield to the pedantry of these executioners only because i consider being murdered by the hand of another is better than shedding my own blood as it is less heinous you know to suffer assassination than to commit suicide  seriously it is a most provoking and clumsy operation abroad and i have as often wished myself beardless as i might once have wished the contrary and as to any consideration that the head or face these surgeonbarbers have in hand is human a butcher who might choose to shave the chops of a bullock before he slaughtered it would be more gentle your barbersurgeon pinches you by the nose with as little remorse as a farrier draws the nippers round the nostrils of an horse he squeezes your head as if he was binding up your brains after a contusion and holds back your neck as if he was going to cut your throat which indeed he generally does in proof of his great powers of pharmacy in a word blessed are those ladies who happen to have no beards and happy those ladies or gentlemen who when they travel can operate upon themselves  in almost every great road town upon the german continent you will find an english shop where you may be supplied with english manufacture there is a very excellent one at the hague kept by mr mqueen which may almost be termed an universal warehouse of british commodities it is true you pay somewhat high for these but you are to consider first their superior excellence secondly the hazard loss and expense of their transportation and thirdly it should be noted that as the dutch and german customers buy almost every thing for life that is make an expensive article last as long as they last themselves and pay bills about once in ten years when they condescend to pay at all for no tradesman dare send in his bill undemanded if articles were not highly rated an english trader abroad must starve  it is observable that the inns abroad kept by englishmen or people who speak our language are dearer than those kept by natives about fifty per cent and it is remarkable also that the english landlords overreach their countrymen more than a stranger see you avoid them there are at least six scotchmen and three irishmen to one trader english born dispersed over foreign lands the first thrive the second live the third barely exist can you account for this the truth of the remark reaches from one end of the continent to the other with scarce an exception i think i have found out the reason but it might seem invidious and a prejudice to mention it  there subsists in some parts of holland a curious circumstance respecting divorces  an husband who is desirous to obtain repossession of either an eloped parted or wandering wife is to send a written summons to her inviting her company to bed and board if she refuses he is to go in a boat on the river meuse to any distance he pleases then he is to call the said wife three several times and if he receives no answer or if she does not appear he is to come back as fresh and fair a bachelor as before he purchased the wedding ring and is at liberty to choose another mate whose hand he may accept after the publication of the banns and marriage ceremony the truth of this almost incredible story is too general to be disputed by any body but those who cannot believe what they have never seen and yet there are numbers of my dear countrymen who will suppose it a gleaning of the authors imagination to which i shall only reply that in the small town of the brielle in holland here are not less than half a dozen couples who have been thus remarried  but as a celebrated traveller lady w montague justly observes we travelers are in very hard circumstances if we say nothing but what has been said before us we are dull and we have observed nothing if we tell any thing new we are laughed at as fabulous and romantic not allowing for change of company or of customs that happen every twenty years in every country or remain fixed for ever though perhaps not before noticed the ceremonies attending visitings and burial condolences deserve mention in prussian westphalia a letter is sent by the survivor informing the friends of the deceased that such a relation has departed this life but it is the etiquette not to reply your sympathy is taken for granted and thus the affair is not only conveniently shortened but a great deal of trouble is saved to both parties  with respect to visits it is the established punctilio for new comers to make the first advances to residents exactly inverting the etiquette of england and the reason assigned for this practice is that new settlers may have the privilege of declining company should they not wish for society or of extending or narrowing it should they desire acquaintance your visit being always returned immediately and if you do not visit in the course of the first month it is presumed you prefer solitude  perhaps this may be an improvement on the plan of england where every one has free liberty to gratify curiosity often at the expense of real courtesy for numbers go once for a wellbred stare drink their dish of tea and show they have had enough of you by never cultivating you unless you happen exactly to suit their taste which is often the result of their singularity or caprice whereas in these countries you have leisure for previous enquiry you can select your acquaintance and if it is not of the best kind the place affords it must be your own fault  another inconvenience attending your not being fortified with the language of the country whether dutch or german is the imposition you are liable to especially on leaving a town or house where you may have had any running accounts the people you have dealt with pretend to understand you fully when you make your bargain but when you come to collect your bills they protest that you have mistaken them and this error is always to their advantage for instance you agree with a surgeonbarber at so much per month to shave you and with a shoeboy to clean your boots etc you reasonably conclude the price settled between you includes every thing but at the end of the month you are charged so much for putting soap on the face and so much for taking it off so much for rubbing away the dust from your shoes and so much again for blacking them let it be clearly stated therefore that in your country shaving and shoe cleaning mean what they express  the price of timber in westphalia and the countries that environ it is amongst the things calculated to surprise an english traveller a noble fir of between thirty and forty years growth is thought rather dear at six florins about ten shillings english and an oak of more than half a century is rated at about twelve or at the most fifteen shillings inferior wood in proportion the birch tree is here found in abundance and contributes much to the beauty of the country drooping with an air of poetical melancholy almost with as much elegant sadness as the weeping willow the natives of westphalia tell you that the juice is good to drink the foliage good to see and the branches good to burn they seem no less sensible than ourselves also that the twigs have other virtues chiefly adapted for the use of nurseries and schools  simple curiosity is alike in all countries you remember the account i sent you in my first sheaf of the astonishment of an whole family of cambrian rustics at the sight of a shining steel watchchain i found a companion for this picture of wonderment in the surprise of some westphalia cottagers who surveyed a common bamboo stick with as much attention and awe as if it was a wand of enchantment and feeling the knots with a trembling hand as if there was magic in every joint  you will be pleased to hear the universal reputation which is enjoyed by the manufactures of your country i think i slightly glanced at this subject before whatever is english becomes every where abroad an object of admiration i have witnessed this in various instances but in none more than in the rhapsody which the sight of three pair of english shoes produced in an honest cobbler of a little town in prussia  these articles neat as imported from london lay upon my table just unpacked as this child of nature entered my room to receive orders for a trifling repair in my boots he incontinently caught up one of the shoes and for some minutes was too much absorbed in wonder to speak he turned the shoe about in silent admiration felt the sole which his look denoted was of the best leather possible  examined the stitching the form the elegance the solidity the simplicity the lightness the straps the quarters sitted it to his hand as he did which he showed signs of the most perfect approbation  then by way of comparison held it down to his own shoe and as he did so gave testimony of the most inessable contempt even for his own performance which was perhaps the highest compliment that could be paid to the performance of another his features and action had actually all the force of hamlets parallel of the old fortinbras his father and the usurper look but on this picture and on this etc his phisiognomy testified that his work was no more to compare to the british crispins than he to hercules it was long before he could attend indeed to any thing respecting himself and after his rhapsody subsided a little he seemed to undertake even the cobbling art of taking up a few loose stitches in an english boot with reluctance  nor does our country triumph in this handycraft fame without the bestfounded pretensions since in every article of workmanship we cast them at a distance that rather gives the sensation of despair than energy doors windows their ornaments their necessaries their comforts their finishing their application their fitness their buildings their elegance all yield the palm to the superior arts of the british artificer and if there is a general rule without an exception i am from very long and diligent scrutiny inclined to think it lies in the unrivalled excellence of our manufactures in the comforts and conveniences of life  you have heard numberless anecdotes of the late prussian monarch a stronger idea of his insatiable military ambition cannot be well given than in his exclaiming to one of his officers while surveying the prospect from his chateau at cleves very fine to be sure noble woods pretty gardens fair towns wellfilled rivers and all that but i can never think it a good prospect while any part of the objects it includes is the property of another sovereign  i will just note to you that amongst the pictures of this chateau is a very fine one of jesus and the virgin and on the reverse a full length portrait of the painter himself suspended in the middle of the room to show at once the genius and the vanity of the man  of the german theater i have little to observe farther than that it excels in passion you must have often noted the defect of the english actors i speak generally when not immediately in discourse or action in the scene they seem to think that their character comes to a pause at the end of every speech and they wait for the cue words to resume it these are no sooner given than they kindle in a moment they wait the match and go off like a cracker then all is dead and inert till the other personages have settled the business in hand whether an affair of love hate hope or despair nor does the passive character they are speaking to ever interrupt the progress of these passions or show any sensibility thereof except by stepping a pace back or a pace forward by a stamp of the foot a thump of the breast or a smack of the forehead  but on the theater allemande all is life vigor and ardency yet rarely overstepping the modesty of nature and the bye play is so skillfully managed that where the poet himself sleeps the vigilance of the actor guarantees his nap without any diminution of his poetical fame  i am aware that this is the case sometimes in the british theater but it is more rare and commonly speaking homer himself could not there nod had homer been a dramatist without some of the performers slumbering with him and causing the audience to slumber also  high however as they estimate the manufactures of great britain the untravelled prussians and germans appear to have but a very confined idea of its extent for in the first place many of them imagine that it is rather necessity than choice rather policy than curiosity which takes such numbers out of england they believe the population is too great for the place that our little country being overstocked the superflux wander about the earth in search of more room almost every person tells you he knows an englishman  that is to say in the course of his life every man has met with one of the british wanderers or some solitary family resident abroad the germans immediately presume this person or family must be known also to you if you answer in the negative they wonder which certainly implies a contracted idea of great britain as a territory however they may think of it as a nation  the germans bring up their children with great tenderness but in a manner to prevent the effects of effeminacy or the ordinary ailments proceeding therefrom i have seen the sons and daughters of gentlemen run through the dews of the morning without shoes stockings or any under garments but shirts and shifts chacing each other round the court yards gardens etc in this almost natural state after a night of incessant rain about noon when there seems the less real necessity to wrap up they begin to put on just in the proportion as other children throw off but they all look as healthy as if they were educated in the way of england the mothers of great britain will shudder at this relation yet could the custom be reconciled with decency which surely were easy it might deserve adoption colds and coughs which are not only bad disorders in themselves but the parents of worse in england are rarely heard of along the continent of germany and after you have turned your back on holland the gout begins to lose his excruciating power till in advancing further north he is in a measure subdued at least a victim bound hand and foot by this tyrant who hourly brings so many of my compatriots to the rack is rarely seen must we not impute this general exemption from one of the sharpest pangs to which our frailty is heir to early exposure of the body and limbs to all the skiey influences  i think i have not yet mentioned the mode of serving at table in holland and prussia vegetables are eaten first no person offers to begin till all are helped meat comes next this is cut into very thin slices in a plate and passing round the table every one receives or declines if a second third fourth or fifth sort of meat is on the board there are as many platesfull sent round it  the servant watches your glass filling it when empty the bread is cut into exceeding thin slices and no healths are drank except at parting  an elegant english family settled in holland has lately given a dutch drum or route of which the lady of the house has favored me with a description as it is well told and a curiosity in itself i will here present you with a gleaning and in her own words  dear mr gleaner  at your desire i am sitting down to give you a description of what is called in this country a contre visit that i might accommodate to the customs of the place i invited the assistance of a good natured dutch neighbor who helped me through all the ceremonials and being no less a personage than the burgomasters wife she was wholly competent to the business i shall write in way of general direction as to what is to be done etc etc  two of the largest rooms in the house are always appropriated to the occasion the better if they communicate as is indeed usual abroad but that is not material card tables are to be set in the four corners of each room the middle being kept perfectly clear  the place of honor is always determined to be on the right hand side of the pier glass from each side of this glass you are to place two rows of chairs with a square box called a stove at the foot of each chair and if in winter you are to take care these stoves are well supplied with burning turf or rather with the live ashes of turf and if in summer the fire is to be omitted as a dutch woman is too much in the habit of canting up her legs on these abominable little footstools to sit comfortably without them and in the cold weather she could neither use her hands or arms without smokedrying her feet  by the gentlemens seats you place spitting boxes and as if these would not hold enough a dozen or two of spitting pots are to be set on the side tables or to grace the corner of the card equipage several slates and pencils are also to be provided all the plate you can muster is to be crowded on the grand sideboard and at least an hundred tobacco pipes with tasteful devices wrapped about them not forgetting half a dozen pound boxes of tobacco with a suitable service of stoppers  these preparations being settled you are ready to receive the company who begin to appear at your dutch drum about five in the afternoon the reigning burgomasters wife enters first you are to receive her at the door after a good run to meet her by way of testifying your joy with a dead stop and you are to take care that your curtsey is at least as profound as hers the better if a little deeper and if you would adopt the fashion of this country you should revive one of your boarding school sinkings at the commencement of a minuet or one of your school reverences to your governess on leaving the room you are to take her by the hand you are to say you are extremely honored by the visit and then kiss her three times then lead her to the right hand side of the glass  order a burning redhot stove to be put under her petticoats  the genteeler if you condescend to place it yourself  and then receive the rest of the company stoveing them and kissing in the same manner more carefully however placing them according to their rank in the town or village than if they were so many british peeresses to be settled by the high steward at the trial of a sister peeress for high treason when all the chairs are filled you may order refreshments  in the first place tea is to be presented three times round the room this over the card tables are to be arranged the stoves refreshed the pipes lighted and the spitting boxes begin to work you are to present four kings to the burgomasters wife and the three you mean to play at her table to the next lady in her rank you present the queens but make a memorandum that when once seated nobody stirs from her table till the party breaks up at ten oclock so that you are fixed as a statue for almost five hours the refreshments are to be handed about every quarter of an hour but to vary as to the collations one quarter gives coffee another wine another liquors another orgeat and at every time the company eat and drink with unabated appetite and those who offer the most good things of this world are made the most honorable mention of in the annals of contre visitism the ceremonies of taking leave are like those of entrance  it is to be observed that when you give one of their visits it is not from your own invitation the reigning burgomaster sends you word if convenient he will come to you such a day if you accept the challenge you are to send off your cards in which you invite the town to meet him who very obligingly obey the summons whether they ever saw you before or no or whether they shall ever see you again  all the smoking party keep their own room but leave such a strong sense of their orgies behind them that it is necessary your house if your nose is not a native of holland should perform a quarantine of a month before it can be purified  a contrevisite seldom includes supper but when a supper is to be given in holland it always comprehends cards and tea with the immense et cetera of about eight times coffee as many cakes wines jellies etc etc etc and supposing these to begin at half past five and supper to be on table at half past ten though the intermediate hours are fully employed in eating and drinking it does not in the least prevent the supper being devoured as king richard voraciously says marrow bones and all for though in general life at home the dutch eat but little of solid food they pay it off abroad with most incontinent rapacity indeed they seem like certain wild beasts in training for the grand gorging day when they are to be turned out upon criminals to reserve themselves for these great public occasions and a dutch supper at the end of five hours stuffing might very well furnish out one of our lord mayors feasts and satisfy all the mansion house monsters on any one of the important days big with the fate of turkeys and of geese by way of specimen i shall conclud  a dutch bill of fare of which i made a n b in my pocketbook immediately on getting home from the last crammingbout to which i had the honor of being invited i shall only premise that we were only    persons at table mem  it was a supper  top  a very large fillet of veal baked and forcdmeat bass  stewed ndi  an immense sallad  a forced pike of   lb weight  pan full of stewed pears   boiled in the shell  plumb pudding  yard wide pie of all meats birds and beasts  pan full of apples  halfyard sweetpye  near a peck of boiled potatoes  another monster of a pike sour sauce  0lb ditto  sallad bowl of different pickles  whole quarter of sheepish lamb roasted  vast dish of sorrel  bottom    n b nothing left but the large bones and plates  to which pleasant but faithful description i shall only ask with the poet is this a supper this a genial room no it is a temple and a hecatomb treated caressed and tired i take my leave   there are dispersed over the provinces of holland of prussia and of germany various towns bourgs and villages which amongst other privileges possess that of affording protection to fugitives for debt and there are some which offer an asvlum even for crimes of these vianne cleves and neuweid may be mentioned amongst others they are either free towns or independent se gneuries the former have usually taken their rise from the exigence of the state which has often made the prince a borrower of the people the emperors frequently wanting supplies of money to carry on their wars or for other occasions have hired large sums of great trading towns and paid the debt in certain extra grants privileges and immunities making them independent of the governors of the provinces or districts where those towns stood or in their neighborhood accordingly such places remain free exercising all kinds of sovereign power with the right of enacting laws constituting authorities courts of justice and coining as well as of offering a sanctuary to strangers debtors etc etc  i am sorry to inforth you that this latter privilege is not seldom made a revenue of the town or the seigneur or a perquisite of office but it must be owned the fee is not large  a guinea or two for instance per person which makes your person sacred beyond limitation provided nevertheless you conform peaceably to the laws of the land where you establish your residence which it is certainly not only decent but easy to do as they are no way rigorous in themselves and the protected places are for the most part situated in a fine country  vianne for instance is built on the banks of a fine river on the confine of the beautiful province of utrecht nearly half way betwixt rotterdam and nimeguen it remains possessed of all rights of seignieurship independent of holland it is supposed to be the fanum dianae of which ptolemy makes mention  the towns and villages of the duchy of cleves already live in my description and i trust in the readers memory and should misfortune find it necessary to take refuge in either of these he will pass his days or years of exile amidst the beauty and health of nature  with respect ot neuwied independent of giving the poor and the unhappy a privilege to enter it has claims on our attention being one of the most agreeable towns and placed in one of the most charming countries of europe the account of it is sufficiently popular but the best gleaning of it is by the author of the journey or rather voyage of the rhine a work i have already commended  it is in this town says he that the writer of these pages  a victim of french despotism has found refuge honor and happiness after having been despoiled of   00000 livres and driven from a country that was dear to him it is in this free and sacred land he at length is permitted to reside in peace with his rescued family and here also it is that he announces a virtuous prince and a gentle race to philosophers men of letters and of humanity  to peaceable citizens and to ingenious artists  to honest laborers and to the worthy of all descriptions who like him may be expelled from the scenes of rapine and desolation  the gratitude of this author for the protection he received has not seduced him into effusions of praise which exceed the truth the sweet sejour of neuweid merits all he has said of it it is situated on the borders of the rhine betwixt bonne and coblentz the country is agreeable the inhabitants sociable and the air wholesome vines and orchards surround it hills and valleys smile on every side the water is particularly excellent the corn good and abundant butchers meat in all its variety and a no less plenty of vegetables fruit fish fowl and game lodgings are reasonable and elegant the prime of every commodity from the famous fairs of bonne coblentz mayence and francksort as well as from holland are to be had at neuwerd as they can come by water to your very door and to crown the whole the reigning prince is a man of politeness urbanity genius peace and benevolence he is descended from one of the most honorable and ancient house and what is better he is in every sense of the term an honest man of the prince of his family and of his palace of mountrepose two leagues from neuweid a thousand fine things have been said by the ingenious writer abovementioned but after what i have just termed him would not all these go to an anticlimax an honest mans the noblest work of god amongst the objectionable things which an english traveller will find in prussia westphalia and through all the catholic countries is the frequency of holy days feasts fasts and fairs  i would have every creature adore his creator according to the customs of his country and resort to the places of worship as often as his piety inclines but i cannot fail to regret that the church should exact an observance of mere ceremonies which trench on the duties of social life being convinced that a performance of these is a part of religion it is the result of reiterated observation that enables me to assure you nearly the half of a servants and labourers time is taken up in the churches and very frequently made the pretext for a neglect of necessary business and indeed promotes idleness i have always noted that the most church going people in this country are the worst domestics the most supine and the most superstitious how it happens i know not but religion in this country seldom works the blood into enthusiasm the being righteous overmuch in germany more commonly produces a moody torpid stupidity methodists and other fanatic sectaries are rare these bodies amongst us produce you know ebullitions of zeal that ferment to distraction it is in england a raging madness in the german dominions a gloomy melancholy and with respect to society the latter is a the evil most to be lamented the first is a violent fit and passes soon away and though the returns of the paroxism are quick the intervals admit of some activity in secular affairs but the german malady after sending a man from his honest employments his master and his family two or three days in the week without counting sunday continues him in a kind of religious apathy all the rest of the year on the holydays it is with great difficulty a cook will dress dinner or a chambermaid toss up the beds if you want bread it must be made and baked the day before to put an hand in the oven would be sacrilege and to fetch a pail of water an offense laid up amongst others for next confession the consequence of all this is that after they have run in and out of the church till they are weary you will see them in lazy circles stand about the streets with folded arms and gapeing mouths or sleeping in their houses kitchens etc at intervals however they wake to the recollection of the saint in whose honor the fete is instituted and renew their aspirations it is common to hear them break forth in the midst of any ordinary occupation even during the few days their religion suffers them to work into an hymn or spiritual song i once past some months in an house where a peasant servant to his other businesses added that of a barber and under whose razor being in a small country place i came almost every day he had been used on my first employing him only to reap the chins of the rustics and any thing that could cut stubble would answer that purpose for besides that it is the general practice for the gentry of germany of shave only once aweek a german chin after it has been shaved would turn the edge of a dutch razor when the man therefore came upon a face that called for daily scraping and found it had been used to gentle usage he looked upon it as so arduous an undertaking that he called in all the might of his religion to strengthen his arm and incontinently retired into a little chapel adjoining the house both before and after the operation first for going through his job with judgment and then in thanksgiving for having performed it without cutting my throat on these occasions he always sung two staves of the same psalm and with so much violence of lungs that one would think he imagined heaven would be deaf to his prayers indeed i often thought so too for not withstanding his bawling if my chin and throat came off with no more than half a dozen flashes the blood gushing at each i reckoned it a morning of escape but this fellow would sometime burst forth into a musical howl at mealtime with the meat in his mouth and yet having a few acres of ground now and then to reap and mow also if too much sun or rain or from or snow thinned his crops be would be as full of growl against the good god of seasons as if the were  a french republican  fairs or what they call kermisses are very proper supplements to their fasts and holydays not that those are more numerous than in england but because it is the custom for the servants to visit every kermis at whatever distance where she or they have a friend or relation and as each kermis lasts a week and as it is thought very hard if the permission is not given for at least a couple of days at each you may guess in what a situation families are lest betwixt one practice and another if by accident you call on a friend and stay dinner the cook is gone to the kermis or to the church or else it is a fast day and she can do nothing but drink coffee eight or ten times and go to the kirk  yet a kermis particularly a village one is worth seeing it is an annual association of all the scattered parts of a mans family and friends i attended one in westphalia on a principle of that general curiosity which carries me every where but having no village connexions while at cleyes i wandered about a little place in the neighborhood during kermis time the first joyful groupe which i saw gathered together arrested my step i stood leaning on the gate of a large farm yard at the farther end of which i observed a number of persons sitting round a table and others dancing and almost every body singing the first glympse of a stranger brings an invitation especially on public occasions this urbanity is almost universal in westphalia i followed a courteous introducer who led me to the master and mistress of the house their testimonies of welcome came so fast upon me that had i eat and drank of half the different good things which were set before me i must have been killed with kindness on the spot i soon understood that i was at the house of a farmer whose happy family from great grandfather to grandchild were amongst the guests and all these different characters on the stage of human life were dancing on a grass plat behind the great barn and all such as were or had been married arrayed in their bridal dresses one of the brothers wives introduced a sackling of two months to the greatgrandfather who was enjoying health in the sight of four and thirty relations and in the sith year of his age it was a benquet for a good natured spectator to see the joy with which the old man danced the little creature on his knee then presented him to the other parts of his family according to seniority that the youngling might have a kermisskiss from all his kindred but the pretty mother how i wish that you had seen the mother during this transaction  not on account of her prettiness but because the finest blushes that ever circulated from the heart into the countenance and the softest tears that maternal fondness ever brought into the face of a lovely young woman would then have been enjoyed by my friend and it was her first child and it had been a match of love and the babe according to its parents wish was a son and according to family wishes also it bore the name of its greatgrandsire and was thought by affection who takes likenesses you know in a moment to inherit the hue of the eyes and some of the features the attitude half bending over it in its circuit as it passed from the arms of one relation to those of another was a subject for painting and might have been highly finished but the extacy in which at the end of the ceremony she received and the kisses with which she covered it were beyond the reach of human pencil and required all the powers of nature who works in colors dipped in heaven after this every body drank health and many more happy family fetes to the old man who in return pledged a bumper of rhenish to the company one of the sons assured me that the veterans maladies were slight and always cured by a visit to one or other of his family his medical son prescribed this affectionate remedy thus when his own home became a little solitary the good old man went to another and as all the family live within a short distance from the ancient mansion of this their forefather there is a cure within reach for every disorder he gets rid of a cold at the house of one child of a fever at that of another of a touch of the rhumatism at a thirds and at a fourths of an headache upon getting a little more into the private history of the house from a guest who was my next hand neighbor and just animated enough with wine to become a benevolent historian i found that the grand children were worthy of the sire for that all the brothers of which there were nine had entered into a social domestic compact the particular articles of which had been committed to writing that in the course of affairs they were mutually to serve each other either with a sum of money or any other assistance suited to the nature and necessity of the case and as if providence intended to try the virtue and sincerity of each all the brothers in turn wanted and found a friend in the good offices of each other  ah my friend we have not got all the simplicity happiness and virtue to ourselves and god forbid we ever should have how blessed to share them as they are shared with all the human race  i have gleaned various instances of their being dispersed over these divisions of the globe i have shown to you the natural affections blooming in holland cambria and westphalia permit me now to present to you one more example of which i was an eye witness in the first mentioned country  in a trip from the hague to rotterdam and from thence to haarlem i was just in time for the afterdinner boat to get a place in the cabin and to see an aged mother and her daughter give and receive the farewell looks expressions and embraces to and from some friends and relatives never did i see the feelings of the heart shine with more lucid brightness while each was in view of the other nor descend in more tender tears when they could behold each other no longer as the boat moved on the groupe on shore followed as long as they could at the edges of the canal and the party in the cabin thrust their heads out of the door to catch the kind looks and sayings till the horse being hooked to the schuyt they could no longer keep pace with us the succeeding moments were passed in deep sighs on the part of the mother and tears on that of the daughter neither of whom took any more notice of me nor of any other person in the cabin than of the cushions they sat on a person in the corner told me these people would perhaps never see each other again for some years as the mother and daughter were going to settle in north holland  i was prepared to hear him say north america at least but to people untravelled a separation of fifty miles is an immeasurable distance and the sympathy of divided affection extends the space to infinity the silence was long and i honored them for it had there been a cranny in their hearts for the entrance of common place curiosity or for conversation with a stranger i should have deemed it a robbery of what was due to their absent friends i perceived the daughter to strain her longing eyes toward the only opening at which there might be a possibility of catching a parting glympse of her relations and i discovered at the same time that i intercepted her sight  would to heaven that stranger did not sit betwixt me and my friends was the sentiment written in every line of her face but as she continued to look i gave her all the chances she could expect by moving my position no sooner had i done so than she exclaimed  i see poor catherines cloak and the skirt of sallys gown through the window the glow of that friendship which is so deliciously animating in the days of our youth flushed her cheeks but it was sweetly blended also with the gratitude which at that period of our lives gives such a coloring and grace to the complexion after this she farther won my regard by such a pensive cast of the head and direction of the eyes as plainly indicated her heart was returning to the hague with her friends and she took little or no notice of any thing or any body else during the rest of the voyage  i have slightly mentioned to you somewhere the love of ornament amongst the dutch as inconsistent with the weight not to say heaviness of their appearance i think this overfinery is to be discovered principally in their liveries which are often gaudy and rich sometimes elegant it is exhibited also in their furniture barges chimneys china and mills it even shows itself in certain indescribable places yet generally speaking all these things are so out of keeping with their own figures and fashions  such for instance as their deep brown or blue suits of dutch homespun or prussian their unyielding features immense breeches preposterous petticoats stupendous hippads and measured pace  that they seem as little of a piece as if the said homespun jerkins etc were to be trimmed with gold and silver foils and fringes  as to the waterfaring men fresh or salt they are bebuttoned from top to toe each button not excepting those of the waistband a third part larger than an english crownpiece and always of solid silver one whimsical fellow who was master of a fishingsmack used to exhibit himself with a suit of coarse blue bays or serge the coat buttons of which were zealand sixdollars a piece of silver the size of our crown the waistcoat was buttoned with florins the trowzers with schellings larger than our shilling the waistband and flaps with pieces of thirty stivers halfacrown his check shirt with dublikys silver twopences and his shoes were fastened by twentyeight stiver pieces cut into clasps and a gilder for the button of his hat which hat was in itself a curiosity being folded into three corners in the way that grocers make up their pennyworths into long bags of whitebrown paper which you know are small by degrees and subimsically less  indeed even the higher class of hollanders are too full of button wearing four where an englishman would content himself with one and placing them so close that it is quite a labor to fasten and loose them  i have praised the dutch neatness it is worthy of praise but occasionally carried to excess it now and then goes into caricature you have always the fear of the pail and scrubbing brushes before your eyes on the grand cleaning day which here is friday the maid servants are to be seen puddling below ankledeep and spouting above at the windows as if they were playing off an engine to extinguish a conflagration although the great end proposed is only to wash away the dust that may have gathered on the sashes in the course of the week an english traveller who comes from the comfort of a dry room or whose state of health would suffer from damps must reconcile to this desagrement as well as he can as he will from an intention of civility be shown into an apartment just washed he had better double his defense by an additional pair of socks or stockings for the dutch landlord would deem it rude to take his guest into a room that has not been laid under water since the last company went out of it and were you to argue against the thing he would set you down as a dirty traveller who did not know how to behave yourself in a clean country  through every part of holland the natives are great observers of symmetry is a brush for example part of the furniture of a room it will be found hanging up equidistant with another of the same size shape and fashion to answer it cup faces cup each sancer has its brother and half the cupboard just reflects the other this matter is also spoken to in former gleanings  but with respect to the modes of dressing it is out of my memory whether i have before mentioned a great and general resemblance betwixt the welsh and german peasantry at least eighty out of every hundred of the latter are habited in the dark blue or deep brown of the former and have a number of customs in common which is the less to be wondered at when we consider the mixture of the two nations when the saxons sometimes by treachery sometimes by invitation and sometimes by invasion became masters or partners of cambria but so many ages having passed away since the saxon heptarchy and even since the expulsion of the germans whether friends or enemies from the principality of wales it was curious enough for a traveller who had just been gleaning that country to find such a general resemblance in the dress air habits and even features of a people so remote and with which modernly speaking they had not nor ever could have the slightest intercourse  they who came over out of germany into wales says caradoc to aid the britons against their enemies the picts and scots were partly saxons angles and juthes from the first of which came the people of essex sussex middlesex and the west saxons from the angles the east angles and the mercians and they that inhabited the north side of the humber from the juthes the kentish men and they who settled in the isle of wight  thus the english nation and its appendages like the english language appears to be a compound of every other country and particularly of germany from settlements marriages descents etc it is reasonable that there should be preserved some family customs and family features a likeness of countenance may be traeed indeed through all classes of the empires of germany and great britain and the former being certainly taken as an whole a brave ingenious and generous nation i was pleased to trace the similitude and admit the original alliance time has worn out the resentments but whatever brings to memory a bond of connection and of amity though formed between individuals or countries three thousand years ago has a charm for the heart had i but the hem of a garment in my possession that had been worn by the greatest foe of my family on the day of reconciliation or at the moment that he came to my ancestor whom he had injured to avow and to repent of the wrong and to promise future loving kindness  that fragment of the dress should have a place in my wardrobe and be held as a memorial  with regard to the ancient germans were we to take a comparative view of them and of the ancient britons we should find a similitude in the features of their minds as well as manners especially in the grand articles of war and religion the heroes sages and priests of one country had their counterparts in the other had cambria her druids bards and chiefs that devoted themselves to wounds and death for the sake of god and their country conformably to the sacrifice the chivalry and worship of the times the germanic nations had holy brave and wise men who corresponded to these characters and afford additional evidence of their having borrowed manners maxims and superstitions from one another  in order to throw luster on the parallel i will pick a little historical gleaning of what i remember we venerate the traditionary independence which animated the ancient welsh the ancient germans cultured the same spirit the roman historian reports them to respect only those duties which they imposed on themselves the noblest youths blushed not to be numbered among the faithful companions of some renowned chiefs to whom they devoted their arms and service a noble emulation prevailed amongst the companions to obtain the first place in the esteem of their chief amongst the chiefs to acquire the greatest number of valiant companions the glory of such distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of their own tribe in the hour of danger it was shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valor by his companions shameful for the companions not to equal the valor of their chief to survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy to protect his person and to adorn his glory with the trophies of their own exploits were the most sacred of their duties the chiefs combated for the victory the companions for the chief the noblest warriors whenever their native country was sunk in the laziness of peace maintained their numerous bands in some distant scene of action to exercise their restless spirit and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers gifts worthy of soldiers the warlike steed the bloody and ever victorious lance were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their chief the rude plenty of his hospitable board was the only pay that he could bestow or they would accept war and the free will offerings of his friends supplied this munificence  but to use the language of bishop hurd on another occasion and apply them to this lest you should think my love of antiquity has operated like enchantment in regard to the ancient german chiefs and companions i must desire you to consider the courage and conduct of the modern ones who have so long and so nobly and almost without a days recess repelled the hordes of france when almost her whole population has been forced into the field can we discover in times past a braver a more faithful or a more persevering body of men than those subjects of austria who are at this very moment under command of beaulieu clairfait and cobourg each of whom might certainly hold a place in the temple of victory as distinguished as any general that rome had to boast nor could the boldest of the race of cadwallader be dishonored by an alliance with the sublime progenitors of these illustrious descendents  it is painful to observe that the religious zeal of the old germans was as wild savage and fatal as that of the ancient britons and that the fanatic ministers of the one answered to the druids of the other both were alike able to persuade that by some ridiculous arts of divination they could discover the will of the superior beings and both taught that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offerings to their altars the germanic like the druidical temples were in dark and ancient groves consecrated by the reverence of succeeding generations their secret gloom the imagined residence of an invisible power says gibbon by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship impressed the mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror i am sorry to discover a yet stricter similitude between the priests of germany and the druids of wales the former no less than the latter we are informed had been taught by experience the use of every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to their own interest and it has been finely remarked that the same ignorance which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving and of embracing the useful restraints of law exposes then aked and unarmed to the blind terrors of superstition the german priests improving this favorable temper of their countrymen even in temporal concerns which the magistrate could not venture to exercise and the defects of civil policy were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical authority  we find too that ancient germany like ancient briton had her bards whose genius character and office were extremely alike in one country and in the other it is not easily to be conceived says one of romes best historians how this singular order of men speaking of the german bards contrived to kindle the enthusiasm of arms and glory in the breasts of their audience it was in the hour of battle or in the feast of victory that they celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days the ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to the animated strains the view of arms of victory and of danger heightened the effect of the military song and the passions which it tended to excite the desire of fame and the contempt of death were the habitual sentiments of a german mind  we may easily suppose that with the help of a glowing imagination which was not wanting the audience imputed to the bards of germany all the power which poesy herself has in some of her noblest flights attributed to the bards of wales  cadwallos tongue that hushed the stormy main modred whose magic song made huge plinlimmon bow his cloud capt head nor have the princes of germany degenerated from their ancestry none of whom have higher claims on the love of the people or the eulogy of the modern bards than the amiable and youthful monarch who now fills the imperial throne of his warlike achievements during the present campaign the trump of fame has sufficiently informed you but there is a trait of his heart in private and domestic life which i receive from the most unquestionable authority and which will endear him to you more than a thousand victories  joseph the second who was an oeconomist left to leopold who did not live long enough after he became emperor to dissipate them an unincumberd diadem and immense treasures these all concentered in the present emperor to whom was bequeathed the disposal of them so unconditionally that the dowager empress his mother was in a manner rather a dependent on his bounty than possessed of powers in herself to claim as widow wife and mother no sooner did the youth find himself thus dangerously placed than he resolved to put it out of his own power to act unbecoming the son of an empress and queen convening therefore his court and council he appropriated an early day for his coronation or rather nomination to the emperorship  the regular ceremony being performed long after at frankfort  and he entreated the honor that the queen dowager would assist at it the assembly was brilliant the young monarch rose in the midst of it and holding in his hand a scroll thus addressed himself to his ministers in the presence of thousands of his subjects  i perceive a passage of great importance is omitted in the will of my royal father no suitable independent provision has been made for my beloved and imperial mother the long tried virtues of that noble lady the tender confidence and domestic love in which she lived with my father convinces me that it never could have been intended that so good a wife so kind a parent and so excellent a woman could be left in a state of dependence on her son much more likely is it that the son should have been bequeathed to the commands indulgence and management of his mother or if it was intended that the son should receive the whole revenues of the empire it could only be in confidence that he would act as her agent and see that her private her natural and proper rights were paid into her coffers with the least care and inconvenience to herself  in the latter case i hope i should be found throughout my reign a faithful steward of my dear parent and of the people and supposing for a moment this case a possible one i cannot be insensible to the exalted affection and esteem the late emperor and king must have for me that he could after his death confide the fortunes of such a wife to the trust of his son but human nature is so frail and the trust is so aweful that i tremble while i possess it and cannot indeed be easy till i have disburthened myself of the weight it imposes to this end my loving friends ministers and subjects i have herein bound myself showing the scroll by an instrument of the last solemnity to become responsible in a yearly sum suited to her rank although inferior to her deservings and i have as nearly as may be made this disposition from my private funds and from sources the least likely to infringe on or to affect the treasures of the state which i hold in trust also  for the honor of my empire and the prosperity of austria yet i consider myself as called upon by my subjects to explain account for and justify every expenditure before i make an arrangement in favor of any part of my own family but i feel at the same time that it is an act of duty and justice on my part which will be crowned by the sanction of all any people  here then madam continued the royal youth dropping on his knee as he descended from his throne and presenting the scroll  here is the deed by which i relieve myself from an insupportable burden  the idea of your majestys becoming the victim of a sons weakness indiscretion or ingratitude and you will find that i have by the same act taken the liberty to appoint you the guardian of my youth in all that can properly be called if any thing can my private fortunes i retain in my hand the public treasures because the weight of them would from the multiplicity of demands be attended with fatigue to you but i shall not fail from time to time as exigences may arise to derive benefit in their application from your known wisdom goodness of heart and judgment and your love of the empire  with regard to the public one might very reasonably expect from such an outset what has happened in the progress of the reign of this monarch  we were prepared for his having almost emptied the coffers of his private property and almost stripped his palace of his furniture many of its necessaries and all its luxuries before he invited the assistance of his people to carry on this unparalleled war for their sake for his own and for that of human kind it is a literal fact that he sent all his gold and silver services of plate to the mint now he contents himself with common porcelain should the invasion of the rights of men continue he will probably be reduced to earthen ware and to show that his spirit in the field is equal to his generous sacrifices at home he left a beloved wife in the most affecting crisis of a womans life to be the first in danger as in honor he is now only in the twentyfourth year of his age  surely nothing but a carmagnol could wish to shorten the life of such a monarch or of such a man but the name of king includes tyranny it seems and every head that wears a crown according to the new system deserves to lose it the rule does not admit of an exception notwithstanding which i shall hazard the treason to wish that the present emperor of germany the present king of great britain and of every other prince like unto them may survive not only the malicious plots of their enemies whether secret or avowed but the enemies themselves and i trust i should have firmness and loyalty enough to breathe this wish this prayer though it should bring me to the edge of that instrument which for a similar offense has immolated such hecatombs of victims  yet there are amongst the subjects even of this beloved sovereign many thousands of persons who would aid and abet these extirpations of royalty in planting a dagger in his heart  the brabancons the people of liege and many large bodies of the higher as well as lower parts of the empire conceal their treason in applause and their discontent in flattery but lie in wait for an occasion like the folded serpent in the grass to sting the bosom that nourishes and arrest the arm which defends them this is so true that in germany as in other parts of the world the foe within our gates and even our familiar friends who can smile upon their master and be villains are more to be dreaded than the external enemy against the open violence of the latter we can guard and force may be opposed to force but from the insidious machinations of the first the hour of confidence may be that of treachery and the moment of apparent endearment may mingle poisons wounds and death with embraces  amidst so much unnatural conduct in different parts of the world it is as refreshing as rare to meet with an instance of loyalty in any part of it such was the splendid and spirited offer of the little town or rather village of broek in north holland whose beauties and singularities i gave in a former gleaning the inhabitants of this place sent word to the stadtholder and the states general that if either the armies or the treasuries of the provinces wanted assistance the patriot gift of twenty or thirty tons of silver and five or ten of gold should not be wanting  but alas  on the per contra side of this solitary fact what a long list of murmurs rebellions massacres and of treasons might not be set down even in the span of earth and water that appertains to the dutch  to go no farther and though the last revolution threw them fifty years behind hand in wealth and credit and an hundred in felicity and cost them thirtytwo millions of florins besides they are bursting ripe for another revolution  adieu  letter lxix to the same cologne we have now given a general gleaning of westphalia as well as of holland and guelderland tried what the open what the coverts yield from cleves wezel emeric or any of the port towns right to left you may bend your way to spa chaud fontaine aix la chapelle or any other place which fashion the arts of men and the streams of nature have made popular but of which the description the virtues etc are as familiar as the springs of islington from hence also your path lies easy and direct by water or by land to all the other parts of germany including its dependent circles from this town of cologne the world is all before you to this ancient and imperial place you may come even from rotterdam by boats of business or of pleasure along two of the noblest rivers in europe the meuse and the rhine the delicious course of which i should certainly describe more particularly and indeed have gleaning materials to this end but that since i collected them a work has fallen into my hands which i recommend to yours because it is written with elegance and truth and because it may now be perused with pleasure by all my readers as i am informed a good translation of it has just made its appearance in england it has for title in the original  voyage sur le rhin depuis mayence jusqua dusseldorf  a voyage or journey by the banks of the rhine from mayence to dusseldorf  but although this ample track of land and water lies as i said before you it is not now either an easy or an eligible path for storms and desolations rest upon it at the time i paid it my earliest visit you could not take a direction amidst a thousand routes that did not present even more than the ingenious work just mentioned has spoken to of every agreement a traveller can desire but no  in short my loved friend the charm is dissolved  i have strayed with you amongst fragrance and fertility and pursued the devious walk till we have literally wandered into a sea of blood forgive me i own it was a stratagem but done in kindness i wished as long as possible to make you forget and to keep you from these confines of sin and death to which we were approaching veiled in a shower of shadowing roses thomson you have hitherto scarcely perceived that all along i have been conducting you to the very scenes of action where even at this moment the battle bleeds in every vein hark heard ye not yon giant tread heard ye not yon footsteps dread it is war mason  i need not inform you dear friend who have ever a clue to my wanderings that soon after your receipt of my last i in a manner escaped to england and during my very short stay there sent you an the history here alluded to is that which appears in the introduction what the author has called gleanings at home history of my sensations but no sooner as you know had i refreshed my spirit at the sight of so much peace and plenty gratified my heart by the transient view of some who were dear to me at home and heard of some important successes abroad i followed once more the bent of my truant disposition and revisited the scenes from which i had been driven it was as you recollect in the midst of a month that would soon have ripened all the fruits of the earth and made the heart of the husbandman sing for joy had not his hopes been destroyed torn up by the roots and trampled under the foot of the merciless enemy i repassed all my ancient paths and to a certain distance found some traces of the lovely scenery i had left and which i have already gleaned for you i advanced a little and soon came to the extreme edge of peace words were they written by shakspeares pen could not duly describe the change which had taken place in the space of an hundred yards farther measuring from the spot from whence peace plenty and nature seemed to have taken flight as if like other terrified emigrants they had sought protection in our queen of isles  a small arm of the rhine separated me from a territory that had some few weeks before been the scene of an action which though short had been bloody i passed over  and the rest of the river for many a league blushed to fancy like the rubicon the earth for several miles gave note of what had been doing in absence of the gleaner an harvest alas of the sword instead of the scythe had been made and whole ranks of human creatures as well as the grass and the corn had been mown down  an iron harvest  flocks and herds had been so effectually driven away or destroyed that although it was celebrated as a country for the choicest cattle and i had so often seen them cover the banks neither the low of an by way of showing you how these worthy gentlemen who are said to be fighting for the liberties of mankind then conducted themselves when they took possession of other peoples property i have gleaned for you a correct copy of one of their edicts issued on the day after their entering prussian guelderland even when they came as friends on a visit of confraternity  au nom de la republique francoise il est ordonne aux administrateurs tresoriers et receveurs quelconques des droits et impositions dans le gueldre prussienne etc de ne verser leurs recettes quentre les mains des persons commises par leur differentes communautes a lesset de fair le levee des contributions imposees au nom de la republique francoise jusqu a parfait et entier payement  il est aussi expressement defendu de fair fortir des dites provinces aucune bestiaux vivres ou sourrages avaunt davoir satisfait aux engagements quelles ont contractees vis a vis de la republique francoise sous peine dencourir fa disgrace et detre traite comme ses ennemis  le general commandant lavant guard de larmee du nord  sign le marliere  au quartier general a ruremonde le   me decembre      lannee premiere de la republique  translation  in the name of the french republic  this is to give notice that all administrators treasurers stewards agents etc whatsoever in prussian guelderland shall not give any receipts or pay any money except into the hands of the commissions appointed and authorized on the part of the french republic until the whole contribution be paid as ordered by general la maliere  and it is by virtue of the said authority strictly forbidden to let any manner of provisions beasts or forage go out of the said provinces until the said engagements with the republic of france are fulfilled upon pain of incurring its disgrace and of being treated as its enemy  so much for french brotherhood  in the very little village of swoegen consisting of half a dozen poor farms and a few cottages was a levy besides their quota of the provisions of   00 florins  in that of mierlo not much larger  000 florins  in other parts of prussian guelderland  00000 florins  forage  00000 florins  besides eating drinking during the possession of the country  n b most of the beautiful trees walks shrubberies etc destroyed by way of frolic as these honest patriots amused themselves during the leisure of victory   heifer nor the bleat of a lamb was to be heard a few sad birds in melancholy notes chanted a funeral dirge over their ruined bowers and thickets most of which had been hewn down and cast into the fire in one of these groves being at a walking distance from the neighboring town where i made one of my gleaning pauses i had in a former visit been at some pains to form a seat of fresh sods to discipline the foliage on either side and canopy the branches above chiefly because it was in the neighborhood of two or three nightingales who sang their sorrows to each other and because a stockdove had built in the back ground and it had the farther agreement of a brook that after an hundred fantastic mazes amongst the meadows and fields adjacent took its course along the underwood through which i could see it stream as i sat and i could besides hear it dispute and struggle with the impediments it found in its way of these it complained so gently as very well to associate with the notes of my dove and nightingales although i had thrown the arching of my alcove as far forward cave like as i could with a design to exclude too obtrusive a visit of the sun and of the world i could observe at the openings of the oak branches part of a fine field of springing corn and catch a glimpse of some steeples on the one hand and several farmhouses and cottages on the other so that the toutensemble you will conceive afforded to a man of poesy and peace all that his heart could desire in this retreat i had passed many a sunsetting and not seldom a sunrising hour i returned to lament the change all that side of the grove which screened and furnished branches for my alcove was cut away by a sanguine banditti who came sword in band into these environs the hand of wantonness had hacked off with the fabre whole nurseries of firs and poplars most of the houses had been burnt down and the wretched inhabitants plundered of all their little stores some were dead of wounds some of grief the rest wandered about the world in search of the very few who with the disposition had the power of benevolence  the fields which i left so full of vernal promise were despoiled not an handful of grain remained for a gleaner who was now literally lest to pick his scanty subsistence amidst thorns and briars and though the steeples of some churches were yet to be seen they could be viewed only as the monuments of that dreadful sacrilege which had been committed within i entered one of these and found it had in real and dreadful truth been turned into a den of thieves the altars were broken down and the fragments stained with the blood of its ministers the ruthless soldiery had converted the most holy places into the most obscene indecent allusions and impious mottos were pencilled on the windows doors and even on the sainted relics and the images of the redeemer were demolished with every mark of mockery and scorn in that sheaf of our gleaning gathered in and sent you from wales i forgot to mention and indeed it will come in better at this place that when i was at bangor the warder of the cathedral of that episcopal city told me that one of its ancient bishops was struck blind by a thunderbolt from heaven for the sacrilegious act of felling the bells the consternation of the warder on recounting this as we stood discoursing under the bellfry could scarce have been exceeded had the thunderbolt fallen on his own head what would this honest son of simplicity have concluded had i been then able to inform him that the french were cutting off the heads and mangling the limbs of their bishops not for selling the revenues of the church but for daring to assist at and administer divine worship for attachment to their king for believing in a savior of the world and for not turning apostate to their god nay furthermore that they condemned the holy men most eminent for talents and piety to the stake the cannot the musket or the guillotine and lastly that so far from sparing the bells on account of their fanctity that they convert them into instruments of murder  the murder of the best priests the best citizens and the best men and by way of closing the climax of sacrilege were i to observe that a number of these citizens finding themselves sicken from the vapors of the charcoal and the putrid stench of the dead bodies which they were turning ut of the coffins that the lead thereof might be made into bullets and balls  would not the poor man with a better reason than superstition has to offer conclude that the porsonous nausea thus seizing them was a signal mark of divine judgment before the era of liberty frenchmen would have considered it in that light likewise  several tombs were torn open and the canonised bones which had been deposited for centuries were hung round the pulpit and the ruins of the altarpiece  the habitations were in the same dismantled state all the valuables that were portable had been carried off in wagons tumbled into the heap of promiscuous plunder and nothing remained but the wreck of the fixtures and the miserable proprietors who had escaped the pillagers mourning or famishing over them one sweetlyrustic abode that i had the preceding year distinguished as the dearest residence of a numerous humble yet not indigent family the proofs of whose industry and content i had seen shine in every plate glass table chair and cupboard and where i had been accustomed to see a groupe of healthy and happy faces was become a general ruin the father was marked down by some of his base townsmen as an avowed lover of his country and had on a late exigence joined some of his neighbors to make head against a party of foragers who would have driven off the herds and flocks this was so soul a crime in the eyes of the french that they cut off the head of the tree and mangled several of the branches the very boards and bricks of the rooms were torn up i ran over the house with horror i passed through three of the apartments without meeting one consolatory object i began to fear every vestige of humanity had been destroyed by these its sworn exterminators when coming to the broken staircase i heard a voice which had often welcomed me i ascended and saw the wretched remnants of this oncejoyful family crowded into the only chamber that remained habitable  two halfgrown boys an old woman and the young daughter who had spoken to me on comparing their present with their past state the latter opened on my mind new ideas of human vicissitude i instantly called to my remembrance that the last time i had seen these very persons the two first objects were sporting on the green before their door in all the glee of body and of soul the old woman and her husband were sitting on a bench environed with honeysuckles that twisted selfbent into a natural canopy and the daughter was leaning halfraised on the flowery ground at the feet of her parents and laughing at the anticks of her two brothers  why should i paint to you the dire reverse alas the reverse goes almost out of the reach even of imagination it is not easy to suppose the ravagers could in so short a space of time change every happy circumstance to its bitterest opposite that they could turn for instance plenty into famine health to disease and a contented mind to an agonized broken spirit yet all this had been done by the sons of liberty who too truly put their threat in execution of carrying misery and death into every place they visited  as to my poor nightingales and stockdove though they had more cause than ever to lament that terror which in conventional language is the order of the day had sent them to mourn prematurely in other lands   the very spot where many a time they carold was forgot for the little thicket which had been their leafy sanctuary was burnt up by these glorious freebooters  because forsooth the proprietor was wicked enough to attempt saving himself and family by flight when he heard that a party of patriots were likely to invade his village and the guilty wretch was another traitor who had unfortunately distinguished himself on a former occasion as a lover of his country nothing in short remained of the various innocent and interesting objects my heart had appreciated but a fragment of the brook part of which had been destroyed in the fury of extirpating the thicket and from the broken gaps the water had worked its way into an opposite current to the left where in forming a junction of sounds it seemed to lament the general ruin but god knows the surrounding calamities required no aids from fancy on the contrary in this poor suffering little town and its environs there actually happened such horrors as fancy when most disposed to excite terror her strongest attribute never formed dreadful beyond imagination was a fact which these inhuman republicans perpetrated on the sucking infant of the hapless fugitive last mentioned he had information that the enemy would be at kreutznach in a few hours and being told that he would certainly be amongst the proscribed on account of the active part he had taken when a party of peasants bravely defended their all against a former horde he followed the impulse of a panicstruck moment and filled his two carts the one with his family the other with his moveable effects in order to send them away to a brother farmers where they could find a promised protection he followed his little household with an aching yet comforted heart but hearing the sound of the enemys guns in the road they were to take and supposing the route had been changed he returned to his cottage and had hope that the plunderers would pursue another plan alas this was a flattering expectation the patriots had heard that a detachment of prussians were still in kreutznach but learning soon after from a scout that they had marched out of the village the preceding evening the patriots silently made their way into the heart of the town before it was suspected they were in the neighborhood for it was late in the night or rather early in the morning and the peaceful harmless inhabitants were in their beds you will better judge of the confusion than i can describe it the peasant sacrificed the dead to save the living and taking his wife in one hand and his children linked arm in arm in the other the suckling lying on its mothers breast he left his dwelling with a hope of still gaining the asylum a patriot countryman and neighbor however with whom he had often disputed on the subject of his principles noticed his departure and conducted the sanguine enemy int the path he had taken they lingered about till the dawn which alas broke too soon for the fugitives who on hearing the voice of their menacing pursuers had plunged into a wood to the left but the crying of their own child betrayed them the barbarians rushed into the wood where spreading themselves they overtook the female part of the wanderers whom the poor peasant had quitted for the moment to explore a track that he conceived might lead them to a small hamlet on the left and which consisting only of a few scattered huts that stood on the skirts of the forest might still preserve his family meantime they were seated as he thought in so secure a recess that the dogs of war though in full cry could not harm them during his absence he was mistaken the bloodhounds discovered their haunt and seizing the trembling mother they tore the babe from her breast and striking off its head threw the bloody gift into her lap as a present to her husband dreadfully swearing at the same time that if she did not persuade him to return and solicit pardon for his past offenses against the french republic that her own head and that of every other child should answer it they left her for other mischief cruel as it is my friend you are impatient for the sequel of this bloody adventure which i received nearly as i relate it from the mouth of the desolate wife  on the return of her husband guess if you can his sensations  the bleeding head of his youngest infant the lifeless trunk of its little body the agonized mother the no less shocking prospect of the remainder of them all before him let your beating heart have rest however as to the remainder of this poor family after the carmagnols had past some hours in the ravage of kreutznach and in raising such exactions as left famine to finish what the sword had begun the approach of the prussians compelled the enemy to evacuate the town and the peasants returned  they returned indeed to an heap of ruins where once the garden smiled and where i had so lately seen with delighted eyes all that the sweetest poetry has ever fancied or described those calm desires that ask but little room those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene lived in each look and brightened all the green   i generally walk with a small edition of the author of these verses an author who was one of the earliest friends of my youth and whom my youthful muse sincerely lamented in my pocket his exquisite poems and the seasons of thomson are amongst the dearest of my traveling equipage on my word of honor i feel a gratitude a respect an affection nay a passion of the heart for every leas for with how many charming ideas have they filled it when my own thoughts were comfortless and sad and during the summer months though i know almost every passage by rote i have one or the other of these glories of our ingenious isle in my hand and in all my wandrings round this world of care they appear to be partakers of my pilgrimage i thus seem to be in the company of two of my most illustrious countrymen and when i peruse their pages i seem but to repeat their conversation  but never did i think i should be a dweller upon earth when almost every beauty and innocence of nature that each has so sweetly sung should be cut down for so many leagues together and left by the cruel spoilers to clot and wither in human gore still less did i suppose i should so often have occasion to apply or to contrast so many of their passages had the author of the deserted village lived in these times and gleaned like me the places which the enemy of mankind have overrun all the distress of that poem which bewailed in some measure an imaginary or at least a partial evil would quit its objects to lament others a thousand fold more to be deplored to see the rural virtues leave the land as an effect of that luxury which indignant spurns the cottage from the green and while trades unfeeling train usurp the land and dispossess the swain and still further to observe contented teil and hospitable care and kind connubial tenderness  and piety with wishes placed above and steady loyalty and faithful love pass from the shore and darken all the strand is a melancholy sight and worthy to be mourned by the muse of goldsmith but while the poor exiles took with them many of their dearest consolations the good old sire that first prepared to go the lovely daughter lovelier in her tears and while the fond mother could   kiss her thoughtless babes with many a tear and clasp them close in sorrow doubly dear their passage to new found worlds beyond the western main and all their destiny is bliss compared with the execrable deeds which have been heaped on the head of the inhabitants of the countries that border on or rather comprehend the theater of the present war  and in fine when i left one desolated place in the hope of gaining more repose and seeing less sorrow in another it was generally speaking but going from bad to worse an irregular and still disappointed tour which included most of the towns and villages in the neighborhood of the saar the sambre the mozelle the zorn the meuse and the lower rhine in those branches which stretch along the frontiers in different directions comprehending one way an excursion from coblentz to the duchy of deux ponts  from louvain to givet another from binche to bouchain a third and so on till i returned like an hunted hare to the place from whence i set out presented me with nothing but a bitter change severer for severe young   i have followed the victorious in their burning pursuit of the flying enemy even when my way has been sometimes impeded by the bleeding bodies and mangled limbs of the vanquished unable from wounded feelings to proceed i have returned to the spots where the action began and there seen the horror desolation and famine by which even conquest has been gained even on the day when such conquest has filled the dismantled and half depopulated streets of the rescued town with the shout of victors  when solemn te deums have been appointed to be sung in all places of public worship i have beheld that mass of private misery which is frequently no less the companion of victory than the attendant of defeat  the shrick of the widow the orphan and the childless parent were still nearly the same  had my poor friend goldsmith survived to witness them how much more reason would he have had to exclaim while on one day he heard or saw in several villages not inferior to his auburn the swain responsive as the milk maid sung the sober herd that lowed to meet their young the noisy geese that gabbled over the pool the playful children just let loose from school the watchdogs voice that bayd the whispering wind and the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind what additions i say my dear friend would have been given to his reasons of complaint were he to have been an auditor and spectator of these objects on one day and on perhaps the very next to find the swain ruined or murdered the milkmaid violated the head driven into the enemys camp the children deprived of a father and the whole country destroyed had the subject of his pen been only the sanguinary annals of a few hours depredation in the village of dudelange or of chimay a sweet little village upon the beauteous river blanch between the picturesque forests of thierach and fagne in the fine county of hainault but for many ages the demon of war has ravaged the charms of chimay  wholly however to extirpate them to turn the town and the environs into the tomb of their harmless inhabitants of the proprieters and their property was reserved for the french republicans  a small place in the disastrous province of luxembourg where decrepid old men sick persons women laboring with child babes at the breast or in the cradle became the indiscriminate victims of these monsters had he seen the lives of those miserable beings taken away by absolutely innovans  cruelty and attested the wanton iniquity of tearing up the young and tender crops which their industry had sown he would indeed have had reason to exclaim sweet smiling village loveliest of the lawn thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn amidst thy bowers the tyrants hand is seen and desolation saddens all thy green and trembling shrinking from the spoilers hand far far away thy children leave the land but it is far beyond the reach even of enthusiast as i am to the energy of his muse and dearly as i love the memory of the man with whom i have past so many happy hours when life and poetry were young to me and consequently when both were more full of charms i must acknowledge that even when i have in the course of this last journe amongst the ruins of humanity applied the choicest language from the muse of my deceased friend to deplore that i sa s many proofs of a tyrants power i have felt that language too feeble for the occasion  and when in surveying the wreek of some spot that once realised the flights of his happiest fancy i have exclaimed here as i take my solitary rounds amidst the tangling walks and ruined grounds and not a year elassed return to view where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew here as with doubtful pensive steps i range trace every scene and wonder at the change remembrance wakes with all her busy train swells at my breast and turns the past to pain   even this have i found a faint though beautiful picture of the facts  i do not recommend any man to make the same experiment but if the sober headed or cold hearted reasoner who has read the effusions of a warm imagination and given to human calamities a stronger pathos and a deeper color than the critic in his elbow chair supposes can belong thereto a journey to these scenes of private grief and public misery would soon convince him that we live in a world in some parts of which there are daily perhaps hourly happening distresses far too poignant for the pen or the pencil though rubens were to hold the one and shakspeare the other and indeed that much of what has been condemned as romance is but an underwritten or underpainted history of circumstances in real life but after all it is wrong in me to set down such condemnation to a cold heart or head  these will never be amongst the defects imputed to the gleaner and yet had he not been an eyewitness to the different calamities described in these volumes he must have attributed some of these calamities had they been represented by any other person to the work of fiction   goldsmiths poetry to offer an adequate description of atrocities of plunder sword and fire which throw into shadow the utmost barbarity of the goths and vandals  and the evil is still growing still extending its horrors though i have at length turned from them the memory of the past is never to be erased the present is full of apprehension and the miseries of the future cannot be calculated remote as is now this peaceful place from the immediate scenes of action it shields me not from a thousand dreadful sights of the wounded and the desolate two wagons loaded with the former this morning passed my window and an equal number are expected tomorrow if you ask me why i threw myself so much in the way of scenes like these so foreign so repugnant to every feeling of my soul why i remained in their view so long i can only answer that in the first instance i went to revisit places and people which had once given me pleasure and i desired to share their pain in a reverse of fortune secondly when once involved it was not easy to disentangle my steps and lastly i lost myself in the bloody mazes  letter lxx to the same valenciennes how often in surveying these horrible wrecks of human affairs have i reiterated that apostrophe which you did me the honor so much to approve on the first publication of a work whose chief design was to paint the miseries of war in general and of civil war in particular you will accept one passage which came to my mind many times in the course of these military gleanings amongst surrounding scenes of death of ruin and of havoc   emma corbett ah earth thou common parent  thou whose nourishing bosom furnishes to all the children of content that will cultivate thy kindness how art thou made the object of sanguinary ambition into what ridiculous portions of ideal property art thou cut out quarrelled and contended for how often does the bounteous sun that shines upon thy surface to expand the grain and to cherish thy various productions leave thy verdant mantle dipped in gore  o peace thou image of divinity itself  descend upon that earth from whence the mistakes of altercating relations have so long affrighted thee subdue gentle power the fierce soul of rebellion i call upon thee in the names of nature reason humanity and justice  i call upon thee in the name of natures god  but lest my loved friend you should deem this in some measure the rhapsody of a poetical mind strongly moved by the sad scenery that environs it at this moment when i am in the midst of the horrors that have been produced by conflagration famine sorrow desolation despair and all the evils of war suffer me to call in the support of one who though he was writing in a well secured city in times of profound peace and public prosperity at least when the rumors of war could reach him but by a medium long after the mischief apprehended and who though he reasoned as a politician and philosopher felt as a man war says he is the last of all remedies cuncta prius tnda all lawful expedients must be used to avoid it it is wonderful with what coolness and indifference the greater part of mankind see war commenced those that hear of it at a distance or read of it in books but have never presented its evils to their minds much more those let me add that write as i do now on the polluted spots where those evils have just happened consider it as little more than a splendid game a proclamation an army a battle and a triumph some indeed they allow must perish perhaps some of their dearest friends in the most successful field but then they died upon the bed of honor resign their lives amidst the joys of conquest and filled with glory smile in death  but war has means of destruction more formidable than the cannon and the sword of the thousands and tens of thousands that have perished in the late contests a very small part ever felt the stroke of the enemy the rest languished in tents and towns or places of refuge amidst damps and putrefaction pale torpid spiritless and helpless gasping and groaning unpitied amongst men made obdurate by the continuance of hopeless misery and many of which must at last die without notice and without remembrance of that number are multitudes now lingering or agonizing in the hospitals which i have visited with a very akeing heart if he that shared the danger enjoyed the profit and after bleeding in the battle grew rich by the victory he might show even his gains without envy but at the conclusion of a ten years war how are we recompensed for the death of multitudes and the expense of millions but by contemplating the sudden glories of paymasters and agents contractors and commissaries whose equipages shine like meteors and whose palaces rise like exhalations  all this is unquestionably true of war in general and no less certainly founded in fact is the exception which has been made that as there are diseases in animal nature which nothing but amputation can remove so there is by the depravation of human passions sometimes a gangrene in human societies for which fire and sword are the necessary remedies that the force collected against france is of this fort i think there are few even of those who wished a reform and silently approved the primary measures taken toward it but must acknowledge at the same time that they must applaud the caution that withheld the british empire from joining in the dreadful operations while there was yet room for gentler methods never perhaps in the annals of history was there a crisis at which bolingbrokes remark could be so apposite as that at which we have now arrived if ever says he a test for the trial of spirits can be necessary it is now if ever those of real liberty and clamorous faction ought to be distinguished from each other it is now if ever it is incumbent on nations to know what truth is and to follow it it is now if we do not take advantage of the standing water of faction the tide will soon turn one way or the other and carry all before it a people says his lordship who will maintain their liberties far from jogging on silently and tamely like the ass between two burdens must preserve some of the fierceness of the lion and even make their roar to be heard like his whenever they are injured or so much as threatened but to show that he does not in this observation mean to recommend that disloyal seditious spirit which creates a perpetual scene of tumult and disorder and exposes the state to dangerous and often fatal convulsions he confesses that a spirit of faction may destroy a free constitution though founded on the noblest basis our rights our natural inheritance but that a spirit of real liberty never can and lest we should imagine that such a spirit is inconsistent with the loyalty we owe our sovereign or chief ruler by what ever name his supremacy is distinguished he remarks that in every kind of government some powers must be lodged in particular men for the good order and preservation of the whole community nothing can be more clear than that the lines which circumscribe the powers are the bounds of separation between the prerogatives of the prince or other magistrate and the privileges of the people we hence infer that every step which the prince or magistrate makes beyond these bounds is an encroachment on liberty and every attempt toward making such a step is a danger on liberty but if it is righteous to draw the sword against tyrants who endanger this liberty it is not less so to unsheath it against traitors who cover the crimes of rebellion and regicide under the mask of patriotism  notwithstanding which we must deeply regret the dire necessity of man thus preying upon man and shudder to reflect there are really those amongst us meriting the censure which an excellent writer has past on them  wretches who without virtue labor or hazard while incommodious encampments and unwholesome stations where courage is useless and enterprise is impracticable are silently dispeopling fleets and sluggishly melting away armies are growing rich as their country is impoverished who rejoice when obstinacy or ambition adds another year to slaughter and devastation who laugh from their desks at bravery and science while they are adding figure to figure and cipher to cipher hoping for a new contract for a new armament and computing the profits of a siege or a tempest  the fighting fanatics are not much more praise worthy either as to their precepts or practice nor the blind mob who follow their doctrine and who talk of liberty because it is a better name for idleness i never hear this clamor for freedom without calling to mind those lines of milton which so justly characterise the present innovators and their adherents see how they apply a barbarous noise environs me of owls and cuckoos asses apes and dogs they bawl for freedom in their senseless mond and still revolt when truth would set them free license they mean when they cry liberty for who loves that must first be wife and good but from that mark how far they are we see for all this waste of wealth and loss of blood   letter lxxi to the same liberty says my lord bolinbroke is a tender plant which will not flourish unless the genius of the soil be proper for it notwithstanding it has been watered with human blood and manured by human bodies great must be the reform of the present system ere i can be persuaded my friend that france is that genial soil the state of and the late transactions in that miserable country cannot be thought of without lessening the at the alldevouring moment in which this letter was written dignity of the human species for comparing what once was that kingdom with what it is one cannot help associating with the godlike attributes of man a capacity of exhibiting and triumphing in qualities the gleaner speaks here of the reign of roberspierre now abhorred alike by the english and french nations so satanic that the arch foe of mankind might blush to avow them as parts of his nature  yet a day is to come when the historian must detail the particulars of the french revolution the fugitive accounts of the temporary or diurnal writers  those  brief chroniclers of the times must be collected by some great and impartial pen for the information of posterity what a soulaffrighting mass of materials if to his literary endowments the biographer of these horrible facts should possess the milder and more compassionate feelings of the heart what agonizing martyrs must those feelings be to the truth how must his page be stained with the blood of innocents in every leaf the crimes of an age committed in a day are to be recorded where shall be found the man whose soul whatever be his talents is firm enough to detail them and after all he can scarce hope posterity should give him credit the closer he advances to the truth the less is the probability of his being believed we are at the present day so accustomed so familiarised to the history of horrors  to the massacre of infants in the first and children in the second state of human beings then onward to the assassination of bedridden age and to the violation of all places which used once to be mostholy  mothers offspring and swaddled babes  sanctuaries churches and sacred altars  that the tales which in the beginning of their atrocities literally did harrow up the soul froze the young blood made the two eyes like stars start from their spheres the knotty and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine make now a weaker impression even on the breast where pity has a throne  i heard one of the most tenderherted of men declare that the sight of mangled human bodies in the field of battle was disregarded after a months custom and we know that the appearance of an open grave or of a deceased person carried to it are almost imperceptible at least unheeded objects in a populous city where funerals are amongst the ordinary occurrences of the day whereas in a small village a coffin and a tomb retain their power of interesting and of affecting the mind even of the gay and dissolute  thus it is in the story of france polluted as it is with abominations but when more than a century of interval from these shall arrive and such a period must come the most candid reader will impute some part of the narrative to prejudice to passion or to fancy  indeed how can the historian himself expect or wish succeeding generations should suppose there had ever entered into the heads or hearts of their ancestors those innovations in cruelty as i have before called them  those original sins in the old age of a wicked world that even now we could not believe but that we know them to be facts  it will nevertheless be the melancholy though faithful office of the biographer of the french republic to state that whatever is most repugnant to reason and nature  most offensive to the laws of man and of god were the means to bring about the best end in the french nation  a nation long celebrated for its manly gentleness and polished urbanity and which was so universally allowed to merit the character given of it by one of its best poets where men adore their wives and womans power draws reverence from a polished peoples softness their husbands equals and their lovers queens he must reverse this picture and show this very people embrueing themselves in the lifeblood of the sex they idolized  extending their ferocity toward it beyond the practices of the common murderer he must instruct children yet unborn that their parents were capable of violating that you probably remember the profane spirit of that letter which chaumet one of the members of the convention read after his long speech on the liberty of religious worship if so you will particularly bear in mind that passage which mentions that at nanci every kind of religious worship was abolished and that every object that could recall religion to the imagination was destroyed this letter was distinguished by the loudest appases of the people religion the very hem of whose garment had been sacred for proof of which tremendous assertion he must enumerate those plundered churches demolished altars and sainted images which for so many ages were deemed hallowed even by the most reprobate of tyrants and most abandoned of the people to which enormities must be added the pillage of coffins and turning out of them the very bones of their forefathers to convert the materials with which filial piety had guarded them into the instruments of a bloody war upon each other to these must succeed the shuddering annals of prisons forced and their contents amounting to thousands and tens of thousands of human beings murdered with more than druidical barbarity for refusing to become apostates to their king their country and their god  in fine the tissue which such an historian must weave for his readers would consist of all that is vile and incredible  of slaughters continued many days and nights without remission of a moment till one pethion of the magistrates avowed that though the number of butchers amounted to an it is well known that these day laborers in murder were hired by the national convention at so much a day or so much per head or per hundred and that there was frequently an horrid emulation amongst the assassins with respect to the number of victims immolated many wagers were laid by these competitors for the bloody wreathe as to the quantum of blood shed in the same given space of time each became jealous of the others prowess deeming a murder more than he or she had committed as a draw back on glory but one of the long summer days that the republicans commemorate by an annual festival and which humanity and nature and natures god join to expunge from the history of time was distinguished by a victor who put in his claim to the sanguinary palm on the merit of having beheaded with his single arm two hundred of his fellow citizens  quis talia sando mirmidonum dolopumve aut duri miles ulissei temperet a lachrymis  hundred daily contracted for in the single city of paris they declared themselves so fatigued that in pity to themselves though with acknowledged regret they were obliged to give their exhausted arms a little rest after which they returned to their bloody business with renovated vigor till one of the most populous capitals in the world was inundated with the blood of its best and bravest inhabitants  he who shall these unhappy deeds relate must describe monsters whose appetite for murder every hour increased by what it fed on and which rayning first the lamb seized then the garbage wretches who exhausted all the modes of cruelty that a wanton and wicked imagination could suggest  of victims stuck on spits which pierced through the scull and entered the brain  or hewn limb from limb were tossed into the air or dragged along the earth yet quivering with life or pounded to atoms and then hurled into the water or the flames  of holy men like poor joseph de villette torn from their retreats where they had passed a life of piety and praise as ignorant of the revolutions as of the vices of the world and of the world itself of shameless women mad with the infection of enthusiasm who forgetting their sex forgetting their nature seated themselves upon the dead bodies of their victims and with more than savage ferocity throwing the mangled members in horrid pastime from murderess to murderess or compressing the blood from the yet palpitating heart  drink it in execration of the murdered  or devoting their own offspring to death with a mockery of roman barbarity for deeds that the worst of the roman matrons would have deemed worthy of a triumph even in times of pagan obscurity or turning the costly furniture of the royal palaces and the sacred offerings of gold and silver of their altars with the altars themselves into a feu de joie  a bonfire  sing and dance around the flames  of mothers initiating their own children in the mysteries of blood  the blood of babes  and more merciless than herod of men who not contented with the massacre of five little ones  in the sight of her who bore them who hacked off the maternal arms even while holding to her bosom and kissing the bleeding head of the the sentiment of lady macbeth has been thought by many humane persons to exceed the bounds of possibility but do not the above facts prove the profound knowledge of the poet in the vices as well as virtues of the heart i have given suck and know how tender it is to love the babe that milks me  i could while it was smiling in my face have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums and dashed the brains out  suckling at her breast and for some time after refusing the compassion implored upon her knees of dispatching the parent  of devoting a noble the countess of chevres lady and her blooming daughters to the consuming fire but first anointing their naked bodies with oil that they might suffer a more excruciating death the murder of madame de perignac was attended by the fellowing terrible circumstance her eldest daughter who suffered with her unable to endure the torture of deliberate death supplicated the executioner appointed to nurse and feed the flames and enforced her request on her knees then halfconsumed to shorten her misery by the sword by a fiercer fire or any other means of speedier dissolution  the murderer either from fear or cruelty refused when a youth who had been a spectator and had struggled with his distress being indeed the young ladys lover ran to the place where the beloved of his soul was burning and dispatched her with a pistol which he had indeed reserved for himself at this the surrounding mob were so exasperated that they made a circle round the blaze to prevent the young mans escape and exclaimed that it was a pity to part lovers amongst the persons most offended at this action i mean of the youth were four young women  in truth the female sex when they have once passed a certain bound of cruelty are cruel indeed and such as caught the spirit of french patriotisin seem to have adopted the whole shuddering doctrine of the  which lady macbeth invoked come all ye spirits that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the toe topfull of direst cruelty make thick my blood stop up the access and passage to remorse that no compunctuous visitings of nature shake my fell purpose  come to my womans breasts ye murdering ministers wherever in your sightless substances ye wait on natures mischief come thick night and pall me in the dunnest smoke of hell how sublimely terrible  would i could add  what long i thought  how finely imagined but could a spirit less fell that this make females stab those who were but suspected of loyalty to their king and honor of their god tear off the flesh with their teeth and fastened with pins to their dress wear it as a mask of revolutionary virtue  shall not the gleaner shall not even every lover of liberty execrate means like these to attain a reform of abuses however great and manifold reader of whatever party thou art consult thy bosom counselor and if there be as much of compassion as would bestow a sigh on human suffrance it would induce thee to reprobate such measures even though they led thee to perfect freedom    but the tenderhearted reader must not be left to suppose the tyrants were guilty of the mercy of a rapid destruction like that of quick lime no  he is to be told that these innocent sacrifices were to be consumed a petit feu by a slow fire and lascivious songs and impious hymns were to chorus the piercing groans of the victims lives there in the round of a very cruel world  roams there a savage along the famishing sands of africa lies there in the dungeons a criminal expecting and deserving death so lost to the innocence that attended him in his cradled hours as to suppose any act of an hellish nature could be added to the horror of this unquestionable fact and yet the historian is to be told that six unhappy priests who were next to be thrust into the flames were constrained to eat of the flesh of these martyred women as it dropped blackened and peacemeal from their bones alas the climax is not yet wound up  a blameless man in his extremest age was the first sacrificed of the six ecclesiastics abovementioned no sooner was he roasted by these surely more than demoniacs than the five others were commanded to inform the french republic whether the body of a parson or of a countess was the most to their taste  well might the banished brothers of the insulted dethroned imprisoned and since beheaded louis the sixteenth in their pathetic and justificatory address to commiseratg europe exclaim who is there that would not be affected to see that once flourishing kingdom to which nature has been lavish in the means of making it such  so rich in population so fruitful in its productions and which once abounded in money so opulent from its resources and commerce from the industry of its inhabitants and the advantages of its colonies  that kingdom provided with so many useful institutions and whose happy abodes have been so universally courted  presenting at this moment nothing but the appearance of a barbarous country given up to rapine stained with bloody ruins and deserted by its principal inhabitants an unorganized empire torn with intestine distraction stripped of all its riches threatened with every species of searcity enervated from four years of internal disorder and on the brink of dissolution from pestilence and famine from battle and murder and from sudden death  mad wickedness my friend has swept all away was there ever seen ever recorded such inquisitorial examinations so many oppressive shackles so many violations of the most sacred places so many massacres of citizens  no  france is itself alone  letter lxxii to the same though the enormities committed by these wouldberepublicans upon the species in general absorb any acts of cruelty exercised on individuals it is i feel impossible to pass over the fate of madame de lamballe one of their most illustrious victims without a particular mark of my attention  the rather as she was even before the miserable revolution one of those sacrifices which the ribbald pamphleteers of france mangled without any just cause  besides a personal acquaintance with her myself from which i am able to assure you of her claim to your respect on the basis of many very generous actions i am also in friendship with many who were in the habits of intimacy with her both before and since her unfortunate visit to the court of france and although i cannot say with the thane of cawdor that she has bought  golden opinions from all sorts of people i can very truly assert that by many of the wise and good in her own country and in england during her residence there her graceful manners her general charity in france and in many other virtues which are held in reverence by the common consent of mankind will make her death bewailed and her memory respected of the private failings which some have been so sedulous to impute to her since her alliance with her royal and unhappy friend i cannot pretend to speak but it may at least be as fair to set all this down to the score of envy malice or uncharitableness as to that of truth she has often been denied the virtues of which she was known to be in possession by all those who knew herself and it is reasonable to suspect such vices may have been attributed by those who knew her not the dark shadows of which never passed her fancy or her mind to be the favorite lady of a court and of a queen of whose favor so many courtiers were jealous to be preeminent for beauty grace and talents are in themselves frequent objects of malice and illreport and not less productive of hatred and envy than of love and admiration nor less dangerous to the possessor than to be the favorite minister of a king  a title to whose kindness though made out by high and meritorious qualities with respect to the sovereign who distinguishes and rewards them must always become the subject of secret malignancy or open detraction with respect to that part of the public whose vanity suggests to them at least an equal share of the same qualities and who therefore make pretensions to at least equal recompense and being disappointed become slanderers of course and slanderers not only of the said favorites but of the said kings and queens for it is a rule in defamation not only to abuse those whose merit is better rewarded than the defamers but to involve the persons rewarding it in the like censure and i have often wondered that you my friend who have so many attractions and so many friends ready to acknowledge it should have had so few enemies covert or avowed to dispute your claims i must confess i am amongst the number of those who regard persons whom  every body is said to speak well of as suspicious characters and i have on nearer approaches generally found them overrated especially for the virtues most lavishly bepraised and by the same principle i always believe and have as frequently found those people who have a contrary report from this very officious mr everybody who paints his angels and monsters larger than the life have few vices but what have been given to them and that the particular vice most insisted on is the very one from which the party accused is most exempt perhaps the truth of a character is between that partial one given by a friend that inveterate one imputed by a foe and that insipid neutral one furnished by an indifferent person that has no interest to abuse nor any passion or affection to praise you it floats on my memory that i am repeating an observation sent you in a former letter if so accept this renewal of the remark as an evidence of its being a truism but then where you will say shall we look for where find such a dispassionate reporter neither influenced by fondness enmity nor languor and if we could find him would his portraits be agreeable  even if they were strong likenesses they would be without the essentials to render them touching we had better i believe yield up the pencil and ourselves to friends and enemies  if the latter give the shades too dark the former can throw in lights to relieve them  and if the deadly coloring of the one is too violent and too sombrous the lovely tinting of the other and even the flattering touches which fondness works into the features will soften away whatever appears too harsh and too heavy  applying this too the unhappy lady who drew forth the remark i am persuaded she deserves what has been said of her virtues by her friends as much as she could do what has been asserted of her by her enemies while both must surely join in lamenting her fate the particulars of which blended with some account of her character are as follow  her maiden name was maria teresa louisa of savoy carignan she married louis alexander joseph stanislaus of bourbon prince of lamballe president of the council and a prince of the blood the princess who had formed her attachment to the queen of france in the day of royal prosperity resolved not to forsake her in the day of distress a series of invitations from some of the first families in england who laid a regular siege for her company yet at last obtained it almost by storm took her from her friend for a short time her reception in london in the best circles and at court reached her affections and won her gratitude and pointed out a safe protection from the tempest that began to roll over the house of bourbon but none of these had power to hold her from taking her share of peril and distress at paris to which city she returned where a slight summer friendship would have trembled to approach she found the unhappy antoinette as she expected to find her surrounded by many insults many dangers and hourly in expectation of more and that such previous knowledge of her august friends situation was the superior magnet that drew her from the admiration of st jamess cannot be doubted since to be partaker of such dangers and insults she quitted such admiration in a word she returned to paris while every body else of character or of no character were flying from it by stratagem and by every means possible the friendship of courts has been a fruitful and a favorite theme of poets who echo the aspersions of ignorance from one to another let that of the princess de lamballe for the queen of france stand on record as a proof that such censures even if they were admitted to be generally true have their happy and honorable exceptions and surely no vicious feeling could have at such a moment drawn the one princess to the other since there is in guilt that sort of dastardy which induces us to leave and escape from its accomplice in the searching hour of calamity rather than hasten to receive our share and were any wanting i should add this circumstance as a weighty one in evidence of the purity of the principles which united madame de lamballe to the queen  but even in her prisonhouse she not only performed the gentle offices of a friend to the queen  the general duties of a friend to the indigent were not forgotten poverty and sorrow were never sent empty or weeping from this amiable princess and her benevolence was even more than her beauty the subject of admiration the people of paris in a more especial manner were the objects of it and it was by the hands of that very people in that very city this illustrious visitor was to die in a manner that would have been thought by justice itself too cruel too shocking for the vilest criminal that ever disgraced human life or the laws that protect it  on the third of that september      which will ever be enrolled in the history of the world amongst the days that have most disgraced and stained it this unfortunate and exalted woman who had long been imprisoned in the hotel de la force was disturbed by the ruffians of the republic while she was yet on her bed of straw to leave that dreadful place for another on her telling them she had no fault to find with her present place of confinement they rudely answered she must be transferred to the prison of the abbey and that she must go without delay adding that her life depended on her obedience she then begged of the leader of these ruffians who was one of the national guard to step aside with his myrmidons while she dressed and that she would attend him in a few minutes she recalled the officer who conducted her through the dungeon to the light the least rays of which that dreadful place excluded they reached the prisondoors the other side of which they had scarce gained when the unhappy princess found reason for preferring the darkness of her subterraneous cell to longlost day light which presented her with nothing but an assembly all made up of villains whose faces hands and garments were embrued in blood the murderers were pursuing their desolations under her eyes in short it was in the middle of that tremendous day on which assassination was the most rapacious some of the fiercest of these executioners paused from blood to interrogate her to abuse and menace alas replied the princess i have nothing to say whether i die a few days sooner or later sirs is a matter of indifference to me since i perceive that i am devoted and i am prepared for death she was then hurried to the tribunal where the president being told she refused to answer questions exclaimed a way with her to the abbey this was a signal for all that was to follow and her executioners did not suffer it to escape scarce had she passed the first street ere they struck their august victim several times on the back part of the head with a sabre which was covered with blood  the blood of so many kings and heroes two wretches then took her arms and obliged her to walk over the dead bodies she fainted at almost every step in this situation they stripped her insulted her forced her to stoop down embrace and kiss the carcasses of the murdered citizens shocking to say they then mangled her beautiful bosom and refusing to show her the indulgence of a speedy release stabbed her first in every part they knew not to be vital unable to bear up any longer she sunk on the earth when the wanton villainy of the rabble proceeded to the worst and basest extremities after which being asked whether she would yet save herself by cursing the french queen and family she struggled even with death to exclaim with energy no never  bless them now and ever after which turning to her persecutors she said behold i am ready then dropping on her knees she cried o god all puissant preserve my friends and receive my soul it was in this pious moment the butchers cut off her head from which hung those most beautiful tresses to receive the blood it was then stuck upon a pike and carried by one of the wretches while another followed with her lovely hands and generous heart a third bearing her bowels folded round his brutal arms in a wreath of triumph while a fourth fastened her other members to a hurdle and drew them after him it was in this manner they paraded the streets of paris pausing at every place which contained those who were known most to love and honor this unhappy princess they first stopped under the windows of the duke of penthievre whom they compelled to survey the mutilated limbs of his daughterinlaw and then proceeding to the temple they forced the royal prisoners to gaze upon their friend and favorite defiled with blood and dishonored in the dust and when the queen fainted at the fight the heartless monsters mocked at her anguish and aggravated it by every insult which the sacred relics of her friend could receive as the horrible procession returned they obliged the passengers whether on foot or in carriages to kiss the head of the princess and one of the abandoned creatures with a loud voice exclaimed that he had feasted like an emperor having dined on the heart of a beautiful princess  but all these terrors were alas in the infancy of their crimes or to use the language of patriotism in the dawn of that indivisible and immaculate republic which has since reached the summit of its virtues in the extirpation of the king queen princesses and nobles of the land  in the melancholy annals of the world there certainly have been periods of time sufficiently on the memory to leave an afflicting impression that of the goths and vandals when they came to take vengeance on the roman empire or roving from their forest homes when they sallied like trooping wolves in quest of plunder or of new settlements was a dreadful era the cruelty of maximin when by a single act of authority the whole mass of wealth we are told was at once confiscated for the use of the imperial treasury and the soldiers hardened as they were in acts of violence blushed as the sacrilegious plunder was distributed amongst them  this was another crisis when according to the historians a general cry of indignation was heard imploring vengeance on the common enemy of humankind ancient tradition but too well authenticated multiplies the examples by hundreds and were we to carry the survey to modern times they would extend to thousands amongst the latter must ever be enumerated the disaffection and dismemberment of the blooming states of america but neither these nor any other in the crimson registers of tremendous occurrences equal the enormities which have been long practiced by the french upon each other and taking history what history never related cried robespierre what romance never dared to imagine we have done  that is very true indeed mr robespierre you and your indefatigable coadjutors have outheroded herod with a vengegeance and to prove further that your famous expression in your famous manifesto of murder your solemn proclamation of blood delivered to your fellow citizens november the seventeenth one thousand seven hundred and ninety three by way of sunday discourse  we have heaped up ages within the limits of one single year  to prove  great leader of the unfaithful that this is also a truism you have contrived to turn one of the most extensive nations of the inhabited earth into a butchery   from the beginning of the world to the present hour the aggregate of offenses perpetrated against god and man would justify our pronouncing that the most calamitous condition of the human race is to be dated from the era of the french republic during the absolute monarchy of the tyrant robespierre  when we reflect that these are the times before us that we live in them that fresh reports and experience of fresh horrors reach our eyes ears and hearts every day  that the now liberty reason and humanity all france all nations and all nature triumph that he is now no more sworn enemy of the affrighted globe is every hour either multiplying mischiess abroad or at home and that he does all that in him lies to deal destruction through the land threatening to involve all nations to overturn all governments laws liberties and religions and in fine that the growing evil scarce gives more assurance of tranquillity to you that are remote than to those who are nearer even than i am now to the immediate scenes of action what hope have we but in him whom the moralist beautifully describes as holding the reins of the whole creation in his hand and who moderates them in such a manner that it is impossible for one to break lose upon another without his knowledge and permission  thrice happy he who in a general disaster like that which now desolates so large a portion of the globe and from the spreading misery of which no security can be derived from riches honors poverty or innocence happy is he who can say with the man who exemplified at his death the precepts of his life  in such cases i know but one way of fortifying the soul and that is by securing to ourselves the friendship and protection of that being who disposes of events and governs futurity he sees at one view the whole thread of my existence not only that part of it which i have already past but that which runs forward into all the depths of eternity when i lay me down to sleep i recommend myself to his care when i awake i give myself up to his devotion amidst all the evils that threaten me i will look up to him for help and question not but that he will either avert them or turn them to my advantage though i know neither the time nor the manner of the death i am to die i am not at all sollicitous about it because i am sure that he knows them both and that he will not fail to comfort and support me under them  may sentiments like these soothe every misfortune that my friends my readers and my countrymen may be called upon to bear  and may peace revisit the world  a peace founded on real liberty but not upon frantic licentiousness  such has all along been the private prayer such shall now be the public wish of your ever affectionate friend and servant  the gleaner  p s  how far the divine power in the wisdom of his sublime and inexplicable dispensations may suffer these instruments of vengeance to proceed it is not for mortals to determine in the mean time one cannot but notice the apparent connection betwixt the late events and certain prophetic parts of the sacred writings in a book called liber mirabilis written by the bishop of arles who died in     there are a number of things foretold which seem to warrant our considering the author not only as a divine but a prophet amongst other singular predictions respecting his devoted country are the following the nobles shall be stripped of their dignities and of their riches  the proper defenders and protectors of the kingdom shall be constrained to leave it  there shall be as great an effusion of blood as in the time of the gentiles  the church universal and the universe itself shall bewail the destruction and the pillage of one of the most celebrated cities of the earth  the holy men shall be driven from their sanctuaries  the virgins shall be polluted and fly from their monasteries  the church shall be despoiled of its temporals  the very heads of the nation and the holy temples shall be defiled the mistress of france shall be left desolate  but the black eagle shall appear and the lion shall come roaring from a far country  woe unto thee once opulent city thou that enjoyest all things in proud abundance thy fated hour will come woe unto thee city of philosophy thou will see thyself brought low  the above is given as a literal translation i have not seen the original and offer it you by a german medium how far the prophecy is fulfilled the above faithful accounts and others which must have reached you will testify and wellknowing the gentle virtues of your heart i may exclaim tant dhorreur vous surprend mais de leur barbaric je ne vous conte que le moindre party tout unite paris la mort fans resistance couvrit en un moment la face de la france if this was true in the days of blood which the henriade has sung it is more eminently so at this sanguinary period     voluminous have been the reflections made in the rise and progress of these horrible these unparalleled events the most obvious yet the most perplexing to all reasoning and all order is the consideration that such events happened under the eyes of those who created to themselves new laws new authorities and a new constitution  that at the time when these massacres began the selferected republican governors were in the full origin of their power and that to have put an end to such disorders in the first instance it would have been a very trifling exertion of such power to have prevented if not the bloody effusions of the tenth of august at least those of the second third fourth and fifth of september in the tremendous year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety two for in each of the places where the lives of the citizens were taken away the executioners  or if they better like the term  the patriots  butchers  did not i am instructed from the best authorities exceed more than between thirty and forty and these made up of wretches that looked as if all hell had drawn them into league mercenary robbers condemned highwaymen hired assassins fellows escaped from the galleys girls of the town and fish women such were the original active disturbers of the public peace who might have been brought to order with a slight effort of any one of the protectors of the newraised republic and to the blush of all those who assumed a share in the infant commonwealth glorious in its design but villainously mangled in its cradle it is to be remembered as an eternal monument of their disgrace that there existed at that crisis even on those bloody days an executive power a minister of justice a minister of the interior a mayor a municipality a department a legislative assembly a national guard a commander in chief of that guard  in short the fortyeight sections there does not seem the shadow of an excuse to be made either as men or magistrates for any one of them if the carnage had been perpetrated in an hour they might have said we wanted time for we could not under an hour have put our authorities in force but that carnage continued three days and three nights successively had the assassins been composed of an army formidable by their numbers the legislative bodies might have said we wanted strength to repel such a force of insurgents but those assassins consisted of an handful of men and women and during the whole time of their assassinations the fortyeight sections were assembled and constantly sitting the national assembly had power to save two of their own members m m jancourt and jonneau why did they not extend their generosity or their justice to the rest these their friends were rescued amidst the outrages of the populace who had proscribed them  with respect to revolutions in general it may be a curious speculation to trace their merits and their progress  a reform in governments may be absolutely necessary and a revolution has sometimes set out well there is an instance which is at the same time an example and a very rare one of a revolution continuing under those principles and if ever there was one act of dire oppression more infamous than another it is to be found in the system of tyranny under which that injured country has long and is still laboring we talk loudly of asiatic slavery of the hard fate of the fable race and pitying europe no less than the gleaner seems to take the alarm on then affecting subject but against the property liberty and lives of these poor people who certainly have undeniable and everlasting rights to their own country and the fruits of their own industry and inheritance while they trespass not on the inheritance and industry of other nations against these often and still marked victims of despotism there is formed a cruel combination headed by two of the most powerful despots both of whom by the bye are amongst the loudest declaimers against the french revolution and by way of supporting this illustrious inconsistency one of these powers has one grand army in brabant to assist in destroying tyrants and another grand army elsewhere to exterminate a free and generous people and his imperious colleague in this celebrated bucchanneering orders and joins in public prayers fasts and festivals to beg of the god of equity to turn the hearts of the french and then at the tag end of this mockery hitches in endways another prayer for the success of her arms against these unfortunates the first prayer is hypocritical and the last is sincere but the sincerity has if possible less relish of salvation in it than the hypocrisy in the degree that it is a greater turpitude to be earnest in a vile cause than simply to affect compassion in a good one in this matter however the affectation is intended to give a color to the earnestness when a plunderer wants an apology in a case of selfinterest pity i mean a piteous prayer which is extremely cheap about the interest of others  pity has a mighty convenient mantle to throw over the shoulders and accordingly the plunderer always makes a spoil of it amongst the rest of the pillage to cover himself and his real designs unluckily however in the present business the mantle is too thin the noble personage in question has in the course of a long life and reign had so many occasions to put it on and throw it off just as it became commodious or troublesome that it is threadbare in some places and torn in others and though the sublime wearer is dressed in it at this very moment all the world can see through it  i have been at some pains to glean the great personage above mentioned and have picked up some curious anecdotes and not a few on this very subject and hypocrisy in benevolence the public and private instances of which will amuse you when we meet and the whole of which delectable gleaning is calculated to prove that  all which glisters is not gold and that when a foreign trumpeter whose breath belongs to the power who paid for the trumpet or commanded it to be blown sounds a volley  i can by no means call it a voluntary  about magnificent presents jewel boxes picture in brilliants etc each of immense value it ought to be told at the same time that in certain parts of the world there are mines of sparkling trumpery which the slave digs and the tyrant gives away just as any wouldbethought generous person in our own country might bestow bristol stones and pass them off for diamonds in doing which there seems to be no great danger as the receiver conceiving the gift a mark of honor must starve rather than dispose of it but some men there are who do not choose to carry the point of honor quite so far and who maintain that the laws of selfpreservation are stronger and more binding than those of delicacy on this right of nature it has come to the ears of the gleaner that certain persons have in the last extremity parted with their superb keepsakes and love tokens received from the graciously imperial hands in question and found like the jugglers trick shake but the bag and all seems fair the fingers spread  and nothings there we know that in some hands both abroad and at home this juggling art has raised both fortune and renown and that vice personified in a female character was the best juggler after all in a story that i know of a sword set or said to be set with brilliants of the first water according to courtarithmetic worth  000 florins the ever honored receiver wanting bread could with difficulty get enough to purchase ve and twenty loaves and a splendid ring from the same everhonoured giver estimated at   00 l sterling was pronounced by a famous jeweller to have cost about  00l in short the gleaner has with very few variations had occasion to apply every instance of slight in the fable and thinks that the illustrious juggler abovementioned might exclaim with better pretensions than gays trickster who dares with me dispute the prize  in juggling i submit to none but then this personage has the reason to give which triumphant vice herself made use of and every subordinate trickster crowned or ancrownd might observe how practice has improved her hand but now and then we cheat the throng  she every day and all day long but it is a tempting theme and i am breaking into my corpse de reserve   as unquestionably did that of france under the sanctions of reason honor public good and the cause of religion but nine times out of ten it degenerates into a mere personal quarrel in which public good and every other generous motive is forgotten to make way for the gratification of private ambition avarice and hatred the original cause in the absorbing ferment of party is speedily swallowed up what was principle becomes passion or what at the commencement was a brave and daring contest betwixt the governors for prerogative and the governed for privilege  a determined assertion of real or supposed rights on the one hand and of natural claims on the other at length settles into a mere party madness and the insanity is contagious every body catches it men women and children rave about it the time of reasoning is past consequently the time of entering its causes it is then the business of the individual whatever be his party to follow where that leads to defeat or victory to life or death in the feverish paroxism of indignation each person easily persuades himself his quarrel is just every angry man imagines he has a good reason to be so and the more we are wandering from the right the more violently and inveterately we insist that the objects of our displeasure and enmity are in the wrong and in public as well as private contention the transition from generous strife to illiberal rancour is almost immediate the slightest wound soon turns into a gangrene each person becomes odious to one party and honored by the other as he gives proof of steadiness to his own cause the massacre is called patriotism on the one hand and loyalty on the other and very frequently the object first in contention like the squabble betwixt the two dogs and the shadow is not worth having but meantime it is fought for as fiercely as if it was the one thing necessary to our comfort in this world and our salvation in the next in the end the point is given up and when accounts are cool enough to be reduced to rules of arithmetic it usually turns out that in point of damages each party has suffered in blood and money from thousands up to millions and on the credit side we have nothing to show for them but units and ciphers  on fair calculation therefore my friend whatever advantage may be derived to posterity little is to be gained by the present generation since after every ten years war i mean a civil war of course so much havoc has been done to property in general and the passions of hatred have so rankled in the heart privately speaking against friends neighbors and families even in the miserable septennial squabble about elections this is manifest that i question much whether there is a being on the face of the earth except the stockjobbers forestallers agents and other vultures in society who thrive in time of public calamity can expect to be the better for it the ravages usually drain the best blood fortunes and feelings of the country for at least half a century and supposing there is then a regeneration with some few benefits that were not before enjoyed we shall probably have lost many that were better before the reform began besides the melancholy consideration that our posterity will look upon the party and personal love and hate that has descended to them as part of their inheritance our immediate offspring will have been educated in all the prejudices of our own particular party and the next age will lose little or nothing of hereditary attachment to one side and ill will to another while remoter generations will trace the history of their forefathers and make what the politics or fashion of the day set down as rights and wrongs the cause of new murmurs new exactions new rebellions new patriotisms and in fine the sparks that will be found in stirring up the embers and ashes of the old world shall serve as a match to burn down the new and knowing my friend what we know of the discontented repining spirit of man knowing that even if god himself does not dispense his sunshine and his showers exactly in proportion to our fancied good we rebel have we not the experience of several thousand years that these fires will be kindled up in human society till the coming of that conflagration which lightnings with the meteors blaze conspire and darted downward set the globe on fire   far however am i from wishing to check the genial current of the soul that aspires to liberty it is the true state of nature the genuine spirit of life the health beauty and support of society we cannot even extend our ideas beyond the sphere of this world and raise them to another without supposing that perfect freedom is the basis of immortal felicity a despotic heaven is a contradiction in terms indeed the generous struggles of human beings for liberty when wanton cruelty no longer debases her cause are but assertions of the divine part of our nature those jarring atoms which shake a nation and which are perhaps inseparable from revolutions give way to wise wholesome and humane arrangements and when order is called out of that political chaos though humanity must ever shudder at the dire effect of those convulsions which have preceded such arrangements as tyrants seldom long survive their victims we must venerate the end while we never cease to deplore some of the means by which it has been brought about  in fine applying these general observations to the particular instance before us of the french people   when the dread thirst of blood is over and ruthless rage shall stain their caus  more with honest joy all nations shall embrace their calli foes and own them of a kindred race firm and immoveaele on natures base stands the grand chartor of the human race and he who gave us life bade life be free a sacred truth and which not only in the humanity work from whence these lines are copied but in every other work of his hand and movement of his heart has and will ever influence the thoughts conversation or composition however imperfect in other respects of one who is equally a foe to tyranny and cruelty whether in monarchs or multitudes and a friend to liberty farewell  humanity or the rights of nature a poem in two books a new edition corrected by the author  preface what i ventured abroad many years since under the title of sympathy  a poem which on account of the interests created in the heart by the subject itself was received by the public with so much generous warmth  was intended to serve as a preliminary to what i had farther to observe on society or a prospect of the human race under the combined influences of clime and government religions laws and liberties  from these the transition to tyranny was natural and strongly in connection and from tyranny i felt myself called upon by all the awakened emotions of humanity to consider slavery but not only that species of it which consists in buying and selling our fellow creatures in africa  but every other kind in every other place views therefore of freedom and bondage throughout the different parts of the globe have been taken as well from experience as the best historical evidence  how far the entire abolition so warmly contended for by the supporters of this measure may be consistent with human policy it is not my purpose particularly to enquire it is not the name of slave in itself which produces the great mischief an hired servant in europe may be as little at his own command and destined to as hard labor as a purchased negro in africa but the essential difference consists in the one being guarded by the laws of the land which spread before his person and his property a shield that defends him from every abuse of power and the other is left naked and defenseless to the insolence of office  humanity requires that the rights of nature should be enjoyed by every human being it is therefore against the shocking barbarity i am glad however to have it in my power to observe that we have not suffered the humanity of the french and other nations to surpass our own at least in one of our islands as the following authentic extract from the jamaica councils will attest dated november   th       this day the house of assembly went into a committee on the consolidated slave bill and continued sitting upwards of three hours we understand that by this bill the whole system of the law respecting negrees is entirely changed a council of protection is established in each parish and many humane provisions are introduced for rendering their condition easy and happy it is also made felony without benefit of clergy to murder a slave a clause which to the great honor of the house passed without a single dissenting voice   the unquestionable cruelty and the too well attested horror growing out of these that i still contend  an abolition of these enormities is absolutely necessary for the rest whether the commerce flourishes or falls is a matter of no moment to the philanthropist without engaging in the heats of political controversy without attending to the pleas of interest on the one side or the sallies of enthusiastic zeal though generous in its excesses on the other it is sufficient to him that the happiness of the species in general is made independent on the tyranny of particular individuals  that the laws of subordination in the different classes of society should not violate the laws of humanity  and that so much of liberty should be allowed to every man as to feel a consciousness of his being a link in the great chain of the community and that till by some act of his own it is necessary for the good of the whole that he should be considered as an outcast of society he is by the rights of nature and of reason entitled to protection from insult misery and death  so far as the wealth can be reconciled to the happiness of nations and the establishments of civil society to the rights of nature every lover of his country must subscribe at the same time as the wealth of worlds cannot justify the least wanton insraction of the laws of humanity whoever vainly attempts to support an argument for the one at the expense of the other erects a building which has its foundation in the sands and which must tumble into ruins at the slightest touch of reason and of truth  humanity book i from vernal blooms and many a fragrant bower the redning blossom and unfolding flower from breezy mountains and the covert vale the gliding water and the whispering gale

adrian his historians all agreeing that he wanted strength of mind to preserve his general rectitude without violation he seems nevertheless entitled to the epithet  tender hare given him on the

according to his own constant maxim not for his own good but for the benefit of mankind tender adrian first on romes record who drew distinct the line twixt slave and lord who with sweet mercy tempered awful power while pitys angel hailed the auspicious hour thou too the justice of constantine may be impeached in some strong instances for his character was certainly composed of a mixture of great vices and virtues but the page of history has declared that after a public avowal of the christian faith he was just and indulgent to all christians and although he pursued a scheme of politics that destroyed the empire he established a religion that continues to be the blessing of mankind just constantine with gentle sway bade all be free and all that god obey the fire from heaven a general

which like links sustain connecting parts of the great social chain and while with these no member is at strise as full the right to liberty as life avaunt assertors of superior right and vain distinctions betwixt black and white firm and immovable on natures base stands the grand charter of the human race and he who gave the blessing gave it free life were a curse if robbed of liberty whence then this wondrous difference in our race come crested pride and thy distinction trace lo from the equator to the northern pole though colors change unchangeable the soul if justly bought the

pallid face behold her beauty shift the ever changeful grace here beauty proudly boasts the lengthening head there on the shoulders bids it broadly spread here smallest gems must grace the fair ones ear and there the pendents large as logs appear here see her ask the locks of snowy white yet beg the charm of teeth more dark than night here must the broadend eyebrow shade the face there softly curvd the crescent arch must grace while here again that crescent arch must part even from the root and yield to brows of art here beauty loves the cheek supremely fair there boasts the gash and cherishes the scar in britain rose and iilly must unite while damians isthmus claims the milky white the beard must here even to the girdle flow there not a bristle must presume to grow here the swollen body there the slender waift this wrapped in silk and that in dogskin graced here beauty triumphs in her wooly hair but waves in wreaths her auburn tresses there to grace the dames of europe fair they flow long and profuse upon a neck of snow in every curl a cupid seems to lie to aid the conquests of the sparkling eye the thickest lip here beauty makes her care more softly swelled like dewy rosebuds there the dazzling white is in this clime admired the glossy black in that is more desired feel humbly then nor deem all grace thy own nor think that nature charms in thee alone the poorest native of the poorest coast has still his beauty still his good to boast from earths beginning to its utmost ends proportioned charm proportioned bliss she sends exact division but adapted still to what in different climes her children feel to what when undebauchd by mans desires or sancied wants necessity requires nor sparing nor yet prodigal her plan with poised equality she blesses man on the worst soil some heartfelt joy bestows which the glad son she there has stationd knows and what from us extorts the taunting sneer may to his sense an happiness appear and the fond gifts which we indulgent deem to him an aggravated curse may seem thus kind is nature in her zone serene but not more kind than in her torrid scene not less a parent where the frozen power resides for centuries in his icy tower where the hoar monarch in his vest of snow ascends the hills where suns refuse to glow vain all dispute of color form or size in pride in reasoning pride our error lies in pride in pride alone the difference lies whence then presumptuous man derived thy right and by what law does olive yield to white their nature origin and end the same why has not brown black copper equal claim though shifting colors like their parent earth alike their species and alike their birth if not in color then perchance in sense in the souls power may lie the proud pretense ah no from natures hand all equal came through every clime an helpless babes the same the same frail emblem of our state appears a weak and helpless being born in tears if cultured climes refine on natures plan they change the mode but never change the man the human passions strongly are impressed in the untutored as the polished breast in the swarth african that is bought and sold as the fair plunderer that steals his gold heaven formed his eyes to love his native hue and pointed all his appetites as true those sable tints at which with fear we start are the loved colors that attract his heart our polished arts refinement may bestow but often enfeeble natures genuine glow in polished arts unnumberd virtues lie but ah unnumberd vices they supply here if they bloom with every gentler good there are they steeped with more than savage blood here with refinement if sweet pity stands there luxury round them musters all her bands it is not enough that daily slaughter feeds that the fish leaves its stream the lamb its meads that the reluctant ox is dragged along and the bird ravished from its tender song that in reward of all her music given the lark is murdered as she soars to heaven it is not enough our appetites require that on their altars hecatombs expire but cruel man with more than beastial power must heap fresh horrors on lifes parting hour full many a being that bestows its breath must prove the pang that waits a lingering death here close pent up must gorge unwholesome food there render drop by drop the smoking blood the quivering flesh improves as slow it dies and luxry sees the augmented whiteness rise some gashd and mangled feel the torturers art writhe in their wounds though saved each vital part ask you the cause the food more tender grows and callous luxry

load thy victims with superfluous pain even the gaunt tiger though no life he saves in generous haste devours what famine craves the bestial paw may check thy human hands and teach dispatch to what thy want demands abridge thy sacrifice and bid thy knife for hunger kill but never sport with life relief appears as the muse shifts her place to where pure manners bless the gentlest race lo where the bramins pass their blameless life free from proud culture free from polished strife to man brute insect natures constant friends the heart embraces and the hand extends see the meek tribe refuse the worm to kill no murder feeds them and no blood they spill but crop the living herbage as it grows and quaff the living water as it flows from the full herds the milky banquet bear and the kind herds repay with pastures fair from sanguine man they drive the game away from sanguine man they save the finny prey the copious grain they scatter over the mead the bird to nourish and the beast to feed the flowers their couch their roof the arching trees and peaceful nights succeed to days of ease o thou proud christian aid fair natures grace and catch compassion from the bramin race their kind extremes and vegetable fare their tender maxims all that breathe to spare suit not thy cultured state but thou should know like them to save unnecessary woe like them to give each generous feeling

one leans on all for aid not all on one what worm so feeble as proud man alone the veriest giant by himself is found frail as the reed that every breeze can wound but even the pigmy with associates

sickening at life in haste her offspring flies and when at length the mother yields to fate stretched round her breathless form the affections wait in mute distress and with uplifted hands the child she cradled at her coffin stands invokes her spirit to assuage the woe and teach him patience to endure the blow blesses the holy shade which gave him birth moves to the grave and views the opening earth a filial shudder through his frame he proves as the dust falls upon the dust he loves then as the time steals on with thieflike power and brings to him the allsubduing hour himself ere this a parent soon shall prove the softening offices of filial love soon those who owe him life shall weeping bend and his attracting couch as fondly tend watch his dimmed eye observe his changing cheek and drink his dying breath to hear him speak as sainted sounds of oracles divine his latest accents in their hearts enshrine thus shall he feel the tenderness he gave and equal tears fall fast upon his grave tyrants over brutes with ease extend the plan and rise in cruelty from beast to man their sordid policy each crime allows the flesh that quivers and the blood that flows the furious stripes that murder in a day or torturing arts that kill by dire delay the fainting spirit and the bursting vein all all are reconciled to christian gain in cold barbarian apathy behold sits the slaveagent bending

thoughts how little did the author imagine the triamph was so near here many a fathom down despotic rage hung human victims in the dreadful cage here the poor captive torn from child and wise from youth to age groaned out detested life nor natures sun nor arts supplying blaze ever stole one beani of comfort on his days nor human form nor human hand was nigh to sooth the grief that gathered in

appears escaped the wreck although their barks were lost whole crews were dashed upon a savage coast the coast though savage there the christians find each godlike feeling in an indian mind for touched by cries that pierced the piny wood the natives sought the margin of the flood then as the expiring christians caught their view to human grief the generous indians flew the social passion glowing in his face thus spoke a chieftain of the sable race haste children haste behold where brothers lie  rise strangers rise the hand of help is nigh men like ourselves throughout the globe command the sheltering bosom and the aiding hand all all are kinsmen of a different hue our faces vary but our hearts are true ye poor white wanderers on our bounty thrown your griefs are sacred and

crowned with dulcet canes where the mad ouragan in phrenzy roars affrights the isle and desolates the shores while many a rill and flowery vale between smile in the storm and reconcile the scene there see a hero of the negro line boasts an high feeling briton proud as thine the faithful quashi with his master bred the same their mansion and the same their bed together used in infant times to play their friendship strengthened in lifes riper day the slave was trusty and the lord was kind to quashis care the property assigned his labors closed he took the transient rest then chid the sun yet loitring in the east ere peeped the dawn his daily toils he sought and daily wealth to his loved lord he brought envy at length a poisoned arrow drew which winged with mischief to the master flew of dire neglect the accusation came and lo the sentence past for quashis shame a public punishment was now decreed and the next morn was quashi doomed to bleed the injured slave with shuddring terror heard and at deep midnight sought his barbarous lord then wrought to agony these words addressed the poignard trembling at his masters breast o thou whom no rememberance can move nor cradled tenderness nor manly love dare not to think that quashis soul will bear the public insults which thy hands prepare think not the bloody morn these eyes shall view nor think for pardon that these lips shall sue no monster no my souls above my fate scorns thy proud mercy as it braves thy hate thus tyrant thus thy fury i defy live thou to shame while i in honor die he spoke  the poignard sluicd the crimson flood and bathed the master in the servants blood if thou would negro tenderness behold seek with the muse the coast where broods the gold a snelgrave briton there  immortal be his name by pitys angel marked with endless fame a briton there an indian infant found for savage rites by superstition bound the negro king amidst the crowd he sought and at the sacrifice the victim bought then to the ship his trembling charge conveyed while all the sable train with awe surveyed but scarce the babe was placed upon the deck than loud was heard a females piercing shriek it is he it is he it is the babe i bore whom savage acqua from this bosom tore ah come my own  resume thy couch of rest and cling once more to this maternal breast blessed be the hand by egho formed to save thrice bless the hand that led me here a slave blessed be the author of these transports wild and blessed the power which has restored my child she could no more but still the speaking eye owned the rich gift of sweet humanity but when she heard her infant had been bought even as the flame its tender limbs had caught o indian god oh godlike white she said while over her fable cheek the crimson spread all that a parent all a slave can give o godlike white o indian god receive kneeling she wept then kissed her rescued child while in her jetty arms the infant smiled dances and songs of praise now struck the waves and one strong charm like magic touched the slaves through the long voyage obedient they remain nor sounding whip is heard nor clanking chain touched is thy heart o merchant of thy kind does human softness steal into thy mind roused is the spark too long repressed by gold then bend thy heart to what we next unfold now while perchance the human passions move o view the force of friendship and of love in negro bosoms see those powers at strife which form the bliss and agony of life zebron and zabor of the jetty race were first in feature and proportioned grace bright as the antelope their radiant eyes as the proud palm tree towrd their equal size both wore alike the tygers speckled spoil brothers in dress in pastime and in toil slaves though they were even slavery had its charms for zebrons comfort was in zabors arms and zabor fainting on the arid sand was reared to joy by gentle zebrons hand by bliss united much by sorrow more a negros fate they softened while they bore but love at last a keener pang imparts for fable zelia triumphed over their hearts her skin of ebony bestowed a grace that far outshone an alabaster face so thought the youths with equal truth inspired with all their passion all their climate fired each scorned to ravish each refused to yield and love and friendship both maintained the field devouring torments spread the mutual flame but still their friendship still their love the same when beauteous zelia in their view appears zebron and zabor melt in mutual tears often both embracing to renounce her swear and friendship seems to link them in despair at length their conflicts big with every grief and every passion sought a dire relief at close of day as zelia traced the wood the lovers followed and before her stood the wandering maid too fatal in her charms now snatched to zebrons now to zabors arms the fondest vows that ever lovers swore the deepest groans that ever heaved they pour then with closed eyes and heads declined they dart the mutual daggers in her bounding heart speechless she fell her sobs their shrieks confound they clasp the victim and they kiss the wound then raise the poignards streaming in her blood and with their own augment the crimson flood thus negro virtues negro frailties shine say fairer savage do they yield to thine their ardent virtues emulate thy own their errors are the errors of their zone and art thou still supreme of human race still boasts thy nature the imperial grace ah no without the aid of borrowed arts worth greatness goodness elevate their hearts the towering spirits in their bosoms move they hate with vigor as with force they love together leagued till death they faithful toil and smooth the wrong that chains them to the soil still hand in hand their direful loads they bear divide each joy and mitigate despair vivid as thine the sense of joy and pain thrills in each pulse and vibrates in each vein when hope inspires behold as bright a ray illumes their eyes and over their features play when grief assails the tears as copious flow to mark the soft or agonizing woe when the lash scourges or the pincers rend a shriek as piercing from the heart they send ere the brave spirit of the man is broke even with a britons scorn they spurn the yoke love of their native land that magic charm against a host has made a handful arm they love like thee the soil that gave them birth and treasure up each particle of earth fondly embosomd ere they leave the shore and kiss the sacred relic over and over muficians poets too by nature taught a song spontaneous bursting from a thought swift into measure subjects seem to fly as transient objects transient themes supply each nerve extatic springs to the rebound and every motion seems to paint a found the sweet enthusiasm every grief beguiles and the scourged captive even in anguish smiles with thrilling passion every feature glows so strong the charm it cheats awhile their woes yet who the negros sufferings can relate or mark the varied horrors of their fate where blushing truth shall we their griefs begin or how commence the catalogue of sin demons of torture ye who mock at woe and smile to see the crimson bloodtrack flow in horrid triumph rise from central hell the inventive pangs of christian growth to tell oh aid the shuddering muse to paint the grief which calls on death for pity and relief oh powers of mercy loose that massy yoke oh hold that arm for murders in the stroke behold that axe the quivering limb assails behold that body weltering in its wails ah hear that bludgeon fall that lash resound and see those wretches writhing on the ground see yonder mangled mass of atoms lie behold that christians hands the flames apply at the bare feet is laid that sulphurous train it climbs the heart and burns into the brain survey the triple horrors of their state doomed in each change to be the sport of fate torn from their native land at first they come and then are thrown into the failing tomb in watery dens like coupled beasts they lie and beg the mournful privilege to die but death more kind than man often brings relief releases one while one survives to grief the living wretch his dead associate sees the body clasps and drinks the putrid breeze chained to the noxious corpse till rudely thrown in the vexed sea then left a slave alone ah wretch forlorn thy lot the most severe assassination would be mercy here methinks i hear thee cry ah give me death give the last blow and stop this hated breath oh for a sword to waft me to the shore where never christian white may torture more curse curse me not with being instant throw this loathsome body to the waves below his prayer denied condemned midst slaves to groan the cruel merchant marks him for his own the scar by christian cruelty impressed smoaks on his arm or blackens on his breast the wattled oziers form his rugged bed and daily anguish earns his daily bread short food and shorter rest and endless toil above the scourge below the burning soil soon with his sable brothers must he go doomed to a sad variety of woe like harnessed mules over africs dreadful sand in slow procession move the mournful band the lengthening files begin their circuit wide while on their limbs are galling braces tied fraught with coarse viands see the straining throng drag the oppressive caravan along the massy iron and the direful log their naked bodies even in slumber clog an iron collar over each neck is past and iron rivets hold the collar fast a tightend chain across each shoulder goes while the dark driver takes his own repose at length arrived the miserable band like the stalld oxen pass from hand to hand ye friends of man whose fouls with mercy glow throb not your breasts with sympathising woe fires not the social blood within your veins to make the white man feel the negros pains beat not your hearts the miscreant arms to bind of the proud christian with a savage mind do thou not pant to snap the impious chain and rush to succor the insulted train from servile bonds to free the hapless race and fix the haughty tyrants in their place make them the weight of slavery to know till their hard

might indeed be considered as a poetical prospectus of the intended poem of society the materials of which are lost and with them the probability of the authors having leisure courage or life to begin his labor again with any wellfounded hope of reaching the point of which he once cherished the ambition  for what cannot youth and poesy make us believe  he has judged it better to end the present performance here only observing that in this revision of it he has availed himself of every criticism which on reflection he felt to be just whether such criticism was public or private expressed with mildness or with rigor  dialogue letters containing necessary first questions and enquiries in english german and dutch as promised by the gleaner  to the reader as well to perform a promise as from a thorough conviction of their great utility to travelers of all descriptions these letters are added but as there is nothing in them which can be either profitable or amusing on this side of the

lose the present time in such barren occupation but when longwishd for and longwanted peace shall renew the earth and revive wounded humanity he would as a friend advise all those who carry their gratulations on that joyful event abroad to take these dialogues along with them even though they should refuse the other parts of the work that honor not but that he would feel himself proud to be
