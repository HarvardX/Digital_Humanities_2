florio a tale for fine gentleman and fine ladies and the bas bleu or conversation two poems  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxvi price three shillings  to the hon horace walpole sir it would be very flattering to me if i might hope that the little tale which i now take the liberty of presenting to you could amuse a few moments of your tedious indisposition it is i confess but a paltry return for the many hours of agreeable information and elegant amusement which i have received from your spirited and very entertaining writings yet i am persuaded that you will receive it with favor as a small offering of esteem and gratitude of which the intention alone makes all the little value  the slight verses sir which i place under your protection will not i fear impress the world with a very favorable idea of my poetical powers but i shall at least be suspected of having some taste and of keeping good company when i confess s that some of the pleasantest hours of my life have been passed in your conversation i should be unjust to your very engaging and wellbred turn of wit if i did not declare that among all the lively and brilliant things i have heard from you i do not remember ever to have heard an unkind or an ungenerous one let me be allowed to bear my feeble testimony to your temperate use of this charming faculty so delightful in itself but which can only be safely trusted in such hands as yours where it is guarded by politeness and directed by humanity  i have the honor to be sir your much obliged and most obedient humble servant hannah more january         florio a poetical tale  florio a poetical tale for fine gentlemen and fine ladies florio a youth of gay renown who figured much about the town had passed with general approbation the modish forms of education knew what was proper to be known the establislihd jargon of bonton had learnt with very moderate reading the whole new system of good breeding knew to be negligent and rude but still his feelings would intrude for florio was not meant by nature a silly or a worthless creature he had a heart disposed to feel had sense and spirit taste and zeal was handsome generous but by fate predestined to a large estate hence all the hopes he gave were foiled his mind by praise and pleasure spoiled the destiny who wove the thread of florios being sighed and said poor youth this cumbrous twist of gold more than my shuttle well can hold for which thy anxious fathers toiled thy white and even thread has spoiled this shall seduce thy pliant youth from sense simplicity and truth thy erring fire by this misled shall scatter pleasures round thy head when wholesome disiciplines control should brace the sinews of thy soul coldly thou wilt toil for learnings prize for why should he that is rich be wise the gracious master of mankind who knew us vain and weak and blind in mercy though in anger said that man should earn his daily bread who counteracts the order given disputes the high behest of heaven forgive nor lay the fault on me this mixture of mythology the bard of paradise has deigned with truth to mingle fables feigned who cannot reach his style or thoughts with ease may irritate his faults poor florio at the ardent age when youth should rush on glorys stage when life should open fresh and fair and hope advance with smiling air of youthful gaiety bereft had scarce an unbroachd pleasure left he found already to his cost the shining gloss of life was lost and pleasure was so coy a prude she fled the more the more pursued but florio knew the world that science set sense and learning at defiance he thought the world to him was known whereas he only knew the town in men this blunder still you find all think their little set  mankind though high renown the youth had gained no flagrant crimes his life had stained no tool of falsehood slave of passion but spoilt by custom and the fashion though known among a certain set he did not like to be in debt he shudderd at the dicers box nor thought it very heterodox that tradesmen should be sometimes paid and promises be kept when made his utmost credit as a sinner was that he sometimes spoilt a dinner ever by system came too late and made his choicest parties wait yet twas a hopeful indication on which to found a reputation small habits well pursued betimes may reach the dignity of crimes his mornings were not spent in vice twas lounging sauntering eating ice walk up and down st jamess street full fifty times the youth you would meet he hated cards detested drinking but strolld to shun the toil of thinking twas doing nothing was his curse is there a vice can plague us worse the wretch who digs the mine for bread or ploughs that others may be fed feels less fatigue than that decreed to him who cannot think or read not all the struggle of temptation not all the furious war of passion can quench the spark of glorys flame or blot out virtues very name like the true taste for genuine saunter no rival passions can supplant her they rule in short and quick succession but sloth keeps one long fast possession ambitions reign is quickly closed the usurper rage is soon deposed intemperance where there is no temptation makes voluntary abdication of other tyrants short the strife but indolence is king for life yet though so polished florios breeding think him not ignorant of reading for he to keep him from the vapors subscribed at hookhams saw the papers was deep in poetscorner wit knew what was in italics writ explained fictitious names at will each gutted syllable could fill there often in paragraphs his name gave symptom sweet of growing fame though yet they served but to apprize of buttons form or buckles size he studied while he dressed for true it is he read compendiums extracts beauties abreges dictionnaires recueils mercures journaux extraits and feuilles no work in substance now is followed the chemic extract onlys swallowed he liked those literary cooks who skim the cream of others books and ruin half an authors graces by plucking bonsmots from their places he wonders any writing sells but these spicd mushrooms and morells his palate these alone can touch where every mouthful is bonne bouche of each new play he saw a part and all the anas had by heart he found whatever they produce is fit for conversationuse is ever ready for display a page would prime him for a day they cram not with a mass of knowledge which smacks of toil and smells of college which in the memory useless lies and only makes men  good and wise a friend he had bellario hight a reasoning reading learned wight at least with men of florios breeding he was a prodigy of reading he knew each stale and vapid lie in tomes of french philosophy and then we fairly may presume from pyrrho down to david hume twere difficult to single out a man more full of shallow doubt he knew the little skeptic prattle the sophists paltry arts of battle talked gravely of the atomic dance of moral fitness fate and chance quoted the nonsense of lucretius stripped of the charm which makes it specious dropped hints with wondrous penetration against the history of creation then proved by argument circuitous the combination was fortuitous swore priests whole trade was to deceive and prey on bigots who believe with bitter ridicule could jeer and had the true freethinking sneer stale arguments he had in store which have been answered over and over practiced to raise his reputation the trite old trick of false citation and would from ancient authors quote a sentiment they never wrote upon his highest shelf there stood the classics neatly cut in wood and in a more commodious station you found them in a french translation he swears it is from the greek he quotes but keeps the french just for the notes he worshipped certain modern names who history write in epigrams in pointed periods shining phrases and all the small poetic daisies which crowd the pert and florid style where fact is dropped to raise a smile arts scorned by historys sober muse arts clarendon disdained to use whatever the subject of debate twas larded still with skeptic prate the good with shame i speak it feel not half this proselyting zeal though florio did not yet believe him he thought why should a friend deceive him much as he prized bellarios wit he liked not all his notions yet he thought him charming pleasant odd but hoped he might believe in god still though he tried a thousand ways truths insuppressive torch would blaze where once her flame has burnt i doubt if ever it go fairly out yet under great bellarios care he gained each day a better air with many a leader of renown deep in the learning of the town who never other science knew but what from that prime source they drew pleased to the opera they repair to get recruits of knowledge there mythology gain at a glance and learn the classics from a dance for though they never cared a groat how fared the venurous argonaut yet pleased they see medea rise on fiery dragons to the skies for dido though they never knew her as maros magic pencil drew her fond as she was and brokenhearted her pious vagabond departed yet for didone how they roar and cara cara loud encore one taste bellarios soul possessed the master passion of his breast not one of those frail transient joys which by possession quickly cloys this bliss was solid constant true twas action and twas passion too for though the business might be finished the pleasure scarcely was diminished did he ride out or sit or walk still he lived over again in talk this keen this ever new delight his joy by day his dream by night twas eating did his soul allure in short a modish epicure though once this word as i opine meant not such men as live to dine yet all our modern wits assure us that is all they know of epicurus they fondly fancy that repletion was the chief good of that famed grecian to live in gardens full of flowers and talk philosophy in bowers or in the covert of a wood to descant on the sovereign good might be the notion of their founder but they have notions vastly sounder their bolder standards they erect to form a more voluptuous sect old epicurus would not own em a dinner is their summum bonum you will rather find such sparks as these like epicurus deities like them they laugh at human cares and with disdain view all affairs bellario had embraced with glee this practical philosophy young florios father had a friend and never did heaven a worthier send a cheerful knight of good estate whose heart was warm whose bounty great at christmas still his oxen bled with which the grateful poor were fed resentment vanished where he came and lawsuits died before his name the old esteemed the young caressed him and all the smiling village blessed him within his castles gothic gate sat plenty and oldfashioned state scarce prudence could his bounties stint  such characters are out of print o would kind heaven the age to mend a new edition of them send before our tottering castles fall and swarming nabobs seize on all some little whims he had it is true but they were harmless and were few he dreaded naught like alteration improvement still was innovation he said when any change was brewing reform was a fine name for ruin he thought twoud show a falling state if sternhold should give way to tate this ever dwelt upon his tongue how things were changed since he was young of moderate parts of moderate wit but parts for life and business fit he of no history made profession but of the protestant succession on all occasions never would fail at popery and the french to rail of blackstone he had read a part and all burns justice knew by heart in books that he might waste no minute his poetry had business in it he never had heard of bards of greece but had read half of dyers fleece to make his sphere of knowledge wider his georgics philips upon cider he could produce in proper place three apt quotations from the a poem by mr somervile chase and in the hall from day to day old isaac waltons angler lay this good and venerable knight one daughter had his souls delight for face no mortal could resist her she smiled like hebes youngest sister her life as lovely as her face each duty marked with every grace her native sense improved by reading her native sweetness by goodbreeding no pretty starts of feigned surprise no sweet minauderies closed her eyes led by simplicity divine she pleased and never tried to shine she gave to chance each unschoold feature and left her cause to sense and nature the sire of florio ere he died decreed fair celia florios bride bade him his latest wish attend and win the daughter of his friend when the last rites to him were paid he charged him to address the maid sir gilberts heart the wish approved for much his ancient friend he loved six rapid months like lightning fly and the last gray was now thrown by florio reluctant calls to mind the orders of a sire too kind yet go he must he must fulfill the hard conditions of the will go at that precious hour of prime go at that swarming bustling time when the full town to joy invites distracted with its own delights when pleasure pours from her full urn each tiresome transport in its turn when dissipations altars blaze and men run mad a thousand ways when on his tablets there were found engagements for full six weeks round must leave with grief and desperation three packs of cards of invitation and all the wearisome delights of slavish days and sleepless nights ye nymphs whom tyrant power drags down with hand despotic from the town when almacks doors wide open stand and the gay partners offered hand courts to the dance when steaming rooms fetid with unguents and perfumes invite you to the dear delight of wellbred crowds and mobs polite you may conceive what florio felt and sympathetically melt none else can guess the hardship dire to lawns and woodlands to retire when freed from winters icy chain glad nature revels on the plain when blushing spring leads on the hours and may is prodigal of flowers when passion warbles through the grove and all is song and all is love when newborn breezes sweep the vale and health adds fragrance to the gale six bays unconscious of their weight soon lodged him at sir gilberts gate his trusty swiss who flew still faster announcd the arrival of his master so loud the rap which shook the door the hall reechod to the roar since first the castle walls were reared so dread a sound had never been heard the din alarmed the frightened deer who in a corner slunk for fear the butler thought twas beat of drum the steward swore the french were come it tinged with red poor florios face he thought himself in portland place short joy he entered and the gate closed on him with its ponderous weight who like sir gilbert now was blessed with rapture he embraced his guest fair celia blushed and florio uttered half sentences or rather muttered disjointed words  as honor pleasure kind  vastly good maam  beyond measure tame expletives with which dull fashion fills vacancies of sense and passion yet though disciple of cold art florio perceived he had a heart he saw and but that admiration had been too active too like passion or had he been to ton less true cupid had shot him through and through but vainly speeds the surest dart where fashions mail defends the heart the shaft her cold repulsion found and fell without the power to wound for fashion with a mothers joy dipped in her lake the darling boy that lake whose chilling waves impart the gift to freeze the warmest heart yet guarded as he was with phlegm with such delight he eyed the dame the goddess strait his peril knew and instant to his succor flew but all was safe she saw and smiled and claimed the triumph of her child celia a dinner still supplied which modish luxury might deride yet her discreet wellordered table though sober still was hospitable a modest dinner best displays the master eats on other days and decent elegance was there and plenty with her liberal air but vulgar plenty gave offense and shocked poor florios nicer sense one dish there was which never failed celia with this each guest regaled twas simple mutton roast or boiled sole dish french cookery has not spoiled though rich in game and stored with fish she never forgot her standing dish florio in secret would repine for florio now but lived to dine disgusted at the constant round for ever at her table found he scarce could stand the slender loyn but fainted at the ample chine yet still afraid to give offense or shock his celias grosser sense patient he yielded to his fate when good sir gilbert pild his plate he bowed submissive made no question but that twas sovereign for digestion but such was his unlucky whim it never would agree with him yet feigned to praise the vulgar treat and if he eat not seemed to eat in sleep sad florio hoped to find the pleasures he had left behind he dreamt and lo to charm his eyes the form of weltje seemed to rise the gracious vision waved his wand and banquets sprung to florios hand the imaginary savours rose in tempting odours to his nose a bell not fancys false creation gives joyful note of preparation he starts he wakes the bell he hears alas it rings for morning prayers but how to spend next tedious morning was past his possible discerning unable to amuse himself he tumbled every wellrangd shelf this book was dull and that was wise and this was monstrous as to size with eager joy he gobbled down whatever related to the town whatever looked small whatever looked new halfbound or only stitched in blue old playbills astleys last years feats and opera disputes in sheets as these dear records meet his eyes ghosts of departed pleasures rise he lays the book upon the shelf and leaves the day to spend itself to cheat the tedious hours whenever he sallied forth to take the air his sympathetic ponies knew which way their lords affections drew and every time he went abroad sought of themselves the london road he asked each mile of every clown how far they reckoned it to town and still his nimble spirits rise whilst thither he directs his eyes but when his coursers back he guides the sinking mercury quick subsides a week he had resolved to stay but found a week in every day yet if the gentle maid was by faint pleasure glistend in his eye but when no more the room she graced the slight impression was effaced whenever sir gilberts sporting guests retaild old news or older jests florio quite calm and debonair still hummd a new italian air he did not even feign to hear em but plainly showed he could not bear em celia perceived his secret thoughts but liked the youth with all his faults yet twas unlike she softly said the tales of love which she had read where heroes vowed and sighed and knelt nay twas unlike the love she felt though to her sire with faultring tongue she often remarked  he was but young confessed his manners wrong in part but then  he had so good a heart his interest farther to secure she praised his bounty to the poor for votary as he was of art he had a kind and melting heart though with a smile he used to own he had not time to feel in town not that he blushed to show compassion  it chanced that year to be the fashion at length to wake ambitions flame a letter from bellario came announcing the supreme delight preparing for a certain night by flavia fair returned from france who took him captive at a glance the invitations all were given five hundred cards  a little heaven  a dinner first  he would present him and begged that nothing might prevent him whoever wished a noble air must gain it by an entree there of all the glories of the town twas the first passport to renown then ridiculed his rural schemes his pastoral shades and purling streams sneerd at his present brilliant life his polished sire and highbred wife thus doubly to inflame he tried his curiosity and pride the youth with agitated heart prepared directly to depart but bound in honor to obey his father at no distant day he promised soon to hasten down but business called him now to town then faintly hints a cold proposal but leaves it to the knights disposal stammerd half words of love and duty and muttered much of  worth and  beauty something of passion then he dropped and hoped his ardour  here he stopped for some remains of native truth flushed in his face and checked the youth yet still the ambiguous suffusion might pass for artless loves confusion the doting father thought twas strange but fancied men with times might change yet owned nor could he check his tongue it was not so when he was young that was the reign of love he swore but now those halcyon days are over in that blessed age for honor famed love paid the homage beauty claimed not that insipid daudling cupid with heart so hard and air so stupid who coldly courts the charms which lie in affectations halfclosd eye love then was honest genuine passon and manly gallantry the fashion yet pure as ardent was the flame excited by the beauteous dame hope could subsist on slender bounties and courtiers galloped over two counties the balls fair partner to behold or humbly hope  she caught no cold but mark how much loves annals mend should beautys goddess now descend on some adventure should she come to grace a modish drawing room with radiant eye and heavenly air what beau would hand her to her chair vain were that motion which betrayed the goddess was no earthborn maid if noxious faros baleful spright with rites infernal ruled the night the group so bent on play and pelf venus might call her doves herself as florio passed the castlegate his spirits seem to lose their weight he feasts his lately vacant mind with all the joys he hopes to find yet on whatever his fancies brood the form of celia would intrude however his random thoughts might fly her gentle graces filled his eye nor was the obtrusive vision over even when he reached bellarios door the friends embraced with warm delight and flavias praises crowned the night soon dawned the day which was to show glad florio what was heaven below flavia admired wherever known the acknowledged empress of bonton over fashions wayward kingdom reigns and holds bellario in her chains various her powers a wit by day by night unmatched for lucky play the flattering fashionable tribe each stray bonmot to her ascribe and all her little senate own she made the best charade in town her midnight suppers always drew whatever was fine whatever was new there often the brightest fame you would see the victim of a repartee for slanders priestess still supplies the spotless for the sacrifice who at her polished table sit the summit reach of modish wit the persiflage the unfeeling jeer the civil grave ironic sneer the laugh which more than censure wounds which more than argument confounds the exalted deed which would engage the wonder of a nobler age with unbelieving scorn is heard or else to selfish ends referred to vanitys light effervescence ascribe they virtues purest essence when malice longs to throw her dart but finds no vulnerable part because the virtues all defend at every pass their guarded friend yet by one slight insinuation one scarce perceived exaggeration sly ridicule with half a word can fix her stigma of  absurd her cruel caustics deeply pain and scars indelible remain supreme in wit supreme in play despotic flavia all obey small were her natural charms of face but heightened with each foreign grace but what subdued bellarios soul beyond philosophys control her daily table was as fine as if ten rajahs were to dine she every day produced such fish as would gratify the nice apicius or realize what we think fabulous in the bill of fare of elagabalus yet still the natural taste was cheated twas deluged in some sauce one hated all that can surfeit or can cloy soupes santes which the health destroy and ever on her sumptuous board the savoury pie of perigord all sauce all sweetmeat all confection all poignancy and all perfection rich entremets whose name none knows ragouts french tourtes and fricandeaux might picque the sensuality of the hogs of epicurus sty yet all so foreign and so fine twas easier to admire than dine o if the muse had power to tell each dish no muse has power to spell great goddess of the french cuisine not with unhallowed hands i mean to violate thy secret shade which eyes profane shall never invade no of thy dignity supreme i with mysterious reverence deem or should i venture with rash hand the vulgar would not understand the initiated only know the raptures keen thy rites bestow thus much to tell i lawful deem thy works are never what they seem thy will this general law has past that nothing of itself shall taste thy word this high decree enacted in all be nature counteracted conceive who can the perfect bliss for it is not given to all to guess the rapturous joy bellario found when thus his every wish was crowned to florio as the best of friends one dish he secretly commends then hinted as a special favor what gave it that delicious flavor a mystery he so much reveres he never to unhallowed ears would trust it but to him would show how far true friendships power could go florio at first with transport eat and marvelld at the sumptuous fete but soon his pleasure was destroyed soon every craving sense was cloyed a little warp his taste had gained which unperceived till now remained for from himself he would conceal the change he did not choose to feel he almost wished he could be picking an unsophisticated chicken and when he cast his eyes around and not one simple morsel found o give me was his secret wish my charming celias standing dish now nature struggling for her rights lets in some little casual lights and love combines to war with fashion though yet twas but an infant passion the practiced flavia tried each art of sly attack to steal his heart her forced civilities oppress insulting through mere graciousness while many a gay intrepid dame by bold assault essayed the same filled with disgust he strove to fly the artful glance and fearless eye their jargon he but faintly praises nor echoes back their flimsy phrases he felt not celias powers of face till weighed against bonton grimace nor half her genuine beauties tasted till with factitious charms contrasted no moments liberty he found the industrious harpies hovered round by force and flattery circumvented to play reluctant he consented each dame her power of pleasing tried to fix the novice by her side of pigeons he the very best who wealth with ignorance possessed but flavias rhetoric best persuades that sybil leads him to the shades the fatal leaves around the room prophetic tell the approaching doom yet different from the tale of old twas she who plucked the tempting gold her arts the ponderous purse exhaust a borrowed thousand staked and lost wakes him to sense and shame again nor force nor fraud could more obtain he rose indignant to attend the summons of a ruined friend whom keen bellarios arts betray to all the depths of desperate play the youth unconscious of deceit was plundered of his whole estate too late he looked for friendships aid a beggar in a moment made and now with horror florio views the wild confusion which ensues marks where the infernal furies hold their orgies foul over heaps of gold and demons dire appear to rise guarding the horrid mysteries marks how deforming passions tear the bosoms of the losing fair how haggard looks convulsive faces banish the frightened loves and graces touched with disdain with horror fired he thought of celia and retired that night no sleep his eyelids pressed he thought and thoughts a foe to rest or if by chance he closed his eyes what hideous specter round him rise distempered fancy wildly brings the broken images of things his ruined friend with eyeball fixed swallowing the draught despair had mixed the frantic wife beside him stands with bursting heart and wringing hands and every horror dreams bestow of pining want or raving woe next morn to check or cherish thought his librarys retreat he sought he viewed each book with cold regard of serious sage or lighter bard at length among the motley band the idler fell into his hand the alluring title caught his eye it promised cold inanity he read with pleasure and surprise and found twas charming though twas wise his tea grew cold whilst he unheeding pursued this newdiscoverd reading he wondered at the change he found the elastic spirits nimbly bound time slipped without disgust away while many a card unanswered lay three papers reeking from the press three pamphlets thin in azure dress ephemeral literature well known the lie and scandal of the town poison of letters morals time assassin of our days fresh prime these on his table all that day unthought of and neglected lay florio had now full three hours read hours which he used to waste in bed his pulse beat virtues vigorous tone the reason to himself unknown and if he stopped to seek the cause fair celias image filled the pause and now announcd bellarios name had almost quenched the newborn flame admit him was the ready word which first escaped him not unheard when sudden to his mental sight uprose the horrors of last night his plundered friend before him stands and  not at home his firm commands he felt the conquest as a joy the first temptation would destroy he knew that next day hymens hand should tack the slight and slippery band which in loose bondage would ensnare bellario bright and flavia fair often had he promised to attend the nuptials of his happy friend he longs to go  but yet he fears at length a bolder deed he dares to celia he resolves to fly and catch fresh virtue from her eye though three full weeks did yet remain ere he engaged to come again this plan he tremblingly embraced with doubtful zeal and fluttering haste nor ventured he one card to read which might his virtuous scheme impede each note he dreaded might betray him and shudderd lest each rap should stay him behold him seated in his chaise with face that selfdistrust betrays he hazards not a single glance nor through the glasses peeps by chance lest some old friend or haunt well known should melt his resolution down fast as his foaming coursers fly hyde park attracts his halfraisd eye he stole one fearful conscious look then dropped his eye upon his book long as he viewed augustas towers the sight relaxed his thinking powers in vain he better plans revolves the softening sight his soul dissolves the towers once lost the smoke his eyes pursue while yet its volumes rise soon as he got entirely clear from this enfeebling atmosphere his mind was braced his spirits light his heart was gay his humor bright thus feeling at his inmost soul the sweet reward of selfcontroul impatient now and all alive he thought he never should arrive at length he entered with delight and selfannouncd embraced the knight the youth his joy unfeigned expressed the knight with joy received his guest and owned with no unwilling tongue twas done like men when he was young for celia not a word she said but blushed celestial rosy red her heightened charms transport the youth who promised everlasting truth celia in honor of the day resolved her table to display such was the charm her sweetness gave he thought her wedgwood had been seve her taste diffused a gracious air and neat simplicity was there whose secret power though silent great is the loveliest of the sweet penates florio had now forgot to wish for aught besides the standing dish sir gilberts port he warmly praises and carefully avoids french phrases with patience hears a dissertation on land tax and a ruined nation listens to many a tedious tale of poachers who deserved a jail heard all the business of the quorum of hapless damsels brought before em nor ever hummd a single air while good sir gilbert filled his chair abroad with joy and grateful pride he walks with celia by his side a thousand cheerful thoughts arise each rural scene enchants his eyes with transport he begins to look on natures allinstructive book no objects now seem mean or low which point to him from whom they flow a berry or a bud excites a chain of reasoning which delights and spite of skeptic ebullitions proves atheists not the best logicians a tree a brook a blade of grass suggests reflections as they pass till florio with a sigh confessed the simplest pleasures are the best bellarios systems sink in air he feels the perfect good and fair when called to dress that titus wore a wig the altered florio swore or else in estimating time he never had marked it as a crime that he had lost but one days blessing when we so many lose by dressing the rest suffice it now to say was finished in the usual way cupid impatient for his hour reviled slow themis tedious power whose parchment legends signing sealing are cruel forms for love to deal in at length to florios eager eyes behold the day of bliss arise the flaming sun illumes the globe the burning torch the saffron robe just as of old glad hymen wears and cupid as of old appears in hymens train so strange the case they hardly knew each others face yet both confessed with glowing heart they never were designed to part this selfsame sun and where is the wonder sees flavias slight bands snapt asunder bellario sues for a divorce and both pursue their separate course reader thy clemency to court though long the tale the morals short yet dare i spite of critic satire suppose the standing dish good nature o gentlest blessing man can find sweet soother of the ruffled mind as the soft powers of oil assuage of oceans waves the furious rage lull to repose the boiling tide whose billows charmed to rest subside smooth the vexed bosom of the deep till every trembling motion sleep  thy soft enchantments thus control the tumult of the troubled soul by labor worn by care oppressed on thee the weary mind shall rest from business and distraction free delighted shall return to thee to thee the aching heart shall cling and find the peace it does not bring ye candidates for earths best prize domestic lifes sweet charities o if your erring eye once strays from smooth goodnatures level ways if ever in evil hour betrayed you choose some vain fantastic maid on such for bliss if you depend without the means you seek the end a pyramid you strive to place the point inverted for the base you hope in spite of reasons laws a consequence without a cause and you bright nymphs who bless our eyes with all that skill that taste supplies learn that accomplishments at best serve but for garnish in lifes feast yet still with these the polished wife should deck the feast of human life wit a poor standing dish would prove though it is an excellent remove however your transient guests may praise your gay parade on gala days yet know your husband still will wish goodnature for his standing dish still in lifes fasti you presume eternal holidays will come but in its highest happiest lot o let it never be forgot life is not an olympic game where sports and plays must gain the same each month is not the month of may nor is each day a holiday though wit may gild lifes atmosphere when all is lucid calm and clear in bleak afflictions dreary hour the brightest flash must lose its power while temper in the darkest skies a kindly light and warmth supplies divine goodnature it is decreed the happiest still thy charm should need sweet architect raised by thy hands fair concords temple firmly stands though sense though prudence rear the pile though each approving virtue smile some sudden gust nor rare the case may shake the building to its base unless to guard against surprises on thy firm arch the structure rises the bas bleu or conversation  addressed to mrs vesey  advertisement the following trifle owes its birth and name to the mistake of a foreigner of distinction who gave the literal appellation of the basbleu to a small party of friends who had been sometimes called by way of pleasantry the blue stockings the slight performance occasioned by this little circumstance was never intended to appear in print it is in general too local and too personal for publication and was only written with a wish to amuse the amiable lady to whom it is addressed and a few partial friends but copies having been multiplied far beyond the intention of the author she has been advised to publish it lest it should steal into the world in a state of still greater imperfection though she is almost ashamed to take refuge in so hackneyed an apology however true  the bas bleu vesey of verse

air ah not for you that sidelong glance and all that charming nonchalance ah not for you the three long hours he worshipped the cosmetic powers that finished head which breathes perfume and kills the nerves of half the room and all the murders meant to lie in that large languishing gray eye desist  less wild the attempt would be to warm the snows of rhodope too cold to feel too proud to feign for him youre wise and fair in vain chill shade of that affected peer who dreaded mirth come safely here for here no vulgar joy effaces thy rage for polish ton and graces cold ceremonys leaden hand waves over the room her poppy wand arrives the stranger every guest conspires to torture the distressed at once they rise  so have i seen  you guess the simile i mean take what comparison you please the crowded streets the swarming bees the pebbles on the shores that lie the stars which form the galaxy this serves to embellish what is said and shows besides that one has read  at once they rise  the astonished guest back in a corner slinks distressed scared at the many bowing round and shocked at her own voices sound forgot the thing she meant to say her words halfutterd die away in sweet oblivion down she sinks and of her ten appointments thinks while her loud neighbor on the right boasts what she has to do tonight so very much you would swear her pride is to match the labors of alcides it is true in hyperbolic measure she nobly calls her labors pleasure in this unlike alcmenas son she never means they should be done her fancy of no limits dreams no ne plus ultra bounds her schemes fired at the idea out she flounces and a new martyr john announces we pass the pleasures vast and various of routs not social but gregarious and pleased to gentler scenes retreat where conversation holds her seat small were that art which would ensure the circles boasted quadrature see veseys plastic genius make a circle every figure take nay shapes and forms which would defy all science of geometry isosceles and parallel names hard to speak and hard to spell the enchantress waved her wand and spoke her potent wand the circle broke the social spirits hover round and bless the liberated ground ask you what charms this gift dispense it is the strong spell of common sense away fell ceremony flew and with her bore detraction too nor only geometric art does this presiding power impart but chemists too who want the essence which makes or mars all coalescence of her the secret rare might get how different kinds amalgamate and he who wilder studies chose find here a new metempsychose how forms can other forms assume within her pythagoric room or be and stranger is the event the very things which nature meant nor strive by art and affectation to cross their genuine destination here sober duchesses are seen chaste wits and critics void of spleen physicians fraught with real science and whigs and tories in alliance poets fulfilling christian duties just lawyers reasonable beauties bishops who preach and peers who pay and countesses who seldom play learned antiquaries who from college reject the rust and bring the knowledge and hear it age believe it youth polemics really seeking truth and travelers of that rare tribe who have seen the countries they describe ladies who point nor think me partial an epigram as well as martial yet in all female worth succeed as well as those who cannot read right pleasant were the task i ween to name the groupes which fill the scene but rhymes of such fastidious nature she proudly scorns all nomenclature nor grace our northern names her lips like homers catalogue of ships once  faithful memory heave a sigh here roscius gladdend every eye why comes not maro far from town he rears the urn to taste and brown his english garden breathes perfume and promises perennial bloom here rigid cato awful sage bold censor of a thoughtless age once dealt his pointed moral round and not unheeded fell the sound the muse his honored memory weeps for cato now with roscius sleeps here once hortensius loved to sit apostate now from social wit ah why in wrangling senates waste the noblest parts the happiest taste why democratic thunders wield and quit the muses calmer field taste thou the gentler joys they give with horace and with lelius live hail conversation soothing power sweet goddess of the social hour not with more heartfelt warmth at least does lelius bend thy true high priest than i the lowest of thy train these fieldflowrs bring to deck thy fane who to thy shrine like him can haste with warmer zeal or purer taste o may thy worship long prevail and thy true votaries never fail long may thy polished altars blaze with waxlights undiminishd rays still be thy nightly offerings paid libations large of limonade on silver vases loaded rise the biscuits ample sacrifice nor be the milkwhite streams forgot of thirstassuaging cool orgeat rise incense pure from fragrant tea delicious incense worthy thee hail conversation heavenly fair thou bliss of life and balm of care call forth the longforgotten knowledge of school of travel and of college for thee best solace of his toil the sage consumes his midnight oil and keeps late vigils to produce materials for thy future use if none behold ah wherefore fair ah wherefore wise if none must hear our intellectual ore must shine not slumber idly in the mine let educations moral mint the noblest images imprint let taste her curious touchstone hold to try if standard be the gold but it is thy commerce conversation must give it use by circulation that noblest commerce of mankind whose precious merchandise is mind what stoic traveller would try a sterile soul and parching sky or dare the intemperate northern zone if what he saw must never be known for this he bids his home farewell the joy of seeing is to tell trust me he never would have stirred were he forbid to speak a word and curiosity would sleep if her own secrets she must keep the bliss of telling what is past becomes her rich reward at last yet not from low desire to shine does genius toil in learnings mine not to indulge in idle vision but strike new light by strong collision over books the mind inactive lies books the minds food not exercise her vigorous wing she scarcely feels till use the latest strength reveals her slumbering energies called forth she rises conscious of her worth and at her newfound powers elated thinks them not roused but new created enlightened spirits you who know what charms from polished converse flow speak for you can the pure delight when kindred sympathies unite when correspondent tastes impart communion sweet from heart to heart you never the cold gradations need which vulgar souls to union lead no dry discussion to unfold the meaning caught as soon as told but sparks electric only strike on souls electrical alike the flash of intellect expires unless it meet congenial fires the language to the elect alone is like the masons mystery known in vain the unerring sign is made to him who is not of the trade what lively pleasure to divine the thought implied the hinted line to feel allusions artful force and trace the image to its source quick memory blends her scattered rays till fancy kindles at the blaze the works of ages start to view and ancient wit elicits new but wit and parts if thus we praise what nobler altars should we raise those sacrifices could we see which wit o virtue makes to thee at once the rising thought to dash to quench at once the bursting flash the shining mischief to subdue and lose the praise and pleasure too this is high principles control this is true continence of soul blush heroes at your cheap renown a vanquished realm a plundered town your conquests were to gain a name this conquest triumphs over fame so pure its essence twere destroyed if known and if commended void amidst the brightest truths believed amidst the fairest deeds achieved shall stand recorded and admired that virtue sunk what wit inspired but let the lettered and the fair and chiefly let the wit beware you whose warm spirits never fail forgive the hint which ends my tale though science nursed you in her bowers though fancy crown your brow with flowers each thought though bright invention fill though attic bees each word distill yet if one gracious power refuse her gentle influence to infuse in vain shall listening crowds approve they will praise you but they will not love what is this power youre loath to mention this charm this witchcraft it is attention mute angel yes thy looks dispense the silence of intelligence thy graceful form i well discern in act to listen and to learn it is thou for talents shall obtain that pardon wit would hope in vain thy wondrous power thy secret charm shall envy of her sting disarm thy silent flattery sooths our spirit and we forgive eclipsing merit the sweet atonement screens the fault and love and praise are cheaply bought with mild complacency to hear
