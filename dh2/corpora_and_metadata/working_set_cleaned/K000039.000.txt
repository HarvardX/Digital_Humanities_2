a comedy called the bassettable  the bassettable a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by her majestys servants  by the author of the gamester  london printed for william turner at the angel at lincolnsinnbackgate and sold by j nutt near stationers hall   0  price   s   d  to the right honorable arthur lord altham baron of altham in the kingdom of ireland my lord poetry in its first institution was principally designed to correct and rectify manners thence it was that the roman and athenian stages were accounted schools of divinity and morality where the tragic writers of those days inspired their audiences with noble and heroic sentiments and the comic laughed and diverted them out of their vices and by rediculing folly intemperence and debauchery gave them an indignation for those irregularities and made them pursue the opposite virtues  this caused the dramatic poets in ancient times not only to be reverenced by the lower sort of people but highly esteemed and courted by persons of the first rank and though the writers of latter ages have in a greater measure not to say in a scandelous manner deviated from the footsteps and examples of their predecessors yet have they found protection and favor with those who have been so generous as to ascribe the faults of the poets to the degeneracy of the age wherein they lived  this consideration my lord has imboldend me to this address for though on the one hand i am sensible that the following piece does little merit your lordships patronage yet your innate goodness and generosity give me hopes that your lordship will pardon this intrusion in which i have the examples of all those that wrote before me to bear me out i heartily wish this play were more worthy of your lordships acceptance yet so much i hope will be forgiven to the fondness of a mother for her production if i say in its favor that through the whole piece i have had a tender regard to good manners and by the main drift of it endeavored to redicule and correct one of the most reigning vices of the age i might say as many of my brethren have done upon slighter grounds that this play has had the good fortune to please and divert the nicest and politest part of the town but i should set little stress on their applause had i not some reason to depend upon your lordships approbation whose judgment penetration and discernment are alone sufficient to do full justice to a performance of this kind  and now my lord if i followed the beaten road of dedicators it would naturally engage me in a panegirick upon your lordships personal virtues and those of your noble and pious family but i shall purposely decline a talk to which i freely own my ability is unequal and which though managed by a masterly pen would make your modesty suffer therefore i shall conclude with begging your lordships leave to subscribe my self with all imaginable respect and sincerity  my lord your lordships most obedient and most devoted humble servant  prologue spoke by mr penkethman in all the faces that to plays resort whether of country city mob or court i have always found that none such hopes inspire as you  dear brethren of the upper tire poets in prologues may both preach and rail yet all their wisdom nothing will avail who writes not up to you it is ten to one will fail your thundering plaudit it is that deals out fame you make plays run though of themselves but lame how often have we known your noise commanding impose on your inferior masters understanding therefore dear brethren since i am one of you whether adorned in gray green brown or blue this day stand all by me as i will fall by you and now to let  the poor pit see how pinkys voice commands silence  now rattle all your sticks and clap your grimy hands i greet your love  and let the vainest author show half this command on clearer hands below nay more to prove your interest let this play live by you so may you share good claret with your masters still free in your amors from their disasters free from poor housekeeping where peck is under locks free from cold kitchings and no christmas box so may no long debates in the house of commons make you in the lobby starve when hungar summons but may your plentious vails come flowing in give you a lucky hit and make you gentlemen and thus preferred never fear the worlds reproaches but shake your elbows with my lord and keep your coaches epilogue spoke by mr esthcourt this goodly fabric to a gazing tarr seems fore and aft a three decktman os war abaft the holds the pit from

  lady bless me may not any person sleep when they please   l lucy no there are certain hours that good man modesty and health require your care for exam disorderly hours are neither healthful nor modest   not civil to make company wait dinner for your    lady why does any body dine before four a clock in london for my part i think it an illbred custom to make my appetite pendulum to the twelfth hour   alp besides it is out of fashion to dine by day light and so i told sir richard yesterday madam   l lucy no doubt but you did mrs alpiew and then you entertain such a train of people cousin that my lady reveller is as noted as a public ordinary where every fool with money finds a welcome   lady would you have me shut my doors against my friends  now she is jealous of sir james courtly aside besides is it possible to pass the evenings without diversions   alp no certainly    l lucy i think the playhouse the much more innocent and commendable diversion   lady to be seen there every night in my opinion is more destructive to the reputation   l lucy well i had rather be noted every night in the front box then by my absence once be suspected of gaming one ruins my estate and character the other diverts my temper and improves my mind then you have such a number of lovers   lady oh cupid is it a crime to have a number of lovers if it be it is the pleasantest crime in the world a crime that falls not every day to every womans lot   l lucy i dare be positive every woman does not wish it   lady because wishes have no effect cousin ha ha   l lucy methinks my lord worthys assiduity might have banished the admiring crowd by this time   lady banished em oh mon cour what pleasure is there in one lover it is like being seen always in one suit of clothes a woman with one admirer will never be a reigning toast   l lucy i am sure those that encourage more will never have the character of a reigning virtue   lady i slight the malicious censure of the town yet defy it to asperse my verture nature has given me a face a shape a mein an air for dress and wit and humor to subdue and shall i lose my conquest for a name   alp nay and among the unfashionable sort of people too madam for persons of breeding and quality will allow that gallantry and virtue are not inseparable   l lucy but coquetry and reputation are and there is no differerence in the eye of the world between having really committed the fault and lying under the scandal for my own part i would take as much care to preserve my fame as you would your virtue   lady a little pains will serve you for that cousin for i never once heard you named  a mortification would break my heart ha ha   l lucy it is better never to be named than to be ill spoke of but your reflections shall not disorder my temper i could wish indeed to convince you of your error because you share my blood but since i see the vanity of the attempt i shall desist   lady i humbly thank your ladyship   alp oh madam here is my lord worthy sir james courtly and ensign lovely coming down will your ladyship see them   lady now have i a strong inclination to engage sir james to discompose her gravity for if i have any skill in glances she loves him  but then my lord worthy is so peevish since our late quarrel that i am afraid to engage the knight in a ducl besides my absence i know will teize him more therefore upon consideration i will retire cousin lucy good morrow i will leave you to better company there is a person at hand may prevent your sixaclock prayers  exit lucy ha sir james courtly  i must own i think him agreeable  but am sorry she believes i do i will not be seen for if what i scarce know my self be grown so visible to her perhaps he too may discover it and then i am lost  while in the breast our secrets close remain it is out of fortunes power to give us pain exit enter lord worthy sir james ensign lovel sir james ha was not that lady lucy   ensign it was  ah sir james i find your heart is out of order about that lady and my lord worthy languishes for lady reveller   sir james and thou art sick for valeria sir richards daughter a poor distresled company of us   ensign it is true that little shephilosopher has made me do penance more heartily than ever my sins did i deserve her by mere dint of patience i have stood whole hours to hear her assert that fire cannot burn nor water drown nor pain afflict and forty ridiculous systems  and all her experiments on frogs fish  and flies ha ha ha without the lcast contradiction   ensign contradiction no no i allowed all she said with undoubtedly madam  i am of your mind madam it must be so  natural causes etc   sir james ha ha ha i think it is a supernatural cause which enables thee to go through this fatigue if it were not to raise thy fortune i should think thee mad to pursue her but go on and prosper nothing in my power shall be wanting to assist you  my lord worthy  your lordship is as melancholy as a losing gamester   lord faith gentlemen i am out of humor but i dont know at what   sir james why then i can tell you for the very same reason that made your lordship stay here to be spectator of the very diversion you hate  gaming  the same cause makes you uneasy in all company my lady reveller   lord thou have hit it james i confess i love her person but hate her humors and her way of living i have some reasons to believe i am not indifferent to her yet i despair of fixing her her vanity has got so much the mistress of her resolution and yet her passion for gain furmounts her pride and lays her reputation open to the world every fool that has ready money shall dare to boast himself her very humble servant ds death when i could cut the rascals throat   sir james your lordship is even with her one way for you are as testy as she is vain and as fond of an opportunity to quarrel with her as she of a gaming acquaintance my opinion is my lord she will never be won your way  to gain all women there is a certain rule if wit should sail to please then act the fool and where you find simplicity not take throw off disguises  and profess the rake observe which way their chiefest humors run they are by their own loved cannot the surest way undone  lord you are of a happy temper sir james i wish i could be so too but since i cannot add to your diversion i will take my leave good morrow gentlemen  exit sir james this it is to have more love than reason about one you and i lovely will go on with discretion and yet i fear it is in lady lucys power to banish it   ensign i find mrs sago the drugsters wifes interest begins to shake sir james   sir james and i fear her love for play begins to shake her husbands baggs too  faith i am weary of that intreague lest i should be suspected to have a hand in his ruin   ensign she did not lose much to night i believe preethy sir james what kind of a tempered woman is she has she wit   sir james that she has  a large portion and as much cunning or she could never have managed the old fellow so nicely she has a vast passion for my lady reveller and endeavors to mimick her in every thing  not a suit of clothes or a topknot that is not exactly the same with hers  then her plots and contrivances to supply these expenses puts her continually upon the rack yet to give her her due she has a fertile brain that way but come shall we go home and sleep two or three hours at dinner i will introduce you to capt hearty the sea officer your rival that is to be he is just come to town   ensign a powerful rival i fear for sir richard resolves to marry him to his daughter all my hopes lies in her arguments and you know philosophers are very positive  and if this captain does but happen to contradict one whimsical notion the poles will as soon join as they couple and rather then yield she would go to the indies in search of dampiers ants   sir james nay she is no woman if she obeys  women like tides with passions ebb and flow and like them too their
