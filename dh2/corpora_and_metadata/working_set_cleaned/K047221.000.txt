two letters from mr burke on the bills relative to the trade of ireland  price one shilling  two letters from mr burke to gentlemen in the city of bristol on the bills depending in parliament relative to the trade of ireland  london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxxviii  to samuel span esquire master of the society of merchants adventurers of bristol sir i am honored with your letter of the   th in answer to mine which accompanied the resolutions of the house relative to the trade of ireland  you will be so good as to present my best respects to the society and to assure them that it was altogether unnecessary to remind me of the interest of the constituents i have never regarded any thing else since i had a seat in parliament having frequently and maturely considered that interest and stated it to myself in almost every point of view i am persuaded that under the present circumstances i cannot more effectually pursue it than by giving all the support in my power to the propositions which i lately transmitted to the hall  the fault i find in the scheme is  that it falls extremely short of that liberality in the commercial system which i trust will one day be adopted if i had not considered the present resolutions merely as preparatory to better things and as a means of showing experimentally that justice to others is not always folly to ourselves i should have contented myself with receiving them in a cold and silent acquiescence separately considered they are matters of no very great importance but they aim however imperfectly at a right principle i submit to the restraint to appease prejudice i accept the enlargement so far as it goes as the result of reason and of sound policy  we cannot be insensible of the calamities which have been brought upon this nation by an obstinate adherence to narrow and restrictive plans of government i confess i cannot prevail on myself to take them up precisely at a time when the most decisive experience has taught the rest of the world to lay them down the propositions in question did not originate from me or from my particular friends but when things are so right in themselves i hold it my duty not to enquire from what hands they come i opposed the american measures upon the very same principle on which i support those that relate to ireland i was convinced that the evils which have arisen from the adoption of the former would be infinitely aggravated by the rejection of the latter  perhaps gentlemen are not yet fully aware of the situation of their country and what its exigencies absolutely require i find that we are still disposed to talk at our ease and as if all things were to be regulated by our good pleasure i should consider it as a fatal symptom if in our present distressed and adverse circumstances we should persist in the errors which are natural only to prosperity one cannot indeed sufficiently lament the continuance of that spirit of delusion by which for a long time past we have thought fit to measure our necessities by our inclinations moderation prudence and equity are far more suitable to our condition than loftiness and confidence and rigor we are threatened by enemies of no small magnitude whom if we think fit we may despise as we have despised others but they are enemies who can only cease to be truly formidable by our entertaining a due respect for their power our danger will not be lessened by our shutting our eyes to it nor will our force abroad be increased by rendering ourselves feeble and divided at home  there is a dreadful schism in the british nation since we are not able to reunite the empire it is our business to give all possible vigor and soundness to those parts of it which are still content to be governed by our councils sir it is proper to inform you that our measures must be healing such a degree of strength must be communicated to all the members of the state as may enable them to defend themselves and to cooperate in the defense of the whole their temper too must be managed and their good affections cultivated they may then be disposed to bear the load with cheerfulness as a contribution toward what may be called with truth and propriety and not by an empty form of words a common cause too little dependence cannot be had at this time of day on names and prejudices the eyes of mankind are opened and communities must be held together by an evident and solid interest god forbid that our conduct should demonstrate to the world that great britain can in no instance whatsoever be brought to a sense of rational and equitable policy but by coercion and force of arms  i wish you to recollect with what powers of concession relatively to commerce as well as to legislation his majestys commissioners to the united colonies have sailed from england within this week whether these powers are sufficient for their purposes it is not now my business to examine but we all know that our resolutions in favor of ireland are trifling and insignificant when compared with the concessions to the americans at such a juncture i would implore every man who retains the least spark of regard to the yet remaining honor and security of this country not to compel others to an imitation of their conduct or by passion and violence to force them to seek in the territories of the separation that freedom and those advantages which they are not to look for whilst they remain under the wings of their ancient government  after all what are the matters we dispute with so much warmth do we in these resolutions bestow any thing upon ireland not a shilling we only consent to leave to them in two or three instances the use of the natural faculties which god has given to them and to all mankind is ireland united to the crown of great britain for no other purpose than that we should counteract the bounty of providence in her favor and in proportion as that bounty has been liberal that we are to regard it as an evil which is to be met with in every sort of corrective to say that ireland interferes with us and therefore must be checked is in my opinion a very mistaken and a very dangerous principle i must beg leave to repeat what i took the liberty of suggesting to you in my last letter that ireland is a country in the same climate and of the same natural qualities and productions with this and has consequently no other means of growing wealthy in herself or in other words of being useful to us but by doing the very same things which we do for the same purposes i hope that in great britain we shall always pursue without exception every means of prosperity and of course that ireland will interfere with us in something or other for either in order to limit her we must restrain ourselves or we must fall into that shocking conclusion that we are to keep our yet remaining dependency under a general and indiscriminate restraint for the mere purpose of oppression indeed sir england and ireland may flourish together the world is large enough for us both let it be our care not to make ourselves too little for it  i know it is said that the people of ireland do not pay the same taxes and therefore ought not in equity to enjoy the same benefits with this i had hopes that the unhappy phantom of a compulsory equal taxation had haunted us long enough i do assure you that until it is entirely banished from our imaginations where alone it has or can have any existence we shall never cease to do ourselves the most substantial injuries to that argument of equal taxation i can only say  that ireland pays as many taxes as those who are the best judges of her powers are of opinion she can bear to bear more she must have more ability and in the order of nature the advantage must precede the charge this disposition of things being the law of god neither you nor i can alter it so that if you will have more help from ireland you must previously supply her with more means i believe it will be found that if men are suffered freely to cultivate their natural advantages a virtual equality of contribution will come in its own time and will flow by an easy descent through its own proper and natural channels an attempt to disturb that course and to force nature will only bring on universal discontent distress and confusion  you tell me sir that you prefer an union with ireland to the little regulations which are proposed in parliament this union is a great question of state to which when it comes properly before me in my parliamentary capacity i shall give an honest and unprejudiced consideration however it is a settled rule with me to make the most of my actual situation and not to refuse to do a proper thing because there is something else more proper which i am not able to do this union is a business of difficulty and on the principles of your letter a business impracticable until it can be matured into a feasible and desirable scheme i wish to have as close an union of interest and affection with ireland as i can have and that i am sure is a far better thing than any nominal union of government  france and indeed most extensive empires which by various designs and fortunes have grown into one great mass contain many provinces that are very different from each other in privileges and modes of government and they raise their supplies in different ways in different proportions and under different authorities yet none of them are for this reason curtailed of their natural rights but they carry on trade and manufactures with perfect equality in some way or other the true balance is found and all of them are properly poised and harmonised how much have you lost by the participation of scotland in all your commerce the external trade of england has more than doubled since that period and i believe your internal which is the most advantageous has been augmented at least fourfold such virtue there is in liberality of sentiment that you have grown richer even by the partnership of poverty  if you think that this participation was a loss commercially considered but that it has been compensated by the share which scotland has taken in defraying the public charge  i believe you have not very carefully looked at the public accounts ireland sir pays a great deal more than scotland and is perhaps as much and as effectually united to england as scotland is but if scotland instead of paying little had paid nothing at all we should be gainers not losers by acquiring the hearty cooperation of an active intelligent people toward the increase of the common stock instead of our being employed in watching and counteracting them and their being employed in watching and counteracting us with the peevish and churlish jealousy of rivals and enemies on both sides  i am sure sir that the commercial experience of the merchants of bristol will soon disabuse them of the prejudice that they can trade no longer if countries more lightly taxed are permitted to deal in the same commodities at the same markets you know that in fact you trade very largely where you are met by the goods of all nations you even pay high duties on the import of your goods and afterward undersell nations less taxed at their own markets and where goods of the same kind are not charged at all if it were otherwise you could trade very little you know that the price of all sorts of manufacture is not a great deal inhanced except to the domestic consumer by any taxes paid in this country this i might very easily prove  the same consideration will relieve you from the apprehension you express with relation to sugars and the difference of the duties paid here and in ireland those duties affect the interior consumer only and for obvious reasons relative to the interest of revenue itself they must be proportioned to his ability of payment but in all cases in which sugar can be an object of commerce and therefore in this view of rivalship you are sensible that you are at least on a par with ireland as to your apprehensions concerning the more advantageous situation of ireland for some branches of commerce for it is so but for some i trust you will not find them more serious millford haven which is at your door may serve to show you that the mere advantage of ports is not the thing which shifts the seat of commerce from one part of the world to the other if i thought you inclined to take up this matter on local considerations i should state to you that i do not know any part of the kingdom so well situated for an advantageous commerce with ireland as bristol and that none would be so likely to profit of its prosperity as our city but your profit and theirs must concur beggary and bankruptcy are not the circumstances which invite to an intercourse with that or with any country and i believe it will be found invariably true that the superfluities of a rich nation furnish a better object of trade than the necessities of a poor one it is the interest of the commercial world that wealth should be found every where  the true ground of fear in my opinion is this that ireland from the vicious system of its internal polity will be a long time before it can derive any benefit from the liberty now granted or from any thing else but as i do not vote advantages in hopes that they may not be enjoyed i will not lay any stress upon this consideration i rather wish that the parliament of ireland may in its own wisdom remove these impediments and put their country in a condition to avail itself of its natural advantages if they do not the fault is with them and not with us  i have written this long letter in order to give all possible satisfaction to my constituents with regard to the part i have taken in this affair it gave me inexpressible concern to find that my conduct had been a cause of uneasiness to any of them next to my honor and conscience i have nothing so near and dear to me as their approbation however i had much rather run the risque of displeasing than of injuring them  if i am driven to make such an option you obligingly lament that you are not to have me for your advocate but if i had been capable of acting as an advocate in opposition to a plan so perfectly consonant to my known principles and to the opinions i had publicly declared on an hundred occasions i should only disgrace myself without supporting with the smallest degree of credit or effect the cause you wished me to undertake i should have lost the only thing which can make such abilities as mine of any use to the world now or hereafter i mean that authority which is derived from an opinion that a member speaks the language of truth and sincerity and that he is not ready to take up or lay down a great political system for the convenience of the hour that he is in parliament to support his opinion of the public good and does not form his opinion in order to get into parliament or to continue in it it is in a great measure for your sake that i wish to preserve this character without it i am sure i should be ill able to discharge by any service the smallest part of that debt of gratitude and affection which i owe you for the great and honorable trust you have reposed in me i am with the highest regard and esteem  sir your most obedient and humble servant e b beaconsfield   d april      copy of a letter to mess   and co bristol gentlemen it gives me the most sensible concern to find that my vote on the resolutions relative to the trade of ireland has not been fortunate enough to meet with your approbation i have explained at large the grounds of my conduct on that occasion in my letters to the merchants hall but my very sincere regard and esteem for you will not permit me to let the matter pass without an explanation which is particular to yourselves and which i hope will prove satisfactory to you  you tell me that the conduct of your late member is not much wondered at but you seem to be at a loss to account for mine and you lament that i have taken so decided a part against my constituents  this is rather an heavy imputation does it then really appear to you that the propositions to which you refer are on the face of them so manifestly wrong and so certainly injurious to the trade and manufactures of great britain and particularly to yours that no man could think of proposing or supporting them except from resentment to you or from some other oblique motive if you suppose your late member or if you suppose me to act upon other reasons than we choose to avow to what do you attribute the conduct of the other members who in the beginning almost unanimously adopted those resolutions to what do you attribute the strong part taken by the ministers and along with the ministers by several of their most declared opponents this does not indicate a ministerial jobb a party design or a provincial or local purpose it is therefore not so absolutely clear that the measure is wrong or likely to be injurious to the true interests of any place or any person  the reason gentlemen for taking this step at this time is but too obvious and too urgent i cannot imagine that you forget the great war which has been carried on with so little success and as i thought with so little policy in america or that you are not aware of the other great wars which are impending ireland has been called upon to repel the attacks of enemies of no small power brought upon her by councils in which she has had no share the very purpose and declared object of that original war which has brought other wars and other enemies on ireland was not very flattering to her dignity her interest or to the very principle of her liberty yet she submitted patiently to the evils she suffered from an attempt to subdue to your obedience countries whose very commerce was not open to her america was to be conquered in order that ireland should not trade thither whilst the miserable trade which she is permitted to carry on to other places has been torn to pieces in the struggle in this situation are we neither to suffer her to have any real interest in our quarrel or to be flattered with the hope of any future means of bearing the burdens which she is to incurr in defending herself against enemies which we have brought upon her  i cannot set my face against such arguments is it quite fair to suppose that i have no other motive for yielding to them but a desire of acting against my constituents it is for you and for your interest as a dear cherished and respected part of a valuable whole that i have taken my share in this question you do not you cannot suffer by it if honesty be true policy with regard to the transient interest of individuals it is much more certainly so with regard to the permanent interests of communities i know that it is but too natural for us to see our own certain ruin in the possible prosperity of other people it is hard to persuade us that every thing which is got by another is not taken from ourselves but it is fit that we should get the better of these suggestions which come from what is not the best and soundest part of our nature and that we should form to ourselves a way of thinking more rational more just and more religious trade is not a limited thing as if the objects of mutual demand and consumption could not stretch beyond the bounds of our jealousies god has given the earth to the children of men and he has undoubtedly in giving it to them given them what is abundantly sufficient for all their exigencies not a scanty but a most liberal provision for them all the author of our nature has written it strongly in that nature and has promulgated the same law in his written word that man shall eat his bread by his labor and i am persuaded that no man and no combination of men for their own ideas of their particular profit can without great impiety undertake to say that he shall not do so that they have no sort of right either to prevent the labor or to withhold the bread ireland having received no compensation directly or indirectly for any restraints on their trade ought not in justice or common honesty be made subject to such restraints i do not mean to impeach the right of the parliament of great britain to make laws for the trade of ireland i only speak of what laws it is right for parliament to make  it is nothing to an oppressed people to say that in part they are protected at our charge the military force which shall be kept up in order to cramp the natural faculties of a people and to prevent their arrival to their utmost prosperity is the instrument of their servitude not the means of their protection to protect men is to forward and not to restrain their improvement else what is it more than to avow to them and to the world that you guard them from others only to make them a prey to yourself this fundamental nature of protection does not belong to free but to all governments and is as valid in turkey as in great britain no government ought to own that it exists for the purpose of checking the prosperity of its people or that there is such a principle involved in its policy  under the impression of these sentiments and not as wanting every attention to my constituents which affection and gratitude could inspire i voted for these bills which give you so much trouble i voted for them not as doing complete justice to ireland but as being something less unjust than the general prohibition which has hitherto prevailed i hear some discourse as if in one or two paltry duties on materials ireland had a preference and that those who set themselves against this act of scanty justice assert that they are only contending for an equality what equality do they forget that the whole woollen manufacture of ireland the most extensive and profitable of any and the natural staple of that kingdom has been in a manner so destroyed by restrictive laws of ours and at our persuasion and on our promises by restrictive laws of their own that in a few years it is probable they will not be able to wear a coat of their own fabric is this equality do gentlemen forget that the understood faith upon which they were persuaded to such an unnatural act has not been kept but a linenmanufacture has been set up and highly encouraged against them is this equality do they forget the state of the trade of ireland in beer so great an article of consumption and which now stands in so mischievous a position with regard to their revenue their manufacture and their agriculture do they find any equality in all this yet if the least step is taken toward doing them common justice in the lightest articles for the most limited markets a cry is raised as if we were going to be ruined by partiality to ireland  gentlemen i know that the deficiency in these arguments is made up not by you but by others by the usual resource on such occasions the confidence in military force and superior power but that ground of confidence which at no time was perfectly just or the avowal of it tolerably decent is at this time very unseasonable late experience has shown that it cannot be altogether relied upon and many if not all our present difficulties have arisen from putting our trust in what may very possibly fail and if it should fail leaves those who are hurt by such a reliance without pity whereas honesty and justice reason and equity go a very great way in securing prosperity to those who use them and in case of failure secure the best retreat and the most honorable consolations  it is very unfortunate that we should consider those as rivals whom we ought to regard as fellow laborers in a common cause ireland has never made a single step in its progress toward prosperity by which you have not had a share and perhaps the greatest share in the benefit that progress has been chiefly owing to her own natural advantages and her own efforts which after a long time and by slow degrees have prevailed in some measure over the mischievous systems which have been adopted far enough she is still from having arrived even at an ordinary state of perfection and if our jealousies were to be converted into politics as systematically as some would have them the trade of ireland would vanish out of the system of commerce but believe me if ireland is beneficial to you it is so not from the parts in which it is restrained but from those in which it is left free though not left unrivalled the greater its freedom the greater must be your advantage if you should lose in one way you will gain in twenty  whilst i remain under this unalterable and powerful conviction you will not wonder at the decided part i take it is my custom so to do when i see my way clearly before me and when i know that i am not misled by any passion or any personal interest which in this case i am very sure i am not i find that disagreeable things are circulated among my constituents and i wish my sentiments which form my justification may be equally general with the circulation against me i have the honor to be with the greatest regard and esteem  gentlemen your most obedient and humble servant e b westminster may        i send the bills
