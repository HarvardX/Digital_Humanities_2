the alteration of the constitution of the house of commons and the inequality of the land tax considered conjointly  by j brand cl m a  london printed for j evans no    paternosterrow  mdccxciii  advertisement this tract is part of a general essay on the change of the representation of the people so much agitated of late the whole was designed at first not to have been extended beyond the limits of a short pamphlet but as i advanced i found that it would so much exceed those bounds that the publication must have been delayed until the chance of its utility if it would have possessed any would have been nearly lost i have therefore considered one great division of the subject only retaining so much of the general matter as may serve for an introduction to it and one purpose of this advertisement is to account for the appearance that this tract carries of being a detached part only of a subject of considerable extent  some abbreviations which are made use of in this work are here explained they are chiefly of the titles of books quoted  davenant  whitworths davenant edition       smith  dr adam smith on the wealth of nations edit  d  vo       chalmers  estimate of the

letters following any number denote the integer part thereof to be millions thus   ms is to be read   millions and      ms either decimally as   millions     thousandths or as an integer     000 this abbreviation has been adopted because in such great numbers the last three places of figures have not been calculated as being absolutely unimportant in the present subject  the alteration etc introduction a measure of such importance as an alteration of the constitution of the third estate certainly requires to be examined in every point of view before it be carried into execution it may be considered as to its general or local consequence the first as affecting the whole kingdom the second the larger district of it  it will affect the kingdom in general by producing a change in the present proportion of power in the executive and legislative departments of the state for its advocates hold out that it will diminish considerably that possessed by the crown and at the same time reduce that of the peers while the strength of the popular branch of the legislature is to receive some considerable increase it is not that i know of so much as pretended that the effective powers of the king and the house of lords are to be decreased in the same proportion it seems on the contrary that the greater cession is to be demanded of the crown hence the power of the upper house will become relatively greater compared with that of the sovereign and relatively much less compared with the increased power of the commons or a total change will take place in the present proportion of power of the three estates  the effect of this change upon the whole kingdom taken as a whole i do not intend at present to enter into but to examine its consequences to a particular district of great magnitude and importance the southern and eastern counties and solely with respect to the tax upon land  this part of the kingdom comprehends the counties of middlesex surry hertford bedford cambridge kent essex norfolk suffolk berks buckingham and oxford with respect to the metropolis these may be called the home district or counties and the remainder of england and wales the remote district or division  to the former of these districts i consider the present proposed alteration of the constitution of the lower house as a measure attended with great danger because as near as its termination is it is not very probable that the present century will elapse or at least be long elapsed before the amount of the land tax will be augmented and though the representatives of the landed property of the remote district have now a very considerable majority over those of the home counties in the lower house yet by the most sober plans of this alteration which i have seen it will in future be doubled now the burden of the tax on the latter is much greater than that on the former and thus all relief to this great existing disproportion will be rendered impossible the present assessment will be made the basis of the additions to the charges of this tax which must in future take place and the difference of the actual and proportional payment of the remote district already very great will receive a further augmentation now all consideration of the metropolis being constantly left out of the question the direct consequence of this must be that the superior celerity with which the remote district has been advancing in opulence during the course of the present century aided beside its natural advantages by the existing inequality of the land tax will become greater by a second artificial acceleration which will arise from this second defalcation of their payment to the public charge and the relative decline of the home district will be precipitated in the same degree  one consequence of this may be here laid down it directly follows from a supposition of its truth that if it should be granted that a change of constitution of the house of commons is otherwise expedient a supposition which though not attacked here is not to be taken as hereby admitted still it ought not to take place until its dangerous consequences be guarded against which are not only that of perpetuating an old system of the grossest inequality of the public burdens of the two divisions of the kingdom but also that of aggravating its oppressive disparity by new augmentations this must be guarded against previous to intrusting the remote counties with double their present majority of members in the house of commons until that be done a prudential justice a regard for a fair equality if these things have any existence more than in name demand the measure to be postponed and hence it follows not only that the present is not the proper season to effect this alteration but that such a period has not yet occurred since the revolution and that it is a happy circumstance that no attempt to carry it into execution has hitherto succeeded this is the legitimate consequence of the argument the summary of which is laid down above its several branches are now to be entered into particularly and separately  but it has often been urged by the inhabitants of the remote district that the expediency and justice of the continuation of the present assessment have been established upon good and solid reasons and they may be inclined to allege that this argument ought to be treated as a dilatory plea only against a necessary reform and that the bringing it forward at this juncture points out the propriety of carrying this great constitutional measure into immediate execution even for the quiet of the home division who when they see the absolute impossibility of succeeding in their unjust and impolitic pretensions will silently abandon them and the imaginary grievance the real discontent it has always fostered and all their chimerical expectations will sink into oblivion together as the general argument may thus be attempted to be answered this objection and the consequences drawn from it will be anticipated by treating the subject in the following order   st an account will be given of the cause of the inequality of this taxation   d the arguments in favor of its continuance will be all stated and such as do not find a more natural place under a following head will be here answered   d the circumstances will be laid down which tend to prove that the amount of the land tax must be increased   th the measure of the disproportion of the charge upon the two districts will be determined and its effect assigned   th the number of county members to be added to those of the home and remote divisions will be shown according to the plans of this change brought forward in      and    0 and thence the great addition of power which would be so acquired by the remote district in the lower house will be proved these discussions will necessarily lead to a variety of arithmetical operations the data on which they are founded the circumstances affecting their authority and the processes themselves will all be referred to the appendix the results only of these operations will be noticed in each section to preserve the history or train of reasoning in it clear and uninterruped by arithmetical operations which however necessary on the subject produce nearly the same effect mixed with arguments of the former kind as digressions to collateral or even to foreign matter davenant vol   p      what is to be said on each of these heads will be the subject of a separate section  section i on the cause of the inequality of the land tax the origin of the disproportion of the charge of the modern land tax upon the home and remote district is to be sound in a very early period of our history when the southwest counties were exposed to the descents of the french and the western and northern to the predatory incursions of the welsh and scotch these hostilities exposed them to frequent and considerable losses and they could contribute very little to the charge of the general defense after they had provided for their own hence it appears in the old accounts of the exchequer that the northern and western counties were always favored in their charge to the ancient subsidies and during the reign of mary the first the whole counties of northumberland cumberland westmoreland the towns of berwick and newcastle and the bishopric of durham were exempted from the payment of these grants on account of their vicinity to the scotch sinclair part   page       in the   th and   th of charles the first an assessment of l  00000 was levied upon land according to the proportion of the old subsidies davenant vol   p     during the civil war the excise had been the great resource of the parliament but when the royal party was subdued a land tax by monthly assessments was extended over the whole kingdom ibid p     the proportions of the old subsidies were adhered to as before ibid p     it has been generally said that by these assesments the heaviest charges fell upon such districts as had formed associations in defense of parliament and this has been supposed to be the origin of the inequality of the modern land tax but most counties in england having been at some time or other associated during the war and by ordinances of the lords and commons at westminster ibid p    this supposition must be given up  one cause of continuing the former proportions of this charge was that while the remote district had been much harrassed by the hostile armies of both parties the home counties better covered by the forces of the parliament had enjoyed a greater degree of security hence arose a necessity of some temporary indulgence to the former which was very commodiously but perhaps not very politically conferred upon them by continuing the old proportion of taxation ibid p    this mode of raising money by monthly assessments formed part of the constant revenue of the state until the restoration the remote counties however were indebted for this indulgence in some measure to the number and vigilance of the members they returned to the house as well as to the consideration of their past sufferings davenant vol   p      these assessments were the basis on which the payments of the several parts of the kingdom to the modern land tax were determined and to which they are exactly ibid p    proportioned this fact for which we have cotemporary testimony is in part the source of the popular error on this subject thus the disproportion of the assessments of the commonwealth was the proximate and that of the old subsidies the remote cause of the present inequality of the land tax  the plan of converting the monthly assessments upon land into a pound rate was first brought forward in that singular convention which received the name of praisegod barebones parliament they resolved that the supply for the maintenance of the army should be so raised but the assessment was broken up before that resolution received the form of an ordinance or law ludlows memoirs vol   p     vivay in switzerland school  that this new system either was then or afterward became popular is evident from its being carried into execution the first year after the revolution for new schemes for raising money which had not acquired an antecedent popularity would not at such a time have been embraced two supplies by a tax on land were granted in that year the first at one shilling and the second at two shillings in the pound their aggregate produce was l        and at four shillings in the pound the sum collected would have been l 0      the real produce of the tax at that rate in the year      was l        davenant vol   p      there appears therefore to have been a deficiency of l       in the latter payment which is thus accounted for to the first the inhabitants of the home district had assessed themselves more nearly to the true value of their estates they afterward  davenant vol   p     learned of their neighbors to favor themselves in the levying of this tax if any species of fraud admitted of defense it might be said that they did not sufficiently profit of the example they had before them  the assessment of      continues with very little change to be the standard of the present time though a certain part of this reduced amount has been rendered only nominal in a very singular manner by the subsequent extension of the tax to salaries and fees of office which was certainly intended to produce an augmentation of the revenue its effect has however been contrary for the entire salary is paid out of the exchequer molesworth sixth report of commissioners vol   p      and the tax on each officer goes in aid of the sum at which the place where he resides was before assessed a relief where probably it is not wanted thus this tax is in no case an increase of the income of the public and in some instances it actually diminishes it for when the salary is small the officer is repaid out of the receipts of his own department sinclair part the third p      thus the treasury pays part of the tax of all those places where officers with small salaries reside and the neat revenue of the state becomes actually diminished what the loss thus generated may amount to i am unable to assign the effective payment of every county will therefore be taken constantly to be the same as in the year       when this inequality originally took place several reasonings were made use of in defense of it but of unequal validity it was urged that the owners of land in the remote district could not pay an equal sum in the pound out of their rents because their returns and markets were not so quick and they tasted not that benefit of trade and greatness of london in the same degree as the home counties davenant vol   p    it may very well be granted that at the imposition of the land tax the production of a farm of  00 acres in the remote district sold for less money than that of another of an equal size in the home division in consequence of which the rent of the latter was greater then that of the former and therefore that an equal tax could not equitably be imposed upon equal quantities of land in each but it by no means follows that from equal rents equally well paid which is for the present to be supposed equal sums ought not to be contributed to the public charge whatever the local circumstances or the natural properties of the soil out of which they result may be for there is the same reason to admit a deduction upon account of one of these accidents inseparably attached to the estate as upon account of the other the landlord who derives an income of l 00 a year from a farm with a good soil situated near an inferior market is in the same circumstances with respect to his ability to pay taxes as another who receives the same rent from a farm containing the same number of acres whose soil is inferior but which is situated in the vicinity of a good market and if the latter were to plead for an abatement of a tax confessedly proportioned to his income because it was derived from a tract of sandy country we should smile at such a plea on such an occasion  but another argument was urged at the time of the imposition of the land tax in defense of the original disproportion of the charge upon the two districts which if the fact it rests upon be admitted proves beyond dispute that the remote district stood then in need of considerable relief in some shape or other and that fact is established upon the fullest evidence the landlords of the remote district alleged that they were not able to pay the same pound rate because their rents were not so well paid davenant vol   p    that is losses of rent were more common among them than in the home division davenant from whom this is extracted when writing in favor of the equalization of the tax gives this as part of the plea of the remote district and does not dispute the fact this tacit admission of it is a kind of historical evidence in its favor he also informs us that in the year      it was evident that money was scarce in the northern and western counties davenant vol   p    a circumstance which must have caused many delays and failures in the payment of rent and it will be seen presently that the relative depression of the landed interest in those parts of the kingdom had increased between that time and the revolution that failures in the payment of rent were then frequent in the western counties particularly and that the farmers were in great distress there seems apparent from the testimony of mr lock lock vol   p    considerations on interest this essay was written about the year      and published in      as appears from the letter prefixed to it in the latter year it received some enlargements the passage relates to one of the two years and in either case it is applicable to one of the two statements here given   but these accounts perhaps without more substantial support would not be sufficient at this time absolutely to confirm the fact on which the remote district then claimed the indulgence of the state and we might be inclined to detract something from their credit upon account of that degree of doubt with which such complaints ought in general to be received but it is proved from the price of estates in      that the rents were then very badly paid in the remote district and on the same evidence it is to be shown that from that year the security of payment to the landlord was relatively more and more declining until      as appears from the increasing ratio of disparity of the value of equal incomes and the increasing difference of the interest of money made by purchases in the two districts at each of those terms  in the year      the mean value of land in the home district was    years purchase between    and  0 years davenant v   p     or an estate of l      s a year was in value l 0000 and the interest of money made by such purchase was l      per cent  the mean value of land in the remote district was at the same time    years purchase ibid between    and    years and the price of an estate of equal rent l        s and the interest of the purchase money l      per cent  hence the proportion of the values of two estates of equal rents in the two districts was at that time as  0000 to      the difference of their selling prices   years purchase or l  0  and the difference of the interest of the purchasemoney l  0   per cent  nothing but a general and great insecurity in the payment of rents could have caused such important differences or raised the interest made by purchasing land above the legal rate on private securities for the rent of land is the most favorite species of income now to those who then bought estates with an intention to reside upon them if the rents had been equally well paid l    a year in the further district must have been of much greater real value than the same sum in the home division on account of the cheapness of markets the situation would likewise have been recommended by another circumstance the strength of the royal party laid here and if we consider their character as contradistinguished to that of their opponents those who were desirous of mixing with a country life the pleasures of the liveliest society it affords would certainly have thought this district at least as eligible as the other the fashion for men of fortune to throng to the capital was even then greatly increased though not nearly so prevalent as it now is and they had found the means of remitting their rents thither the receivers of the land tax in the remote counties formerly justified keeping large balances in their hands upon account of the difficulty of procuring remittances from london but at the same time the collectors of the excise found no difficulty in procuring bills and could have remitted more money by the same method the length of their term of payment varrying with the distance of the place molesworths reports of the commissioners v   p       this pretended difficulty is the occasion of the remark in the text the remote district had already made some considerable advances to rival the home division in its foreign commerce and paper credit before the revolution was very extensive as will be seen further on very little difficulty therefore could have existed on this head in this respect an income from one part of the kingdom was nearly as convenient as from another on the whole of these circumstances it appears that equal rents equally secure should at least at this period have been of equal value in the two divisions and that nothing but a great hazard of failure of payment could have been the cause of the difference stated above for there was at that time in the home district a greater plenty of money than securities davenant v   p     and if it had not been for this reason it would have found its way to the market where the best income was to be obtained for it that is where the interest by purchase of land exceeded the legal rate on private loans by per cent it was seen before that in the year      money was very scarce in the northern and western counties davenant vol   p     and here it is shown that in the remainder of the kingdom there was more than could be employed  at the revolution the average price of land in the home counties was    years purchase between    and    years ibid vol   p     and the interest of money so made l      per cent hence the value of an estate of l      s a year was l 0000 in the remote district the value of land was    years purchase between    and    years ibid the interest made by money so employed was l      per cent and the value of an estate of l      s was l  0     s this rapid rise   years purchase in    years was caused by a singular fall of the rate of interest which will be further noticed below  if the security of the payment of rent in the remote district had not decreased from      to      the value of an estate the price of which in the home counties was in the latter year l 0000 would in the remainder of the kingdom have continued to be l        s it had fallen to l  0     s therefore the increasing insecurity of the rents of that part of the country had diminished the value of landed perpetuities in the proportion of       to   0   or in that of  0000 to       the increase of the insecurity of the landed income in the rest of the kingdom may be exhibited in another point of view by assigning the proportion of its effect to sink the price of estates to that of the cotemporary fall of interest intimated above to raise them if the hazard of the payment of rent in both districts had been the same in the second town as in the first the increase of the years purchase in each would have been proportioned hence in the same time that the value of the land of the home counties increased from    to    years purchase in the remote counties it would have been augmented in like manner from    to  0       years purchase on the other hand if the insecurity of the payment of rent had increased in the same proportion as the rate of interest fell or the years purchase of the landed income rose whose degree of security was constant which is here taken as having been the fact in the home counties then the number of years purchase would have remained fixed or fifteen times the rent have been the value of land in the remote district in      and      again which is a third case if the hazard had increased but with less celerity than the rate of interest fell the value of land would have been somewhere between the two limits of    and    years purchase whose difference is six years now in effect this case obtained these lands had risen to be in value    years purchase exhibiting an increase of   years it has been proved that the undiminished effect of the fall of interest would have increased their value by   years purchase a part of its efficacy therefore and which would if it had operated unopposed have raised them   years purchase more was counterbalanced by some depressing cause which if acting alone would have sunk them by that amount and no adequate cause can be assigned except the increased hazard of the payment of rent hence if the total efficacy of the fall of interest to raise the value of land which took place in these    years be conceived to be divided into    equal parts the effect of   such parts will be found to have been annihilated by the increasing hazard of the payment of rent or the forces of these opposite causes to have been in that proportion and the value of the estate to have been increased by the   parts only which remained uncounterbalanced  the value of land in the remote district in the year      was only   years purchase below that of the rest of the kingdom the difference had increased to   years in the year      the difference of interest made by purchases which in the first term was l  0   l  per cent nearly had in the second become augmented to l   0  nearly   per cent the remote district was therefore relatively to the home district in a state of rapid decline at the time the land tax was imposed and the same is true even of the value of land though it exhibits a small absolute rise  it may not be here superfluous to explain by an instance the terms absolute rise and relative fall and how both may be understood to be applied to the same thing at the same point of time for this distinction is always material when the magnitudes which two or more subjects increasing with different degrees of celerity attain when compared at the beginning and end of a term of time therefore let there be supposed to be two bodies absolutely without weight whereof the first is projected upwards with two degrees of velocity to continue uniformly the same and let the second be in like manner projected at the same instant with one degree of celerity now all consideration of weight with respect to both being out of the question at the end of a certain time the second will be below the first by a given distance and at the end of double that time by double that distance here the second body at all times will have ascended absolutely yet its distance below the first will be always such as it would have been if the first had remained at rest and the second been projected in the opposite direction with one degree of uniform velocity as before therefore considered with respect to the place of the first it is said to have been at all times relatively falling  some account of the cause of the increasing insecurity of the payment of the rent of the remote district may be given upon the authority of mr lock he describes the artifices by which the purchasers of the product of the farmer had at the time of his writing his tract upon interest been able to impose their own prices upon him and compel him beside to allow them long terms of credit and the incapacity of paying their rents to which the farmers were thereby reduced and he concludes if any one doubt of this let him enquire how many farmers of the west are broke and run away since michaelmas last lock vol   p    from the whole of what he has said upon this subject it is evident that the same account is applicable though perhaps in a lower degree to the northern counties  hitherto we have considered only the argument in defense of the original disproportion of the land tax drawn from the declining circumstances of the remote district at the time of its imposition but the following state of the home division gave no inconsiderable addition to its weight and of this there is the strongest evidence in the singular fall of the rate of interest upon loans mentioned above by which the value of lands in the home counties was in    years raised   years purchase in considering this fall every thing which relates to the fluctuations of the rate in that term which were themselves very remarkable will be omitted some years before the time of mr lockes writing his essay on interest the scarcity of money made it in england really worth more than l  per cent ibid p   but so early as the year      such a decrease of the current interest had taken place that the east india company borrowed considerable sums of money at l  per cent houghton who has preserved this fact adds that although he had secured the interest of one of the officers of the house to obtain that rate for a friend he failed of success and that money was then currently lent at l    and   per cent houghtons husbandry and trade improved vol   p     at the time of the revolution according to davenant davenant vol   p     the greater part of the loans upon landed security were at the two former rates  this fall of interest is to be attributed among other very accelerating causes to the increase of our currency at that time by paper credit which has been erroneously supposed by some not to have existed or at least to have been in a very circumscribed state before the revolution the shutting up of the exchequer in the year      occasioned the failure of many bankers and by laying open their accounts show the extent which paper credit had then obtained the circulating notes of one of them on his single security exceeded l 000000 lock vol   p   but in      it was so much further increased that by its means our rents and taxes were paid and the bulk of trade here at home carried on almost without the species of money davenant vol   p     and davenant from whom this extract is taken further describes the state into which it fell during the war of the revolution approaching to that of a total annihilation and the first symptoms of its revival as such after the peace of riswyck  i have entered with some detail into this proof of the very flourishing situation of the home counties and of the relative and increasing decline of the remote division at the time of the imposition of the land tax because it is strongly connected to that inequality of the assessments which has been perpetuated to this day and it shows that they stood in need of some relief though the remainder of the kingdom has cause to regret that no other method was followed in affording assistance to them than that which has been eventually so unfortunate to themselves in the course of these researches two popular errors in the history of our national wealth appear likewise to be done away the one respecting the high rate of interest the other the extent of paper credit before the year       in these observations on the causes of the inequality of the land tax i have been obliged to go so far with this sketch of a comparative history of the state of the landed interests in the two districts that there is but little required to bring it to its ultimate period and therefore it shall be here given the distant counties seem to have recovered a total equality with the rest of the kingdom as early as the accession of george the second guthrie informs us that in the year      the value of the northern counties of the kingdom began to be better understood than formerly guthries geography ed      p      vo in the year      the price of the land of england had increased to    years purchase this is given by anderson a diligent collector of facts as the general value of the whole kingdom to    and    years purchase chalmers p     no distinction is here made of the prices of estates in the two districts and no traces of their disparity at any subsequent time have occured to me i therefore conclude that at this period a total equality had taken place between them the national average price of land in      had been    years purchase nearly it follows that this average had increased in the interval between the two lastmentioned years by   years purchase but that the value of land in the home counties having been    rents had fallen one while the remote district had risen in price from    to    or   years purchase  it remains only to account for this variation of the state of the two divisions the inequality of the land tax certainly much quickened the progress of the remote district first to attain a level with the home counties and afterward in many circumstances a superiority above them but before it was imposed there were some natural causes in operation which would have ultimately produced even the last of these effects although its period had not been accelerated by an artificial cause in constant action the oppression of the remainder of the kingdom with a double land tax so early as the      the home counties had begun to grub up their woods and dispark their parks davenant vol   p    and carried that practice to a great extent but the quantity of wood has been much more diminished since and they are become in a manner tributary to the remote district for fuel the coal trade though by no means arrived at its present magnitude was increasing with rapidity at the time the land tax was first raised insomuch that in the year      it was found that the quantity of coal consumed in london had been trebled of late years manufactures are attracted from one country to another by the cheapness of firing and accordingly it was then laid down as a fact that of late years likewise the north and west had acquired a greater proportion of trade than the home counties  section ii the arguments in favor of the inequality of the land tax stated and considered the advocates for the continuance of the present proportion of the charge of the two districts to the land tax argue thus its original establishment was necessary for if was founded on the difference of their abilities to contribute to the public expenses the historical evidence on which this rests admits of no dispute at present the national interest and the national justice both urge its continuance and the arguments for it derived from each of these topics are so cogent that they deserve to be separately stated  how strongly considerations of public interest and expedience recommend the continuance of the old valuation is thus made evident no material increase of the charge of the tax upon the remote counties can take place without a corresponding advance of rent which must be followed by a proportional increase of the price of the farmers products and as that district includes by much the largest part of the kingdom a general increase of its rent will produce ultimately a general advance of the prices of the first necessaries of life  but the effect of such an innovation will not terminate here the claim upon which it is to be introduced rests upon this principle that the taxes upon rent ought always to vary with its amount and be proportioned thereto hence every increase of rent in every district must constantly be accompanied with a proportional advance of the payment of the land to the state a maxim of taxation which whatever specious pretenses may be set up in its favor has always produced the worst effects in those counties where it has been carried into practice in some of them it has received the name of the taille and wherever it has been adopted the spirit of improvement in agriculture has not only been extinguished but in many instances the art itself has gone backward thus the equalization of the tax will prevent the increase of product which might otherwise counterbalance its effect upon prices  but the measure of the evils which will result from the subversion of the old system appears only of its proper magnitude in its secondary consequences or when those primary effects of it already pointed out come to operate in conjunction by preventing the increase of productions physically necessary to the subsistence of mankind it puts a stop to the increase of population and by its tendency to raise their prices it perpetually takes something more and more away from the comfort and happiness of the lower closs of people which their numerous privations brought on by the charges of the state have already too much diminished the greatest object of a moral policy and nature and virtue admit of no other is to augment the number of a nation and to increase their comforts in the utmost practicable degree now the effects of this novelty are directly repugnant to these great ends and we cannot forbear adding how even that empty and delusive but perhaps ostensible pretense to justice on which it rests as a foundation has been lately in some degree done away every one must be convinced that the housetax is a land tax disguised under another name by its imposition this charge upon the remote district has been effectively increased since the first valuation and at the same time brought nearer to that proportionality incessantly demanded with so much clamor and so little reason  these are the arguments to the consideration of which the remainder of this section will be confined but there is another constantly produced on this subject upon which the greatest stress is often affected to be laid that all purchasers of estates in the remote district for a long series of years have paid an increased price for them in confidence that the present proportion of assessments should be continued to all future periods and that it would he injustice to take from them what they have paid a valuable consideration for this argument will be more fully stated in the fourth section and an answer to it given no further notice will therefore be taken of it here the consideration of those which precede it is now to be entered upon  they set out with a tacit defense of the continuance of the inequality from a necessity which arose from the peculiar circumstances of the home district at the juncture when it was suffered to take place that they stood then in need of some relief is not to be disputed and possibly the justice of that claim has been fortified with a new proof in the preceding section admitting it therefore in its full extent it does not follow that such relief ought originally to have been extended to them in a mode contrary to the first principles of taxation nor even that point being gratuitously given up that the relief ought to have been prolonged beyond the necessity on which it was founded now all traces of the preexisting depression of the remote district had been obliterated so early as the year      and the necessity and the inequality ought to have terminated together  the second plea urged is that as the equalization of the tax will increase its charge throughout the greater part of the kingdom it must effectively increase the national rent itself and consequently the prices of the first necessaries of life  in answer to this i shall endeavor to show that it will neither effect rent nor prices that it will not effect rent of land follows first from the nature of the subject itself which is clearly laid down by dr adam smith in his work on the wealth of nations smith v   p     he informs us that rent is always the largest part of the value of the product of land that can be taken from the farmer allowing him the ordinary profits of stock after defraying his expenses now this being admitted in the latitude in which he has put it that is as a general principle the rent must be already arrived at this height in the remote counties no further rise therefore can take place merely in consequence of the increase of the landlords outgoing charges for it will not create an ability in the tenant to pay him a greater sum that ability being no more affected by the increase of the landlords payment to the public than by an equal diminution of his income by any other means as by the alienation of part of his estate equal in rent to the addititious part of the tax in consequence of his former extravagance in either case his wishes and efforts to enjoy the same neat income as before will be equal and the influence of his endeavors with his tenant to raise his rent because his income is reduced will be equally efficacious it is only an increase of the farmers product or of the prices of that product or both conjointly which can raise the rent of any district when that rent and the value of the product are once adjusted to each other the increase of the latter must always precede that of the former as the cause must always precede its effect  but let it now be supposed contrary to what has been shown to follow from the nature of the subject that the rents of the remote district will be raised and that the farmers will attempt to raise their prices to reimburse themselves there will be nothing in this advance immediately to effect the rents or prices of the home district now the two divisions of the kingdom have many common markets foreign countries the metropolis and all those markets in the interior parts of the kingdom situated on their common boundary line and some miles within it on each side the farmers of the remote district carry their products now to all those markets as equal competitors to those on the other side of the boundary but if they raise their prices they will be no longer able to support that competition or at least their vent will be greatly diminished in either case they will be forced to keep a greater quantity of their commodities at home than formerly and their home demand not being increased the prices of their home market instead of being supported at the new rate must fall below that which took place before now an increase of rents can never subsist with more circumscribed markets and with declining prices hence no advance can be put upon their rents which shall disable them to go into the markets common to the two districts at the same prices as their competitors the interest of the landlords themselves must prevent it or in other words they cannot raise their prices above the rate which would have taken place if there had been no advance of rent  but beside the gratuitous admission of the possibility of the rent being increased in the remote district in consequence of the equalization of the tax let it lastly be conceded that the farmers will not be prevented from raising their prices by the competition of those of the home division and let us enquire what increase of the rate of their markets may now be expected to take place  to equalize the tax upon the two districts the remote counties must have their rate increased one shilling and d in the pound rent or l    0  per cent app art     on such an advance taking place when an estate is to be let it follows from what is conceded that the treaty or as it is called by those who have written on prices and commodities the alteration will run thus the landlord will say the decrease of my income by the new tax is one shilling and d in the pound and you must increase the rent in the same proportion to this the tenant will reply the markets are not advanced nor will the land become more productive by virtue of the increase of the tax the amount of my disbursements the annual interest of my capital the value of my labor and of my superintendance will continue undiminished and i must make the same profit for the immediate subsistence and the future provision for myself and my family as before i therefore cannot consent to any advance demanded upon that account we have seen before the nullity of the landlords pretensions and the validity of the reasons against them urged by the tenant but let it be admitted now that what is alleged on either side has equal force hence the alteration will terminate by the landlords receding from half his additional demand and the tenant submiting to pay the additional tax or to increase the rent  d in the pound that is l    l    0 per cent app art     let the effect of this on the general price of provisions be now enquired after  it will be admitted without hesitation that the price of the farmers yearly product if any variation be made in it will after this advance of rent continue to bear the same proportion to his total annual disbursements that was found to take place in the year      these disbursements are divisible into two classes the first increasing immediately by the increase of his rent operating alone and the second comprehending wages the wages of labor seedcorn and some other particulars by the effect of an increase of prices of necessaries already established and following upon such increase either immediately or at the end of a term more or less remote an increase of disbursements of the latter kind cannot impress a beginning of movement upon the market or produce an initial rise of prices because an effect cannot generate its cause but if the farmers outgoing expenses of this second class be increased in consequence of a preceding rise of markets occasioned by an advance of rent this may lay him under a necessity of making a urther augmentation of his prices or generate a second addition to their rates but this secondary addition cannot take place until the first in order the cause on which its existence depends is established in the market the point to be proved therefore is that such initial advance cannot take place  the expenses of the first class whose increase is or may very probably be immediately consequent upon the increase of rent are the parish charges and the tithe now let the former rent of the tenant have been l   00 app art     according to the average proportion found to obtain throughout the kingdom the sum of this rent and those two charges would have been l      app art     and that sum will be now increased in the same proportion the rent is increased that is l    app art     percent as above or by l0    app art     and all the farmers annual disbursements including the maintenance of his family which before amounted according to the same average to l 0    will now be augmented to l 0 0  and the selling value of his total product must be increased in the same proportion that value had before amounted to l      and it must now become l      that is it will be augmented   s and   d per cent the effect of this may be shown on the price of wheat the article of his product the most necessary to general subsistence wheat at this time is about   s the quarter its price with this augmentation upon it will be l    s   d   0 app art       if all the farmers in the remote district were tenants at will according to the supposition on which we are now tacitly reasoning each of them would have his rent increased in the first year of the increase of the tax according to the proportion here given and the assigned advance might justly indeed be made general through the whole district it seems however too minute to produce any effect in the market as the loss to the farmer would be the increase of the expense of production only equal to about one third of the increase of the price above stated and therefore less than two pence the quarter of wheat  but it is only a part of the whole body of farmers whose terms will expire and whose rents can be thus raised in that first or any succeeding year a circumstance which must be taken into the account and therefore it is to be observed that lands are let for different terms although there are some farmers who are tenants at will by much the greater part of the land is under lease or article for a term certain as for    0       or even    years let it be supposed that the term of all the contracts for the remote counties is on an average seven years upon the equality of chance the term of one farmer of seven will expire in any assigned year now the farmer whose rent is raised at the michaelmas immediately following the augmentating of the tax is justly entitled to sell his commodities at the advanced rate stated above but the remaining six farmers of every set of seven will be as well able to sell at the old prices as before let us now take as an instance one of these sets supposing the rents of all the farmers equal and seek what effect the advance of the prices of the single individual will have in market now it is evident it will be the same as if we suppose the rent of the single man above mentioned is seven times its former amount but that it is raised only the same sum as before now the quantity of his product being in the proportion of seven to one he will be completely reimbursed by one seventh of the former rate of his advance on his prices that is by    of a penny on the quarter of wheat or   s   d per cent on the selling price of all his commodities  this is the rate of advance averaged upon the whole district which will reimburse the general body of the farmers at the old rate of profit for the additional charge the advance of rent in the first year will bring upon them and it is too minute for them to take any measures in that year to obtain it if even the advance of rent had at this time fallen at once on the whole body there is little probability that it would have disturbed the rates of the markets and that increase of charge falling on one seventh of their whole number only in the first year of the augmentation of the tax its effect is so far insensible that it seems to leave no tendency to an advance of prices behind it things once fixed completely resist a smaller degree of force tending to a change they in some measure resemble heavy bodies at rest which require a power of a certain magnitude to be applied to them which must exceed what is sufficient to counterbalance friction or a kind of adhesion to their situation before they can be put into motion if the increase of the rent had taken place all at once it would most probably have passed off without any effect on the market prices but its whole power upon them will be divided into seven parts each taking place at distant intervals and in this case we may fairly recur to the former illustration and say if we admit that a certain force when applied to a body all at once may be capable of overcoming this resistance of cohesion and to produce a small but almost imperceptible movement in it yet if this moving power be divided into many parts and each applied in succession the effect of each will be successively lost before the application of the next and no movement ultimately produced  the next objection in order is that if the tax be from time to time augmented it will degenerate into that specious of imposition upon land which is called abroad the taille which has in every country where it has been adopted been found to obstruct all increase of the quantity of land brought into cultivation and those improvements which augment the product of land already cultivated thus by preventing the multiplication of the necessaries of life it deprives the lower class of people of a liberal support and even by a diminution of its numbers makes a waste of human life  in opposition to this it must be proved that every plan for augmenting the land tax does not terminate in such a system and to do this it is necessary to lay down the following preliminary division of the subject the effect of the rise of the tax may be different as it takes place after improvement of the annual value of land either immediately or at the end of some definitive term of time it may also differ when land is to be improved by the capital of the tenant or that of the landlord the combination of these circumstances affords four distinct cases for our consideration  let us first examine the two cases where the rise of the tax immediately accompanies the advance of the improving value of the land not entering at present into any consideration of the means of carrying such a measure into execution the greater part of the improvements of the value of land is effected at the expense of the tenant this therefore is the case first considered in order to be induced to undertake it he must have a lease at a fixed rent for a considerable term of years but here the landlord may have frequently a temporary interest against such improvements and consequently against granting all such leases of the same duration as the term of the contract and of no small magnitude this will be a great check upon long and improving leases for while the value of the estate is increasing the tax will be perpetually increasing and the landlords gross rent remaining fixed during the whole term his neat income will be perpetually decreasing we know how a small present interest can counterbalance a great advantage if remote but the immediate interest here treated of is not a small one when the improvements of the tenant are spirited and judicious and he has a long term before him the only thing which can call forth such vigorous and beneficial exertions from him the annual value of the land may come to be doubled or more than doubled during its subsistence and the tax increasing with that value cause a very sensible diminution of the landlords neat income and sometimes he may even find himself in considerable embarrassments throughout the whole remainder of the term after these improvements shall have become fully effective and it is the interest of the tenant to make them so as soon as possible in this case the landlord will not always find the present uneasiness of his situation counterbalanced by the reflection that he or perhaps his heirs will at a remote period reap a great advantage by an advance of rent if the increase of the tax should therefore follow directly upon the increase of the annual value of land such leases it may be presumed would be less frequently granted  when the landlord is at the expense of the improvement he is not exposed to the hazard of these inconveniences at his contract for a lease for any term of years he will obtain an increase of rent in proportion to the speculated value of his improvements this will consist of the annual interest of the capital he advances an annual profit upon it of the nature of a commercial profit and the amount of the expected increase of the tax these points he must have a reasonable prospect to secure or he must act without a motive or on the abstract consideration of public good only but in this case the landlord would certainly be less disposed to improve when the sovereign who contributes nothing to the expense was to share in the profit of the improvement hence the progress of cultivation as far as it depends upon the capital of the landowner might receive some little check but by no means so considerable as that pointed in the first case  but admitting that augmenting tax immediately upon every increase of the annual value of land may be attended with some consequences that are ineligible and some difficulties in execution it does not thence follow that a territorial valuation once established should remain invariable to the end of time especially if in its origin it was oppressive and unequal or according to what has been laid down by some on this head that such valuations should not be revised above once in a century at most although it is to be cursorily observed here that even admiting the last principle a century is so nearly elapsed since the establishment of the tax that the home district may now rest its claim to equalization upon it  it remains now to consider whether if the increase of the land tax should follow that of the rent at any assignable term or distance of time it would produce the bad effects inseparably attached to that levy called a taille this inquiry likewise involves two cases but before they be separately gone into the supposition on which they both of them depend that such an increase of the land tax is practicable must be examined the proof that a measure is practicable ought certainly to precede the consideration of its expedience  if ever there should be an attempt made to introduce a permanent correspondence between the tax and the value of the land the opposition to it will endeavor to make a vigorous stand upon this point and such erroneous opinions have by some anticipation been inculcated respecting it that many of those most essentially interested in its defense have sometimes seemed disposed to give it up i shall therefore begin this examination with a maxim drawn from the code of political morality if men would but dedicate half that exercise of the understanding to reduce what is just to a practicable form which they apply to support institutions which rest upon no proper basis of principle employing all the indirect policy and perplexed patchwork of expedients to make them rub on without any violent shock or obstruction they would generally find their work neither difficult nor its event doubtful what is just has in its own nature a strong tendency to become practicable and almost to find the way to become effective itself it wants but few helps and previous arrangements and those a very moderate degree of circumspection will easily suggest temper it only with so much indulgence to the personal interests which seem attacked by it as you well can without defeating its end and that power is seldom greatly circumscribed and you must succeed the narrow and awkward ground which you force those who oppose you to take and the shame of making a persevering and decided stand upon it half disarms them to your hands  that adjustments of the advance of the tax to the advance of the rent may be reduced into practice has been fully shown by dr adam smith smith v   p    and how the latter may be always discovered but to anticipate all objections to the gradual increase of the tax the rent of the last past lease or contract might be made the value taxed in every year not the present existing rent which seems so far to diminish the temptation and facility of fraud as almost to annihilate it by this mode many objections to the registers of leases for the purpose of determining rates and charges upon land are anticipated it diminishes the temptations of falsification incident to some other plans two men may combine together to make a false entry where a true one would be followed with an immediate increase of some annual payment to be made by either or both but if the increase of charge be remote as for instance if it be not to take place until the end of a lease now entered upon the temptation to a fraudulent entry will be almost annihilated where a present or almost immediate sacrifice of property is called for a fraud may be committed but if it be not actually to be made in less than seven or perhaps ten years after the account is given in men will readily consent to it they will seldom venture upon a piece of knavery when they know it must be so long before they can expect to reap the beneficial effects of it beside the interval between the registry and the commencement of the next contract when the increase of the tax is to take place must be long and the chances of the discovery of the fraud multiplied in proportion if the parish rates were to follow the valuation of the land tax thus adjusted it would take off a similar discouragement to improvements in agriculture that of being followed up immediately with an increase of charges of another kind and no fraud would thus probably find its way either into the rates or into the register for such a fraud would not diminish the charges of the person committing it and it would expose him to great resentment from his neighbors as sacrificing their future interest without any advantage to himself besides every contributor in a parish would for his own sake be a vigilant guard over all the rest the probable number of frauds woule be greatly diminished and the chances of the discovery of each greatly increased and the parish rates would either keep errors out of the public register or afford several valuable corrections to it this mode of increasing the tax has likewise another good property dr a smith v   p     has observed that every tax ought to be levied at the time and in the manner that is most convenient for the contributors to pay it now this maxim which primarily refers the original imposition of a tax holds likewise of all its subsequent augmentations for according to this arrangement the tax will always come to be increased at a time when the landlord has enjoyed the augmentation of the rent on which the addition is to be assessed without deduction for the complete term of one lease and at a time likewise when he has probably secured a second augmentation of rent by a second contract for as the average value of land is constantly increasing an increase of rent will be mostly obtained at every new letting in what manner a similar and equivalent indulgence is to be extended to those who occupy their own lands has been explained by the same writer smith v   p       it appears that under these modifications the tax may be made to increase with the ability of the contributors without great difficulty the inquiry is now to be resumed whether being constantly so augmented it will nor be followed with the bad effects of a taille and here let it be first supposed as before that the improvement is to be made by the tenant and that it is a great and spirited operation requiring the advance of a large capital for if it be found that the gradual advance of the tax as described above will be no obstruction to a greater improvement it cannot be requisite to show in particular that it will be no impediment to others upon a less extensive scale the general circumstances of such undertakings as far as they affect the question are these the land is to be taken as having been let before at a moderate rent according to its former condition its advance to the incoming tenant will be either nothing or very small on account of the great expense he must incur in the proposed improvements he will also take are to secure himself a sufficient term to pay him the insurance of his hazard and to enable him to reap the profit of his spirited industry now during this term which must be considerable if any small advance of the rent had been acceded to by him in the beginning of it the tax will be assessed to its former not its present amount according to the leading principle of its augmentation described above at the end of the term there will be a second contract when the estate will be let to the full of its improved value or nearly so and during its subsistence the tax will become increased in proportion to the augmentation of the rent by the first lease only which advance it was shown could not be very considerable and at this rate the valuation will remain fixed during the whole of the second term and ultimately at the end thereof or at the beginning of the third lease the tax will be raised to correspond to the second rent or the improved value of the land  let us now search what there is in these circumstances to hinder an improvement which would take place if the tax were fixed if contrary to the plan here traced out the great augmentation of the tax were to take place immediately with that of the rent at the expiration of the improving lease the farmer would not have been originally deterred from accepting it by the consideration that an addition would be made to his landlords outgoing charges at the instant his present connection with him was to terminate he will know that at the end of the lease if he think so long beforehand of treating again for the farm that the landlord will get as much for the improved value of it as he will be able to pay or nearly so and that he can get no more and as that future addition to his rent must depend upon other circumstances he will not at all consider how one eighth or one tenth of it will be drawn out of his landlords strong box at the end of fourteen or twentyone years to come  yet it is here admitted that the great improvement of the value will be taxed immediately at the termination of the first letting whereas according to the mode supposed to be followed that material augmentation of the tax corresponding to it will not take place until the end of the second lease the increase at the end of the first being proportioned to the first augmentation of the rent which must have been either small or nothing on account of the expense of the farmer at his first improvement the augmentation of the tax corresponding to that improvement will only commence with the third lease now no man will carry his speculations to a futurity so remote as previous to entering on a contract for a farm susceptible of such improvement to consider on what terms he could obtain a third lease or what his landlords assessment to the taxes would be increased to at the end of that length of time to which the second will extend as to the small advance to be made at the beginning of the second term if any it has been already seen that a much greater would then produce no effect  it remains to be examined how far the increase of the tax thus modified will be a check upon the spirit of improvement in the landlords and let it be supposed here that the augmentation of the tax will ultimately be an eighth or a tenth of the increase of the annual value of the land in fact the average effective tax of the kingdom does not exceed a fifteenth of the rent when its nominal rate is four shillings in the pound when the tenant improves his land upon a long lease he knows he shall at the end of the term be obliged to pay an advance of rent equal to that of the value of the land or very nearly so yet this does not now hinder him from making such improvements at his own expense when it is done by the landlord he obtains immediately an increase of rent in consequence of it equal to the value of the improvement and the tax will take from him but an eighth or tenth of the augmentation of that annual value at the end of the same term at which the whole would be taken by the rise of rent from the improving farmer hence if giving up the whole of the augmented value at the expiration of the lease do not hinder the farmers improvement one eighth or one tenth being taken from the addition to the landlords rent at the same term will produce no effect  it has been urged by one writer that the housetax is in its nature a land tax and consequently having been laid upon the remote district long after the imposition of the former its original degree of inequality no longer subsists he might have proceeded to confirm his acute conclusion with the mathematical axiom  that if to unequal magnitudes equal magnitudes be added the quantities so increased will approach nearer to the ratio of equality than the two first i will not expose to posthumous censures the wellearned reputation of a man eminent in his own laborious branch of science in which he rendered to the public the greatest services by quoting him by name or referring to the books from which such an imbecility is copied the answer is contained in a few words the housetax is general and at the same rate throughout the whole kingdom including the home district and therefore the payment of it does not exempt any other district from paying its equitable proportion to any other tax  section iii on the probability that the amount of the land tax must be increased at a very near period the foundation on which the result of all inquiry into the probability of the future increase of the charge of the land tax ought to rest must be found in its general nature and the existing circumstances of the state in the consideration of the nature of a land tax some principles will be laid down tending to show that it is caeteris paribus to be preferred perhaps to all others the natural limitation of those principles will also be afterward added though not necessary to the points to be proved for general principles which differ from universals by being limited by an internal necessity or external circumstances are frequently set up as such or abusively confounded with them but they ought never to be brought forward without duly specifying the point at which they cease to be applicable unless it is well known or selfevident  taxes are established as well for the purpose of political regulation as effective revenue such as at once answer both these ends are the best now a land tax is an effective and sumptuary tax and unequalled in the degree in which it possesses these two properties for no plan for collecting a revenue from the great incomes derived from monied capitals or the annual fund of expenditure of the more opulent traders has been hitherto carried into execution with success  it is observed by a political writer of the first estimation that as productive capital is the source of industry so revenue is the source of idleness smiths wealth of nations v   p    the glitter the magnificence and sometimes the dissipation of the opulent proprietor of land becomes the example of those who derive great incomes from other sources and they seem to undergo something like the reverse of improvement in the transplanting the greatest number of these copyists like those who propose splendid but faulty originals as models exhibit their faults at secondhand something increased and the effects of the other parts not a little diminished if the luxuries of this class could be reached by a tax the moral benefits to society would be great and perhaps no permanently useful institution of policy ever existed which did not draw that consequence after it but to drop the consideration of what seems but perhaps only seems unattainable we may observe that drawing an effective revenue from land attacks this progress of luxury at its very source and greatly retards though it cannot totally counteract it there is a consequence of this which deserves attention  in the natural history of human society we find that when it has once attained to a state of manly elegance it passes on next to refinement and ultimately to a vitiated and effeminate voluptuousness whatever is noble and excellent must decline in each step of this fatal progress and even whatever tends to accelerate the transactions of society from the first to the second of these states must be numbered among the greatest evils whatever retards it among the greatest benefits to mankind it is like a medicine which would prolong the continuance of youth and manhood and suspend the approach of the imbecility and miseries of old age and i add that a sober philosophy may prepare such a tincture for society though not for the individual though there is nothing more deleterious than the preparations which pretend to these properties which are to be found in the laboratories of some great modern chemists  the luxuries of a wealthy society are the cause of this progress it is always the object of that of today to pass the bounds of that of yesterday and whatever checks it in its course at least retards the celerity with which society is gliding down this descent and lengthens out the existence of its arts its manners and its morals  the tendency of a tax on land to produce this beneficial effect is evident by absorbing a just part of the income of the proprietor it diminishes the strength of the primary cause of these successive degeneracies in the state of society it is to be observed on the other hand that whatever makes his capacity of expense increase with greater celerity than his rent will anticipitate the terms of those changes and consequently be pernicious the circumstance here taken as a supposition only will be afterward found to exist  there are further considerations which show the rent of land to be a more proper subject of taxation than most others and one is that to make a due proportion of the public charges fall upon it leaves the quantity of comfort and enjoyment remaining to society after such a tax the greatest possible as no way has been discovered to come at the great monied incomes which therefore are not here to be considered for the deduction of the same proportional part from the incomes of any two men are here supposed equally to diminish their capacity of acquiring the customary comforts of their situation a tax exclusively falling upon land affects only a class of men which is upon the average extremely opulent but in case the same money were levied by a general tax the lower orders of the people would have been obliged to pay their share to it and their comfort would have been diminished in the proportion which the annual sum so taken from them bears to their annual income but as it is now paid by the opulent proprietors of land their enjoyments will be diminished only in the proportion the same sum bears to their great annual income that is indefinitely less or the comfort enjoyed by the whole society considered as an aggregate remain much greater it is evident likewise that it tends to render the enjoyments of the separate classes of society more equal  a tax on land tends also to render the inequalities of rank and fortune less glaringly offensive to those whom civil society by the operation of its very nature has subjected to numerous and afflicting privations of the enjoyments of life for if we suppose the present land tax taken off a greater and more parading display of the disparity of the circumstances and ranks of the classes of civil society would take place and the irksome sense of it in the inferior orders must be aggravated in proportion a sense which enters perhaps for no inconsiderable part of the calamities of that class whose feelings of their own state will always be numbered among the objects most worthy of respect by a wise and benevolent legislature  but it may be made evident that the landlords cannot be charged with more than a certain part of the public burdens by a tax on their estates without the injury extending beyond themselves and affecting the interests of society they contribute to the general taxes to many they pay as much and to many more than their relative proportion there are some likewise to which their contributions for certain causes are less but upon the balance their other taxes will be found to be at least in proportion to their total incomes and the land tax to be purely an additional charge exceeding that proportion i thought i had been alone in this opinion but find myself preceded in it by sir nathaniel gould and baron maseres  and such payments neither can or ought to be carried beyond a certain extent  for the ability of paying these addititious charges must be confined to that class of the landed men whose circumstances are so easy that they can commodiously subsist upon their incomes and let it be admitted that this may be extended so low as to take in that order of men which mr king in arranging the nation into classes denominated freeholders of the better sort whose income from land at this time upon an average may somewhat exceed l  0 a year and which was valued by him in      at l   and let it be admitted that the incomes of the different classes of society bear the same proportion now each to each and to the whole which he found to take place in      if this amount be divided into a thousand equal parts the income of the more opulent landlords is     app art      of the laboring people  0  app art      and of the remainder of the society including the mercantile and monied interests     app art     such parts the income of the lower class as exhibited here falls short of rather than exceeds its present proportion according to some accounts which have fallen into my hands it is nearly in the proportion shown above or     thousandth parts of the whole which they pay by the general taxes that denomination is here given to the remainder of our taxes which are payable by the people in general including the proportion of land and not by the latter exclusively  now the total amount of the general taxes is l      ms app art      and the part thereof paid by the great landed proprietors proportioned to their income is l     ms app art     moreover the total land tax being l     ms its proportional charge on this class is l     ms ibid   and their total payment to all taxes l     ms ibid   exceeding their proportional charge in the ratio of     0 to  0000 ibid     this excess is greater in the home district less in the remote than the average here assigned and if the land tax were equalized the whole class of the landowners would contribute to the expense of the state in the same proportion as those of the home district pay at present the sum of the taxes on the income of land would become five shillings and fivepence in the pound and on all other incomes on an average three shillings and threepence and one third section iv table or the former would be to the latter as five to three  but by carrying this system too far the opulence of this class will become more reduced than is consistent with the general interest of society when every man is taxed according to his income the proportional power of every class which depends very much on the existing division of property remains unaltered now the inequality of its present division is natural as far as human society of which it is the necessary consequence is natural hence that proportion of power in the different classes is natural and a diminution of that of the upperclass of too great magnitude places society in an unnatural situation and draws a long train of calamities after it for hereby the spirit of subordination is undermined and almost annihilated and its place must be supplied by something else to preserve public order as before as much restraint as is thus taken off from the individual must be added again by the coercion of new and stricter laws the increase of which is always inimical to personal liberty at least the rigours of the municipal laws in republics and some illconstructed mixed governments furnish us with striking examples of this it has arisen from their being obliged to diminish the natural influence of ranks by artificial restraints as being inimical to the principle on which they are founded  but it is not hereby meant to be maintained that the opulent landholders ought not to pay any addititious tax and particularly that the amount of the tax cannot be now increased until it bears the same proportion to their rent which took place in the beginning of this century actual experience having proved the contrary or that the landlords of one part of the kingdom cannot bear the same proportional charge as those of the other  these reasonings showing that the tax may justly be increased are nearly of the same force to prove that it will unless an inability of the contributors can be admitted or that the state will not for a considerable period to come want such an augmentation of revenue for whoever has considered the progress of taxation in this century and a great part of the last will admit that to prove the one is nearly to prove the other but leaving these general topics more particular considerations are now to be brought forward in support of this position  since the year   00 the taxes paid by the other classes of society have increased in burden though not in the same degree as in charge because their annual income in the same period have greatly increased for if their income had remained fixed during this term and the taxes paid by them been trebled their burdens would have been trebled but if this income be conceived in the same time to have become doubled at the end of it every equal charge would have been borne with twice the facility and their burdens instead of increasing in the proportion of three to one would have been augmented only in that of three to two or become only half as much again this illustrates though it does not give an accurate measure of the increase of the burden of all taxes exclusive of that on land on all the contributors during the present century  on the other hand if the taxes had remained fixed and the income of the contributors had been doubled their burdens would have been reduced one half  it is in this mode though not in the same degree that the advances of rent has been perpetually diminishing the burden of the land tax the average increase of actual rent has been nearly threefourths per cent annually from the year   00 the first term for which an average land tax for peace and war or its periodical average can be assigned to the year      or more accurately every pound rent had in that term been increased to l      app art      and if the tax had increased in the same proportion its burden would have perpetually remained fixed now in the year   00 the periodical average of the tax that of the city of london being excluded was l     ms app art     and thus augmented it would have become l    ms ibid   its amount at  s in the pound the nominal rate of the preceding peace is l     ms ibid  0 therefore if an addition of l   000 ibid  0 were now made to the tax it would only bring the burden of the contributors back to an equality with that of the year   00 and here it is to be observed that this addition is far less than the present defalcation of the remote district see section     but as the burdens of the other classes of society have continued increasing and that with a very considerable degree of celerity they have a right to demand from the proprietors of land that by their particular tax they would again contribute to the increased public expense at least in the old proportion to their incomes and that some remedy should at length though late be applied to a system of taxation by which while the proportion of their own burden to the expense of the state is perpetually increased that of the land tax of the opulent country gentry is perpetually diminishing and they will add that the experience of the beginning of the century pointed our that the land could very well bear the burden then laid upon it justice and policy redemand it and there seems a considerable probability that the demand must be attended to  for an additional argument for it of great weight is to be drawn from the progress of the debt and the necessity of putting a stop to it this will be fully laid open in the proof of the following proposition that the equalization of the land tax will be very nearly an adequate remedy to this evil and put it absolutely in our reach with a small additional exertion to demonstrate which it becomes necessary to determine the amount of a sinking fund which will effect this great purpose  our present efforts to put a stop to the increase of the debt although very inadequate greatly exceed whatever were made at any former term and form no weak presumptive proof that we may expect from the spirit of the times and it may be justly added of the administration that when it is seen with what facility this first step to security can be obtained it will not be neglected  we are now to proceed to the investigation above mentioned omitting fractions it may be taken that the average length of a term of war is eight and of peace ten years app art      nor ought it to be assumed that in future the duration of peace will exceed that of war in a greater proportion in subjects of such consequence to a state it is best to err on the safest side and we are to give way to no delusive imaginations that the future course of things will be better than what we have experienced in the last  00 years for it is so far back that these averages extend the present semichaotic state of europe will not permit us to indulge in such agreeable but visionary expectations and in a few months we have seen a new and great republic rise the vices of whose internal constitution are such that foreign wars will become necessary to it to obtain some respite from internal commotion this is very clearly illustrated by the consequences which always attended the heterogeneous and discordant constitution of the republic of the romans a much more moral people a state of hostilities almost continual was the only remedy to the discord of peace it was by foreign wars only that they enjoyed at any time the delusive appearance of a hollow truce at home with no principle of union within the state fell to pieces when there was no external force to compress its repulsive parts together it fell for want of an enemy and the tyranny of a despot succeeded the alternate tyrannies of the great and the mob the new republic has the same disorders but in a more malignant degree and it possesses only the same terrible means to patch up the blotches and ulcers which its radically vitiated constitution will be perpetually producing and reproducing  these considerations will not give us leave especially at present to think the chances of the duration of peace to be increased or tending to increase eighteen years is therefore here assigned as the length of a period of one war and one peace taken together as the distance from any assigned year of peace to the same year in the next peace and let it be supposed that a term of peace now existing will continue five years it will be followed by a war of eight years of which the extraordinary expense will be taken at eighty millions the five first years of the following peace will complete the period and if the debt at the beginning and end of that period be equal or the capital paid off in the two halves of the terms of peace be equal to the new capital generated by the intermediate war the progress of the debt will be completely stopped and no more  the fund applicable to the discharge of the debt which will effect this purpose may be called the adequate fund to distinguish it from such as suffer the debt to continue to increase and also those whose product is so great as to afford a remission of taxes under certain regulations  if an adequate fund were to be this applied to the restraining the progress of the debt directly at the commencement of a term of peace taken to continue ten years or another immediately at the commencement of a war whose duration would be eight years it is evident their amounts must differ the fund which would be necessary in the middle of a term of peace as being nearly the mean of these charges is the most proper for our present purpose its amount and operations are therefore to be here shown the determination of the amounts of sinking funds which shall operate in any assigned manner forms a chapter of modern political arithmetic which should have been long since completed its title i believe is now written for the first time and a section of it is given in the text which is more fully explained in the last article of the appendix and to this if i have time i shall add a summary of the contents of the other parts of this subject   the mean rate of interest in the stock market during each year of the two half terms of peace is taken at   per cent or the value of the consolidated   per cent l   app art      per cent their neat average for nine years ending with the year      was l 0   app art        now if five years before the actual commencement of a war the state be possessed of a sinking fund amounting to l    ms ib   such a fund under the most probable conditions which can be assigned will be what is here called an adequate fund for first this sum annually applied to the reduction of the   per cent capital will be augmented at the rate of   per cent annually and will in five years have furnished l     ms ib   in money for that purpose by which a capital of l     ms ib   will be bought up and the fund at the end of the first peace amount to l     ms ib     a term of war of eight years is now to be supposed to follow in which let it be admitted that the extraordinary expenses will amount to l 0 ms that the average price of the   per cent stock will be l     app art      and its rate of interest l     ib  0 per cent and the system of the management of the land in war which has lately been established being supposed to be uniformly followed its annual product is to be subscribed by the commissioners of the land to the loan of each year for which they are to receive an annuity raised by new taxes the perpetuity of which shall be equal to the perpetuity of the omnium obtained by the lenders of equal sums of money that is ib  0 l  per cent thus l      ms app art      being the produce in money of the fund so augmented in eight years will be advanced by the commissioners for the service of the war and at the commencement of the peace its annual amount becomes augmented to l     ms ib      the sum necessary for the support of the war is taken at l 0 ms and as l      ms is the sum furnished by the public commissioners the loans of the private creditors must amount to l      ms ib     and this will generate a new capital of l      ms ib    in the   per cents  in the first two years of the following peace the product of the fund being annually increased at the rate of   per cent will be in money l    0 ib     which will have extinguished a capital of l      ms ib     in the   per cents  in the last five years of the foregoing peace it has been seen that a capital of l      ms had been in like manner paid off by the fund and in the first and second terms taken together a capital of l      ms x l      ms l      ms app art       there is here a minute difference of the capitals generated and paid off it is caused by neglecting totally all places of figures after the fifth which in operations of this sort are comparatively of no consequence or it pays off in one complete period the new debt generated therein and the capital of the debt at its termination is precisely equal to its amount at the beginning the fund therefore becomes what is here called an adequate fund  an equalization of the land tax which would produce a million and a small fraction annually in addition to our present surplus would be a very good approach to such a fund and it may be carried into execution without making the tax perpetual by vesting a further part of the old sinking fund in the commissioners equal to the increase of the tax and voting the latter annually to the current services to make up the deficiency in the provision for them which will arise from this appropriation nothing is hereby altered of the constitutional nature of a land tax as it continues to be voted annually and to be applied to current services only it is thus indeed to be considered as indirectly applied to the augmentation of the fund and in this sense its augmentation thereby is to be always here understood  the amount of an adequate surplus fund being l     ms a year the existing fund which very little exceeds   million must be admitted to be totally inadequate and if the consideration of our present safety does not impose upon us a necessity of augmenting it instantly the time in which that necessity shall speak in a more imperative tone is not far distant but the same exertions at both periods will not produce equal relief in equal times the ultimate burdens of the state and the time they must continue are increased by every delay of effectual measures  this state of our affairs therefore calls for every just and practicable addition to be made to our income and an augmentation to the land tax evidently comes under that description  whatever shows that such a sacrifice on the part of those who ought to make it is less than at first sight it appears is an argument which enforces the claim upon them it adds the whole of its proper weight to the consideration of necessity and thus increases the probability that it must take place though indirectly not in a minute degree it may be therefore proper to be shown that upon a supposition that an adequate fund be established part of which shall be effectively formed by an augmentation of this tax it will effect the total value of the estates out of which it issues and the neat annual income of the proprietors much less than at first sight it may appear to do  that the selling price of estates will be hereby very little if at all decreased is thus shown although their neat rents be at first diminished yet by the operation of such a fund the rate of interest must be much reduced and the years purchase of neat landed income will be increased in the same proportion hence the reduction of the market value of such estates will be ultimately inconsiderable and it much concerns those persons on whom the augmentation of the charge of the tax will fall well to examine whether by the application of such a fund and the consequent fall of interest more may not be gotten than lost upon this head sir john barnard in his celebrated essay on the reduction of the interest of the debt in the last four lines of it where he would have advanced nothing which in his own opinion did not stand upon the best foundation applied this argument in support of a point which seems to involve a much more decided opposition to popular belief than that stated above considerations etc osborne    0 p      it may be said that the increase of the tax is an uncompensated reduction of the neat income of the landlord but the very act of giving up a small part of it impresses a very strong tendency upon the remainder to increase for that increase will always be the consequence of improvements of the soil or augmentation of demand and both these must follow in a certain degree the fall of the rate of interest the price of improvement of land is the interest of the money sunk in it and whether it be effected by the capital of the farmer or the landlord when it becomes cheaper the landlords will be able to draw into their own pockets a greater proportion of the annual value of these improvements supposing the number of such undertakings not augmented but the increased facility of them will likewise augment their numbers again from the same common source of prosperity the traders and commercial men will become able to be better customers for the products of the soil or an augmentation of demand for them take place the second predisposing cause of an increase of rent the joint effects of both may very soon restore to the landlord no small part of what the tax initially takes from him or he may ultimately and at no very distant period find his temporary sacrifice entirely repaid and when the urgent necessities of the state call for it it may be expected that the voice even of a selfinterest very slightly counterbalanced by any better principle would be almost silent against it  but should the tax be increased without augmenting the appropriated sinking fund there will be no tendency in its effects to reimburse the landlord for the diminution of his income and a resource almost sufficient to ward off all the new difficulties the debt will involve us in and in time to free us from the old will be lost to us for ever and leave nothing which a wellgrounded hope can substitute in its place  nor can it be said that the addition to the tax thus applied is locked up from the service of the public when any exigence requires it the new system of the application of the sinking fund preserves to the state the command of its own money at all times and under such conditions that its alienation increases its efficacy thus a defect of its original institution is converted into an advantage the present surplus retards the increase of debt but does not put a stop to it and without the establishment of an adequate fund the annual charges of the state must continue to increase to the most oppressive magnitude by the increase of the public annuities the best and readiest source of augmentation for the fund is that of the land tax and the justest mode of effecting that is by equalization that measure would place us in the immediate reach of the great object here treated of for if it be once obtained the tax which would pay the interest of the loan of a single year of war will make the fund adequate the amount of the fund is something less than   millions the sum of the surplus and the augmentation of the land tax is very nearly l  00 ms and since this section has been chiefly written an addition of l 00000 has been obtained to the revenue from the east india company an equalization of the tax would therefore bring us very nearly into the situation stated  if the present war should not be attended with any great deficiency of the revenue such a fund would very soon be rendered adequate by the addition of an annuity of  l per cent on all loans to its amount     the justice of the claims of the rest of the nation upon the landowners for an increase of the amount of the tax the magnitude of that evil to which it will provide almost an adequate remedy and the urgent necessity for such a remedy afford presumptions which rise almost into proof that the time when it will take place is not very remote what they want of absolute evidence will perhaps be nearly supplied by the following considerations  the average nominal rate of the tax in four successive terms of peace ending with that of      was       app art     table pence and of the four last terms of war  s in the pound and we may look on the established proportion of its charge in war and peace to be as the numbers    and       respectively thus its nominal rate during the present peace having been uniformly  s in the pound in the next war it will exceed six shillings by a small fraction and the addition to its annual charge become l 0      and it may be observed here as on a former occasion that it will be seen in the next section that if the whole of this addition be levied exclusively upon the remote district it will still contribute to this tax less than its proportional charge  besides these arguments deduced from the nature of a land tax the equity of the measure and the state of our finances to show that an augmentation of amount is very probable several authorities to establish the same point might be doubtless found by any person who should search for them at the conclusion of the late war and during the term at the beginning of the present peace in which a settled gloom seemed to hang over us some sober and temperate men began to declare their opinions of the necessity of its augmentation baron maseres who certainly applied himself with much ability and attention to investigate the effects of the sinking fund on several capitals of our heterogeneous mass of debt concludes his researches by affirming that it would become necessary to increase the land tax if the revenue should fall short two millions of what the exigencies of the state might require and he takes it for granted that such an addition to our income would be wanted maseres      page     there is reason says this writer to apprehend that it will be necessary not only to continue the land tax at  s in the pound but even to increase it to double its present quantity or to four millions a year this he wrote during the war but as he did not publish the work in which it is contained until after the conclusion of the peace if his sentiments had been changed he would have corrected the passage it is here evidently seen to what quarter men well versed in these subjects look forward themselves and direct the attention of the trading and monied interest for the next augmentation of public revenue  though the opinion of baron maseres that the amount of the land tax will probably be doubled when a new necessity shall call for an increase of the public revenue may be disputed yet a less augmentation would severally affect the interests of the home counties and whenever again we shall be engaged in a war a great addition must be made to it the opinions long since advanced by men of eminence will then form the general sentiment and be carried into effect and it is probable that if the present valuation be continued the nominal rate will be about six shillings in the pound for the reason given above i know very well that there is much ridicule frequently attached to the supposition that plans of speculative men buried in the dust of a library will ever influence the important transactions of the political world or produce events on which the fate of great classes of men or even great nations shall depend and that to consider and be prepared beforehand as to what part we shall act when we see such scenes to be approaching is something even beneath the folly and dotage of timidity it would be easy to multiply examples to show that the confidence which gives birth to such maxims has been very frequently illfounded and the astonishing events of the last  0 years will not lend it any great support at least it will not be derived

remote sources of some great institutions which have been useful or of a more dubious nature might be here added but it is not our present business to multiply historical anecdotes of any determinate description  section iv on the measure of the disproportion of the charge of the land tax on the home and remote districts and its consequences in the first section it was stated that the kingdom is with respect to the land tax to be considered as separated into two great divisions the home district comprehending the    home counties with that of middlesex all consideration of london being here excluded and the remainder of england and wales called the remote district it is generally known that the land tax upon the home district much exceeds its due proportion as determined by the annual rent of each the measure of that excess is first to be made the subject of consideration  the proportion of the contents or number of acres of each district is very nearly known but if the value or fee simple accurately speaking estates of equal value only should be charged with equal taxes not those of equal income hence a rent proportioned to the fee simple of a district not the actual income thereof will be the measure of its taxability but this distinction which had been apparently adopted by mr king is much less necessary upon this subject than i had at first imagined it will be found however to have been observed throughout this essay though distinctions with but little difference ought not generally to be made yet when they are once interwoven in a tract there may be much trouble in blotting out all the traces of them and it will on the whole be only a negative correction of each be taken as its contents that of the remote district will be stated too high again the number of houses in each at the revolution is known with sufficient accuracy and the remote division has relatively increased in population ever since to a great degree it has likewise in the same term increased in manufactures with a much greater celerity than the home division if therefore the taxable value of the districts be computed from the proportion of their population in      that of the remote district will be considerably less than the truth in the first case there will be an error of excess in its value and in the second of defect and it is here assumed that these errors counterbalance each other hence it is determined that the value of the home is to that of the remote district as  0000 to       app art      and it is evident that this is the proportion of their taxable income the proportion of their values is all that is here required to be found as it serves the same purposes in the present inquiry as their absolute amounts if known  by other independent methods it is found that this proportion is sufficiently near the truth and they afford collateral support to it  davenant in his essay on ways and means written in      lays it down that the remote counties were then to be esteemed and valued as three fourths of the kingdom in the first section it is fully shown how much their value has relatively increased since it is matter of common notoriety if therefore when the rent of the home division is taken as  0000 that of this district be taken as       the latter may seem rather to be less than greater than the truth the land tax paid by the home district london excluded is l       app art      and according to the proportion here given the remote district ought to pay l 0   00 app art      the real payment thereof is l 0      app art      which falls short of its equitable and just contribution l 0      app art      this defalcation may be stated in another point of view thus its proportional payment davenant v   p    being l 0000 its effective charge is l 00  only and for every sum of l 0000 thus paid the just charge amounts to l       we shall now inquire what is the effective charge of this tax in the pound upon the actual income of real estates in the two districts when the nominal charge on each is four shillings  the income of such estates is of two kinds rent of superior condition as rent of land or of inferior condition as that of buildings and mines the sum of each of these is ordinarily stated as the national rent and may properly be called a mixed rent on account of the nature of the subjects out of which it arises the market values of all the estates of two districts of considerable extent may not be as their incomes the rate of interest being in each the same because one may contain a greater proportion of rents of the inferior condition than the other hence the ability of such a division of a country to contribute to a land tax will not always be in the precise proportion of its mixed income but of its selling price or which is the same thing it will be as the annual rent of supeior condition which might be purchased for that price to determine the proportion of the ability of the landlords of a district to pay any tax its mixed income ought to be so reduced a transformation which is employed in other parts of this inquiry but we are now to find the proportion the actual tax bears to the actual income that is the mixed income the law by which it is imposed bearing no respect to the nature of the subject out of which any rent arises  excluding london the mixed rent of both districts in      amounted to l      ms and that of the home district to l  0  ms and the land tax on this part of the kingdom being l    00 the charge in the pound was   s      d very nearly the rent in the remote district was l      its land tax l 0   00 and the rate in the pound   s 0 d very nearly or half the former only the average of the whole kingdom without london is   s   d table showing

pence and the nearest vulgar fractions each way of expressing it having its convenience for different purposes see appendix no       beside the peculiar tax paid by the landlords a part of all other taxes is paid out of their income or rents and as these do or may affect all income in general from whatever source derived they are here called general taxes now the part paid out of the rents of the two districts is to their whole charge as that rent to the whole national income hence the amount of these general taxes being l      ms app art      their charge upon the provincial proprietors of land is l      ms or   s   d preceding table in the pound rent  hence the charge of all taxes in the home district is   s   d preceding table in the pound and in the remote division   s     d preceding table  therefore by the inequality of the assessment of the land tax the burden of the home district exceeds its true proportion in the ratio of   to   it is also somewhat greater than that proportion of their income which political arithmeticians have laid down as a limit of what a country can pay in taxes in the the time of peace without ceasing to increase in riches the fourth penny of their annual income davenant v    p       the payments of the rents of the home district to all taxes is l      ms app art      and the equitable payments of the remote district in proportion to its value would be l      ms ib  0 its actual payment is l   0  app art     ms which falls short of its due contribution by l 0    ms ib  0 nearly the same sum as before assigned and their proportional is to their real charge as       is to  0000 ib     the consequence of this disparity to the kingdom in general and the home district in particular offer themselves next to our examination the first branch of these considerations will be entered upon by the proof of the following proposition  if the remote district had constantly contributed in their just proportion to this tax and the sum by which it would have been thereby increased had been applied to the purchase of   per cent stock it would at this time have extinguished a capital nearly double that of the present redeemable debt after a due and even liberal allowance had been made for the difficulties that part of the kingdom labored under at the revolution and perhaps for some following years  the average nominal rate of the tax since its first establishment has been  s and    d in the pound very nearly pence       and its annual average product in england l      now its actual charge to the remote counties is to that on the whole kingdom as  0    to       davenant v   p    table therefore the annual average charge upon them has been l     0 but that actual charge is to the proportional charge as  0000 to       the amount of the latter would have therefore been l   0  0 the difference of these two payments or l   0 0 is the fund which would thus have been applicable to the reduction of the   per cent capital  the term of its operation is next to be fixed and in assigning it due allowance is to be made for the distress under which it has been seen that the remote district labored at the revolution and for some years after it was above shown that in the year      all traces of the former depression of the value of estates in the district had become obliterated or    years after the imposition of the tax but at the very beginning of the term the payment of the remote counties was greatly below their abilities of contributing to the public charges and it may be taken that their estates rose to an equality of value with those of the home district by equal degrees in equal times and if their first payment which was so inadequate had been fully proportioned to their ability at that time by the nature of their progressive recovery as above described if they had paid the full tax the last half of the term or    years and their initial assessments without increase for the first half thereof a due allowance would have been made for their temporary distress but in the circumstances which took place this allowance is much more than adequate from the whole term of a century therefore the period during which the land tax has existed    years is to be deducted and the remainder    years is the period in which the fund of l    0 0 to have been gained by the equalization of the tax would have been applicable to the extinction of the debt  the third factor to be assigned is the rate of interest at which the fund would have operated in successive periodical publications we have the price of the   per cent stocks from the year      inclusive to this time and taking as before the average interest of the stock market during the present peace at l   that of the last    years was l     per cent during the first  0 years of this term that rate was still higher but the permanent rate here assumed is l   per cent it is to be noted that hereby the amount of the fund for the whole term will not be inconsiderably less than the truth the interest at which it would have accumulated in the first  0 and the last  0 years having exceeded l   per cent  the amount of an annuity of l   in    years at l  per cent is l    0 and of an annuity of l   0 0 l      ms and interest being at l  or the value of the   per cents l     that sum of money would have extinguished a capital of l      ms of such stock  nor can it be said from the experience of the fate of our sinking fund that such an additional sum if put under the like appropriation would not have been applied for that purpose for during the present century the mean annual expenses and the charge of the peace establishment have increased very nearly in the same proportion and this seems to be derived from a necessity imposed upon every member of the european republic of states which will not submit to be degraded below its former relative rank therein which is founded on great advances in strength and opulence which most of them have made in the present age by an unfortunate system of policy the nation has never provided an increasing revenue for this increasing charge and thus the product of the sinking fund has at length been almost totally absorbed by the increasing charge of the peace establishment the errors and perhaps the delinquence of administrations may at some periods have contributed toward it but this impolitic national parsimony much more nor are the marks of criminal profuseness which appear upon the face of the public accounts so frequent in the middle and at the conclusion of the last hundred years as at the beginning and perhaps no reason can be assigned to show that if the amount of the sinking fund had been l  0000 a year more this surplus would have been gratuitously flung away and if only one half of it had escaped from the influence of peculation and mismanagement our present debt would have been nearly annihilated  but the inequality of the land tax has likewise contributed its share to another great evil it was not without its effect and that perhaps a very considerable one in producing the civil war of the colonies and dismembering the empire for it cannot be doubted that a suspicion of the equity with which the british parliament would exercise the power of taxation was one of the leading causes which brought on the resistance which terminated in that great revolution and if no other american made up his opinion on this head from the disparity of the land tax of england dr franklin at least did he always used to quote the continuance of the land tax upon its present very unequal footing as a proof of the very little regard that was had to justice and commonsense in our national deliberations maseres on life annuities p   0 this argument must have full weight with those who think the colonists would have concurred in any mode of contributing to the expenses of the united empire which they were assured from the established character of equity in the legislation would not have been attended with practical oppression and inequality for they would not have hazarded a civil war for abstract principles when they had a sufficient moral probability grounded on their confidence of the long unimpeachable justice of that assembly in whom the power would be that these abstract principles would never produce an additional burden to them in their operation and on the other hand temperaments would have been easily discovered and conceded to with the same facility to have obtained their contributions without any contravention to those principles  the effects of this inequality upon the home district in particular are now to be stated here it will not be sufficient to examine simply the force by which these counties are depressed for its consequences depend not only on its magnitude but on the strength of the subject on which it operates therefore after discussing the general effects of the disparity other circumstances are to be pointed out which operating in conjunction with them tend greatly to increase the relative depression of the district  beside the absolute definition of the property of the the home district by the disproportionate assessment of the tax as a secondary consequence it produces an effective and a very important balance of payment against the less and in favor of the greater division of the kingdom  when money is brought by taxes into the treasury much of it again returns into the country for several purposes to pay the interest of the public creditors for the subsistence of troops the purchase of stores and commodities and on diverse other accounts now it may very well be admitted sums so returned into the two districts are as the landed capital of each the sum of these disbursements in both will evidently exceed l   0  ms app art    the amount of the provincial tax but first let it be considered as exactly equal thereto being distributed to both in the proportion laid down the share of the remote division will be l    0 ms app art    and that of the home district l 0  00 app art   the former sum exceeds the remittance of that district to the treasury on account of the land tax by l     0 app art    and the latter falls short of the tax on the home division by the same sum or it is an effective balance increasing annually the money of one district and decreasing that of the other  now let the annual disbursement of government exceed the sum assigned by any given amount such excess must be derived from the general taxes which are equally levied in both districts and the money returning to each according to what is above laid down will be proportional to its landed capital or its prior charge to those taxes but less than the amount thereof because all the expenses of government are not internal hence considered by itself this second reflux of money cannot generate a balance in favor of either of them it is only a proportional restoration of part of the money of both it therefore cannot diminish the wrong balance assigned above  such balances may exist between province and province as well as between independent kingdoms and in like manner must be ultimately paid by the precious metals that we may judge of its consesequence let its amount be compared with that part of our annual gain by foreign trade which presents itself first to every ones imagination who thinks upon the increase of national opulence i mean that part of the precious metals gained by the general balance of trade which forms the annual increment of our national stock of coin that we have on an average of many years an annual resting balance of this kind notwithstanding the great diminution of corn which must be occasioned by our wars and the more latent causes of decrease will not i think at this time be brought into dispute now the larger this sum is stated to be the less will the comparative loss of the home district appear from the adverse balance above pointed out in    0 mr andrew hook published his essay on the national debt and capital which is mentioned by sir john sinclair sir j sinclairs history of the revenue v   p     we may see likewise by postlethwayts dictionary that it was a work held in much consideration when first written as an admirable work the great foundation on which all his computations are built is the annual increment of the national coin this he states at l       hookes essay p   in this he seems to have exceeded the truth it appears from a passage in dr a smiths wealth of nations which i have not time to search for that this amount may somewhat exceed l  0000 a year yearly thus the balance against the home district generated by the inequality of land tax exceeds the part of our foreign balance of trade by which the coin of the kingdom is increased by l      being more than one half thereof  this annual increment of the coin of l   000 a year is the basis on which the increment of our currency is founded which is the sum of our circulating paper and coin for a part of this new coin being withdrawn and locked up in the chest of the banker enables him to increase the currency by three or four times its amount in paper and thus the market for all our commodities is supplied with the representative signs of real value although both their quantities and their nominal prices are perpetually augmenting this apparently minute annual increment of the national stock of coin is the stream that has led the national capital in every stage of its progressive growth and it is sufficient to have increased it to that magnitude it has attained the inequality of the land tax which has generated a balance against the home district of l   000 a year must have greatly retarded it in its course of prosperity during the whole term it has operated although the counties included in it should be admitted to have derived an equal or perhaps a superior sum annually from some other quarter for even in this latter case a part of that annual superlucration of the district equal to this balance would be annihilated by it or would be rendered what has been called a lucrum cessans which is always in effect equal to a damnum emergens  in the process to determine the adverse balance against the home counties by the inequality of the tax it has been shown that its amount upon the provinces when its nominal rate is  s in the pound a charge now become permanent is l   0  ms of which sum the proportional share of the remote district is l      ms and of the home district l 0  00 i shall here so far make a digression as to draw a corollary from this connected with the general subject though not with the particular matter of this section  hence a method is easily deduced to equalize the burden of the tax and still retain the old valuation of the districts and this may be done by adopting a counterinequality this is not the decisive counterinequality of dr franklin to be described hereafter though i borrow the term from him he annexed a much more effective notion to it of the nominal rates at which the two districts are assessed so adjusted as to be reciprocal to the inequality of the valuation by which the payment of each district is rendered proportional to its value the new rates are found thus the product of the tax on both remaining fixed at its present amount the proportional contribution of the remote district is l     ms now at the nominal rate of  s in the pound the sum raised therein is l 0    ms and at the nominal rate of      d  s   d  s in the pound the total collected by the division would amount to that proportional payment  again at the nominal rate of  s in the pound the sum of l     0 is raised in the home counties the valuation of which being continued and that reduced to       pence or  s  d halfacrown in the pound the amount of the tax would be reduced to l 0     its proportional part of the total now paid by both  this seems to hold out a very easy mode of doing an act of substantial justice to the oppressed district and at the same time of avoiding the natural difficulties and the artificial obstructions which might be flung in the way of a new valuation but the gross inequality being thus removed the great mass of interest which opposes the introduction of a more perfect system of levying this tax would be much reduced if it did not fall with it and in a little time every subordinate inequality would follow the fate of the great one which at present covers and protects them all  to return to the immediate subject of the section the burden of this disparity on the home district has been considered in some material points of view but if all of them had been exhausted only one half the inquiry is finished the measure of the power which is to support that burden remains to be sought after and this power may be considered either absolutely or relatively  now there are some natural circumstances respecting the two districts whose primary and secondary effects necessarily give a great superiority to the remote division it includes the coal countries the direct and primary consequence of which the wood in the home district being reduced to almost nothing is to form another balance of payment in their favor but the secondary effects of this natural inequality of the districts in respect to firing extend much further it lays the manufactures of the one under great disadvantages and gives a superior facility to the extension of those of the other in the home district it has the most hurtful effect on the morals and industry of the laborers in agriculture and while from the increase of its coal trade and that of its manufactures the shipping of the remote division has received a great augmentation that of the home district has suffered a cotemporary decline and each in a degree which prior to actual experience would have been held far to exceed any bounds of probable expectation this source of superiority derived from nature on the one side and of relative depression on the other are the most cogent arguments against suffering the continuance of any other disparities generated by artificial and inequitable systems of policy such as the continuation of a tax of double burden upon the district in the less fortunate natural state  but i must consider more in particular each of these circumstances which add to the weight of this unjust burden their importance to the general argument is such that they are not to be passed over in a bare summary enumeration  with respect to the balance against the home district by the coal trade it may be said that if their wood be cleared off the soil it is because they find their gain more by reducing it into cultivation hence they are able to pay for their coal and afterward derive a greater profit from their land than before to this it must be answered that the whole advantage it might reap if they could obtain their firing out of the bowels of their own soil is diminished by the price of the coal remitted out of the district and that land brought into cultivation in the other division occasions no drain of money for firing on the contrary they keep that whole sum at home and their capital is perpetually increasing by the expense of their neighbors in this article for the price of the coal and its freight  the expense of this fuel to the consumers in the home counties consists of the following parts its value at the pit a duty of more than sixty per cent on that value smith v   p     and      the freight mercantile profit and inland carriage firing is necessary for the comfortable subsistence of many different sorts of workmen who work within doors smith v   p     and      and manufacturers have always gradually migrated into countries where fuel is cheapest when there has been no great disparity of other circumstances to this cause the depression of many branches of the manufactures of the home district is to be ascribed which formerly flourished there and that part of the kingdom may have long occasion to regret the loss of the bill brought into the lower house by the present minister a few years ago laying a tax on coal at the pits mouth if it had been withdrawn on being carried coastwise it would have formed an equalizing and protecting duty and given some remedy to its natural disadvantages  if this difference of situation affect the subsistence of one class of the laboring poor in the home district  the manufacturers and attack the very existence of the manufactures themselves it produces effects no less fatal to the morals and industry of another  the workmen in husbandry before wood was almost extirpated there the labourer could purchase firing or as it was of little value much was given him its scarcity has diminished very much if not annihilated this supply from the liberality or sufferance of his superiors and its price renders him more ready to steal than able to buy he goes out in the night in search of it and opportunities frequently present themselves to him at the same time of making other depredations and the woodstealer is thus tempted to become and frequently does become a robber of a still more dangerous character this is one great inductive cause of that profligacy which the poor are arrived at in the home district and from which i conclude that cheapness of firing has greatly tended to preserve those of the remote division it is well known how much the flourishing state of a country depends upon the morals of the lower class and in the home district there is every cause in action to bring them into a state of degeneracy which can operate in the remainder of the kingdom with almost an additional necessity imposed upon them by the dearness of fuel of beginning the practice of night stealing  the last disparity of the two divisions to be treated is in the quantity of their shipping that of the home district having decreased with great rapidity while that of the other has been constantly and greatly augmenting  this is to be shown from the tonnage of english ships cleared outward in the year    0 and      two terms sufficiently remote and the only terms for which i have been able to discover proper data to found any comparison upon and it will be afterward shown by general reasoning that the conclusions to be derived from them will very well apply to the present purpose  the shipping of the outports are here only to be taken into the account excluding that of the port of london and the materials for their comparison obliges us to divide the tonnage into two parts not corresponding to the two districts but approaching to such correspondence as near as may be the first division contains the four greater outports of whitehaven liverpool newcastle and bristol the second the remaining ports of the kingdom being all the smaller outports after that account is so stated it will be shown that all its consequences may be strictly applied to the smaller home ports that is all the ports of the home district exclusive of london and moreover that they would hold good a fortiori if the account could be more exactly drawn out or that the decrease of the shipping of the home district estimated both absolutely and proportionally would by such more accurate account appear to be greater than that here to be exhibited  the absolute decrease of the shipping of the smaller ports is first to be shown there were cleared outward from all of them taken together in the year    0    0   app art  0   mr chalmers takes the total tonnage of english shipping at more than the number of tons cleared outward in a year see note app art  0   tons of english shipping and in             app art  0   mr chalmers takes the total tonnage of english shipping at more than the number of tons cleared outward in a year see note app art  0   tons only they had therefore decreased  0     tons app art  0   mr chalmers takes the total tonnage of english shipping at more than the number of tons cleared outward in a year see note app art  0   in twentytwo years to apply this loss to a proper measure familiarised to the conception of every man as far as it can be by being frequently made the subject of conversation in the very same term of twentytwo years the tonnage of english vessels annually cleared outward increased  0 0   tons thus if these ports had been able to preserve their shipping without augmenting it a single ton the increase of our vessels for commerce and our naval force great as it actually was would have been doubled and half the augmentation of our marine strength from the prosperity of the five great ports was annihilated by the decline of the smaller taken conjointly  having stated the absolute loss the celerity of this decline is now to be fixed taking therefore the tonnage of the smaller outports in    0 as  000 that of      will be found to be as      app art  0   or they had lost of their whole shipping in twentytwo years the prosperity of the four great outports and the severe reverse of situation of the remainder and smaller exhibit an unparalleled and afflicting contrast the tonnage of the former increased in the same time from        to     0  tons or by    0   tons in the proportion of  0000 to       ibid art  0   while the most distressed commercial state in europe did not in the same period experience any calamity to be put in competition with the decline of the latter it argues something deleterious and fatal either natural or artificial or both to their commerce depressing it during the whole of the term  although no extracts of registers can be here produced to show upon which of the smaller ports the whole of this calamity fell yet every general reason points out that the total of it is exclusively to be carried to the account of those of the home district the increase of shipping of some of the smaller ports of the other division at least counterbalancing probably much exceeding some decrease which might be experienced by others because those causes then known to exist in this kingdom adequate to the production of so great an evil or even capable of restraining a course of prosperity were limited in their operation to the home district exclusively for although that district beside its disproportionate charge to the state by the land tax is further exhausted by paying an annual balance to the other counties which this first oppression draws after it as its necessary consequence a balance which considerably exceeds the annual increment of the national coin there is superadded to this a second and much greater on account of coal and the scarcity of fuel which has thus rendered the home district tributary to the rest of the kingdom is a circumstance which has generated much depravity in the village poor laid a new tax upon the productions of agriculture and tended not a little to retard its improvements and the increase of its products and to the effect of the same cause is further to be added that by promoting the migration of some of our manufacturers and restraining the extent of others it has produced the same melancholy consequences on the laboring inhabitants of our greater towns and cities as on those of the villages increasing the pressure of their necessities and by perpetual intermissions of employment relaxing their habits of industry and giving birth to or increasing those of the worst nature  in this account are to be found proximate as well as remote causes of destruction of commerce and the consequent decrease of shipping these having existed exclusively in the home district the whole of their effect must have taken place there and it appears highly probable that the account above given does not show the whole of their loss in shipping for from their natural and artificial advantages it seems absolutely necessary to admit that the smaller ports of the remote division taken collectively have made some increase to their tonnage counterbalancing in part the decrease of the others this rate of augmentation may certainly be taken equal to that of the average increase of the national shipping as retarded by the losses of the home district for their advantages are above the general average and it may with the greatest moderation be assumed that as the four great outports all situated in the remote district have in twentytwo years increased in tonnage in the proportion of       to  0000 app art  0   so that of the other ports alike situated and partaking the same common advantages have in the same time increased in the proportion of       to  0000 which is the average rate of increase of the tonnage of the whole kingdom or with something less than one fourth of the celerity of the former  but if it be contended that even this rate is too much let the tonnage of these smaller ports taken collectively be now admitted to have increased with any celerity less that here mentioned the augment it has received must be something and the decrease of the tonnage of all the smaller ports of the kingdom taken together will have been diminished by that increase therefore the decrease of that of the other ports that is those of the home district will be equal to the total decrease of this tonnage  0     tons with that small augment added to it the decrease of their shipping therefore as above represented is less than the truth whence it follows that the celerity of its decline is much less than the truth for in    0 the tonnage cleared outward from the small home ports must have been less than    0   tons app art  0   the total for both districts its decrease also exceeded  0     tons hence by the nature of proportion it must have decreased from the year    0 to      with a greater celerity than that defined by the ratio of    0   tons to        tons or of  0000 to      app art  0     if the shipping of smaller remote ports be supposed to have been stationary neither increasing nor diminishing the decrease of the annual tonnage of the smaller home ports will remain as first stated but from the nature of proportion the celerity of their decline as given above will be below its true magnitude  there is one case indeed in which the celerity of the decline of the shipping of the home district will be accurately defined by that proportion that is if one equal decrease had taken place at the same time in the remote division but this supposition is extremely improbable for it may be presumed that in the history of commerce there is not to be found an instance of a great district which had once acquired a considerable quantity of shipping if it had not lost its industry or did not labor under any particular circumstances of adversity where that shipping was found to have been decreasing in long terms of time it has always been progressive throughout europe in general where the existence of such causes to retard it have not been extremely evident  laying now aside all further consideration of the absolute quantity of its decrease it is to be observed that the celerity of the decline of the shipping of the smaller home ports can be exaggerated by the estimate given above upon one supposition only and that is that a more rapid decline has taken place in the smaller ports of the other in a time when every cause of superiority was operating in their favor an assumption too absurd to be considered  it is concluded hence that the decrease of the shipping of the smaller home ports and the celerity of its decline great as it is represented above rather falls short of than exceeds the truth and that although this point is established only upon general reasoning which is certainly inferior in conclusiveness to the proof arising from actual registers of tonnage yet these general reasons have great cogency are founded upon wellknown facts and there appears nothing of the like kind to be set against them to balance them and they can only be set aside by the production of copies of the entries of such registers  it may be said that the state of the shipping of england may have been very much altered between the year      and this time and that the smaller home ports may have recovered in a great part their relative proportion now on an average of three years ending in      the tonnage of all our ships in foreign commerce was        tons chalmerss opinions on interesting subjects      p    and in the like term ending in             tons this shows a decrease of       tons chalmerss opinions on interesting subjects      p    and exhibits no appearance of an increase of shipping in any part of the kingdom and the probable presumption is that it would not have sprung up in a time of general decline in a district which every thing tends to depress and if such be the fact it can be proved by the evidence of the registers alone it is beside to be added that those causes which produced the decrease of shipping from    0 to      must have been since removed before its progress could have been even stopped and a much greater change must have taken place before their antecedent effect could have been in any degree recovered of either of these great revolutions no single vestige has occurred to me  the proportional payment of the home district to the andtax is l 0   00 app art      and its effective payment being l 0      app art      the defalcation amounts to l 0      app art      i therefore now proceed to show that it is possessed of the full ability to make up that deficiency  this might be in general terms inferred from the great increase of the commerce of that part of the kingdom just before instanced but it may be more directly proved from particular and independent evidence that after such augmentation of the tax their burden would not be equal to that of their actual contribution to it at its first imposition on the contrary that a further addition of l   00 a year to this proportional payment must be made to bring it to such equality and as they were able to support the original charge and rapidly emerge from a state of comparative depression into that of a decided superiority over the remainder of the kingdom that they are possessed of the full ability now to make good their defalcation to the proportional payment  the burden of a tax upon all income of the same condition as before defined is the proportion the annual charge of the tax bears to the annual amount of the income thus a double sum taken from a double income and a treble sum from a treble income constitute equal burdens and so on for any other equimultiples of tax and income  in      the land tax amounting annually to l  0      was laid on this district in sixteen years of the first twenty the charge was the same or at   s in the pound for three years at   s and the remaining year at   s at the revolution or five years before its commencement the remote district was in a state of relative decline which appears even to have been advancing upon it with great celerity yet the progress of this decline became retarded it stopped entirely the state of manufactures began to shift guthries geography edit      p     the lands in the other parts of the kingdom had fallen not very inconsiderably and those of the remote district advanced to a perfect equality in value with them so early as the sixteenth year after the expiration of the first twenty it is to be concluded therefore that during that term of twenty years the burden of the land tax did not exceed the measure of that ability which the district then possessed and that the same burden would at present be attended with no oppression to them  our inquiry therefore must be directed to discover what charge in the year      would be equal in burden to the actual payment of the division in the year       the taxability of any income is every thing else being alike as its selling value from a revenue of l 000 a year in land or what is called here income of superior condition a larger sum may be drawn in taxes than from the same rent in buildings or income of inferior condition or if an income of the latter kind be reduced in the proportion which its proper number of years purchase bears to that of an estate in land the resulting amount will be part thereof which appears to be justly the subject of taxation thus having given the national rent of land and of estates of inferior condition the whole may be reduced into an income all the equal parts of which shall be of equal value and equitably pay the same rate in the pound to a tax the value of these rents in      and      are severally given it appears from their amount that the national rent during those eightysix years increased very nearly per cent app art     annually and supposing it to have continued to be augmented at this rate until the year      the taxable national rents of      and      were l      ms app art     and l  0   app art     ms respectively  the wealth of the remote has evidently increased with greater celerity than that of the home district and consequently the advance of the rent thereof exceeded the average rate of the whole kingdom but let it be admitted to have increased at an equal rate only it follows that the taxable income of estates of this division has increased from the year      to      in the proportion of   0   to       or in that of l0    00 to l 0      but this latter sum was the amount of the payment of the remote division to the land tax in      now the experience of that time demonstrated that it was able to bear such a burden for nearly twenty years successively and during that term to recover in a great measure from very depressed circumstances and make large steps in the road by which it has since led to a high degree of prosperity and the former sum l     00 being the payment of equal burden the inhabitants of that part of the country are now equally well able to bear it their proportional payment was before shown to be l 0   00 which falls short of the tax of equal burden by l   00 app art     a year reasons of very great validity must be produced by the possessors of land in the remote district to oppose to the claims of their countrymen for redress or equalization and i will here put the defensive argument in which they seem to repose the most confidence in as good a light as i am able to place it  from the original imposition of the land tax and a whole century has now elapsed since that time all contracts for estates in this district have been made in full confidence that this proportion of payment would be perpetual it is not a few individuals whose interest are sacrificed to this innovation but the whole body of purchasers of land for that whole term who in number perhaps exceed three fourths of the cotemporary purchasers in the kingdom all these by one act will be stripped of a property for which they have paid a fair value and in which they thought themselves secured by the public faith it has certainly been tacitly given but it has been ratified as often as the present and original proportion has been reenacted which has been an annual practice of the same continuation as the tax and hence the state is become as firmly pledged by these repeated acts as by the most express promise for a legal right the most absolute and plenary both to benefits and exemptions may be founded on long continued customs and every good system of laws recognizes such customs as a foundation of civil right all invasions upon them have always been diligently repressed in the common courts where the maxim quieta non sunt movenda has constantly been had in reverence but this custom is of a higher nature it is the custom of the legislature and the custom of parliament is the law of parliament which is paramount to all its ordinary acts and a fundamental part of the constitution limiting even that power which limits every thing else  to this it is answered that the facts alleged are not true and admitting their truth the conclusion must then rest entirely upon some other assumptions used in conjunction with them in the course of the argument which are totally repugnant to the first principles of society  it is laid down as a fact in this argument that all purchasers since the establishment of the tax have been made in full confidence that no equalization would in future take place to this it is replied that the expectation of the purchasers on this head could not amount to such a confidence our ancestors in the home district before the imposition of the tax made their respective purchases without any compensation for a perpetual charge upon their purchased income of double the magnitude which the new landowners of the remote counties will have to pay after the equalization has taken place i repeat the words of double the magnitude for the question being here of purchased income only by the equalization they will lose a part of such income equal to one half only of that taken away from our ancestors at the original imposition of the tax and this is the whole purchased income the tax after equalization will take from them the part thereof paid by them at present not being purchased income for at the treaty for the sale of the estate to each individual its amount was deducted out of its income and no money paid for it and their expectation that the whole of their purchased income would be liable to no tax must have been weakened by their knowledge that the state had formerly taken from the persons they represent the same quantity of purchased income which is now required for the equalization and from the proprietors of the home district the double of that quantity their expectation therefore of continuing to enjoy the whole of their purchased income untaxed must be less than that entertained by our ancestors prior to their having experienced such an assessment and even the expectation the latter might form must have fallen very short of the measure of full confidence pretended to by the purchasers of the home district as in the course of more than fifty years before the land tax took place occasional aids of great amount under other names had frequently been levied upon land the confidence therefore under which they pretend to have purchased must have been diminished by the experience of the former failure of a confidence better founded in the case of the home district it therefore could not be what they style it a full confidence and it may be added though it depends upon a principle to be proved hereafter that they must always have suspected that the inequality of the land tax must ultimately be remedied because in counties where the greater outlines of a moral policy are upon the whole well preserved no exemption flagrantly abusive can subsist to all perpetuity and that such forms of government by their own internal vigor ultimately purge off all real feculencies  but if we examine this full confidence which has perpetually existed a little more closely we shall come to its true nature it is a new species of full confidence which has subsisted under a constant expectation entertained in both parts of the kingdom that it would ultimately fail the subject of baron maseress work on annuities makes him a very good authority on this head he has beside paid considerable attention to it by him we are informed that the persons who have been lightly taxed have always feared and those who have been heavily taxed have always hoped that the parliament would one day or other have sufficient regard to justice to correct this gross inequality maseres vol   p     it follows that the purchasers of estates in the remote district did not at the time of purchasing regard that part of their income which an equalization would take from them as a certain and perpetual annuity but as a contingent income only which must cease on the happening of a certain event which was so probable in their opinion as to be the object of constant fear now nobody can imagine that the same number of years purchase would be paid for an income or part of an income which it was always feared might be taken from the purchaser as for an absolute perpetuity there must have been some difference in the purchasemoney now this difference allowed to the buyer was the value of the increase against the contingency happening or the income ceasing by the equalization of the tax and this is effectively the same thing as if the purchaser had paid down the whole value of that income out of which a sum equal to the then reputed value of the hazard had been repaid to him by the seller as a proper equivalent to the loss of it when it should happen all such purchasers in the remote district have therefore the consideration for this addition to the tax in hand or it has been paid to those of whom they are the representatives whole virtual engagements binding the income they must abide by and it must be admitted that these purchasers either by themselves or their representatives have one with another been permitted to enjoy this contingent annuity a much longer term than they could have expected for if no second sale of the same estate had taken place during the whole century the disparity has subsisted the purchaser and those claiming under him will according to the equality of chance have been in possession of this beneficial contingency fifty years and taking repeated sales into the question the term may probably have been about thirtyfive or forty years  but let it be now supposed that all these contracts for the purchase of land were actually as improvidently made as they were stated to be join to this the wellknown fact that parliament has adhered during a whole century to the same proportion of assessment yet this will not serve as a foundation to prove such a custom as is alleged granting all that is laid down in law books upon the validity of custom for it is an established maxim of the law malus usus abolendus est blackstones com v   p         an inequitable custom must be abolished the act of      established the inequality and such an act it is itself among the enumerated proofs that custom is invalid since the statute itself is a proof of a time when such custom did not exist blackstones com p    and the like may be said of the    subsequent acts every one of which is a full and distinct proof of its nonexistence at the time it was passed and this is the total support their claim of custom derives from the original proportion of assessment having been    times reenacted beside if at any time during the whole period the faith of parliament had been expressly pledged to the remote district for the continuance of their exemption and not tacitly and by implication it would have destroyed the analogy set up between this custom and a legal custom as it would have shown it to have been not compulsory ibid p an essential property of a legal custom but voluntary  as the continuance of the immunity contended for fails of all support from its analogy to a legal custom its only remaining defense must rest upon the principles of natural equity  let us therefore examine how far it can be reconciled to the first principles on which human society is formed and on which it continues to be kept together these are always clearly discoverable by the fiction of a number of wise and welldisposed individuals who were before independent of each other meeting to form a compact to enter into society and all disguise of their sentiments and circumstances being out of the question by the description of the individuals forming such a meeting the want of each individual for the protection of all the rest and his desire to obtain it would be really and apparently equal and every one would readily and honestly engage to contribute to the protection of all the rest by prestations bearing the same proportion to his ability or constituting equal burdens to him by prestations are to be understood renders of personal service or of commodities or both jointly or of their representative signs for there exists no ground in the case described why less or more than that proportion should be either required or accepted of or engaged for by any one  that the burdens of every member of the same community be equal is therefore the first principle on which human society is founded and that compact is violated when any one refuses to take his proportioned share in the aggregate burden it is of moral obligation as long as he enjoys the protection of the society or nation and such obligation a series of infractions of no length although it may very well suit the iniquity of selfinterest to call it a custom can invalidate moral obligations cannot be prescribed against no absolute and declared act of any legislature can cancel the first article of this primitive convention parliament therefore is not competent to pledge the national faith even by an express law that the tax should not be equalized and it will not i suppose be pleaded that that august assembly could tacitly contract such an engagement on the part of the nation when an express declaratory law to that purpose would in itself be null and void  upon the grounds of the objection advanced by the remote district against an equalization of the tax it might be likewise proved that such tax ought never to be laid in countries where it has not been laid before and where it has that it should be immediately repealed for prior to the introduction of such a tax every purchaser of an estate would have paid the full market value of its clear income and of every part thereof and the tax will take from him an income he has purchased under the full security of enjoying it a security more complete and much higher in degree than the landowners of the remote district can entertain this being an absolute injustice such a tax ought not to be introduced and where it is already established the evil ought to be remedied as fast as possible and with very little trouble it might be shown upon the same ground that every other tax ought to be repealed  there is a very numerous class of proprietors in the remote district who possess estates which have been in their families for the whole erm of the existence of the tax during which a double charge has fallen upon the income of those of the home counties if the former were to rest the continuance of this inequality upon their own interest they would want even a verbal pretension to resist the claims made upon them injustice does not like however to go quite barefaced she will rather make use of any flimsy tatter almost transparent to veil herself with some of the old hereditary proprietors it may be presumed tke up the argument here considered for this reason others join them who never examine what they have constantly heard repeated and what their self interest makes them wish to be true and many who examine no old opinions at all these unite to give this miserable shadow of a pretense for the continuance of oppression and injustice weight and currency and together with those whose claims to indulgence they avow themselves to defend they form a great majority of the landlords of the remote counties that is of three quarters of england yet if this argument in its best form were proposed to any sensible man who was not previously acquainted with it and with the interests and prejudices which combine to support it and he was told at the same time that it was the language held by a large party of wellinformed men in england he would be apt to suspect the veracity of the relation  hitherto the difference of the charge of the land tax of the home district and that of the whole of the remote division has been considered it remains only to draw a comparison of the former with a part of the latter the county of york the actual and proportional payment of that county to the land tax and its rate in the pound are the only points to be considered  following the process laid down at the beginning of this section it appears that the rent of the home district is to that of the county of york as  0000 to  0   the actual payment of the home distrct to the land tax is l       and the proportional payment of the county l     0 its actual payment is l    0 and the defalcation l    00 app art     this

alteration of the constitution of the house of commons proposed in      and    0 in considering the consequence of the plans for a change of the election of the commons i confine myself to those brought forward in the years      and    0 as it is probable from the great celebrity of their movers that on a future occasion either one or the other will be revived or some third scheme brought forward compounded from both the first was introduced into the house by mr pit in the year      the second by mr flood in    0 whose name certainly retains great weight with those who now call for this great alteration in the constitution and of the outline of which mr fox declared that it was the best he had ever heard suggested upon the subject new annual register    0 history p      i shall begin with a very short analysis of each of these plans  that of mr pit new annual register      history p      consisted of three parts as follows  the suppression of some smaller boroughs which ultimately were to have been about fifty in number this was to have been done by the purchase of the right of election of single boroughs whenever the consent of two thirds of the electors was obtained for its surrender  the first set of boroughs to have been disfranchised was in number thirtysix and seventytwo members were to be added to the representatives for counties in such proportion to each as the wisdom of parliament might prescribe and copyholders were to have been admitted to the right of voting in all the counties  after this part of the plan had been fully executed the rights of election of other boroughs were to have been bought up and transferred to large towns at present unrepresented as it was supposed that the new members would ultimately amount to about a hundred the number of the second class of boroughs to have been suppressed would have been nearly fourteen and in populous towns where the number of electors are very few that franchise was to have been extended to all the inhabitants  by this plan the number of members in the house of commons would have remained unaltered strict regard being had to the article of the union on this subject  that of mr flood new annual register    0 history p    consisted of a single article only  that a hundred new members should be added to the house to be elected by the householders of the counties  by the first if executed in its full extent about fifty boroughs would have been suppressed by the second they are all supposed to continue in the possession of their franchise according to the former some greater towns now unrepresented were to have the privilege of returning members to parliament the number of these members would have been about twentyeight by the latter no new grant of this kind was made and lastly by the scheme of      the members of counties were to have been increased by seventytwo and by a hundred by the plan of    0 but by both the right of voting is extended to electors of new descriptions and the number of members who would have obtained seats upon absolutely new appointments by the first is the same as that which would have been added to the house by the second of these schemes of alteration  the several parts of each of them and the circumstances connected with them which tend to affect the balance of power in the representation of the two districts are now to be made the subject of disquisition  the continuance or the suppression of the elective franchises of the boroughs will produce some difference in the effects of the alteration of the lower house upon this balance it will therefore be shown that there is no probability that in future such suppression will take place for it is by no means certain that it would have been affected if the bill of      had been passed into its original form but it is more clearly evinced by the following argument it will be opposed by all those who wish to uphold the present constitution of the house and they will be supported in their opposition judging from what is past by the most effective advocates for a change  and first it is by no means certain that the elective franchises of certain boroughs would have been bought up and suppressed if the bill of mr pit in      had passed into a law  for prior to the suppression of any borough the bill made it requisite that two thirds of the electors should signify in a prescribed manner their assent to resign their elective franchises this act indeed would become binding upon the whole and they were to receive a compensation for their surrender which would upon an average have amounted to l      to each borough one million was to have been allotted for the suppression of    boroughs new annual register      hist p      but we cannot but perceive there was by this plan much left to chance in the suppression of the boroughs it was postponed to an indefinite period and mr pit admitted that the operation of the scheme would not have been immediate at least in its fullest extent it was declared however that the benefit of the plan was expected to be felt before the expiration of the parliament then newly assembled when mr flood proposed his plan in    0 he observed on this head that the purchase must be slow and uncertain and that the worst boroughs those of government would never resign  there is a very great party in the house who support the boroughs as part of the existing constitution and when their suppression is again moved judging from what is past we may pronounce they will be joined by a very effective body of the advocates for a change namely those who shall follow on this subject the former sentiments of mr fox and as we are not to presume on a change of opinion in any man till we have some evidence of it by that great leader of opposition himself the outline of mr floods plan has been given before he proposed the admission of one hundred new members for counties into the house to be elected in a manner he described and to leave the boroughs in their present state mr fox owned that he thought its outlines the best he had ever heard suggested upon the subject new annual register    0 hist p      but nothing could tend to give more stability and permanence to them than the effect of some of the principles laid down by him upon this subject in      he contended that the franchise election was a public trust and not a property which therefore the public had a right to resume without any pecuniary consideration if it be admitted that the principle contains an abstract truth no abstract proposition can be laid down tending to raise a stronger barrier against all attempts to get rid of the boroughs it precludes all treaty between the electors and all other persons interested in the thirtysix boroughs and the state and by alarming all the rest it must have united them in a much firmer combination in the general defense he likewise laid a further difficulty in the way of the measure arguing on the principles of those who consider the right of voting for a representative as a property he did not hesitate to declare that he would never agree to the purchasing from the majority of the electors the property of the whole new annual register      hist p       in requiring a perfect unanimity of the whole body of the electors of a borough the difficulty of obtaining a voluntary resignation of their elective powers was increased to the utmost and when in the same debate he honored with his particular approbation that principle which by a diminution of members for boroughs tended to increase the proportion of knights of the shire new annual register      hist p       one is a loss to conceive by what practical means he could give it effect nor unless he looked upon it as a political impossibility can this decided praise which he has given to the abstract principle be reconciled to his declaring afterward the outlines of a plan from which it was expressly excluded the best he had ever heard suggested upon the subject  the name of mr flood itself independent of this approbation will influence many in favor of this distinguishing part of his scheme and a great class of the supporters of the change become supporters of the continuance of the elective franchise of the boroughs  the qualified system however which he endeavored to introduce bore a nearer resemblance to that of the late lord chatham than he seemed disposed to admit the plan of that nobleman was to make an addition to the county representatives leaving the rotten boroughs as he expressed it to drop off by time mr flood proposed that the new representatives of counties should be elected by the resident householders the second article of lord chathams plan the leaving the boroughs in their present state he professed to retain and observes upon mr pitts scheme that to disfranchise them might be arbitrary but that to buy them out would be to build reform not on purity but corruption new annual register    0 hist p      from this account of the two debates on the change of the representation it does not seem certain from what passed at the first that the suppression of the smaller boroughs would have been carried into execution if the addition of county members had been consented to and in the second this part of the plan was not only deserted but treated with no very indirect censure  in the further support of this conclusion i shall bring forward the authority of another of the greater patrons of this revolution in the third estate who is to be understood as delivering the sentiments of that great body of men who have taken the lead in this measure and who have placed him at their head the evidence here to be produced is that of the rev mr wyvill late chairman of the committee of the yorkshire association in his defense of the reformers of england pages        0     0    when he speaks of the boroughs he is totally silent as to the suppression of any every thing that he says relating to them is confined to the liberation of the electors from the state of influence or even of subjection under which he states them to be brought by certain individuals and to these he likewise strongly urges the absolute necessity of resigning their usurpations the abolition of which he represents as the ultimate object of popular pursuit this amounts to an absolute disavowal of all the plans for their disfranchisement it also might be inferred that such a thorough measure would not meet his concurrence or that of the party of which he is the head from the principle he lays down that men do not attempt to correct what they wish to destroy he had given great praise indeed to the plan brought forward by mr pit in      but what he has said on each subject ought to be so construed that his declarations on both may be made to stand together this praise is general and such praise may always be supposed to be attended with the reserve of some particulars which a writer does not stop to specify or intentionally declines it his approbation is therefore to be understood to extend to the other parts of mr pitts plan exclusive of the disfranchisement of boroughs and so taken the appearance of contradiction stated here is done away  it results from the whole of this that no serious attempt will be probably made for the suppression of any of the smaller boroughs it is rather to be expected that at a future period a compromise may be offered between the spirit of alteration and borough influence perhaps by laying them a little more open that something may be gained to the former and something preserved to the latter  the measures to be pursued with respect to the boroughs are not without their consequence in determining what share of power each of the districts will have in the house of commons after a change of its constitution shall have been affected as will be shown in its proper place what they will probably in future be has been therefore here examined upon the authorities of leaders of parties it will be likewise shown further on that the plan of laying open the boroughs as far as it has any effect on this future balance of power will operate against the home district  it follows likewise from what has been already advanced that the home district ought so to act whenever this measure shall be attempted a third time as if no more was intended to be carried than what was moved for the second namely an addition to the number of county members only  a second great alteration in the constitution of the house by the plan of      was giving the franchise of election to some populous towns at present not represented it was calculated that the number of members so to be admitted would amount to about twentyeight now the remote district having increased in manufactures and population with much greater celerity than the home counties the number of towns in the former risen into the required degree of consequence bear a greater proportion to its magnitude than those of the latter and instances perhaps are there only to be sound of market towns rising into the magnitude of great cities and villages into that of populous towns hence the number of new members to be thus added to the remote district shall exceed that of the home district more than in the proportion of its magnitude or that of     to  00 the ratio of their landed capital the nearest approach to this proportion in integer numbers is by allotting seven members to the smaller district and twentyone to the larger which thus would acquire a majority of fourteen but the number of votes thus acquired by the remote district is less than the proportion assigned above points out and it has been shown that it ought to be greater and more probably the least acquisition of the latter might be taken at twentythree and of the former at five or the remote district acquire a new addition to its majority in the house on all territorial questions of eighteen voices  the last alteration these plans hold out is that of adding to the number of the county members and in this they both concur by the plan of mr pit this addition was to have been of seventytwo which were to have been allotted in such proportion to each county as the wisdom of parliament might prescribe new annual register      hist p    it may be here taken that the addition to be made to the number of members returned by each county would be such as to make its share in the representation proportioned as nearly as possible to its weight and importance in the scale of the general landed interest that is to the total value of such county itself and the present number of county members being ninetytwo and that of the proposed addition seventytwo the representatives of the landed interest would thus amount to one hundred and sixtyfour  now the value of the home and remote district being to each other as  0000 and       respectively the balance of power of those divisions in the lower house according to the present system and the proposed plan of alteration here considered is shown in the following comparative statement app art       number of members present plan of      expressed in the nearest whole numbers additions by the latter home district          remote district           majority of latter           by this plan the majority of the representatives of the landed interest of the home division would be increased from fortyfour to eightysix or very nearly doubled  but this majority would have received a further accession of strength by a disproportionate addition of new members for great towns if that part of the plan of      had ever been carried into execution for the majority of the members of the whole district would have received a further increase of fourteen votes or have now become fiftysix in the whole for the latter would have brought an augmentation of power to the landed interest of its proper district though perhaps not quite so certain and effective as an equal addition of representatives of counties  we shall find that the consequences of mr floods plan would have been in this respect very nearly the same and at the first view there is the appearance of total coincidence between both he proposed that the number of representatives should be increased one hundred and that they should be elected by the householders of the counties these are inhabitants of market towns and villages the latter are chiefly landlords and tenants with a few little tradesmen the former contain a greater number of tradesmen and artificers in tolerable circumstances but whose business chiefly depends upon the neighboring farmers or gentry here we see nothing but landed proprietors and electors of the two other descriptions either immediately or mediately dependent upon them the new class of members in both the great districts of the kingdom will be returned by the landed interest and be in all respects as much representatives of that interest as if the votes by which they are appointed had been given by men of landed property only hence if this scheme be carried into execution the number of representatives of the landed interest being increased by one hundred will become one hundred and ninetytwo and the number of members of both the great divisions of the kingdom by the new arrangement are to be taken as being made proportional to the value of estates in each according to the supposition laid down when the corresponding part of the scheme of      was under consideration and the comparative statement of the new and old representations of the two districts may be exhibited as follows app art       number of members by present system plan of    0 additions by latter remote district           home district          majority of former     00     by this plan the majority of the representatives of the landed interest of the remote district would be considerably more than doubled  this decrease of power of the landed interest of the home district in the commons is an unbalanced loss to be repaired by no probable circumstance if the power of sending members to parliament had been taken from or resigned by a number of the smaller boroughs part of those which would have been suppressed would undoubtedly have been situated in the remote district and thus this decrease of power would have been in some degree though inadequately counterbalanced but that idea which never appears to have been cordially taken up by the greater patrons of the change was soon avowedly deserted and even condemed and if it be now to be purposed that any alteration should take place in them it will only be in the number and description of their electors but whether measures for this purpose are to be embraced or not the consequences to result from the increase of the majority of the county members of the remote district will remain the same as if no change were made in such bodies or borough election for there is nothing in such alteration to counterbalance this increased majority if it have any feeble effect in this case it will act in concurrence with it  on account of the consequences which the continuance of the smaller boroughs will be attended with the probability of it has been considered at some length i therefore add this further observation only upon the subject those who are from principle alone friends to this alteration of the constitution will consent to their continuance under some modifications to diminish the opposition they must otherwise meet and those of the remote district who are patrons of it from local interests alone or jointly with other motives will concur with the former and this is additional evidence that a total disfranchisement of the smaller boroughs will not be attempted but let it be now admitted that it actually takes place and let its consequence in conjunction with an increase of the members for counties upon the proportion of power to the landed interest of the home district in the lower house be now examined  it has been before observed that it must be supposed that some or many of the boroughs to be suppressed are situated in the remote district thus some counterbalance to the increase of its majority will take place although it cannot be doubted that if a number of boroughs were suppressed in that district and their members added to the counties its landed interest in the house would be very much strengthened and its influence in every thing relating to charges upon land very much increased for the landed estates of county members upon an average very considerably exceed those of the representatives of boroughs they are therefore far more interested in all charges upon their own land and they will not only join with more unanimity in opposing them but they will individually exert their personal abilities with more energy and employ their more extensive interest with a more earnest diligence to the same end but let it be admitted that any number of them could be found disposed to sacrifice their immediate pecuniary interest to public justice or expediency they have another object at least of equal magnitude to surmount the private interest of all their constituents is directly against the increase of charge upon land with whom taken in the aggregate it is always public virtue not to give up a partial or total exemption from any general chage to resist the imposition of a new or the extension of an old tax it is a kind of local patriotism and the honors of this patriotism are acquired in villages by cheating the hundred for the good of the parish in the hundred by cheating the province in the province by defrauding the nation and in a nation by robbing the world in general and if any individual belonging to one of these societies endeavor to counteract these objects of public utitity he is looked upon as a betrayer of the public interest and a traitor hence if a county member of the remote district were to give his vote for the equalization of the land tax he might not only lose his seat but retire under no small load of popular odium many individuals may be found who have that regard for the general state that they will submit to burdens which they have the most probable expectations of being able to evade a sentiment which hardly ever discovers itself in great bodies of men among the reasons to be given for this is that here the blame of injustice rests upon the whole and no part of it separately attaches itself to any one in particular  and as charges on land are less expensive in general upon the representatives of boroughs their property in land upon an average not being nearly so large as that of members for counties so their constituents of the former are less interested in such charges than those of the latter it will even frequently happen that they are totally uninterested in the tax of the lands in their neighborhood or as by the imposition of such taxes they may expect to avoid future additions to their own their interest may be contrary to that of the district in which the borough is situated the members of many boroughs are therefore quite uninfluenced by the landed interest of the circumjacent country as far as respects the security of their seats and even where a member is effectively nominated by a single opulent landed man it is much more probable that he will leave him to act by his own discretion on this head than that he will so be left in this case by the landlords of a whole county for individuals are much more frequently determined by disinterested motives than numerous bodies of men  it follows from this that if a number of boroughs disfranchised and their members added to the landed interest increasing the number sent by both districts so as to render them proportional to their values the superiority of the remote district in the house will be very considerably increased  and if the privilege of voting for the members of the smaller boroughs be extended to the landowners of the circumjacent counties the representatives of every such borough will be more influenced by the landed interest than before and if all such boroughs be so laid open the remote district will acquire some further degree of superiority in the legislature which may not be inconsiderable and without danger to the home counties  what has been already said leads to a question the examination of which cannot properly be here declined that is how far the consequences resulting from this alteration have or have not been among the motives for the singular zeal and perseverance with which this object has been pursued of late years in certain parts of the kingdom  in the first place it may here be observed that it seems impossible that it could at any time have been the general motive of any great combination of men in any part of the kingdom for in that case the expected effect of the measure must have been as extensively known as the motive was general and its very publicity would have rendered its success impossible by alarming the home district against it whose concurrence in it its advocates might not only wish but otherwise expect to obtain beside the arguments by which it would be defended whatever superficial appearance of plausibility they might be dressed out with would appear to be nothing but the mockery of injustice it cannot therefore have possibly been the motive of the great exertions of communities at large  again the consequence pointed out cannot have been the motive of numerous committees in any part of england to have taken up such a measure for if it had been so it would have become matter of general notoriety nor is it to me credible there can be indiscriminately taken in any part of england out of any political party a numerous assembly of men of property and education as many of the committees for this purpose have been to whom any man or set of men would venture to propose the pursuit of such an end as has been described by such means  yet it appears extremely probable that the effect of this alteration to perpetuate the inequality of the land tax did not escape the attention of all persons who were interested in it however it might pass totally unheeded by a great body of those who actively concurred with them and even of their ostensible leaders and of these persons some might have contributed to give movement to this business and to support that unwearied spirit with which it has been persevered in and the general cicumstances of the case the county where and the peculiar time when the measures to carry this plan into execution were first set on foot are taken together no inconsiderable evidence of this at least it renders the contrary very difficult to conceive such was the persuasion at least which impressed itself upon me if a writer may state his individual conviction about the time of the intermission of the long persevering struggle of the party formed to effect this change in the constitution of parliament after the check it received by the defeat of       the first county which took up the alteration of the commons with zeal and system was that of york and indeed it is the only one which can be said to have done so this measure was entered upon at a general meeting of the freeholders in the year      how far the county was interested in this as a defensive measure is evident by a comparison of its actual and proportional charges to the land tax when the nominal rate of that tax is   s in the pound its actual charge on the home district is   s and   d app art   and on the county of york to    d its actual payment to the tax at the same nominal rate is l    0 but its charge on every tract of the home counties equal in rent amounts on an average to l     0 sec   table it is evident therefore upon an equalization of the land tax the charge upon the county of york would be very greatly increased and that it is much more deeply interested against a parliamentary reform of this abuse than any other county in england  therefore the probability here contended for receives all the support which can possibly be derived from the consideration of the place where the measure originated the evidence deducible from the time and circumstance of its being so taken up and of the great effort made some years after to carry it into execution is now to be brought forward  it has been shown before that apprehensions had always been entertained in the favored counties that an equalization of the tax was an event which would one day take place and these apprehensions were greatly increased in      the time when the association of the county of york was set on foot now in a former section of this tract many circumstances have been produced to prove that a considerable addition must be made to the land tax at a near period they were mostly written when the conclusion of a very prosperous peace was not esteemed to be so near as in fact it was found to be the necessity of that augmentation could not appear less in degree or more remote in distance during the despondency and misfortunes of the war of the colonies when enemy was superadded to enemy and when the county of york formed its association and every such appearance of necessity to increase the tax must increase the apprehension entertained by the favored counties and by that of york in particular their comparative exemption is approaching with speed to its end  but there were other causes then existing peculiar to that juncture to alarm the foresight of selfinterest and put it upon its guard circumstances sufficient to make an impression upon every mind had recently and strongly tended to draw the inequality of the tax to public attention it has been seen before that the resistance of the colonies to the claims of taxation was defended by dr franklin who might then have been properly called their minister in england by the injustice of the english parliament shown by this inequality that this injustice he frequently inveighed against maseres on lifeannuities p   0 this truly great man used always to quote the continuance of the land tax upon its present very unequal footing as a proof of the little regard that was had to justice and common sense in our national deliberations when it was objected to him that the correction of this inequality would be unjust to those who had purchased land upon a supposition of its continuance he replied with some quickness unjust yes it would be unjust for it would be doing but half of what strict justice requires which would be to create a counterinequality in the assessment of the land tax whereby the lands which had been heavily taxed should hereafter be taxed lightly and those which had been lightly taxed should hereafter be taxed heavily for the space of about fourscore years or for a time which should be equal to the time during which the present inequality has been permitted to continue truths derive effective weight and receive general currency from the greatness of the occasion on which they are laid down and the great consequences they are seen to draw after them and whatever gives a subsequent addition to the celebrity of the man who employs them with such effect tends more strongly at the instant to concentrate the general attentention to them and to excite alarm in those whose interests they oppose and in the beginning of      it was known that he had completed the dismemberment of the empire by his treaty with france and in the next the association of this county was formed from the political sentiments of the majority of its members he had many admirers and probably personal friends among them and no doubt can be entertained that his sentiments on this subject were sufficiently understood to several as therefore it was a period in which there was greater reason to expect a formidable attempt on their relative immunity from the tax than at any other preceding it the strongest probability indicates that there must have been some persons who urged on the association as an adequate defensive measure against it  if the circumstances which took place when this country made its great effort in      be examined the same conclusion results from them dr price writing in the beginning of      informs us that in      there had existed an excess of annual expenses of the nation above the receipt of l     0  part of this he states to have been temporary and he estimates the reduced deficit at l       postscript to state of public debt dated march         cadell p       we may suppose this state of the revenue to have been known and given full credit to by many members of that association of which his able defender the rev mr wyvill had long continued the head baron maseres one of the first calculators of the age and the friend of dr price in his very important work treating on revenues and debt had the year before affirmed that there was reason to apprehend that on the return of peace it would be necessary to add two millions a year to the land tax to make good the payment of the interest of the debt and acquire a surplus of a million or twelve hundred thousand pounds to be applied to its reduction on lifeannuities p     he dates the passage here extracted april      that is in case upon the return of peace we shall have a deficiency of revenue nearly of the same amount which was actually found to exist the state was then in the very situation he described in speaking of which he had added that it was highly fit to correct the inequality of the land tax  if the revenue had not recovered from this state of deficiency recourse must have been had to some very effective tax or set of taxes and there was sufficient probability that it must have been to the land tax to alarm those who were interested in it  this alarm must have been greatly increased by the singular decline of public credit in the following year      for the price of stock in that year so far from holding out any expectation of an amendment in our situation seemed to indicate that additional calamities were coming upon us with rapidity and that nothing less than the most ready and effectual aids could support us that year was marked by the average price of the   per cents stocks having fallen to the lowest point of depression which had ever been known in the whole period of their existence they had sunk nearly l  per cent below the average of the preceding unfortunate war their mean neat value in that year having been l  0  app art      and   per cent only even below the lowest year of that term and in march      their price in the market had been reduced to l   new annual register pub papers p   0 per cent  such was the situation of our finances and the apparent necessity of obtaining a great augmentation of revenue from some quarter by a very productive tax in the year      and the beginning of      when the yorkshire association exerted all its efforts to bring about what is called a reform now this measure being adapted to the purpose of continuing their comparative exemption from the land tax like a means to an end being pushed with great energy by the county most interested in flinging obstructions in the way of real reform that of substantial injustice and their strongest exertions having been twice made at a crisis when the most alarming danger threatened that exemption these circumstances combined render it credible that there are persons not ignorant of the consequences of an alteration of the constitution of the house of commons here described mixed with the general body of the friends of that plan in the remote district and who are not without influence in the direction of their measures  and there is nothing discoverable which diminishes the degree of this probability in the general inaction of this party in the remote district during the six years of great prosperity following the rejection of the bill of      which seemed to have removed the danger to an indefinite distance nor in the resumption of their operations with some little change of mode during the spring of last year when a war upon the continent was become certain in which there were grounds to conjecture that we might be sooner or later involved whereby their former danger might return upon them and perhaps increased in degree  i shall now address a few observations to both the districts drawn from what has preceded to the inhabitants of the home counties in general it may be said that as nature has given you disadvantages to struggle with your attention ought to be vigilantly employed that no addition be made to them that can be prevented nature in giving coalmines to your countrymen has rendered you tributary to them this unfortunate disparity in physical circumstances has diminished many of your manufactures and perhaps annihilated some and on account of the expense of fuel you are less able to support the competition of foreigners in those articles of export trade which remain to you the superiority you once possessed over the rest of the kingdom in foreign commerce has been lost above a century these misfortunes are derived from natural circumstances they will probably be as permanent as their cause and the inhabitants of the home counties must acquiesce under them  the same however cannot be said of that which is now to be stated the shipping in your ports has been so decreased that it requires half the augmentation of that of the rest of the kingdom to make up the loss and this shows not only a relative but an absolute decline and it does not seem that any natural cause can be produced for it it is a loss of which perhaps no second instance can be found to have taken place on the same extent of coast in any part of europe in natural advantages in skits in capital the maritime parts of this district are superior to many if not to most of these equal tracts this indicates the existence of some artificial cause by which this depression must have been greatly increased if not absolutely generaed and the only apparent cause of it is the inequality of the land tax which not only distresses these counties by its direct operation but by a circuitous effect transfers annually a great balance in specie into the more flourishing division of the kingdom in addition to the large yearly sum necessarily remitted thither for firing in the present state of the representation the latter cause of the depression of the home counties does not seem absolutely out of the reach of remedy i appeal to the apprehensions always entertained by the remote district on the subject of an equalization of the tax as a proof of it but their uniform determination to employ all their force to oppose it has been evident from the days of davenant to the present time by an alteration of the constitution of the third estate their majority of representatives of the landed interest will be doubled and if at this time under any pretense they be assisted by you in measures which will effect it you add to the will to oppress you in order to exonerate themselves a power to do it which you will never be able to resist and deprive yourselves of every future hope of palliating your natural disadvantages which though you may be unable to conquer your vigilance if duly exerted may diminish  with those among ourselves who call this alteration a reform i would argue thus  an equality of representation or a nearer approach to it if desirable is certainly desirable for some end it is to be considered as a means and not as a final object which is desirable of itself without looking any further if it be not an end or final object what is the end or object meant to be obtained by it you will answer that the public charges may be rendered the least possible that they be imposed with perfect equality upon every one of equal ability and proportionally upon persons of different abilities but it is evident the change for which you are such strenuous advocates will give new powers which may be employed to subvert these very ends these new powers will be by you entrusted to men whom experience shows to have been always leagued together to prevent your ends being carried into effect and when you have doubled their power to defeat them by your patriotic exertions you certainly will have made no alteration in their sentiments except that which an increase of strength always inspires the self deceits of interest gild over many a piece of base metal until it passes for fine gold from the crucible even in the opinion of the operator himself some semivoluntary deception like this i believe may have taken place in this business in the remote counties this is an everyday human infirmity which may be some apology for them but what shall be the apology for you sacrificing your own ends in the pursuit of means utterly subversive of them and of your immediate interest  by these plans some members are indeed added to the home counties but with your own hands you put a weight so much greater into the opposite scale that you effectively annihilate the power of the former and what is the interest of that power you labor to anihilate to destroy a gross system of inequality and disproportion the very professed end of your exertions what will be the use made of the power you labor so heartily to render superior to all opposition to apply the increase of strength you confer on it to perpetuate in practice and effect principles diametrically opposite to your avowed object and that upon a large and an increasing scale this must be the consequence of your ultimate success if you do not make the equalization of the tax a previous condition to your concurrence in what you call a reform  this attachment to proportion and certain beauties of abstract form induces you to endeavor to augment the number of the county members and that of the great towns and so far the master builders of constitutions in the remote district will assist you but at no inconsiderable expense for the land tax must be increased and you must pay double your proportion to the augmentation as you do to the present tax you wish in addition to disfranchise the maller boroughs here other reformers will conteract you and your magnificent design remain incomplete and this conduct of yours to make no small concession in its favor very much resembles that of many of the ialian nobility at the revival of architecture who began magnificent palaces which they were totally unable to complete but almost every one of them and their descendants has ever since had the gratification of starving in a building full of proportion and beauty as far as they were able to run it up but not quite covered in  what is further to be said will be addressed to the zealous advocates for a revolution in the house of commons belonging to the remote district and first as far as the subject will permit such a distinction to be preserved to those who push on the measure only on account of some analogy they suppose they discern in it to the spirit of the constitution who i am confident compose almost the whole of the party though this description does not absolutely extend to all  the success of your efforts will terminate in flinging into your hands a majority of the landed interest in the house of double its present amount it will then be absolutely in your power to continue to compel the home counties to pay in the double of the proportion you are charged at to the land tax and to assess them at the same rate in all the augmentations which must be hereafter made to it experience has taught you that you may with facility run into this abuse and if we refer to the whole course of that of the last century we shall find the disorder to have been hereditary and endemial and you should wish at once to get rid of it out of the country injustice is a more deformed local disease than an alpine goitre now this abuse you can previous to the great concessions you solicit being made to you put it out of your power to commit and you will still be able to attain by the grant every end you profess to seek and by thus removing all suspicion of a latent selfinterest mixing with it you will remove no inconsiderable obstacle to the acquisition of your object but if you refuse previously to place this injustice out of your reach in order to give facility to the acquisition of your object which in your opinion is great and no less than to carry the finest system of government a nation ever had the happiness to live under to a height of perfection and excellence even far above what it ever knew if to this end you refuse to sacrifice this power of abuse you clearly prefer the second to the first what distance there may be between such conduct and that of those whose original motive was the abuse and not the use of these additional powers i shall not attempt to determine it may be admitted to be considerable but it is not enough  beside it is to be observed that there is a repugnancy between the ultimate effect of this majority and the principle upon which it is declared to be sought which is that representation and contribution and the ability to contribute should be proportional now that effect will be to render the assessment by which the home district is doubletaxed permanent and to double the majority of representatives which that part of the landed interest now has which evades half its payments to the public charge you demand that a strict proportion should be established between representation and property and yet refuse to establish it between property and constitution we have heard much of test laws and those who will not comply with them are legally excluded from power the admission of this proposition in practice in its full effect is a test you must comply with before you can legally be admitted to an increase of power and it is required by a law the authority of which you will not venture to dispute it is the law of wisdom and of justice to put on an appearance of public principle solely to serve for a cover to the injustice of selfinterest is political hypocrisy of the worst kind and to those who shall come to discern the oppressive consequences of this measure to the home district after they have taken it up and yet persevere in it must be added that even to permit ourselves to be biassed by the seductions of the same motive to persevere in reducing a system into execution whose effects are discovered to be contrary to the better ends which induced us at first to embrace it cannot escape without the like reprehension however mitigated in degree  it has been repeatedly observed that if the principle of the old assessment be continued the charge of the home district above its proportion must increase with every increase of the tax and that the effect of the new system will be to render this increasing oppression inevitable the great majority of its patrons in the remote counties i make no doubt will join with every one who reveres the spirit of our own constitution in condeming much of the general system of the old government of france and much of the detail of its administration yet such abuses as these that system was adequate to the correction of and effected it they did not call it reform even under that government bad as it was to invent a new mode of fortification to cover old oppressions and to be able to extend them in france as well as in england parts of the provinces were aggrieved by being assessed above their proportion to the land tax it is not the absolute amounts of the tax in the two kingdoms which are here compared but their proportionality to the values of lands taxed only mr neckar has given us the mode in which a remedy was applied to these inequalities i think it was put in practice in upper guyenne a valuation was made of the lands a number of districts which were generally admitted to be taxed at the average rate and as the first step to an equalization it was permitted to any district the inhabitants of which supposed their lands to be taxed one third more than that rate to have them surveyed at their own expense and if the measure of the excess was found to be of that magnitude the whole of it was remitted and the deficiency of the tax made up by a small additional levy upon the province the greater inequalities being thus remedied the same redress was extended as a second step in the operation to all those divisions whose charge exceeded their due proportion by one fourth and lastly all those places were relieved in the same mode who thought the amount of the abatement they would be entitled to equal to the expense of a survey and valuation neckar english translation v   p     from an abridged account a comparison of the measure of these inequalities with that of the english land tax will not be an improper addition to this account now the average excess of the charge of the home district in england is much greater than the limit of the highest class of unequal assessments in this province for the average real rate of the tax in this kingdom is here the proper standard of comparison and corresponds to the fixed charge found in france by the first valuation which was made the standard of comparison there now that average in england is one shilling and three pence three farthings       pence in the pound see section   tale  and one third of this rate is   d      pence corresponding to the smaller limit of the disparity of charge of the most oppressed class of the landlords in this part of france but the measure of that disparity in the home district of england is   d      pence in the pound therefore the mean excess of charge of that district is to the lower limit of the most oppressed district in this part of france as      to      or as     0 to  0000 or something more than nine to five in this transaction the french adopted the idea of a graduated scale on which they marked the different measures of oppression arising from the inequality of the land tax with the purpose of applying a remedy to each successively according to its degree and in its construction it resembled in principle that of a thermometer for the fixed point or that of absolute equality of contribution was the zero from which the comparative degrees of oppression or injustice began to be estimated we have seen that in the home district of england its mean degree would fall nearly twice as high as the lower limit of extreme disparity in france and if the degrees of oppression in england were marked on a scale by similar graduation as one half must fall below that mean point so by the very nature of an average the other half in number and amount must fall above it the evils of the old french constitution and even this evil while it subsisted certainly deserved condemnation but it becomes not the mouth of those who persist in measures whose effects promote the continuance and perhaps the extension of greater its appearance it is true was dark but when placed upon a ground so much darker its color seems to assume a different character  i do not find in the account i follow that any opposition was made by the favored districts against carrying this fair measure into execution although the sufferers could not add to the principles of universal equity on which they applied for relief a second claim to justice and the promptest justice that could be rendered them drawn from the particular circumstances affecting both parties they could not as the proprietors of lands in the home counties produce historical proofs that the inequality of the tax had been a necessary relief to their countrymen at the formation of the original assessment who then labored under great difficulties and distress a sect which has been shown in the history of the english tax and then appeal to the united principles of gratitude justice and of honor to be freed from a burden their humanity had been instrumental in imposing upon them now the reason had so long ceased  the lightest censure with which any of these schemes for alteration can be dismissed is that it is a refinement totally useless if it fail in the ends for which it is recommended to us and one great end must be to bring about a proportional division of all public burdens particularly contributions to the public service it is otherwise at best a parade of design and accuracy without use a great movement without a motive but it is to those who make use of these wellsounding maxims as pretenses to screen other motives which it is not so convenient to avow that the remainder of this observation and that which follows it are directed  when changes of this kind are called for planned to fortify old abuses with new strength and sting into the hands of those who have always supported them powers to add to their weight men feel themselves insulted as well as injured they see that the realities of public principle and justice are sacrificed to the mockery of proportion and speculative equality and that a system called by the name of a reform under a delusive pretense of strengthening public liberty and putting a necessary weight into the popular scale slips at clandestinely into that of inequality and oppression already more loaded than a decent selfishness would wish but the present example of a neighboring nation and that of our own in the middle of the last century show that the selfishness which hypocrisy has taught to wear the mask of patriotism strides over all ordinary bounds  it is not only justice that suffers thus the spirit of liberty itself suffers with it great and good principles which have taken deep root in the character of a nation are most liable to be destroyed by abuse by being practiced upon by an insidious policy for its own crooked ends and being excited to the wildness and folly of fanaticism for every great principle has both its fanatics real and hypocritical and its fanaticism instead of a fire regularly and fully fed it may be kindled into a conflagration which destroys every thing in its neighborhood devours its own magazines and amidst the ruin which it spreads round hardly a spark may be found to survive covered up in the embers our history in the last century furnished more than one example of this and it will be the happiness of the present if our posterity has to recur so far back as to that period for such domestic instances in the reign of charles i the principle of loyalty had been overstrained to serve the purposes of the court when the civil war and all its calamities might have been prevented by its constitutional exertions it was found to be too much exhausted  the spirit of liberty whose increase at first was necessary to oppose the overgrown and formidable prerogatives of the crown ran into a contemptible and wild enthusiasm by its extravagances it almost lost all hold of the affections of the people and at the return of charles ii the virtue of his minister prevented parliament from making an entire sacrifice of the national freedom by conferring upon the sovereign a fixed revenue which would have made him for ever independent of that assembly the sobriety of manners and serious attachment to religion which so honorably distinguished the english in the beginning of the century had been very generally debased during the civil wars into a puritanical hypocrisy and at the restoration public decency appeared almost swept away by a torrent of profligacy and irreligion here it is seen that the same physical law seems to affect society to which individuals are subjected immoderate elevation proceeds and causes a depression in an equal degree or to make use of the language of medicine a state of excitation is constantly followed by a state of collapse the spirit of liberty should always be vigilantly preserved in a full and regulated degree but when it is artificially stimulated into fanaticism to serve mean and oppressive purposes the contempt with which the end only ought to be surveyed becomes with the generality of mankind attached to the instrument employed to bring it about and the meaner the motives an ostentatious affectation of it is made a screen to the more it will be degraded in the general opinion the national attachment to liberty is in danger enough from the abuse of its name to carry on purposes inimical to the regulations and existence of civil society and if it be further perverted to procure the creation of new powers to protect a lucrative system of injustice and to add more weight to its oppression it may be pronounced that its extinction is not far distant  one very important question on this subject still remains to be discussed and that is how will the interest of the public creditors and the whole class of men whose income is derived from the profit of stock be affected by the landed interest of the remote counties acquiring an additional power in the house of commons  by the plans for this alteration here examined the weight of the landed interest in the house will be greatly increased if seventytwo members for counties were substituted instead of the same number for boroughs its weight will be very considerably augmented although twentyeight members were admitted for the more populous unrepresented towns  but there is no occasion to employ much consideration upon this as the plan for the absolute suppression of boroughs seems abandoned if they be left in their present state and any number of members be added to the counties the addition to the landed interest in the house will diminish the relative importance of that of the other two  the mercantile and the monied men if the mode of election in boroughs be changed by admitting more of their inhabitants to have votes it will not tend to counterbalance the increase of weight the landed interest will acquire as above but if that change be made by admitting the inhabitants of the circumjacent country of any description to votes in a borough it will give some further superiority to the landed interest  by the equalization of the land tax such an addition may be made to the applicable sinking fund that it will very soon by its own operation become what has been called in this essay an adequate fund it has been shown to be the property of that fund that while it is applied to the extinction of capital a debt ceases to increase periodically or the additions made to it in every war are paid off in peace by the operations of such a fund it is evident that the price of stock would be supported both in peace and war at a rate much higher than at present can permanently take place hence the value of the funded income of that great body of the public creditors the proprietors of the   per cent stocks and the irredeemable annuities will be very greatly increased while the interest of capitals in trade will be reduced and that great class of men will be benefited by some moderate increase of profit and by a new facility of obtaining capital whenever an opportunity of employing a greater to advantage presents itself  these are the consequences of a revenue acquired by an equalization of the tax so applied it is the only apparent anchor of the national hope justice demands it from the landed proprietors of the remote district they themselves will be great sharers of the benefit which the public may thus receive from it and so far the expense of their sacrifice will be lessened but i think an enlightened attachment to the good of their country ought to make them preserve it for this purpose to give it up on no other condition  but if before the equalization be obtained the commercial interest and the public creditors concur in any plan for the alteration of the representation which adds to the majority of the members of the remote district in the house of commons they render it apparently impossible and destroy the foundation of their best hopes no bodies of men exist whose interest at this juncture should lead them more strongly to oppose the alteration of the constitution of the commons than the inhabitants of our commercial cities and towns both in the home and remote district together with the great majority of our public creditors and perhaps it would be difficult to fix upon a measure which it was more their interest to unite all their strength against  finis corrections page   l   for district read districts p   l    and note l   after own and matter insert p

but it is founded on an assumption so gross and illadapted to the purpose that its result is not to be set against that of dr halley as confirmed by concurring authorities he makes the contents of the kingdom to exceed by a small quantity    ms grew in philos trans ubi supra of acres by some mode of proceeding equally erroneous sir william petty reduces that amount to    ms grew in philos trans ubi supra but the mean of these extreme estimates is    ms and it tends as far as such a mean can be evidence to confirm the account of dr halley who observes that in his time the best maps did not agree to a million or two of acres    it appears from this table of the contents of the several counties that the home district contains      ms and the remote districts       ms of acres and the contents of the former being taken as  0000 those of the latter will be as          it was observed above that some exceptions may be taken against the mechanical approximations used by dr halley in assigning the contents of the counties which must be allowed to have their weight in determining the proportion of two small counties by this mode an error of some consideration may arise but this will not sensibly affect the truth of the conclusion given above for if the contents of two small tracts of land containing two such counties each be compared together the error in their proportion will be less than in the comparison of such counties single and if there be     or   such counties comprised in each district it will become insignificant and the result may be taken as true to all practical purposes in like manner in determining the area of a single county if it be very large the probability of error will be reduced in proportion to its size in increasing the number of counties in each district we approach nearer and nearer to absolute truth in these proportions in the same manner and for the same reasons as in multiplying the number of astronomical observations to obtain a correct average its error decreases rapidly as their number increases and it soon arrives at the greatest degree of accuracy that can possibly be required in use    we are now to endeavor to determine as near as may be the proportion which the rents of the two districts bear to each other    if their rent be taken to be as the total number of acres in each it is evident that the remote division will be estimated considerably too high    but it must be admitted that this district has increased in riches with more celerity than the rest of the kingdom the number of its inhabitants likewise exceeds that of the home counties in a considerably greater degree than it did a century ago it is not assumed here that an actual increase of the number of the people in either of these districts has taken place since the revolution i am not entering the lists with the sturdy advocates for depopulation if the number of inhabitants of the remote district have continued the same while those of the home counties have decreased or if the former have decreased with any assignable degree of celerity and the latter with a greater what is laid down in the text remains true being therefore relatively increased in wealth and population it follows that if the value of the two districts be taken as their respective number of inhabitants in    0 that of the remote district in this second mode will be estimated considerably too low therefore let it be here assumed that the error of excess in that value determined in the first mode is nearly equal to that of defect in the second and that the mean of both approaches very near to the true value    the proportion of the population of these districts in    0 is now to be found and this may be done from that valuable account of the number of houses in each county given by dr davenant from the hearth books davenant v   p    it is from this table that the number of houses and the land tax of each county are constantly taken in these computations    0 it is necessary in this computation to leave out the number of houses contained in london as the land tax of that city will not be brought to account in the estimate of the payment of the home district     the number of houses in the county of middlesex exclusive of london is not separately given in the account referred to but it must have nearly borne that proportion to the number of acres it contains which took place at that time between the quantity of land and number of houses in the counties of essex kent surrey and hertford taken together they being contiguous to it and in other circumstances similarly situated now the contents of the four counties are      ms of acres and the number of houses        whence the number of acres in middlesex being    000 the proportional number of houses to be assigned to that county is  0     to avoid a repetition of the steps of this process in another place i add here that the land tax of the   counties being l    0  that of middlesex exclusive of london is found by the same method to be l           the number of houses of the   remaining counties of the home district were   0    and those of the whole division     0  the number in the remote district by the same table was        hence by the second supposition the value of the two districts is as those numbers respectively or that of the home district being taken as  0000 that of the remote district appears to be as           it was shown above that if their proportional values be taken at the quantity of land in each they will be as  0000 and       respectively and it was also assumed that the error of excess in the proportion of the remote counties by that mode of estimation is nearly equal to the error of defect in this and therefore that the mean of the two is very near the truth thus the value of the home district is to that of the remote as  0000 to       nearly and to that of the whole kingdom as  0000 to           to confirm this conclusion the proportion of the rents of the two districts are now to be determined in another mode both of them contain many and considerable uncultivated tracts of land and as profitable land is the only subject of taxation in order to determine how far the land tax upon each is proportioned to its value or rent the profitable land in each district ought to be known upon the authority of mr young the land in cultivation in the whole kingdom is here taken at    ms chalmers p     of acres and thus the quantity of land at present lying waste in both districts amounts to      ms of acres but i have discovered no direct authority to determine the quantity of profitable land in either it is therefore here assumed as an hypothesis that if of a tract in the home district of a given magnitude a certain number of acres upon an average ought to be allowed as waste land and in the same quantity in the remote district treble of that allowance and deduction be upon an average made the value of equal proportions of land of the two remainders will upon the average be equal from this assumption it follows that nearly    th of the whole or      acres in every  00000 is to be taken as uncultivated land and in the remote division   0   acres in every equal tract or nearly    ths of the whole the waste land in the home district will then amount to     00 acres and the profitable land to      ms of acres and in the remote district the uncultivated land will be   0  ms and the land under cultivation       ms of acres making the quantity of cultivated land in both   000 ms of acres as above     hence the value of the home district being taken as  00000 that of the remote district will be as   000  and of the whole kingdom as   000  for      ms is to       ms as  00000 is to   000  by the former process it had been found that taking the value of the home district as  0000 that of the remote division is as       and of the whole kingdom as       which conclusions agree sufficiently well     if the proportion of waste land in equal tracts davenant v   p    in the home and remote districts had been taken as unity and four respectively then every  00000 acres in the home division would have been found to contain    0 acres of waste and in the remote district       and the value of the former district being taken as  0000 that of the latter will be       which agrees still nearer with the result of the first process     the sums actually paid on account of this tax by the two districts and their proportional charges are now to be compared davenant v   p    davenant has given the produce of every county to the first  shilling aid granted in the  th year of william and mary the variations which have since taken place are too minute to be considered here it appears from his table that the charge upon the home counties london and middlesex being excluded was l       the sum paid by that county exclusive of london was before shown to be nearly l      the amount of the land tax for the home counties is therefore l       which sum as appears above is to the proportional charge upon the remote district as  0000 to       the proportional charge upon that district is therefore l 0   00 nearly exceeding its actual payment l 0      davenant v   p    by l 0       article ii a comparison of the burden which the proportional payment to the tax would at present be upon the remote district and that of its actual charge upon it at the imposition of the tax in      the nominal rate of the tax being at   shillings in the pound   when the proportion of the tax to the rent remains fixed the burden continues the same although the cotemporary amounts of the rent and tax vary in any assignable manner    to determine the amount of the tax which in the year      would be equal in its burden on the remote district to that paid in      the proportion of its rents in those two years must be found and this may be very well taken to be the same as that of the cotemporary amounts of the entire national rent hence the rents of the land of england for the years      and      are first to be sought thus mr king made the aggregate of all these rents of estates real    ms pounds for personal estates chargeable also to the land tax he added one million more stating the total so chargeable at    ms pounds davenant v   p     this latter sum davenant mistook for the national rent of      and gives it as such p     but instances of considerable error are not unusual in that writer this has been copied from him by the generality of authors since these are to be derived from the rents of the years      and      which have been ascertained with more accuracy than those of any other terms in the former the rent of the land of england or the rent of superior conditions was stated by mr king the best political arithmetician this kingdom has ever produced at  0 millions and those of buildings mines and other hereditaments being rents of inferior condition at   millions it is evident by his estimate of the amount of the landed capital as preserved by davenant that he rated the value of these inferior rents as equal to that of a landed income of   millions of superior condition this point has been carefully examined the several elements he made use of and the results he obtained from them are to be found scattered in separate essays of davenant but without any reference to the process of which they are a part a proof of this position is much too long to be given here i shall add however a circumstance which i think tended to determine him to take the value of the   species of real income in the proportion of   to   i have been informed that in the assessinents of parishes lord chief justice hale directed lands to be laid at   ths of the rackrent and buildings at onehalf and such a rate so formed was confirmed by lord mansfield in the case of k and brograve m  0 g iii now   ths is to  half as   to   it was possibly upon the authority of hale that mr king adopted this proportion of the value of equal rents from land and buildings without land and took it as holding true of other rents of inferior condition this opinion would have great weight with him as sir matthew hale had applied himself to political arithmetic as appears by the observations he has left upon population he died in      the work referred to was published      chalmers p     and upon that subject mr king must have considered him as his immediate predecessor the value of such rents being thus reduced in the market for income upon account of the inferior nature of the subject from whence they result hence the whole rent being in value equal to    millions a year in land ought to be taxed as an income of    millions is only    in the year      mr young estimated the rents of land or those of superior condition at l     ms and the rents of inferior condition as buildings etc at l    ms chalmers p     from the latter sum      ms or   d is to be subtracted as before and the remainder l      ms will be the equivalent income of superior condition the taxable rent was therefore       ms    from these rents of      and      thus reduced to a proper form those of the years      and      are to be determined in order to this let it be admitted that in the whole interval from      to      or during    years that equal rents upon an average increased equal sums in equal times or which is the consequence thereof that the national rent increased at any equal rate per cent annually that rate is now to be sought the rent of      l   000 ms multiplied by       is equal to l      ms that of      now there intervened    years between those terms and  00    raised to the   th power is equal to       hence the annual average augment of rent for that term was l 0    or nearly per cent from      to      there elapsed   years and the rent being supposed to have increased annually in the ratio assigned above became in the year      l   000 ms x  00     000 x  0    l       ms in like manner from the year      to the year      there elapsed    years and the rent of the year      is equal to l       ms x  00      l      ms x    0  l   0   ms now it is evident considered in every point of view that the improvements of the remote districts have advanced with greater celerity than those of the rest of the kingdom and the increase of rent from the natural connection between general improvement and the improvement of land has gone on in the same manner hence the rents of that district have increased with a greater rate of celerity than the total national rent but let them be taken by the assumption laid down above to have increased only in the same proportion then the rent of that division in      being taken as       that of      is as   0   its land tax in      was l  0      and it will be as       is to   0   so is l  0      to l      00 and these two sums being as the rents of the home district in the years      and      the burden of the former upon the landlords in      was equal to what the burden of the latter would be upon the landlords in      if their charge to the land tax were to amount to the latter sum    it has been seen before that the tax which ought to be paid by the remote district in proportion to the actual charge of the home division is l  0    ms app art i    which is l    00 a year less than the sum assigned above as the present charge of the land tax is equal in burden to the original payment  article iii on the proportional and actual charges of the land tax on the county of york its nominal rate being four shillings in the pound   in dr halleys table the county of york is stated to contain     ms of acres and the contents of the home district being nearly      ms app art i   of acres estimating the value of each thereby the latter is to the former as  0000 to      the proportion of their values is now to be assigned according to the population of these two tracts in    0 the home district contained     00 app art i    houses and the county of york    0   davenant v   p    therefore the value of the former being assumed as  0000 that of the latter derived from this second assumption appears to be as   0  but taking the arithmetic mean of these results as before those values will be as  0000 and  0   respectively hence the actual payment of the home district to the land tax being l       app art i    that of the county of york ought proportionally to be l      0 the actual payment of the county is l    0 which is l     00 less than that proportional payment hence the average charge of the tax upon an income from land of any given amount in the home counties is to that on an equal income in the county of york as  0000 to      or the owners of land there are acquitted for the payment of little more than   d of their equitable contributions and for every l  0000 paid by the county to this tax their proportional charge is on an average l        article iv on the balance of payment between the two districts as affected by the inequality of the land tax its nominal rate being four shillings in the pound the land tax of the home district excluding the metropolis being l      0 app art i    and that of the remote district l  0   00 devenant v   p    the total provincial land tax is l    0  0 suppose now the annual expenses of the government in the provinces for the payment of public annuitants services for commodities etc to amount to this sum and no more and in each district to be in proportion to the value of the lands that of the home division being as  0000 the remote as       app art i    the value of the two taken together will be as       therefore as       the number proportional to the value of both districts is to l    0  0 the money so returned into both so is       the number proportional to the value of the greater division to l     000 the sum remitted thither by government and the difference of these sums l  0  00 will be the money flowing back into the home division on the same accounts but their charge to the tax being l      0 the difference of their payment thereto and the money returning to them annually is l      0 this sum constitutes an effective balance of payment against them in favor of the other division being the excess of the money the latter received back above the charge of the tax to them  article v on the number of members to be returned to the house of commons in future from the counties of the remote district according to certain proposed alterations in its constitution   by the plan for the change of the constitution of the house of commons brought forward in      the number of the members for counties was to have been increased by    and it would thus have amounted to     it is taken here as granted that this plan if carried into execution will be effected by so increasing the number of representatives for each county that it will become as nearly as possible proportional to its value and although for a single county we cannot approach nearer that proportion than its next integer number yet if many counties be taken as forming a large district the new number of members to be allotted to it taken collectively may be made to be extremely nearly proportional to the aggregate value of the district formed by them hence the total number of county members now to represent the remote division the value of which somewhat exceeds   ths of the whole lands of the kingdom might and would by the new arrangement be made very accurately proportional to that value now the value of the lands of the kingdom being as       and of the remote district as       art i    and the total number of the representatives of counties by this plan being     the number to be sent by that district shall be   x                        by mr floods plan the addition to the number of representatives of counties was to have been  00 if it be followed the number of county members in the house will

   0  a detailed account of the authorities on which this table is founded would be much too long for this place the average actual amount of the tax in each term of war and peace together with the nominal rates are here assigned after an accurate examination and comparison of the data to be found in the authors named in the margin davenant postlewayte in his history of the revenue dr price and sir john sinclair the first and last of the periodical charges are she only articles of the table here treated on it was not drawn out on this occasion but i have chosen to give it entire and unmutilated as it shows the progressive amounts of the tax the several sums include the expenses of collection    the nature and determination of the amounts in the third greater column called the periodical average charge or of the smaller column which follows it being the same average of the nominal rate of the tax require an explanation the former being the bases of the calculation now to be entered upon    the periodical average either of the actual charge or nominal rate of the tax for any term as for instance that of the peace of      is found in this same manner that is by multiplying the annual average payment or rate of the term by the mean length of a term of peace and that annual payment or rate during the preceding war by the mean number of years in a term of war and dividing the sum of the products by the number of years comprehended in one period consisting of a term of war and a term of peace each of the mean length this may be illustrated in the instance of the nominal rate of the tax for the term mentioned above during the peace of      this rate was at two shillings and sixpence in the pound and taking the mean length of a term of peace at  0 years which though not accurately true as will be seen hereafter is near enough for the present purpose which is that of mere illustration the product formed by the multiplication of the rate and the term will be    shillings again the constant nominal rate of the tax in the war of      which immediately preceded this peace was   shillings in the pound and taking the mean duration of war at   years which is likewise near enough to the truth the product will be   s and the sum of the product   s the sum of the length of the two terms is    years by which dividing the sum of the products the average nominal rate for the whole period determined on the above assumptions is  s and   pence and by a similar process the periodical charge for the whole period may be determined    and supposing the average length of peace and war duly assigned above as they are sufficiently nearly for the purposes of illustration it is evident that this is the nominal rate at which the charge of the tax upon land ought to have been then allowed in all treaties of bargain and sale at that time for its true charge upon any estate could not be estimated for the future at either the one or the other rate the one being too great and the other too small but by a mean properly taken between both    amounts thus calculated for each term of peace and war ought to be reckoned according to the equality of chance the true average charge of the tax upon the kingdom at that time the accidental excess of one period being always compensated with an accidental alleviation at another    the average length of a war is very nearly   years and of a term of peace  0 for the sum of the lengths of our five great wars since the revolution was exactly    years computed from the month in which they effectively commenced to that in which they effectively terminated and if the peace of utrecht had continued uninterrupted until the commencement of the war of      the length of the   intermediate terms of peace would have been    years and   months but the rebellion in      and the petty hostilities with spain in           and      may be taken together as adding   years to the duration of the   wars and increasing the number of terms by the fraction one half thus the total number of years of war are    equal to the duration of   terms and the mean length of a war is     years to be taken at   years the number of years of peace is reduced to    years and   th or   months the number of terms increased by a half becomes   and the mean length of a term of peace  0    to be taken at  0 years now    years being the distance from the commencement of one term of peace to that of the following is here called a period and the averages of the land tax for    years are named periodical averages    but during the first year of every peace the land tax has always been continued at   shillings in the pound or at the rate of the preceding war it is therefore effectively with respect to the tax a year of war wherefore in the table the terms of the duration of the tax in war and peace are taken as having been equal this accidental circumstance of their equality is purposely neglected in the illustration given in       the periodical charge of the tax during the peace of riswyck is stated in the table at l      ms and its nominal rate at  s and  d in the pound the middle of that term fell in the beginning of the year   00 we are to find what was the charge of the tax upon the whole kingdom in that year exclusive of london and hence determine what it would amount to in the present year written dec      upon a supposition that it had increased during the whole of this century with the same celerity as the rent the land tax of london and middlesex at  s in the pound is l  0   0 davenant v   p    and that of middlesex l       as above app art      the tax upon london therefore amounts to l        at  s in the pound and at  s and  d the periodical rate in   00 to l   0    and that of the provinces to l            this charge is to be supposed to have increased with the same celerity as the rent or l   at the end of one year to be increased to l  00    app art     at the end of    years it will become l  00      l       and the whole tax on the counties      x l      ms l     0 ms   0 the periodical and actual land tax of great britain at this time is l  0    ms the rate   shillings in the pound that of scotland l 00   ms of london l 0     ms and that of the counties l      0 ms now this charge falls short of the sum found above to be proportional to the rise of rents in the first    years of this century by l    000 the remote district now pays l  0    ms annually less than its due proportion according to the present constant rate of the tax and if the proprietors thereof were to take this augmentation entirely upon themselves that defalcation would still continue to be l     00 a year     it may be contended against the whole of what is here laid down that in treaties for the sale of land this periodical average never comes into consideration that it never has been even eventually the actual measure of the charge for any real period of war and peace and in fine that it is an amount never considered in speculation and which never becomes the actual measure of the charge in fact to this it is answered that for the reason given above section iv of this article the charge of no one year in particular either of war or peace or the average of no one term of either can be assumed as the constant measure of this charge therefore an average is to be taken in some other manner which must be such as upon the equality of chance will approach nearest to the truth and this is the property of the periodical average above assigned this certainly is not necessarily the real or eventual average and perhaps not that most frequently adopted in treaties or the speculative average but it is notwithstanding the probable average and as such ought to supersede the other two in use any mean taken in any other manner must in long terms be found erroneous and this is generally true of the mean taken from the actual length of two assigned successive terms of war and peace     but let the actual average of the war of the revolution and the following peace be now made the basis of computation as the proper periodical average and it will be found that the conclusion before derived is not invalidated thereby the mean annual amount of the tax which was paid for   years in the war of the revolution was l      ms the sum of the   nominal rates   s that of the  st year having been  s in the pound in the following peace which continued   years its amount was l       ms and the sum of the   rates was   s therefore the actual mean payment of these  0 years for all england was l   0   ms and the mean nominal rate   shillings    0 the tax of london was l 0     ms and the charge on the remainder of the kingdom l       ms which augmented as before in the proportion of       to unity gives l       ms as the amount of a land tax which in      would be equal in burden to the average payment of the counties in   00 exclusive of london the advance upon the counties thus found is l  0    ms and the defalcation of the remote district being l  0    if the whole of that advance were levied upon them their payments would become very nearly proportional to that of the home division the difference of these sums being l    00 a year only  article vii on the charge of the land tax at the nominal rate of four shillings in the pound and of the general taxes separately and conjointly on the owners of land in the two districts   the amount of the taxes of england the land tax excluded is first to be shown and as these taxes may fall on the whole society in general they are here called the general taxes we are next to enquire what part thereof is paid by income from land the fund for the payment of all taxes being income of some kind or other that part being found its charge upon the two districts severally will be determined and the general taxes paid by each its payments to the land tax which falls on landed income alone being added the total tax of the landlords of each district will be obtained and its proportion to their respective incomes may be assigned moreover if we compute the absolute rent of each district the sum of the general taxes the land tax and the total of both being before found the charge of each of these in the pound in both divisions will be found likewise    the taxes of england exclusive of that on land are here given from the account of the national income for the year ending at lady day      sinclair v   p   0 the articles of that account fall under two heads proper taxes and money derived from other sources in the statement here followed impressed money and arrears of taxes are given in one article and their joint amount is l        the former is a saving from money allotted before to specific purposes it forms no part of the taxes paid in this year but not having authority upon which to settle its amount it is taken equal to the arrears of taxes of preceding years paid in during the year comprehended in the account half this compounded sum is therefore struck off but the other half is carried to the general total to balance such part of the taxes of the year as are not paid in until the next and therefore do not appear in their proper places the profit of the lottery is likewise struck out of the account it is not a part of the general taxes though an annual resource of

the two districts separately let the nation be supposed to be divided into two great classes the first eriving their income from the rent of land and the econd from all other sources that the income of many individuals is mixed will not affect the truth of the conclusion sought let it also be assumed that the charge of the general taxes upon each class will be as its total expenditure which is to be taken to be in the same proportion to its gross income in each and lastly let it be also admitted that the total income of the district bears the same proportion to the total income of the nation which was determined by mr king to obtain in      i find that the application of the calculations and results of mr king frequently made in this tract is justified by the uniform practice of those who have treated on subjects similar to this because they were interwoven in the body of davenants works they are frequently referred to as his and postlethwayt speaking of them as such says the quantities are since no doubt considerably increased but as most probably the proportion remains very little nearly unaltered it is fair to argue upon them as has been done by the best writers upon these subjects dictionary article landed interest column  th line  th edition  d      of the great comparative authority of what mr king has left us mention has been before made app art i       the actual income of the two districts in      must therefore be assigned when it was before enquired what proportion of the tax the remote district could equitably pay the selling value of the estates in each or the rent of estates of equal value in land or of the best condition was taken as the proper measure by which to estimate that ability the estates of inferior condition as buildings and mines being reduced to landed income of equal value but here the question is what is actually paid from incomes of estates real of all qualities all being equally assessed without regarding that better or worse condition but their amount only for the comparison is now actual income and actual taxes the income of all the estates real in the kingdom in      was    millions and of buildings two millions now from this amount the rent of london is to be deducted which being taken in that year at one million a very considerable part of the general taxes of the city of london is paid directly out of the income of the landed gentry constantly or occasionally residing there and it duly corresponds to the rents of all the houses they occupy by the year or for shorter terms and it does not appear that the clear income of estates in london in      is taken too low consideration being had of this circumstance leaves the income of both the districts    millions    the total national income being as l       ms its absolute amount in      the present amount of the general taxes l       ms and the provincial rent as l   000 ms its absolute amount at the revolution the general taxes upon that income at this time will by the assumption be a fourth proportional to those three numbers or l      the sum paid thereto out of the income of estates real in both districts    that paid by each comes next to be determined and it will be directly proportioned to the income of each respectively now the incomes of superior and inferior conditions will be mixed very nearly in the same proportion in the two districts and the sums of each in each district will be as the selling value of that district whence the sum of the rents of both being taken as       that of the remote district will be as       app art      and the general taxes of both conjointly being equal to l      ms by taking a fourth proportional to these   numbers their charge on the income of the remote district is found to be l       ms and on that of the home district at l 000     the last object of this part of our enquiry is the total total taxes paid out of the landed income of each district separately and the proportion of those payments to each other  districts home remote l ms l ms general taxes  000        land tax 0      0    total taxes          0     now it shall be as l       ms the total tax upon home district is to  0000 so is l    0  ms the sum paid by the proprietors of land in the remote district to     0 therefore the sum of the taxes upon the home district being taken as  0000 their charge on the remote district will be as     0 but the rent of the home district being taken as  0000 that of the remote division is as       and the total charge of the taxes paid by the owners of the land of each ought to be in that proportion hence the actual taxes on landed income in the remote district is to their proportional and equitable amount as     0 to       or when the sum of their payments to the taxes is l  0000 their charge ought to be l         0 the total sum levied by taxes on the remote district is l    0  ms but to render it proportional to the charge on the home district it must be increased to l       ms the difference of these sums or the defalcation of the landowners of this division in their payment of the taxes is thus found to be l  0    ms being that of their payment to the land tax which had been before determined to be l  0    ms the difference l  00 arises from all places of figures after the  th being entirely neglected in these operations     the charge in the pound of the land tax the general taxes and both conjointly upon the income of land in each of the two districts and their averages on the income of all provincial estates are lastly to be determined     the rents of the two districts are to be first sought in the year      mr young found the income from the estates real to amount to l    00 ms chalmers p     from this sum if   millions be deducted for the rent of london mr young following mr king without variation states the rent of buildings in the whole kingdom at   millions that of london is taken above at the same sum it might upon the first inspection seem to be the consequence of this that it is supposed above that there were in      no other buildings without a proportional quantity of land annexed to them than those contained in the city of london but in this account mr youngs object was to give the total receipt of the landlords annually from their estates he has therefore in the next article included in a single sum with other things the value of timber sold by them and that being his object it is rightly included in the total but timber being a commodity its value is not a rent of ground on which it grows any more than the value of a quarter of corn is the rent of the land producing it now supposing its annual value in      to have been rightly assigned by mr king and that it had increased from that time until the year      in the same proportion as the rent it would in the latter year have amounted to l 0  00 the statement made above therefore tacitly supposes this sum to have been the rent of the remaining buildings of the kingdom which have no land annexed to them it may perhaps be too small but i have chosen as the probable error in the text is thus very greatly reduced to adopt no further correction to it the remainder l    00 ms will be the sum of the rents in both districts in the year      that of      was    millions as above from both the income of      is to be determined     now let the same assumption be made with regard to the mixed rent as was before laid down with respect to the rents of superior condition only that it has increased during the whole of this period with one constant degree of celerity or which is the same thing that it has been every year augmented at an equal rate per cent the number of years from the revolution to      was    that rate was therefore l 0    per cent for the first rent    millions multiplied by  00     is equal to       xl   000 ms l    00 ms the period between      and      was  0  years and by the assumption the mixed rent at the end of the term was become l  000 ms x 00   0 l  0 ms       l      ms     this being the sum of the mixed rents of the two districts that of each is now to be assigned the rents of the superior and inferior condition in the two districts are in both very nearly in the same proportion to each other hence the sum of these rents or the mixed income of each district which is the subject here considered will be as the value of that district but the value of both is to the value of the remote district as       to       app art i    therefore as       is to l       ms the sum of the rents of both districts so is       to l       ms the mixed rent of the greater that of the home division is therefore l   0  ms     hence the amount of a tax or set of taxes upon either district or both jointly being given the proportion of the charge to the rent or its rate in the pound may be found as for example to find the present rate of the land tax of the home district it will be as its annual rent l   0  ms is to its annual tax l 0     ms so is l   to l 0 0    the real rate of the tax in the pound equal to       pence or two shillings and one penny and twothirds nearly again to find how much in the pound is paid by the landholders of the same district to all the taxes it will be as its rent l   0  ms is to l       ms their total payment to the state so is l   to l 0  0   or shillings     nearly and if from this rate l 0  0   be subtracted l 0 0    that of the land tax as above the remainder l 0      or   shillings   pence is the charge in the pound of the general taxes upon their income and that of all the upper class in society it is thus that the table in the text is formed exhibiting the rate in the pound of the land tax the general taxes and both conjointly for the two districts  observations on this article     this finishes the account of the computations on this branch of the subject referred to in the fourth section but if the train of reasoning be carried a little further the conclusion we shall come to will lend no inconsiderable evidence to the assumptions which have been made in the course of these operations it being apparent that the total national income may be deduced from what is laid down in this article now the result which will be so obtained very nearly coincides with the amount which the general estimation has assigned to that income but it has not been hitherto calculated upon these grounds the evidenue of these assumptions is therefore hereby increased there is superadded to their own internal probability the whole of that of the generally received estimate of the national income beside the presumption of the truth of both arising from their results being found to be congruous parts of a whole     to determine this income let us follow an arrangement originally adopted by mr king and suppose the nation to be divided into two classes each subdivision of the first increasing its wealth in its respective proportions and of the second diminishing it the expense of the maintenance of each of its subdivisions exceeding its income     it has been before observed that the income of the lower class exceeds that which would be found from the proportion of their payment to the general taxes an observation laid down as part of the evidence on which the assumption here proceeded upon is founded and that income must be evidently very nearly equal to the sum of their wages and the present amount of the national poors rate for most of this class have no other subsistence than what they derive from the one or the other     the wages of the laborers in agriculture was fixed by mr young in      at l   0   ms this sum has since been increased and its rate of increase is to be sought in the year    0 the average wages of husbandmen in all england was   pence a day petty polit arithm p     in political essays or the british empire   0 strahan      and including extraordinary wages in harvest turniphoeing and similar incidents it is here taken to have been in the year    0    pence a day this charge therefore increased at the rate of l 0     per cent annually in this interval of  00 years and in    years elapsed from      to      the wages of these laborers became increased to  00      x l   0   ms  0    x l   0   ms l    0  ms upon a supposition that their number continued absolutely stationary   0 the wages of the remainder of this class is now to be sought mr sulmioch a german writer on population of great celebrity has determined the average decrements of human life for a whole kingdom similar in circumstances to the kurmark of brandenburgh on a supposition that one third of the inhabitants are resident in great towns and the remainder in country parishes and villages now in all kingdoms the laboring poor of great towns are as numerous in proportion to the upper class as in the country but the great towns are generally the seats of manufactures for foreign commerce and their numbers of every description in this kingdom taken collectively greatly exceeds that proportion of our total population which takes place in brandenburgh again the husbandman supplies our natural wants only all our artificial wants are supplied by laboring artizans and manufacturers and as they much exceed those of that part of germany the number of persons employed in the supply of them here must be a proportionably greater part of the people hence it is to be concluded that more than one third part of the laboring class are inhabitants of great towns the average of their wages is also more than that of laborers in husbandry and upon these two accounts alone the annual income of the sets of men already enumerated must exceed that of one third of the whole class and if to the expense of their maintenance we add that of the laboring manufacturers and artisans residing in villages of servants in the country not employed in husbandry of our sailors in the foreign and coast trades and in the navy the soldiers and the men whom our home fisheries employ the sum of their income by wages may very well be taken equal to that of the laborers in husbandry     the amount of the poors rate remains to be added to this sum it may be said that being paid to them from the income of the upper class it is included in it and thus the same sum will be brought twice to account in the amount of the national income sought but all income is rightly brought to the account of that class which ultimately expends it for its own support not of that which pays it to them by law or contract otherwise rent would be the income of farmers not of landlords accordingly in mr kings table of national income davenant v   p     the amount of the national poors rate is taken from the income of the upper and inserted in that of the inferior class as appears from its construction this rate is an increasing rate its annual increment in the city of bristol for  0 years had been found to be l      per cent in a country district comprehending many parishes l      per cent in two contiguous hundreds in   years l    per cent and in  0 parishes in    years l     per cent observations on mr gilberts bill      p   let the average rate of increase be therefore taken at l   per cent and in    years the charge will be augmented in the proportion of   0   the amount of one pound at that interest for that term to unity the charge for the maintenance of the poor for the year ending at easter      was l       ms and in  0 years ending at easter      it had thus become increased to l        0   l       ms hence the income of the whole class is l    0 x  annual register dodsley v  0 p     l       l    00     that of the upper class is now to be found from the result of the assumption made at the beginning of this article that income appears to be to the part of the general taxes paid out of it as unity to 0      section    the charge of those taxes upon it is therefore to be assigned the total amount of the income of this class in      was l       ms davenant v   p     table and of the national income l       ms therefore by the assumption it shall be as l       ms is to l       ms the present amount of all the national general taxes so is l       ms to l   0   ms the amount of those taxes now paid out of the income of the upper class and again as 0      is to unity so is l   0   ms to l       ms the income sought     hence the income of the upper class being l      ms and that of the lower class l    00 ms the national income is l  0     ms at the end of the last and the commencement of the present peace it was generally stated at l  00 ms and with this the amount here found is in perfect coincidence and the evidence of the assumptions made at the beginning of this article is the amount of their own internal probability combined with the probability that the commonly received opinion of the amount of the national income is near the truth  article viii on the proportion of the taxes paid by the upper rank of the proprietors of land to their income and of that of the other classes   the income of the upper class of the proprietors of land in the year      was stated by mr king as follows davenant v   p     annual income total l l temporal lords   00    000 spiritual lords   00    00 baronets   0  0 000 knights   0   0000 esquires   0   00000 gentlemen   0    0000 eminent clergymen       000 freeholders of the better sort       0000 proprietors of land upper class   0  00    the remainder of the income of the upper class consisting of those who are engaged in the greater commerce the individuals of the several liberal professions not included in the account given above together with the whole of the middle class was in that year calculated by mr king at l       ms that of the lower class comprehending soldiers sailors and laborers of all denominations at l  0 0 ms and he computed the whole income of the people at l       ms whence the proportion of that of the three great divisions of the people here classed together being supposed to remain constant to this time if the present national income be taken as  000 that of the greater landed proprietors will be as     that of the lowest class as  0  and the remainder of society as        the general taxes or those to which every class contributes in proportion to its income amount to app art     l       ms a year and the contribution of the greater landowners to that total is 0    thereof yearly or       ms    this would be their payment to the public expenses if their income were taxed only in the same proportion as that of the rest of the people but in addition they pay their share of the land tax and here by the constant assumption let their present rents be taken as bearing the same proportion to the whole national rent which took place in      and it will be as    millions whitworths davenant v z p     the total rent of estates real in      is to l       ms the present amount of the land tax so is l   0   ms the income of this class in      to l       their present payment to that tax or the excess of their charge above what is paid out of any other equal income and the amount of their general taxes being l       the sum of both is l      ms which exceeds their proportional charge l       ms in the proportion of     0 to  0000    this is the average rate of the excess of taxes upon rent throughout the kingdom but in the home counties it is more and in the remote counties less than here assigned the proportion of land tax to income in the latter being onehalf that of the former only and it may be added that the present total burden of taxes upon the income of land in the home counties is very near the limit which the whole landed interest can properly bear  article ix on the effect of the equalization of the land tax on the price of the products of the soil the increase of the charge in the pound on the landlords of the remote district is to be sought the charge on the home district is l 0 0    and of the other l 00     see comparative table section iv in the notes the augmentation upon them to equalize the tax will therefore be l00    or one shilling and d in the pound amounting to l       per cent    half this charge by the assumption in the text is taken as the augmentation of the rent which is thus increased in the ratio of l 0    to unity or l     per cent now if the former rent of a farm had been l     the proportional poors rate would have amounted to l      and the other parish charges l0   chalmers p     now their sum l        multiplied by  0    as above will give the augmented disbursement of the tenant on these three articles l   00  and these are the only parts of his annual expense which will be initially affected by the advance of his rent hence the annual increase thereof is l 0    his total expenditure before amounted to l  0    and is now become l  0 0     suppose him to augment the price of his products in the same proportion as these expenses are increased their former selling value was l       chalmers p     it is now become l       or augmented in the proportion of   00    to unity that is    shillings and   d per cent and if before he sold a quarter of wheat for    shillings he must now add   pence and    0d to its price  article x on the tonnage of the english ships cleared outward from the port of london the four greater ports of the remote district and the other ports of the kingdom   the computations to be given in this article require two observations to be placed before them by way of introduction the first is that although the existence of a great decrease of the shipping of the ports of the home district exclusive of that of london be clearly proved by the accounts to be produced its exact measure is not thereby assignable and the other that the first application made of them as i afterward found was not the best approximation to the purpose in view the process however so employed presented some conclusions which seem to have importance enough to be preserved in an article of a miscellaneous appendix here will therefore be found other matter beside what is referred to as proved in the body of this tract or what is necessary to its support    in this subject it becomes requisite to consider the total tonnage by the tonnage of a port or ports is here uniformly meant tons english cleared outward in a year without regard to repeated voyages  but the number of tons of shipping belonging to any port exceeds the tonnage annually cleared outward and on an average of the whole kingdom by one third of the latter amount chalmers p    hence the tons of shipping and the tonnage cleared outward are on an average proportional in different years   of the kingdom as divided into three parts the first that of the port of london the second that of the four ports next to it in consequence or whitehaven liverpool newcastle and bristol all situated in the remote district and the third that of all the remaining and smaller ports taken collectively    the amounts of these three parts of the tonnage for the years    0 and      may be determined from two tables given by mr chalmers whence the increase or decrease of any one may be assigned for a term of time of sufficient duration in the first table he shows the tonnage of england for      and its average for the years         0      here to be taken as the tonnage of    0 the circumstance which led him to choose those years is evident but if the average had begun with the year    0 the comparisons here to be given might have been instituted upon averages of   years for every article and the matter of the account would have been somewhat more perfect as it is we must rely on the consequences to be drawn from the entries of   single years but from an inspection of his tables it is evident that any error to proceed from this circumstance must be very minute it ought however to be subjoined to this observation that it must be the fate of writers who are so much more full of information than others as to present us with almost every thing we can want that if we miss a single article of it our disappointment is more marked it is somewhat like that of the purchaser of a ticket in the lottery which is either the number immediately above or below a considerable prize    the two first columns of the following account of tonnage are compounded from the two tables given by mr chalmers tons  kingdom total chalmers estimate table p    the five ports ibid p        the third column in the table is the difference of the tonnage of the whole kingdom and the several parts thereof places tonnages    0      difference    0      increasing kingdom total  0             0 0

         00   0000      respectively at the beginning and end of the term of    years    the two last columns exhibit first the proportion in which the tonnage has increased in that term where any such augmentation took place and here that of the year    0 is constantly made the standard of comparison this is done by taking it as  0000 and finding a fourth number bearing such proportion to  0000 as the actual tonnage of      bore to that of    0 which fourth number will be as the tonnage of      or it may be conceived another way if the tonnage of    0 be supposed to be divided into  0000 equal parts the fourth number or the proportional shall be the number of such parts of which the tonnage of      consisted let the first article in the table or the total tonnage be the example of this process then as  0     tons the tonnage of    0 is to  0000 so is        the national tonnage in      to       the fourth proportional here the tonnage of    0 being taken as  0000 that of      will be as       or if the tonnage of the first term be supposed to be divided into  0000 equal parts that of the second will consist of       such parts    and in the two last articles which relate to the smaller ports first separately and secondly in conjunction with london where the tonnage is seen to have decreased in the same period that of    0 again is made the standard of comparison to determine its proportional decrease  the following observations suggest themselves on this table    firstly the celerity of the increase of tonnage of the five greater ports conjointly exceeded that of the kingdom in general in this period of    years and upon an average in the proportion of     to     nearly    secondly the proportion of increase of the tonnage of london exceeded that of the whole kingdom in the ratio of     to     nearly the disproportion of the head to the body of the kingdom is a real evil and that it is augmenting with the celerity that this proportion implies is at least a drawback from the advantage derived from the increase of its shipping cities may attain such a degree of population and riches that the sources of their further augmentation would be attended with much greater advantage if their operation could be transferred to new seats if that part of its superabundant waters which renders one place a rank and putrid marsh should work its way to some other where it was wanted it would diffuse life and fertility over it and the first retain all that luxuriance and all that luxuriance only which is wholesome   0 however it appears that even in      the proportion of the shipping belonging to the port of london compared with that of all england was not so great as in the beginning of the century by a survey taken in   0  which is preserved in the plantation office we see that the tonnage of all the trading vessels in england amounted to        and of the port of london to       tons chalmers estimate p   the former of which numbers is to the latter as  0000 to      it therefore had relatively fallen even in      in the proportion of      to      but in    0 in the ratio of      to      as will be seen in the next table in which state if it had continued and its reaugmentation pointed out above had been divided among the smaller ports of the kingdom whereby the quantity of our shipping would have remained the same it might have been of much greater general advantage     the table here given shows the proportion of the tonnage of english ships cleared outward in the kingdom in general and the port of london at sundry periods since

the kingdom increases this appears from the two first articles of the table in      the tonnage of english cleared from london was in all probability considerably less than it had been in      it amounted in the firstmentioned year to   ths of the tonnage of the whole kingdom in      it probably might be about   d of the whole its increase therefore in the latter end of the peace was extremely rapid     i am not without suspicion of some error of the press in the authority i follow in the account of the tonnage of london for the year          thirdly the tonnage of the four great outports had upon an average increased during    years with a greater celerity than that of london and in the proportion of     to     and their increase simply considered exhibits nothing which is not advantageous it points out the spirit of enterprise to be diffused a great town increasing rapidly in commerce is a punctum vitae to the whole country round it and these advantages continue until its increasing opulence begin to have a bad effect on manners and its increasing number on population     fourthly the tonnage of whitehaven which appears in the table to have very nearly obtained an equality with that of london had actually upon an average of three years ending with the year      somewhat exceeded it that of london for those three years having been    0   and of whitehaven        tons chalmers estimate table p         fifthly the proportional increase of the commerce of liverpool appears to have been somewhat more than double that of the kingdom in general and to have exceeded that of all other ports     sixthly with respect to shipping bristol which is only the fifth has been hitherto deemed the second port in relative importance chalmers p         seventhly although the port of london is situated in the home district it is to be considered as the emporium of the kingdom in general both are interested in what regards the extension of its commerce and nearly perhaps in proportion to the importance of their own fabrics and manufactures and it cannot be said to belong exclusively to either but considering the consequences to be drawn from this statement it is highly probable that there will not be wanting some who paying a greater regard to the geographical situation of that city than its relation to the whole kingdom as its capital will argue for taking the increase of its shipping to the account of the tonnage of the home district now this cannot be separated from the general total of that of the smaller ports but being joined with them it appears that the tonnage of london and the smaller ports had decreased in    years   00  tons and if the tonnage of    0 be taken as  0000 that of      will be      only hence there appears a very considerable decrease of tonnage even in this mode of stating it     eighthly the observations on the decrease of the shipping of the smaller ports the object for which these inquiries were instituted are given in the body of this tract   0 ninthly the proportion of the tonnage of any one or more ports to that of the kingdom in general or any other port or ports made the standard that is taken as  0000 is the measure of the proportion of their shipping nearly or of their maritime importance see note   and the difference of those measures at distant terms of time of their relative progression or retrogression and both these points in every necessary instance may be determined for the years    0 and      this is done in the divisions of the following table the tonnage of the first article of each being made the standard in both those years thus in the fourth division in the year    0 the tonnage of the four greater outports        tons being made the standard or taken as  0000 that of the smaller outports having been    0   tons the proportion they then bore to the former will be defined by the fourth proportional to these three numbers or be as       but in the year      that measure of their relative importance had become diminished to       a comparison of the tonnage of particular ports chiefly the smaller outports with sundry standards    0      ports london included tonnage

other or others at any two periods may become a subject of inquiry as was intimated in the account of the construction of the last table thus the tonnage of the four greater outports being taken as  0000 it is seen by the last table that in    0 the tonnage of the smaller outports was as       and in      as      their relative importance compared with that of the four greater ports had therefore in twentytwo years diminished in the proportion of those numbers and taking its measure in the year    0 or       as the standard or as  0000 in the year      it had become diminished in the proportion of      to  0000 or to something less than   d of its former measure for as       is to  0000 so is      to          the variations of the tonnage of the smaller outports being the principal object of investigation in this article its decrease when compared with the total shipping of the kingdom and the greater subdivisions is given in the third column of the following table the first two are copied from the preceding table and by taking each number in the first as  0000 the corresponding number in the third is a fourth proportional to the number in the first column the

their disquisitions on some subjects collateral to that here treated of to assume hypothetically some rate for the average of this peace they have concurred in assuming l    per cent as that rate in which they are here followed    in the last peace the mean price of the same stock so taken was l   0  and in the following war l      per cent the first of which rates is to the second as l    to l      supposing therefore that the proportion of the prices of peace and war will continue the same l      per cent will be the average value of the stock next war    the douceur or premium given for the actual advance of l  00 to a loan is the excess of the market value of all the heterogeneous securities granted to the lender and every other beneficial condition of his contract which has a value in money above the sum advanced l  00 from calculations of all the loans of each it appears that the average douceurs of the wars of           and      were l      l      and l      per cent respectively the mean of which is l    0 per cent it is taken here at   per cent    the amount of an adequate fund to be established immediately upon the expiration of the fifth year of a peace is here sought this

the war the debt will increase at its termination the fund is again to be applied to the discharge of the debt for the term of   years in peace it is annually augmented with the interest of the capital of the public debt paid off thereby and in war by a rate of interest equal to that effectively made by those who lend money to government now the amount of the adequate fund is required to be

interest which is to be allowed to the trustees of the fund for its augmentation when it is taken to the current service in war and which is to be provided for by new taxes we must enquire now how much the fund will supply toward the charge of the war during the whole eight years of its continuance now this sum will be equal to the amount of an annuity of l      ms increasing at the rate of

observations on the decrease of the shipping of the homedistrict as stated in the fourth section of the text and the tenth article of the appendix since this tract has been printed off a new edition of mr chalmerss estimate so often quoted in it has been put into my hands in this the table of the yearly tonnage of the five greater ports is omitted  the foundation of every thing laid down above concerning the shipping of the ports of the home counties this omission is of too much consequence to be passed over without some observations upon it  although the matter of the table be in itself very curious it appears to have been inserted in the original edition principally on account of two inferences there drawn from it these appear to me to have been afterward discovered by this candid writer not to be legitimately founded thereon and it was as i suppose omitted in the edition of      as no longer lending support to any thing there advanced and consequently become superfluous  in the observations which introduce it he states the five principal ports as representatives of the whole and as demonstrating the great progress of our navigation in twenty years edition of      table p    hence it is evident that he supposed the tonnage of the smaller ports had increased in some proportion not very dissimilar to that of the greater in suppressing the table together with his remarks upon it he has tacitly given up this induction it has been shown above and from this extract from the register of shipping edition of      table p    joined with others contained in the same work that while the tonnage of these ports increased with an assigned celerity that of the smaller had decreased with much more  his second greater inference from the table is of an importance on this subject which demands a fuller consideration of it from the equality of the tonnage cleared outward in      he lays it down that in that year whitehaven claimed an equality with london in respect to the numbers of native shipping edition of      table p    this deduction which is likewise erroneous he appears desirous of disavowing more explicitly in the preface to his improved edition of      edition of      preface p   by stating that the colliers of whitehaven and newcastle enter and clear at the customhouse several times in one year hence from a given increase of tonnage annually cleared outward from one of these ports the same increase of its shipping is not to be inferred as from an equal augmentation of that of the other ports of the kingdom taken on the average  now many of the considerations on the decrease of the shipping of the home district given above admit the assumption which mr chalmers seems to have rightly now guarded against by a protest in form and it is impossible to conceive the error it may lead to on this subject as of no consequence it is evidently of that magnitude that it may either greatly exaggerate the appearance of the growing depression of the shipping of the smaller ports or operate so on the result as to conceal a very great part of its true amount  it shall therefore be here shown that the latter has been the case and that if any allowance be made to counterbalance the effect of this erroneous principle in the preceding computations what has been laid down on this subject in the fourth section will hold good a fortieri  this is proved as follows whitehaven and newcastle being excluded the proportion of the whole tonnage of the greater ports annually cleared outward to the shipping they possess may be taken to be very nearly the same as that of the smaller ports but the annual tonnage of those two ports bears a greater proportion to the quantity of their shipping now here let there be assumed as successive hypotheses that the voyages made by the shipping of those two ports are to those made by that of the other ports of the kingdom in equal terms of time first in the ratio of equality secondly in that of two to one and lastly in that of three to one it follows that the quantity of shipping in the rest of the kingdom being as the tonnage cleared therefrom annually that of the two ports shall be on the first supposition as their annual tonnage on the second as one half thereof and on the third as one third part thereof  by the table in the  0th page of the appendix we find that in the years    0      the total tonnage of the kingdom was  0            of whitehaven and newcastle           0   of the remainder of the kingdom     0          the difference of the latter numbers  0   tons may very well be taken as accidental hence it follows the two coal ports being set out of the great question that if the remaining ports of the kingdom be taken as divided into two sets the first increasing in shipping and the second decreasing the gain of the one has in this term of twentytwo years been equal to the loss of the other  according to the first hypothesis the shipping of whitehaven and newcastle in the years    0 and      are to be taken as        and    0   respectively according to the second as one half thereof or  0    and    0   and according to the third as one third thereof or       and       to render the total national tonnage and its principal divisions proportional to the total shipping and its corresponding divisions respectively according to the condition of each hypothesis  the table quoted above being extended to comprehend the results of the second and third hypothesis will stand thus   ports tonnage by is it by iid by iiid by      years hypoth hypoth

stationary                 0     the decrease of the annual tonnage of the smaller ports and that of their shipping proportional thereto must remain the same on each of the three hypotheses or on any other which can be laid down whereby allowance is made for the greater number of repeated voyages of the shipping of whitehaven and newcastle for by every such hypothesis the sum of the annual tonnage of those ports must be diminished and that of the five great ports and the total tonnage of the kingdom will each be diminished by the same amount as that of those two ports hence the difference of those two great aggregates being the tonnage of the smaller ports will be constantly the same at any two assigned times on any such hypothesis and its increase or decrease in the interval between them remain constant and unaffected thereby  the proportion which the decrease of the tonnage of the less ports in twentytwo years as given in the table bears to the increase of the total national tonnage in that term according to each of the three hypotheses is comparatively shown as follows  the increase of the national tonnage in twentytwo years would have been hyp i         ii         iii         tons if the small ports had retained the shipping they possessed in    0 by its decrease this augmentation was reduced to hyp i   0 0   ii   0  0 iii        tons or to less than hyp i one half ii one third iii one fourth of that amount and thus hyp i one half ii two thirds iii three fourths of the increase of our commercial shipping and naval force generated by the increase of the trade of the five great ports has been annihilated by the decline of the trade of the smaller taken conjointly wherefore if they had been able only to retain the trade they possessed at the beginning of the term the augmentation of our shipping for trade and war considerable as it was would have been more than hyp i doubled ii trebled iii quadrupled in the above term of twentytwo years  hence the increase of the national shipping and its naval force appears to have been much more retarded by the decline of the smaller ports upon the second and third hypotheses than on the first that is than on the statement of the same matter given in the third paragraph of the   th page of this tract as therefore some allowance must be made for the repeated voyages of the colliers of the two ports the bad consequences of that decline are there stated at less than their true magnitude  its celerity was likewise such that the tonnage of the smaller ports was in twentytwo years reduced in the proportion of  0000 to      an unparalleled and afflicting contrast to the prosperity of the four great outports the annual tonnage of which increased in the same time in the proportion of hyp i        ii        iii        to  0000  here again the first hypothesis is that on which the celerity of the decrease of the former and the increase of the latter is given p    l    etc and its result is confirmed by that of the two last hypotheses a fortiori  the shipping of the greater ports of the remote district having increased in the above proportion it may with great moderation be assumed that the small ports of that district by situation partaking of the same common advantages have in the same time increased in the proportion of hyp i        ii   0    iii   0    to  0000 which is the average rate of the increase of the tonnage of the whole kingdom their advantages being above the general average and hereby the argument made use of p    l   receives an additional strength  thus it is evident in the three last comparative statements that every thing on the decline of the smaller ports deduced from the first hypothesis follows a fortiori from the second and third but these consequences of hyp i contain the whole arithmetical matter brought forward on the subject in the fourth section whence any allowance to be made on account of the repeated voyages of the shipping of the coal ports adds to the strength and conclusiveness of that branch of the general argument  in the table here annexed are contained such of the articles of that in the   th page of the appendix and the first table of page   th as relate to the smaller ports on each of the three hypotheses  tonnage of smaller ports as their ratio of decrease standard tonnage of    0      in      as hyp their proportion of tonnage in    0 as  0000 kingdom total i    0       0 0 ii   00           iii                five greater ports i                ii    0           iii  0     00    0  four greater outports i                 ii  0              iii          0      outports london excluded i       0 0   0  ii       00     0 iii              0  by the second and third hypotheses the annual tonnage of the sets of ports successively made standards being diminished by the reduction of that of the two coal ports the proportion of the annual tonnage of the smaller ports the quantity of which is the same on each hypothesis appears increased in each successively but it is not the absolute proportion of the shipping of the smaller outports at any one time to that of any other set of ports as a standard which is here to be considered but the variation of that proportion in twentytwo years representing the relative celerity of their decline compared successively with each standard and the measure of their variation is very little changed upon any of these hypotheses thus the proportion of the shipping of the smaller ports to that of the whole kingdom appears upon the first to have decreased in twentytwo years in the ratio of  0 0 to  0000 and by the third in that of      to the same number which is its greatest difference here although their relative decline appears by the second estimate somewhat less than before that difference of these results is not enough to have any weight against any general conclusion which might have been drawn from the first but in the fourth section no argument has been brought forward from the decrease of the tonnage considered in this point of view  as by the two last hypotheses the total annual tonnage of the kingdom is diminished that of london remaining the same as before in every period hence it follows that what is said of the great proportion of the national commerce concentrated in that vast city holds good a fortiori if it had been judged necessary the table in which it is particularly given might have been extended to comprehend the results of the two last hypotheses and enlarged from the later collections of mr chalmers estimate edition of      p      there are some further variations in the edition of mr chalmerss estimate of      from that of      which must be likewise here noticed  in the    th page of the first edition mr chalmers has given a table of the annual produce of the land of england and the annual expense of it to the farmer it is copied from youngs political arithmetic part ii page    this table likewise is not reprinted in the subsequent publication of his estimate in      the edition i possess of this work of mr young has no second part nor have i been able to find one in which it is contained but from the correspondence of the general totals to the articles of which they are compounded it is evident that the whole was accurately copied in the first publication of mr chalmers from a comparison of mr youngs northern and eastern tour i have verified the first article of the farmers expenditure the rent of the land of england and the sum of the three following  the tithes poors rate and parish charges the amount of the two last articles the annual expense of seedgrain and labor as deduced in the same mode from these tours  are sufficiently near to those in this account for the purposes for which i have quoted it even if the difference of these articles be an error in the latter which however ought to be understood as a correction of the average of the tours made upon reason by mr young these several amounts are determined from the minutes he took in his journeys and there is no reason to suppose them not to be as accurate as those he collected at the same time to determine the number of persons engaged in farming these mr chalmers in the improved edition of his estimate states to have been of sufficient accuracy for that purpose it may be supposed therefore that although he did not find it necessary to the improved and abridged plan of his work to retain the table he notwithstanding had not changed his former opinion of the several articles thereof that they were satisfactory because the data were good this table is quoted in the  th  th   st and   th pages of the appendix of this tract  in his first edition mr chalmers had stated the value of land in      at twentyfive and twentysix years purchase in support of which he quotes andersons history of commerce vol ii p     in the edition of that work printed in      vol iii p     it is said that land then sold at twentyfive twentysix and twentyseven years purchase but the two first of these are to be esteemed as the ordinary rates and the last as the highest price of land at that time and its average value may in all contracts very well be taken to have been at that time twentyfive and a half years purchase as stated in the first section of this essay p    if we compare mr chalmerss extract from anderson in p     of the edition of      with the corresponding passages of that of      p    and     the necessity of this observation will be evident  i have followed the first copy of the estimate in this pamphlet in other places besides those already noticed but the passages i have made use of are repeated in the improved edition of his work printed in       erratum notes to p   and p    of the text for molesworth read molleson
