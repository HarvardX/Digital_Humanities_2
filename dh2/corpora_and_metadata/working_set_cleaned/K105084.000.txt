love of novelty which in some degree is common to all mankind is more particularly the characteristic of that mediocrity of parts which distinguishes more than one half of the human species this inconstant disposition is never more conspicuous than in what regards the article of amusement we change our sentiments concerning it every moment and the distance between our admiration and extreme contempt is so very small that the one is almost a sure presage of the other the poets whose business it is to please if they want to preserve the fame they have once acquired must very often forfeit their own judgments to this variable temper of the bulk of their readers and accommodate their writings to this unsettled taste a fame so fluctuating deserves not to be much valued  poetry like virtue receives its reward after death the fame which men pursued in vain when living is often bestowed upon them when they are not sensible of it this neglect of living authors is not altogether to be attributed to that reluctance which men show in praising and rewarding genius it often happens that the man who writes differs greatly from the same man in common life his foibles however are obliterated by death and his better part his writings remain his character is formed from them and he that was no extraordinary man in his own time becomes the wonder of succeeding ages  from this source proceeds our veneration for the dead their virtues remain but the vices which were once blended with their virtues have died with themselves  this consideration might induce a man diffident of his abilities to ascribe his own compositions to a person whose remote antiquity and whose situation when alive might well answer for faults which would be inexcusable in a writer of this age an ingenious gentleman made this observation before he knew any thing but the name of the epic poem which is printed in the following collection when he had read it his sentiments were changed he found it abounded too much with those ideas that only belong to the most early state of society to be the work of a modern poet of this i am persuaded the public will be as thoroughly convinced as this gentleman was when they shall see the poems and that some will think notwithstanding the disadvantages with which the works ascribed to ossian appear it would be a very uncommon instance of selfdenial in me to disown them were they really of my composition  i would not have dwelt so long upon this subject especially as i have answered all reasonable objections to the genuineness of the poems in the dissertation were it not on account of the prejudices of the present age against the ancient inhabitants of britain who are thought to have been incapable of the generous sentiments to be met with in the poems of ossian  if we err in praising too much the times of our forefathers it is also as repugnant to good sense to be altogether blind to the imperfections of our own if our fathers had not so much wealth they had certainly fewer vices than the present age their tables it is true were not so well provided neither were their beds so soft as those of modern times and this in the eyes of men who place their ultimate happiness in those conveniences of life gives us a great advantage over them i shall not enter farther into this subject but only observe that the general poverty of a nation has not the same influence that the indigence of individuals in an opulent country has upon the manners of the community the idea of meanness which is now connected with a narrow fortune had its rise after commerce had thrown too much property into the hands of a sew for the poorer sort imitating the vices of the rich were obliged to have recourse to roguery and circumvention in order to supply their extravagance so that they were not without reason reckoned in more than one sense the worst of the people  it is now two years since the first translations from the galic language were handed about among people of taste in scotland they became at last so much corrupted through the carelessness of transcribers that for my own sake i was obliged to print the genuine copies some other pieces were added to swell the publication into a pamphlet which was entitled fragments of ancient poetry  the fragments upon their first appearance were so much approved of that several people of rank as well as taste prevailed with me to make a journey into the highlands and western isles in order to recover what remained of the works of the old bards especially those of ossian the son of fingal who was the best as well as most ancient of those who are celebrated in tradition for their poetical genius  i undertook this journey more from a desire of complying with the request of my friends than from any hopes i had of answering their expectations i was not unsucessful considering how much the compositions of ancient times have been neglected for some time past in the north of scotland several gentlemen in the highlands and isles generously gave me all the assistance in their power and it was by their means i was enabled to complete the epic poem how far it comes up to the rules of the epopaea is the province of criticism to examine it is only my business to lay it before the reader as i have found it as it is one of the chief beauties of composition to be well understood i shall here give the story of the poem to prevent that obscurity which the introduction of characters utterly unknown might occasion  artho supreme king of ireland dying at temora the royal palace of the irish kings was succeeded by cormac his son a minor cuchullin the son of semo lord of the isle of mist one of the hebrides being at that time in ulster and very famous for his great exploits was in a convention of the petty kings and heads of tribes assembled for that purpose at temora unanimously chosen guardian to the young king  he had not managed the affairs of cormac long when news was brought that swaran the son of starno king of lochlin or scandinavia intended to invade ireland cuchullin immediately dispatched munan the son of stirmal an irish chief to fingal king of those caledonians who inhabited the western coast of scotland to implore his aid fingal as well from a principle of generosity as from his connection with the royal family of ireland resolved on an expedition into that country but before his arrival the enemy had landed in ulster  cuchullin in the mean time had gathered the flower of the irish tribes to tura a castle of ulster and dispatched scouts along the coast to give the most early intelligence of the enemy  such is the situation of affairs when the poem opens  fing b i cuchullin sitting alone beneath a tree at the gate of tura for the other chiefs had gone on a hunting party to cromla a neighboring hill is informed of swarans landing by moran the son of fithil one of his scouts he convenes the chiefs a council is held and disputes run high about giving battle to the enemy connal the petty king of togorma and an intimate friend of cuchullin was for retreating till fingal should arrive but calmar the son of matha lord of lara a country in connaught was for engaging the enemy immediately  cuchullin of himself willing to fight went into the opinion of calmar marching toward the enemy he missed three of his bravest heroes fergus duchomar and caithbat fergus arriving tells cuchullin of the death of the two other chiefs which introduces the affecting episode of morna the daughter of cormac  the army of cuchullin is descried at a distance by swaran who sent the son of arno to observe the motions of the enemy while he himself ranged his forces in order of battle  the son of arno returning to swaran describes to him cuchullins chariot and the terrible appearance of that hero the armies engage but night coming on leaves the victory undecided cuchullin according to the hospitality of the times sends to swaran a formal invitation to a feast by his bard carril the son of kinsena  swaran refuses to come carril relates to cuchullin the story of grudar and brassolis a party by connals advice is sent to observe the enemy which closes the action of the first day  b ii the ghost of crugal one of the irish heroes who was killed in battle appearing to connal foretells the defeat of cuchullin in the next battle and earnestly advises him to make peace with swaran connal communicates the vision but cuchullin is inflexible from a principle of honor that he would not be the first to sue for peace and resolved to continue the war morning comes swaran proposes dishonorable terms to cuchullin which are rejected the battle begins and is obstinately fought for some time until upon the flight of grumal the whole irish army gave way cuchullin and connal cover their retreat carril leads them to a neighboring hill whither they are soon followed by cuchullin himself who descries the fleet of fingal making toward the coast but night coming on he lost sight of it again cuchullin dejected after his defeat attributes his ill success to the death of ferda his friend whom he had killed some time before carril to show that ill success did not always attend those who innocently killed their friends introduces the episode of comal and galvina  b iii cuchullin pleased with carrils story insists with him for more of his songs the bard relates the actions of fingal in lochlin and death of agandecca the beautiful sister of swaran he had scarce finished when calmar the son of matha who had advised the first battle came wounded from the field and told them of swarans design to surprise the remains of the irish army he himself proposes to withstand singly the whole force of the enemy in a narrow pass till the irish should make good their retreat cuchullin touched with the gallant proposal of calmar resolves to accompany him and orders carril to carry off the few that remained of the irish morning comes calmar dies of his wounds and the ships of the caledonians appearing swaran gives over the pursuit of the irish and returns to oppose fingals landing cuchullin ashamed after his defeat to appear before fingal retires to the cave of tura fingal engages the enemy puts them to flight but the coming on of night makes the victory not decisive the king who had observed the gallant behavior of his grandson oscar gives him advices concerning his conduct in peace and war he recommends to him to place the example of his fathers before his eyes as the best model for his conduct which introduces the episode concerning fainasollis the daughter of the king of craca whom fingal had taken under his protection in his youth fillan and oscar are dispatched to observe the motions of the enemy by night gaul the son of morni desires the command of the army in the next battle which fingal promises to give him the song of the bards closes the third day  b iv the action of the poem being suspended by night ossian takes that opportunity to relate his own actions at the lake of lego and his courtship of evirallin who was the mother of oscar and had died some time before the expedition of fingal into ireland her ghost appears to him and tells him that oscar who had been sent the beginning of the night to observe the enemy was engaged with an advanced party and almost overpowered ossian relieves his son and an alarm is given to fingal of the approach of swaran the king rises calls his army together and as he had promised the preceding night devolves the command on gaul the son of morni while he himself after charging his sons to behave gallantly and defend his people retires to a hill from whence he could have a view of the battle the battle joins the poet relates oscars great actions but when oscar in conjunction with his father conquered in one wing gaul who was attacked by swaran in person was on the point of retreating in the other fingal sends ullin his bard to encourage him with a war song but notwithstanding swaran prevails and gaul and his army are obliged to give way fingal descending from the hill rallies them again swaran desists from the pursuit possesses himself of a rising ground restores the ranks and waits the approach of fingal the king having encouraged his men gives the necessary orders and renews the battle cuchullin who with his friend connal and carril his bard had retired to the cave of tura hearing the noise came to the brow of the hill which overlooked the field of battle where he saw fingal engaged with the enemy he being hindered by connal from joining fingal who was himself upon the point of obtaining a complete victory sends carril to congratulate that hero on his success  b v in the mean time fingal and swaran meet the combat is described swaran is overcome bound and delivered over as a prisoner to the care of ossian and gaul the son of morni fingal his younger sons and oscar still pursue the enemy the episode of orla a chief of lochlin who was mortally wounded in the battle is introduced fingal touched with the death of orla orders the pursuit to be discontinued and calling his sons together he is informed that ryno the youngest of them was killed he laments his death hears the story of lamdarg and gelchossa and returns toward the place where he had left swaran carril who had been sent by cuchullin to congratulate fingal on his victory comes in the mean time to ossian the conversation of the two poets closes the action of the fourth day  b vi night comes on fingal gives a seast to his army at which swaran is present the king commands ullin his bard to give the song of peace a custom always observed at the end of a war ullin relates the actions of trenmor great grandfather to fingal in scandinavia and his marriage with inibaca the daughter of a king of lochlin who was ancestor to swaran which consideration together with his being brother to agandecca with whom fingal was in love in his youth induced the king to release him and permit him to return with the remains of his army into lochlin upon his promise of never returning to ireland in a hostile manner the night is spent in settling swarans departure in songs of bards and in a conversation in which the story of grumal is introduced by fingal morning comes swaran departs fingal goes on a hunting party and finding cuchullin in the cave of tura comforts him and sets sail the next day for scotland which concludes the poem  the story of this poem is so little interlarded with fable that one cannot help thinking it the genuine history of fingals expedition embellished by poetry in that case the compositions of ossian are not less valuable for the light they throw on the ancient state of scotland and ireland than they are for their poetical merit succeeding generations founded on them all their traditions concerning that period and they magnified or varied them in proportion as they were swayed by credulity or design the bards of ireland by ascribing to ossian compositions which are evidently their own have occasioned a general belief in that country that fingal was of irish extraction and not of the ancient caledonians as is said in the genuine poems of ossian the inconsistencies between those spurious pieces prove the ignorance of their authors in one of them ossian is made to mention himself as baptized by st patrick in another he speaks of the famous crusade which was not begun in europe for many centuries after  though this anachronism quite destroys the authority of the bards with respect to fingal yet their desire to make him their countryman shows how famous he was in ireland as well as in the north of scotland  had the senachies of ireland been as well acquainted with the antiquities of their nation as they pretended they might derive as much honor from fingals being a caledonian as if he had been an irishman for both nations were almost the same people in the days of that hero the celtae who inhabited britain and ireland before the invasion of the romans though they were divided into numerous tribes yet as the same language and customs and the memory of their common origin remained among them they considered themselves as one nation after south britain became a province of rome and its inhabitants begun to adopt the language and customs of their conquerors the celtae beyond the pale of the empire considered them as a distinct people and consequently treated them as enemies on the other hand the strictest amity subsisted between the irish and scots celtae for many ages and the customs and ancient language of both still remaining leave no room to doubt that they were of old one and the same nation  it was at first intended to prefix to ossians poems a discourse concerning the ancient inhabitants of britain but as a gentleman in the north of scotland who has thoroughly examined the antiquities of this island and is perfectly acquainted with all the branches of the celtic tongue is just now preparing for the press a work on that subject the curious are referred to it  a dissertation concerning the antiquity etc of the poems of ossian the son of fingal inquiries into the antiquities of nations afford more pleasure than any real advantage to mankind the ingenious may form systems of history on probabilities and a few facts but at a great distance of time their accounts must be vague and uncertain the infancy of states and kingdoms is as destitute of great events as of the means of transmitting them to posterity the arts of polished life by which alone facts can be preserved with certainty are the production of a well formed community it is then historians begin to write and public transactions to be worthy remembrance the actions of former times are left in obscurity or magnified by uncertain traditions hence it is that we find so much of the mavelous in the origin of every nation posterity being always ready to believe any thing however fabulous that reflects honor on their ancestors the greeks and romans were remarkable for this weakness they swallowed the most absurd fables concerning the high antiquities of their respective nations good historians however rose very early amongst them and transmitted with luster their great actions to posterity it is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame they now enjoy while the great actions of other nations are involved in fables or lost in obscurity the celtic nations afford a striking instance of this kind they though once the masters of europe from the mouth of the river oby in russia to cape finistere the western point of gallicia in spain are very little mentioned in history lin l   they trusted their fame to tradition and the songs of their bards which by the vicissitude of human affairs are long since lost their ancient language is the only monument that remains of them and the traces of it being found in places so widely distant of each other serves only to show the extent of their ancient power but throws very little light on their history  of all the celtic nations that which possessed old gaul is the most renowned not perhaps on account of worth superior to the rest but for their wars with a people who had historians to transmit the fame of their enemies as well as their own to posterity britain was first peopled by them according to the testimony of the best authors caes l   tac agric l   c   its situation in respect to gaul makes the opinion probable but what puts it beyond all dispute is that the same customs and language prevailed among the inhabitants of both in the days of julius caesar caesar pomp mel tacitus   the colony from gaul possessed themselves at first of that part of britain which was next to their own country and spreading northward by degrees as they increased in numbers peopled the whole island some adventurers passing over from those parts of britain that are within sight of ireland were the founders of the irish nation which is a more probable story than the idle fables of milesian and gallician colonies diodorus siculus mentions it dio sic l   as a thing well known in his time that the inhabitants of ireland were originally britons and his testimony is unquestionable when we consider that for many ages the language and customs of both nations were the same  tacitus was of opinion that the ancient caledonians were of german extract by the language and customs which always prevailed in the north of scotland and which are undoubtedly celtic one would be tempted to differ in opinion from that celebrated writer the germans properly so called were not the same with the ancient celtae the manners and customs of the two nations were similar but their language different strabo    the germans are the genuine descendants of the ancient daae afterward well known by the name of daci and passed originally into europe by the way of the northern countries and settled beyond the danube toward the vast regions of transylvania wallachia and moldavia and from thence advanced by degrees into germany caes l   live l   tac de mor germ the celtae it is certain sent many colonies into that country all of whom retained their own laws language and customs and it is of them if any colonies came from germany into scotland that the ancient caledonians were descended  but whether the caledonians were a colony of the celtic germans or the same with the gauls that first possessed themselves of britain is a matter of no moment at this distance of time whatever their origin was we find them very numerous in the time of julius agricola which is a presumption that they were long before settled in the country the form of their government was a mixture of aristocracy and monarchy as it was in all the countries where the druids bore the chief sway this order of men seems to have been formed on the same system with the dactyli idaei and curetes of the ancients their pretended intercourse with heaven their magic and divination were the same the knowledge of the druids in natural causes and the properties of certain things the fruit of the experiments of ages gained them a mighty reputation among the people the esteem of the populace soon increased into a veneration for the order which a cunning and ambitious tribe of men took care to improve to such a degree that they in a manner engrossed the management of civil as well as religious matters it is generally allowed that they did not abuse this extraordinary power the preserving their character of sanctity was so essential to their influence that they never broke out into violence or oppression the chiefs were allowed to execute the laws but the legislative power was entirely in the hands of the druids caes l   it was by their authority that the tribes were united in times of the greatest danger under one head this temporary king or vergobretus fergubreth the man to judge was chosen by them and generally laid down his office at the end of the war these priests enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of the roman empire it was in the beginning of the second century that their power among the caledonians begun to decline the poems that celebrate trathal and cormac ancestors to fingal are full of particulars concerning the fall of the druids which account for the total silence concerning their religion in the poems that are now given to the public  the continual wars of the caledonians against the romans hindered the nobility from initiating themselves as the custom formerly was into the order of the druids the precepts of their religion were confined to a few and were not much attended to by a people inured to war the vergobretus or chief magistrate was chosen without the concurrence of the hierarchy or continued in his office against their will continual power strengthened his interest among the tribes and enabled him to send down as hereditary to his posterity the office he had only received himself by election  on occasion of a new war against the king of the world as the poems emphatically call the roman emperor the druids to vindicate the honor of the order began to resume their ancient privilege of choosing the vergobretus garmal the son of tarno being deputed by them came to the grandfather of the celebrated fingal who was then vergobretus and commanded him in the name of the whole order to lay down his office upon his refusal a civil war commenced which soon ended in almost the total extinction of the religious order of the druids a few that remained retired to the dark recesses of their groves and the caves they had formerly used for their meditations it is then we find them in the circle of stones and unheeded by the world a total disregard for the order and utter abhorrence of the druidical rites ensued under this cloud of public hate all that had any knowledge of the religion of the druids became extinct and the nation sell into the last degree of ignorance of their rites and ceremonies  it is no matter of wonder then that fingal and his son ossian make so little if any mention of the druids who were the declared enemies to their succession in the supreme magistracy it is a singular case it must be allowed that there are no traces of religion in the poems ascribed to ossian as the poetical compositions of other nations are so closely connected with their mythology it is hard to account for it to those who are not made acquainted with the manner of the old scottish bards that race of men carried their notions of martial honor to an extravagant pitch any aid given their heroes in battle was thought to derogate from their fame and the bards immediately transferred the glory of the action to him who had given that aid  had ossian brought down gods as often as homer has done to assist his heroes this poem had not consisted of elogiums on his friends but of hymns to these superior beings to this day those that write in the galic language seldom mention religion in their profane poetry and when they professedly write of religion they never interlard with their compositions the actions of their heroes this custom alone even though the religion of the druids had not been previously extinguished may in some measure account for ossians silence concerning the religion of his own times  to say that a nation is void of all religion is the same thing as to say that it does not consist of people endued with reason the traditions of their fathers and their own observations on the works of nature together with that superstition which is inherent in the human frame have in all ages raised in the minds of men some idea of a superior being  hence it is that in the darkest times and amongst the most barbarous nations the very populace themselves had some faint notion at least of a divinity it would be doing injustice to ossian who upon no occasion shows a narrow mind to think that he had not opened his conceptions to that primitive and greatest of all truths but let ossians religion be what it will it is certain he had no knowledge of christianity as there is not the least allusion to it or any of its rites in his poems which absolutely fixes him to an era prior to the introduction of that religion the persecution begun by dioclesian in the year  0  is the most probable time in which the first dawning of christianity in the north of britain can be fixed  the humane and mild character of constantius chlorus who commanded then in britain induced the persecuted christians to take refuge under him some of them through a zeal to propagate their tenets or through fear went beyond the pale of the roman empire and settled among the caledonians who were the more ready to hearken to their doctrines as the religion of the druids had been exploded so long before  these missionaries either through choice or to give more weight to the doctrine they advanced took possession of the cells and groves of the druids and it was from this retired life they had the name of culdees which in the language of the country culdich signified sequestered persons it was with one of the culdees that ossian in his extreme old age is said to have disputed concerning the christian religion this dispute is still extant and is couched in verse according to the custom of the times the extreme ignorance on the part of ossian of the christian tenets shows that that religion had only been lately introduced as it is not easy to conceive how one of the first rank could be totally unacquainted with a religion that had been known for any time in the country the dispute bears the genuine marks of antiquity the obsolete phrases and expressions peculiar to the times prove it to be no forgery if ossian then lived at the introduction of christianity as by all appearance he did his epoch will be the latter end of the third and beginning of the fourth century what puts this point beyond dispute is the allusion in his poems to the history of the times  the exploits of fingal against caracul carachl terrible eye the son of the king of the world are among the first brave actions of his youth a complete poem which relates to this subject is printed in this collection  in the year   0 the emperor severus after returning from his expeditions against the caledonians at york fell into the tidious illness of which he afterward died the caledonians and maiatae resuming courage from his indisposition took arms in order to recover the possessions they had lost the enraged emperor commanded his army to march into their country and to destroy it with fire and sword his orders were but ill executed for his son caracalla was at the head of the army and his thoughts were entirely taken up with the hopes of his fathers death and with schemes to supplant his brother geta  he scarcely had entered the enemys country when news was brought him that severus was dead  a sudden peace is patched up with the caledonians and as it appears from dion cassius the country they had lost to severus was restored to them  the caracul of fingal is no other than caracalla who as the son of severus the emperor of rome whose dominions were extended almost over the known world was not without reason called in the poems of ossian the son of the king of the world the space of time between     the year severus died and the beginning of the fourth century is not so great but ossian the son of fingal might have seen the christians whom the persecution under dioclesian had driven beyond the pale of the roman empire  ossian in one of his many lamentations on the death of his beloved son oscar mentions among his great actions a battle which he fought against caros king of ships on the banks of the winding carun caravon winding river it is more than probable that the caros mentioned here is the same with the noted usurper carausius who assumed the purple in the year     and seizing on britain defeated the emperor maximian herculius in several naval engagements which gives propriety to his being called in ossians poems the king of ships the winding carun is that small river retaining still the name of carron and runs in the neighborhood of agricolas wall which carausius repaired to obstruct the incursions of the caledonians several other passages in the poems allude to the wars of the romans but the two just mentioned clearly fix the epoch of fingal to the third century and this account agrees exactly with the irish histories which place the death of fingal the son of comhal in the year     and that of oscar and their own celebrated cairbre in the year      some people may imagine that the allusions to the roman history might have been industriously inserted into the poems to give them the appearance of antiquity this fraud must then have been committed at least three ages ago as the passages in which the allusions are made are alluded to often in the compositions of those times  every one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbarism overspread the north of europe three hundred years ago the minds of men addicted to superstition contracted a narrowness that destroyed genius accordingly we find the compositions of those times trivial and puerile to the last degree but let it be allowed that amidst all the untoward circumstances of the age a genius might arise it is not easy to determine what could induce him to give the honor of his compositions to an age so remote we find no fact that he has advanced to favor any designs which could be entertained by any man who lived in the fifteenth century but should we suppose a poet through humor or for reasons which cannot be seen at this distance of time would ascribe his own compositions to ossian it is next to impossible that he could impose upon his countrymen when all of them were so well acquainted with the traditional poems of their ancestors  the strongest objection to the authenticity of the poems now given to the public under the name of ossian is the improbability of their being handed down by tradition through so many centuries ages of barbarism some will say could not produce poems abounding with the disinterested and generous sentiments so conspicuous in the compositions of ossian and could these ages produce them it is impossible but they must be lost or altogether corrupted in a long succession of barbarous generations  these objections naturally suggest themselves to men unacquainted with the ancient state of the northern parts of britain the bards who were an inferior order of the druids did not share their bad fortune they were spared by the victorious king as it was through their means only he could hope for immortality to his fame they attended him in the camp and contributed to establish his power by their songs his great actions were magnified and the populace who had no ability to examine into his character narrowly were dazzled with his fame in the rhimes of the bards in the mean time men assumed sentiments that are rarely to be met with in an age of barbarism the bards who were originally the disciples of the druids had their minds opened and their ideas enlarged by being initiated in the learning of that celebrated order they could form a perfect hero in their own minds and ascribe that character to their prince the inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct and by degrees brought their minds to that generous spirit which breathes in all the poetry of the times the prince flattered by his bards and rivalled by his own heroes who imitated his character as described in the eulogies of his poets endeavored to excel his people in merit as he was above them in station this emulation continuing formed at last the general character of the nation happily compounded of what is noble in barbarity and virtuous and generous in a polished people  when virtue in peace and bravery in war are the characteristics of a nation their actions become interesting and their fame worthy of immortality a generous spirit is warmed with noble actions and becomes ambitious of perpetuating them this is the true source of that divine inspiration to which the poets of all ages pretended when they found their themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations they varnished them over with fables supplied by their own fancy or furnished by absurd traditions these fables however ridiculous had their abettors posterity either implicitly believed them or through a vanity natural to mankind pretended that they did they loved to place the founders of their families in the days of fable when poetry without the fear of contradiction could give what characters she pleased of her heroes it is to this vanity that we owe the preservation of what remain of the works of ossian his poetical merit made his heroes famous in a country where heroism was much esteemed and admired the posterity of these heroes or those who pretended to be descended from them heard with pleasure the culogiums of their ancestors bards were employed to repeat the poems and to record the connection of their patrons with chiefs so renowned every chief in process of time had a bard in his family and the office became at last hereditary by the succession of these bards the poems concerning the ancestors of the family were handed down from generation to generation they were repeated to the whole clan on solemn occasions and always alluded to in the new compositions o the bards this custom came down near to our own times and after the bards were discontinued a great number in a clan retained by memory or committed to writing their compositions and founded the antiquity of their families on the authority of their poems  the use of letters was not known in the north of europe till long after the institution of the bards the records of the families of their patrons their own and more ancient poems were handed down by tradition their poetical compositions were admirably contrived for that purpose they were adapted to music and the most perfect harmony observed each verse was so connected with those which preceded or followed it that if one line had been remembered in a stanza it was almost impossible to forget the rest the cadences followed in so natural a gradation and the words were so adapted to the common turn of the voice after it is raised to a certain key that it was almost impossible from a similarity of sound to substitute one word for another this excellence is peculiar to the celtic tongue and is perhaps to be met with in no other language nor does this choice of words clog the sense or weaken the expression the numerous flections of consonants and variation in declension make the language very copious  the descendants of the celtae who inhabited britain and its isles were not singular in this method of preserving the most precious monuments of their nation the ancient laws of the greeks were couched in verse and handed down by tradition the spartans through a long habit became so fond of this custom that they would never allow their laws to be committed to writing the actions of great men and the elogiums of kings and heroes were preserved in the same manner all the historical monuments of the old germans were comprehended in their ancient songs tacitus de mor germ which were either hymns to their gods or elegies in praise of their heroes and were intended to perpetuate the great events in their nation which were carefully interwoven them this species of composition was not committed to writing but delivered by oral tradition abbe de la bleterie remarques sur la germany the care they took to have the poems taught to their children the uninterrupted custom of repeating them upon certain occasions and the happy measure of the verse served to preserve them for a long time uncorrupted this oral chronicle of the germans was not forgot in the eighth century and it probably would have remained to this day had not learning which thinks every thing that is not committed to writing fabulous been introduced it was from poetical traditions that garcillasso composed his account of the yncas of peru the peruvians had lost all other monuments of their history and it was from ancient poems which his mother a princess of the blood of the yncas taught him in his youth that he collected the materials of his history if other nations then that had been often overun by enemies and had sent abroad and received colonies could for many ages preserve by oral tradition their laws and histories uncorrupted it is much more probable that the ancient scots a people so free of intermixture with foreigners and so strongly attached to the memory of their ancestors had the works of their bards handed down with great purity  it will seem strange to some that poems admired for many centuries in one part of this kingdom should be hitherto unknown in the other and that the british who have carefully traced out the works of genius in other nations should so long remain strangers to their own this in a great measure is to be imputed to those who understood both languages and never attempted a translation they from being acquainted but with detached pieces or from a modesty which perhaps the present translator ought in prudence to have followed despaired of making the compositions of their bards agreeable to an english reader the manner of those compositions is so different from other poems and the ideas so confined to the most early state of society that it was thought they had not enough of variety to please a polished age  this was long the opinion of the translator of the following collection and though he admired the poems in the original very early and gathered part of them from tradition for his own amusement yet he never had the smallest hopes of seeing them in an english dress he was sensible that the strength and manner of both languages were very different and that it was next to impossible to translate the galic poetry into any thing of tolerable english verse a prose translation he could never think of as it must necessarily fall short of the majesty of an original it was a gentleman who has himself made a figure in the poetical world that gave him the first hint concerning a literal prose translation he tried it at his desire and the specimen was approved other gentlemen were earnest in exhorting him to bring more to the light and it is to their uncommon zeal that the world owes the galic poems if they have any merit  it was at first intended to make a general collection of all the ancient pieces of genius to be found in the galic language but the translator had his reasons for confining himself to the remains of the works of ossian the action of the poem that stands the first was not the greatest or most celebrated of the exploits of fingal his wars were very numerous and each of them afforded a theme which employed the genius of his son but excepting the present poem those pieces are irrecoverably lost and there only remain a few fragments in the hands of the translator tradition has still preserved in many places the story of the poems and many now living have heard them in their youth repeated  the complete work now printed would in a short time have shared the fate of the rest the genius of the highlanders has suffered a great change within these few years the communication with the rest of the island is open and the introduction of trade and manufactures has destroyed that leisure which was formerly dedicated to hearing and repeating the poems of ancient times many have now learned to leave their mountains and seek their fortunes in a milder climate and though a certain amor patriae may sometimes bring them back they have during their absence imbibed enough of foreign manners to despise the customs of their ancestors bards have been long difused and the spirit of genealogy has greatly subsided men begin to be less devoted to their chiefs and consanguinity is not so much regarded when property is established the human mind confines its views to the pleasure it procures it does not go back to antiquity or look forward to succeeding ages the cares of life increase and the actions of other times no longer amuse hence it is that the taste for their ancient poetry is at a low ebb among the highlanders they have not however thrown off the good qualities of their ancestors hospitality still subsists and an uncommon civility to strangers friendship is inviolable and revenge less blindly followed than formerly  to say any thing concerning the poetical merit of the poems would be an anticipation on the judgment of the public the poem which stands first in the collection is truly epic the characters are strongly marked and the sentiments breathe heroism the subject of it is an invasion of ireland by swaran king of lochlin which is the name of scandinavia in the galic language cuchullin general of the irish tribes in the minority of cormac king of ireland upon intelligence of the invasion assembled his forces near tura a castle on the coast of ulster the poem opens with the landing of swaran councils are held battles fought and cuchullin is at last totally defeated in the mean time fingal king of scotland whose aid was solicited before the enemy landed arrived and expelled them from the country this war which continued but six days and as many nights is including the episodes the whole story of the poem the scene is the heath of lena near a mountain called cromleach in ulster  all that can be said of the translation is that it is literal and that simplicity is studied the arrangement of the words in the original is imitated and the inversions of the style observed as the translator claims no merit from his version he hopes for the indulgence of the public where he fails he wishes that the imperfect semblance he draws may not prejudice the world against an original which contains what is beautiful in simplicity and grand in the sublime   fingal an ancient epic poem in six books book i cuchullin cuchullin the son of semo and grandson to caithbat a druid celebrated in tradition for his wisdom and valor cuchullin when very young married bragela the daughter of sorglan and passing over into ireland lived for some time with connal grandson by a daughter to congal the petty king of ulster his wisdom and valor in a short time gained him such reputation that in the minority of cormac the supreme king of ireland he was chosen guardian to the young king and sole manager of the war against swaran king of lochlin after a series of great actions he was killed in battle somewhere in connaught in the twentyseventh year of his age he was so remarkable for his strength that to describe a strong man it has passed into a proverb he has the strength of cuchullin they show the remains of his palace at dunscaich in the isle of sky and a stone to which he bound his dog luath goes still by his name sat by turas wall by the tree of the rustling leaf  his spear leaned against the mossy rock his shield lay by him on the grass as he thought of mighty carbar cairbar or cairbre signifies a strong man  a hero whom he slew in war the scout cuchullin having previous intelligence of the invasion intended by swaran sent scouts all over the coast of ullin or ulster to give early notice of the first appearance of the enemy at the same time that he sent munan the son of stirmal to implore the assistance of fingal he himself collected the flower of the irish youth to tura a castle on the coast to stop the progress of the enemy till fingal should arrive from scotland we may conclude from cuchullins applying so early for foreign aid that the irish were not then so numerous as they have since been which is a great presumption against the high antiquities of that people we have the testimony of tacitus that one legion only was thought sufficient in the time of agricola to reduce the whole island under the roman yoke which would not probably have been the case had the island been inhabited for any number of centuries before of the ocean came moran moran signifies many and fithil or rather fili an inferior bard the son of fithil  rise said the youth cuchullin rise i see the ships of swaran cuchullin many are the foe many the heroes of the darkrolling sea  moran replied the blueeyed chief thou ever tremblest son of fithil thy fears have much increased the so perhaps it is the king fingal the son of comhal and morna the daughter of thaddu his grandfather was trathal and great grandfather trenmor both of whom are often mentioned in the poem of the lonely hills coming to aid me on green ullins plains  i saw their chief says moran tall as a rock of ice his spear is like that blasted fir his shield like the rising moon  his ponderous shield behind him cast the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon milton  he sat on a rock on the shore like a cloud of mist on the silent hill  many chief of men i said many are our hands of war  well art thou named the mighty man but many mighty men are seen from turas walls of wind  he answered like a wave on a rock who in this land appears like me heroes stand not in my presence they fall to earth beneath my hand none can meet swaran in the fight but fingal king of stormy hills once we wrestled on the heath of malmor mealmor  a great hill  and our heels overturned the wood rocks fell from their place and rivulets changing their course fled murmuring from our strife three days we renewed our strife and heroes stood at a distance and trembled on the fourth fingal says that the king of the ocean fell but swaran says he stood let dark cuchullin yield to him that is strong as the storms of malmor  no replied the blueeyed chief i will never yield to man dark cuchullin will be great or dead go fithils son and take my spear strike the sounding shield of cabait cabait or rather cathbait grandfather to the hero was so remarkable for his valor that his shield was made use of to alarm his posterity to the battles of the family we find fingal making the same use of his own shield in the  th book  a horn was the most common instrument to call the army together before the invention of bagpipes  it hangs at turas rustling gate the sound of peace is not its voice my heroes shall hear on the hill  he went and struck the bossy shield the hills and their rocks replied the sound spread along the wood deer start by the lake of roes curach curaoch signifies the madness of battle leapt from the sounding rock and connal of the bloody spear crugals cruthgeal  faircomplexioned breast of

former deeds their souls are kindled at the battles of old and the actions of other times their eyes are like flames of fire and roll in search of the foes of the land  their mighty hands are on their swords and lightning pours from their sides of steel  they came like streams from the mountains each rushed roaring from his hill bright are the chiefs of battle in the armor of their fathers  gloomy

tirchonnuil or tirconnel i e the land of connal speak thou first of men thou breaker of the shields thou have often fought with lochlin shall thou lift up thy fathers spear  cuchullin calm the chief replied the spear of connal is keen it delights to shine in battle and to mix with the blood of thousands but though my hand is bent on war my heart is for the peace of erin erin a name of ireland from car or iar west and in an island this name was not always confined to ireland for there is the highest probability that the ierne of the ancients was britain to the north of the forth  for ierne

be thou like a roe or young heart on the mountains of bether solomons song from malmor like a heart from the ecchoing hills  hail thou son of rossa what shades the soul of war  four stones this passage alludes to the manner of burial among the ancient scots they opened a grave six or eight feet deep the bottom was lined with fine clay and on this they laid the body of the deceased and if a warrior his sword and the heads of twelve arrows by his side above they laid another stratum of clay in which they placed the horn of a deer the symbol of hunting the whole was covered with a fine mold and four stones placed on end to mark the extent of the grave these are the four stones alluded to here  replied the chief rise on the grave of cathbat  these hands have laid in earth duchomar that cloud in war cathbat thou son of torman thou were a sunbeam on the hill  and thou o valiant duchomar like the mist of marshy lano when it sails over the plains of autumn and brings death to the people morna thou fairest of maids calm is thy sleep in the cave of the rock thou have fallen in darkness like a star that shoots athwart the desert when the traveller is alone and mourns the transient beam say said semos blueeyed son say how sell the chiefs of erin fell they by the sons of lochlin striving in the battle of heroes or what confines the chiefs of cromla to the dark and narrow house the grave  the house appointed for all living job   cathbat replied the hero fell by the sword of duchomar at the oak of the noisy streams duchomar came to turas cave and spoke to the lovely morna  morna muirne or morna a woman beloved by all  fairest among women lovely daughter of cormaccairbar why in the circle of stones in the cave of the rock alone the stream murmurs hoarsely the old trees groan is in the wind the lake is troubled before thee and dark are the clouds of the sky but thou art like snow on the heath and thy hair like the mist of cromla when it curls on the rocks and it shines to the beam of the west  thy breasts are like two smooth rocks seen from branno of the streams thy arms like two white pillars in the halls of the mighty fingal  from whence the whitearmed maid replied from whence duchomar the most gloomy of men dark are thy brows and terrible red are thy rolling eyes does swaran appear on the sea what of the foe duchomar  from the hill i

one stately deer for thee  high was his branchy head and fleet his feet of wind  duchomar calm the maid replied i love thee not thou gloomy man  hard is thy heart of rock and dark thy terrible brow but cathbat thou son of torman torman thunder this is the true origin of the jupiter taramis of the ancients  thou art the love of morna thou art like a sunbeam on the hill in the day of the gloomy storm saw thou the son of torman lovely on the hill of his hinds here the daughter of cormac waits the coming of cathbat  and long shall morna wait duchomar said his blood is on my sword  long shall morna wait for him he fell at brannos stream high on cromla i will raise his tomb daughter of cormaccairbar but fix thy love on duchomar his arm is strong as a storm   and is the son of torman fallen said the maid of the tearful eye is he fallen on his ecchoing hill the youth with the breast of snow he that was first in the chase of the hill the foe of the strangers of the ocean  duchomar thou art dark she alludes to his name  the dark man indeed and cruel is thy arm to morna but give me that sword my so i love the blood of caithbat  he gave the sword to her tears but she pierced his manly breast he fell like the bank of a mountainstream stretched out his arm and said  daughter of cormaccairbar thou have slain duchomar the sword is cold in my breast morna i feel it cold give me to moina moina soft in temper and person the maid duchomar was the dream of her night she will raise my tomb and the hunter shall see it and praise me but draw the sword from my breast morna the steel is cold  she came in all her tears she came and drew it from his breast he pierced her white side with steel and spread her fair locks on the ground her bursting blood sounds from her side and her white arm is stained with red rolling in death she lay and turas cave answered to her sighs   peace said cuchullin to the souls of the heroes their deeds were great in danger let them ride around it was the opinion then as indeed it is to this day of some of the highlanders that the souls of the deceased hovered round their living friends and sometimes appeared to them when they were about to enter on any great undertaking me on clouds and show their features of war that my soul may be strong in danger my arm like the thunder of heaven  but be thou on a moonbeam o morna near the window of my rest

three spears by my side and follow the bounding of my steeds that my soul may be strong in my friends when the battle darkens round the beams of my steel  as rushes a stream    hom as torrents roll

though cormacs hundred bards were there to give the war to song feeble were the voices of a hundred bards to send the deaths to future times for many were the falls of the heroes and wide poured the blood of the valiant  mourn ye sons of the song the death of the noble sithallin sithallin signifies a handsome man  fiona a sair maid  and ardan pride   let the sighs of fiona rise on the dark heaths

shetland were at that time subject to the king of lochlin we find that the dogs of trenar are sensible at home of the death of their master the very instant he is killed  it was the opinion of the times that the souls of heroes went immediately after death to the hills of their country and the scenes they frequented the most happy time of their life it was thought too that dogs and horses saw the ghosts of the deceased  bend thy fair head over the waves thou fairer than the ghost of the hills when it moves in a sunbeam at noon over the silence of morven he is fallen thy youth is low pale

raises all his voices around and mixes with the sound of shields  each hero is a pillar of darkness and the sword a beam of fire in his hand the field echoes from wing to wing as a hundred hammers that rise by turns on the red son of the furnace who are these on lenas heath that are so gloomy and dark who are these like two clouds as when two black clouds with heavens artillery fraught come rattling on over the caspian milton and their swords like lightning above them the little hills are troubled around and the rocks tremble with all their moss  who is it but oceans son and the carborne chief of erin many are the anxious eyes of their friends as they see them dim on the heath now night conceals the chiefs in her clouds and ends the terrible fight it was on cromlas shaggy side that dorglas placed the deer the ancient manner of preparing feasts after hunting is handed down by tradition  a pit lined with smooth stones was made and near it stood a heap of smooth flat stones of the flint kind the stones as well as the pit were properly heated with heath then they laid some venison in the bottom and a stratum of the stones above it and thus they did alternately till the pit was full the whole was covered over with heath to confine the steam whether this is probable i cannot say but some pits are shown which the vulgar say were used in that manner  the early fortune of the chase before the heroes left the hill  a hundred youths collect the heath ten heroes blow the fire three hundred choose the polished stones the feast is smoking wide  cuchullin chief of erins war resumed his mighty soul he stood upon his beamy spear and spoke to the son of songs to carril of other times the grayhaired son of kinfena ceanfeana i e the head of the people  is this feast spread for me alone and the king of lochlin on ullins shore far from the deer of his hills and sounding halls of his feasts rise carril of other times and carry my words to swaran tell him from the roaring of waters that cuchullin gives his feast here let him listen to the sound of my groves amidst the clouds of night  for cold and bleak the blustering winds rush over the foam of his seas here let him praise the trembling harp and hear the songs of heroes  old carril went with softest voice and called the king of darkbrown shields rise from the skins of thy chase rise swaran king of groves  cuchullin gives the joy of shells partake the feast of erins blueeyed chief he answered like the sullen sound of cromla before a storm though all thy daughters inisfail should extend their arms of snow raise high the heavings of their breasts and softly roll their eyes of love yet fixed as lochlins thousand rocks here swaran shall remain till morn with the young beams of my east shall light me to the death of cuchullin pleasant to my ear is lochlins wind it rushes over my seas it speaks aloft in all my shrowds and brings my green forests to my mind the green forests of gormal that often ecchoed to my winds when my spear was red in the chase of the boar let dark cuchullin yield to me the ancient throne of cormac or erins torrents shall show from their hills the red foam of the blood of his pride  sad is the sounds of swarans voice said carril of other times   sad to himself alone said the blueeyed son of semo but carril raise thy voice on high and tell the deeds of other times send thou the night away in song and give the joy of grief for many heroes and maids of love have moved on inisfail and lovely are the songs of woe that are heard on albions rocks when the noise of the chase is over and the streams of cona answer to the voice of ossian ossian the son of fingal and author of the poem one cannot but admire the address of the poet in putting his own praise so naturally into the mouth of cuchullin the cona here mentioned is perhaps that small river that runs through glenco in argyleshire one of the hills which environ that romantic valley is still called scornafena or the hill of fingals people   in other days this episode is introduced with propriety calmar and connal two of the irish heroes had disputed warmly before the battle about engaging the enemy carril endeavors to reconcile them with the story of cairbar and grudar who though enemies before fought side by side in the war the poet obtained his aim for we find calmar and connal perfectly reconciled in the third book  carril replies came the sons of ocean to erin a thousand vessels bounded over the waves to ullins lovely plains the sons of inisfail arose to meet the race of darkbrown shields cairbar first of men was there and grudar stately youth long had they strove for the spotted bull that lowed on golbuns golbbhean as well as cromleach signifies a crooked hill ecchoing heath each claimed him as their own and death was often at the point of their steel  side by side the heroes fought and the strangers of ocean fled whose name was fairer on the hill than the name of cairbar and grudar  but ah why ever lowed the bull on golbuns ecchoing heath they saw him leaping like the snow the wrath of the chiefs returned  on lubars lubar  a river in ulster labhar loud noisy grassy banks they fought and grudar like a sunbeam fell fierce cairbar came to the vale of the ecchoing tura where brassolis brassolis signifies a woman with a white breast  fairest of his sisters all alone raised the song of grief she sung of the actions of grudar the youth of her secret soul  she mourned him in the field of blood but still she hoped for his return her white bosom is seen from her robe as the moon from the clouds of night her voice was softer than the harp to raise the song of grief her soul was fixed on grudar the secret look of her eye was his  when shall thou come in thine arms thou mighty in the war   take brassolis cairbar came and said take brassolis this shield of blood fix it on high within my hall the armor of my foe her soft heart beat against her side distracted pale she flew she found her youth in all his blood she died on cromlas heath here rests their dust cuchullin and these two lonely yews sprung from their tombs and wish to meet on high fair was brassolis on the plain and grudar on the hill the bard shall preserve their names and repeat them to future times  pleasant is thy voice o carril said the blueeyed chief of erin and lovely are the words of other times they are like the calm shower homer compares soft piercing words to the fall of snow   but when he speaks what elocution flows like the soft fleeces of descending snows pope of spring when the sun looks on the field and the light cloud flies over the hills o strike the harp in praise of my love the lonely sunbeam of dunscaich strike the harp in the praise of bragela she that i left in the

his alarms  the warriors of the night moved on the rest lay in the heath of the deer and slept amidst the dusky wind  the ghosts it was long the opinion of the ancient scots that a ghost was heard shrieking near the place where a death was to happen soon after the accounts given to this day among the vulgar of this extraordinary matter are very poetical the ghost comes mounted on a meteor and surrounds twice or thrice the place destined for the person to die and then goes along the road through which the funeral is to pass shrieking at intervals at last the meteor and ghost disappear above the burial place of the lately dead were near and swam on gloomy clouds and far distant in the dark silence of lena the feeble voices of death were heard  fingal an ancient epic poem book ii connal the scene of connals repose is familiar to those who have been in the highlands of scotland the poet removes him to a distance from the army to add more horror to the description of crugals ghost by the loneliness of the place it perhaps will not be disagreeable to the reader to see how two other ancient poets handled a similar subject    etc hom ii    when lo the shade before his closing eyes of

or him who made the fainting greeks retire and launched against their navy phrygian fire his hair and beard stood stiffend with his gore and all the wounds he for his country bore dryden lay by the sound of the mountain stream beneath the aged tree a stone with its mos supported his head shrill through the heath of lena he heard the voice of night at distance from the heroes he lay for the son of the sword feared no foe  my hero saw in his rest a darkred stream of fire coming down from the hill crugal sat upon the beam a chief that lately fell he fell by the hand of swaran striving in the battle of heroes his face is like the beam of the setting moon his robes are of the clouds of the hill his eyes are like two decaying flames dark is the wound of his breast  crugal said the mighty connal son of dedgal famed on the hill of deer why so pale and sad thou breaker of the shields thou have never been pale for fear  what disturbs the son of the hill  dim and in tears he stood and stretched his pale hand over the hero  faintly he raised his feeble voice like the gale of the reedy lego  my ghost o connal is on my native hills but my corse is on the sands of ullin thou shall never talk with crugal or find his lone steps in the heath i am light as the blast of cromla and i move like the shadow of mist connal son of colgar i see the dark cloud of death it hovers over the

pope he retired in the midst of the whistling blast stay said the mighty connal stay my darkred friend lay by that beam of heaven son of the windy cromla what cave of the hill is thy lonely house what greenheaded hill is the place of thy rest shall we not hear thee in the storm in the noise of the mountainstream when the feeble sons of the wind come forth and ride on the blast of the desert  the softvoiced connal rose in the midst of his sounding arms he struck his shield above cuchullin the son of battle waked  why said the ruler of the car comes connal through my night my spear might turn against the sound and cuchullin mourn the death of his friend speak connal son of colgar speak thy counsel is like the sun of heaven  son of semo replied the chief the ghost of crugal came from the cave of his hill  the stars himtwinkled through his form and his voice was like the sound of a distant stream  he is a messenger of death  he speaks of the dark and narrow house sue for peace o chief of dunscaich or fly over the heath of lena  he spoke to connal replied the hero though stars dimtwinkled through his form son of colgar it was the wind that murmured in the caves of lena  or if it was the form the poet teaches us the opinions that prevailed in his time concerning the state of separate souls from connals expression that the stars dimtwinkled through the form of crugal and cuchullins reply we may gather that they both thought the soul was material something like the  of the ancient greeks of crugal why did thou not force him to my sight have thou enquired where is his cave the house of the son of the wind my sword might find that voice and force his knowledge from him and small is his knowledge connal for he was here to day he could not have gone beyond our hills and who could tell him there of our death  ghosts fly on clouds and ride on winds said connals voice of wisdom they rest together in their caves and talk of mortal men  then let them talk of mortal men of every man but erins chief let me be forgot in their cave for i will not fly from swaran  if i must fall my tomb shall rise amidst the fame of future times the hunter shall shed a tear on my stone and sorrow dwell round the highbosomed bragela i fear not death but i fear to fly for fingal saw me often victorious thou dim phantom of the hill show thyself to me come on thy beam of heaven and show me my death in thine hand yet i will not fly thou feeble son of the wind go son of colgar strike the shield of caithbat it hangs between the spears let my heroes rise to the sound in the midst of the battles of erin though fingal delays his coming with the race of the stormy hills we shall fight o colgars son and die in the battle of heroes  the sound spreads wide the heroes rise like the breaking of a bluerolling wave they stood on the heath like oaks with all their branches round them  as when heavens fire has scathd the forest oaks or mountain pines with singed tops their slately growth though bare stand on the blasled heath milton  when they echo to the stream of frost and their withered leaves rustle to the wind  high cromlas head of clouds is gray the morning trembles on the halfenlightened ocean the blue gray mist swims slowly by and hides the sons of inisfail  rise ye said the king of the darkbrown shields ye that came from lochlins waves the sons of erin have fled from our arms  pursue them over the plains of lena  and morla go to cormacs hall and bid them yield to swaran before the people shall fall into the tomb and the hills of ullin be silent  they rose like a flock of seafowl when the waves expel them from the shore their sound was like a thousand streams that meet in conas vale when after a stormy night they turn their dark eddies beneath the pale light of the morning  as the dark shades of autumn fly over the hills of grass so gloomy dark successive came the chiefs of lochlins ecchoing woods tall as the stag of morven moved on the king of groves his shining shield is on his side like a flame on the heath at night when the world is silent and dark and the traveller sees some ghost sporting in the beam  a blast from the trouble of ocean removed the settled mist the sons of inisfail appear like a ridge of rocks on the shore  go morla go said lochlins king and offer peace to these offer the terms we give to kings when nations bow before us when the valiant are dead in war and the virgins weeping on the field  great morla came the son of swart and stately strode the king of shields he spoke to erins blueeyed son among the lesser heroes  take swarans peace the warrior spoke the peace he gives to kings when the nations bow before him leave ullins lovely plains to us and give thy spouse and dog thy spouse highbosomd heaving fair thy dog that overtakes the wind give these to prove the weakness of thine arm and live beneath our power  tell swaran tell that heart of pride that cuchullin never yields  i give him the darkblue rolling of ocean or i give his people graves in erin but never shall a stranger have the lovely sunbeam of dunscaich or ever deer fly on lochlins hills before the nimblefooted luath  vain ruler of the car said morla will thou fight the king that king whose ships of many groves could carry off thine isle so little is thy greenhilled ullin to the king of stormy waves  in words i yield to many morla but this sword shall yield to none erin shall own the sway of cormac while connal and cuchullin live o connal first of mighty men thou have heard the words of morla shall thy thoughts then be of peace thou breaker of the shields spirit of fallen crugal why did thou threaten us with death thy narrow house shall receive me in the midst of the light of renown  exalt ye sons of inisfail exalt the spear and bend the bow rush on the foe in darkness as the spirits of stormy nights  then dismal roaring fierce and deep the gloom of battle rolled along as mist  as evening mist risen from a river over the marish glides and gathers round fast at the labrers heel homeward returning milton that is poured on the valley when storms invade the silent sunshine of heaven the chief moves before in arms like an angry ghost before a cloud when meteors enclose him with fire and the dark winds are in his hand  carril far on the heath bids the horn of battle sound he raises the voice of the song and pours his soul into the minds of heroes  where said the mouth of the song where is the fallen crugal he lies forgot on earth and the hall of shells the ancient scot at well as the present highlanders drunk in shells hence it is that we so often meet in the old poetry with the chief of shells and the halls of shells is silent  sad is the spouse of crugal for she is a stranger crugal had married degrena but a little time before the battle consequently she may with propriety be called a stranger in the hall of her sorrow in the hall of her sorrow but who is she that like a sunbeam flies before the ranks of the foe it is degrena deoghrena signifies a sunbeam  lovely fair the spouse of fallen crugal her hair is on the wind behind her eye is red her voice is shrill green empty is thy crugal now his form is in the cave of the hill he comes to the ear of rest and raises his feeble voice like the humming of the mountainbee or collected flies of evening but degrena falls like a cloud of the morn the sword of lochlin is in her side cairbar she is fallen the rising thought of thy youth she is fallen o cairbar the thought of thy youthful hours  fierce cairbar heard the mournful sound and rushed on like oceans whale he saw the death of his daughter and roared in the midst of thousands mediisque in millibus ardet virg  his spear met a son of lochlin and battle spread from wing to wing as a hundred winds in lochlins groves as fire in the firs of a hundred hills so loud so ruinous and vast the ranks of men are hewn down  cuchullin cut off heroes like thistles and swaran wasted erin curach fell by his hand and cairbar of the bossy shield morglan lies in lasting rest and caolt trembles as he dies his white breast is stained with his blood and his yellow hair stretched in the dust of his native land he often had spread the feast where he fell and often raised the voice of the harp when his dogs leapt around for joy and the youths of the chase prepared the bow  still swaran advanced as a stream that bursts from the desert the little hills are rolled in its course and the rocks halfsunk by its side  but cuchullin stood before him like a hill virgil and milton have made use of a comparison similar to this i shall lay both before the reader and let him judge for himself which of these two great poet have best succeeded quanus athos aut quantus eryx aut ipse coruscis cum sremit ilicibus quantus gaudetque ivali vertice se attollens pater appeninus ad auras like eryx or like athos great he shows or father appenine when white with snows his head divine obscure in clouds he hides and shake the sounding forest on his sides dryden on the other side satan alarmed collecting all his might dilated stood like teneriff or atlas unremovd his stature reached the sky milton  that catches the clouds of heaven  the winds contend on its head of pines and the hail rattles on its rocks but firm in its strength it stands and shades the silent vale of cona  so cuchullin shaded the sons of erin and stood in the midst of thousands blood rises like the fount of a rock from panting heroes around him but erin falls on either wing like snow in the day of the sun  o sons of inisfail said grumal lochlin conquers on the field why strive we as reeds against the wind fly to the hill of darkbrown hinds he fled like the stag of morven and his spear is a trembling beam of light behind him few fled with grumal the chief of the little soul they fell in the battle of heroes on lenas ecchoing heath  high on his car of many gems the chief of erin stood he slew a mighty son of lochlin and spoke in haste to connal  o connal first of mortal men thou have taught this arm of death though erins sons have fled shall we not fight the foe o carril son of other times carry my living friends to that bushy hill  here connal let us stand like rocks and save our flying friends  connal mounts the car of light they stretch their shields like the darkened moon the daughter of the starry skies when she moves a dun circle through heaven sithfadda panted up the hill and stronnal haughty steed like waves behind a whale behind them rushed the foe  now on the rising side of cromla stood erins few sad sons like a grove through which the flame had rushed hurried on by the winds of the stormy night  cuchullin stood beside an oak he rolled his red eye in silence and heard the wind in his bushy hair when the scout of ocean came moran the son of fithil  the ships he cried the ships of the lonely isle there fingal comes the first of men the breaker of the shields the waves foam before his black prows his masts with sails are like groves in clouds  blow said cuchullin all ye winds that rush over my isle of lovely mist come to the death of thousands o chief of the hills of hinds thy sails my friend are to me like the clouds of the morning and thy ships like the light of heaven and thou thyself like a pillar of fire that gives light in the night o connal first of men how pleasant are our friends but the night is gathering around where now are the ships of fingal here let us pass the hours of darkness and wish for the moon of heaven  the winds came down on the woods the torrents rushed from the rocks rain gathered round the head of cromla and the red stars trembled between the flying clouds sad by the side of a stream whose sound was ecchoed by a tree sad by the side of a stream the chief of erin sat connal son of colgar was there and carril of other times  unhappy is the hand of cuchullin said the son of semo unhappy is the hand of cuchullin since he slew his friend  ferda thou son of damman i loved thee as myself  how cuchullin son of semo fell the breaker of the shields well i remember said connal the noble son of damman tall and fair he was like the rainbow of the hill  ferda from albion came the chief of a hundred hills in muris an academy in ulster for teaching the use of arms hall he learned the sword and won the friendship of cuchullin we moved to the chase together and one was our bed in the heath  deugala was the spouse of cairbar chief of the plains of ullin she was covered with the light of beauty but her heart was the house of pride she loved that sunbeam of youth the noble son of damman cairbar said the whitearmed woman give me half of the herd no more i will remain in your halls divide the herd dark cairbar  let cuchullin said cairbar divide my herd on the hill his breast is the seat of justice depart thou light of beauty i went and divided the herd one bull of snow remained i gave that bull to cairbar the wrath of deugala rose  son of damman begun the fair cuchullin pains my soul i must hear of his death or lubars stream shall roll over me my pale ghost shall wander near thee and mourn the wound of my pride pour out the blood of cuchullin or pierce this heaving breast  deugala said the fairhaired youth how shall i slay the son of semo he is the friend of my secret thoughts and shall i lift the sword she wept three days before him on the fourth he consented to fight  i will fight my friend deugala but may i fall by his sword could i wander on the hill and behold the grave of cuchullin we fought on the hills of muri our swords avoid a wound they slide on the helmets of steel and sound on the slippery shields deugala was near with a smile and said to the son of damman thine arm is seeble thou sunbeam of youth thy years are not strong for steel  yield to the son of semo he is like the rock of malmor  the tear is in the eye of youth he faultering said to me cuchullin raise thy bossy shield defend thee from the hand of thy friend my soul is laden with grief for i must slay the chief of men  i sighed as the wind in the chink of a rock i lifted high the edge of my steel the sunbeam of the battle fell the first of cuchullins friends   unhappy is the hand of cuchullin since the hero fell  mournful is thy tale son of the car said carril of other times it sends my soul back to the ages of old and to the days of other years  often have i heard of comal who slew the friend he loved yet victory attended his steel and the battle was consumed in his presence  comal was a son of albion the chief of an hundred hills his deer drunk of a thousand streams a thousand rocks replied to the voice of his dogs his face was the mildness of youth his hand the death of heroes one was his love and fair was she the daughter of mighty conloch she appeared like a sunbeam among women and her hair was like the wing of the raven her dogs were taught to the chase her bowstring sounded on the winds of the forest her soul was fixed on comal often met their eyes of love their course in the chase was one and happy were their words in secret  but gormal loved the maid the dark chief of the gloomy ardven he watched her lone steps in the heath the foe of unhappy comal  one day tired of the chase when the mist had concealed their friends comal and the daughter of conloch met in the cave of ronan the unfortunate death of this ronan is the subject of the ninth fragment of ancient poetry published last year it is not the work of ossian though it is writ in his manner and bears the genuine marks of antiquity  the concise expressions of ossian are imitated but the thoughts are too jejune and confined to be the production of that poet  many poems go under his name that have been evidently composed since his time they are very numerous in ireland and some have come to the translators hands they are trivial and dull to the last degree swelling into ridiculous bombast or sinking into the lowest kind of prosaic style  it was the wonted haunt of comal its sides were hung with his arms a hundred shields of thongs were there a hundred helms of sounding steel  rest here he said my love galvina thou light of the cave of ronan a deer appears on moras brow i go but i will soon return i fear she said dark grumal my foe he haunts the cave of ronan i will rest among the arms but soon return my love  he went to the deer of mora the daughter of conloch would try his love she clothed her white sides with his armor and strode from the cave of ronan he thought it was his foe his heart beat high his color changed and darkness dimmed his eyes he drew the bow the arrow flew galvina fell in blood he run with wildness in his steps and called the daughter of conloch no answer in the lonely rock where are thou o my love he saw at length her heaving heart beating around the arrow he threw o conlochs daughter is it thou he sunk upon her breast  the hunters found the hapless pair he afterward walked the hill but many and silent were his steps round the dark dwelling of his love the fleet of the ocean came he fought the strangers fled he searched for his death over the field but who could kill the mighty comal he threw away his darkbrown shield an arrow found his manly breast he sleeps with his loved galvina at the noise of the sounding surge their green tombs are seen by the mariner when he bounds on the waves of the north  fingal an ancient epic poem book iii the second night since the opening of the poem continues and cuchullin connal and carril still sit in the place described in the preceding book the story of agandecca is introduced here with propriety as great use is made of it in the course of the poem and as it in some measure brings about the catastrophe  pleasant are the words of the song said cuchullin and lovely are the tales of other times they are like the calm dew of the morning on the hill of roes when the sun is faint on its side and the lake is settled and blue in the vale o carril raise again thy voice and let me hear the song of tura which was sung in my halls of joy when fingal king of shields was there and glowed at the deeds of his fathers  fingal thou man of battle said carril early were thy deeds in arms lochlin was consumed in thy wrath when thy youth strove with the beauty of maids they smiled at the fairblooming face of the hero but death was in his hands he was strong as the waters of lora his followers were like the roar of a thousand streams they took the king of lochlin in battle but restored him to his ships his big heart swelled with pride and the death of the youth was dark in his soul  for none ever but fingal overcame the strength of the mighty starno starno was the father of swaran as well as agandecca  his fierce and cruel character is well marked in other poems concerning the times   he sat in the hall of his shells in lochlins woody land he called the grayhaired snivan that often sung round the circle this passage most certainly alludes to the religion of lochlin and the stone of power here mentioned is the image of one of the deities of scandanavia of loda when the stone of power heard his cry and the battle turned in the field of the valiant  go grayhaired snivan starno said to ardvens seasurrounded rocks tell to fingal king of the desert he that is the fairest among his thousands tell him i give him my daughter the loveliest maid that ever heaved a breast of snow her arms are white as the foam of my waves her soul is generous and mild let him come with his bravest heroes to the daughter of the secret hall  snivan came to albions windy hills and fairhaired fingal went his kindled soul flew before him as he bounded on the waves of the north  welcome said the darkbrown starno welcome king of rocky morven and ye his heroes of might sons of the lonely isle three days within my halls shall ye feast and three days pursue my boars that your fame may reach the maid that dwells in the secret hall  the king of snow starno is here poetically called the king of snow from the great quantities of snow that fall in his dominions designed their death and gave the feast of shells fingal who doubted the foe kept on his arms of steel the sons of death were afraid and fled from the eyes of the hero the voice of sprightly mirth arose the trembling harps of joy are strung bards sing the battle of heroes or the heaving breast of love  ullin fingals bard was there the sweet voice of the hill of cona he praised the daughter of the snow and morvens all the northwest coast of scotland probably went of old under the name of morven which signifies a ridge of very high hills highdescended chief  the daughter of the snow overheard and left the hall of her secret sigh she came in all her beauty like the moon from the cloud of the east  loveliness was around her as light her steps were like the music of songs she saw the youth and loved him he was the stolen sigh of her soul her blue eye rolled on him in secret and she blessed the chief of morven  the third day with all its beams shone bright on the wood of boars forth moved the darkbrowed starno and fingal king of shields half the day they spent in the chase and the spear of fingal was red in the blood of gormal  it was then the daughter of starno with blue eyes rolling in tears came with her voice of love and spoke to the king of morven  fingal highdescended chief trust not starnos heart of pride within that wood he has placed his chiefs beware of the wood of death but remember son of the hill remember agandecca save me from the wrath of my father king of the windy morven  the youth with unconcern went on his heroes by his side the sons of death fell by his hand and gormal ecchoed around  before the halls of starno the sons of the chase convened the kings dark brows were like clouds his eyes like meteors of night bring hither he cries agandecca to her lovely king of morven his hand is stained with the blood of my people and her words have not been in vain   she came with the red eye of tears she came with her loose raven locks her white breast heaved with sighs like the foam of the streamy lubar starno pierced her side with steel she fell like a wreath of snow that slides from the rocks of ronan when the woods are still and the echo deepens in the vale  then fingal eyed his valiant chiefs his valiant chiefs took arms the gloom of the battle roared and lochlin fled or died  pale in his bounding ship he closed the maid of the raven hair her tomb ascends on ardven and the sea roars round the dark dwelling of agandecca  blessed be her soul said cuchullin and blessed be the mouth of the song  strong was the youth of fingal and strong in his arm of age lochlin shall fall again before the king of ecchoing morven show thy face from a cloud o moon light his white fails on the wave of the night and if any strong spirit this is the only passage in the poem that has the appearance of religion  but cuchullins apostrophe to this spirit is accompanied with a doubt so that it is not easy to determine whether the hero meant a superior being or the ghosts of deceased warriors who were supposed in those times to rule the storms and to transport themselves in a gust of wind from one country to another of heaven sits on that lowhung cloud turn his dark ships from the rock thou rider of the storm  such were the words of cuchullin at the sound of the mountainstream when calmar ascended the hill the wounded son of matha from the field he came in his blood he leaned on his bending spear feeble is the arm of battle but strong the soul of the hero  welcome o son of matha said connal welcome art thou to thy friends why bursts that broken sigh from the breast of him that never feared before  and never connal will he fear chief of the pointed steel my soul brightens in danger and exults in the noise of battle i am of the race of steel my fathers never feared  cormar was the first of my race he sported through the storms of the waves his black skiff bounded on ocean and traveled on the wings of the blast a spirit once embroiled the night seas swell and rocks resound winds drive along the clouds the lightning flies on wings of fire he feared and came to land then blushed that he feared at all he rushed again among the waves to find the son of the wind three youths guide the bounding bark he stood with the sword unsheathed when the lowhung vapor passed he took it by the curling head and searched its dark womb with his steel the son of the wind forsook the air the moon and stars returned  such was the boldness of my race and calmar is like his fathers danger flies from the uplifted sword they best succeed who dare  but now ye sons of greenvallyed erin retire from lenas bloody heath collect the sad remnant of our friends and join the sword of fingal i heard the sound of lochlins advancing arms but calmar will remain and fight my voice shall be such my friends as if thousands were behind me but son of semo remember me remember calmars lifeless corse after fingal has wasted the field place me by some stone of remembrance that future times may hear my fame and the mother of calmar rejoice over the stone of my renown  no son of matha said cuchullin i will never leave thee my joy is in the unequal field and my soul increases in danger connal and carril of other times carry off the sad sons of erin and when the battle is over search for our pale corses in this narrow way for near this oak we shall stand in the stream of the battle of thousands  o fithils son with feet of wind fly over the heath of lena tell to fingal that erin is inthralled and bid the king of morven hasten o let him come like the sun in a storm when he shines on the hills of grass  morning is gray on cromla the sons of the sea ascend calmar stood forth to meet them in the pride of his kindling soul but pale was the face of the warrior he leaned on his fathers spear that spear which he brought from laras hall when the soul of his mother was sad  but slowly now the hero falls like a tree on the plains of cona dark cuchullin stands alone like a rock    etc hom ii    so some tall rock oerhangs the hoary main by winds assailed by billows beat in vain unmoved it hears above the tempests blow and sees the watery mountains break below pope in a sandy vale the sea comes with its waves and roars on its hardened sides its head is covered with foam and the hills are ecchoing around  now from the gray mist of the ocean the whitesailed ships of fingal appear high is the grove of their masts as they nod by turns on the rolling wave  swaran saw them from the hill and returned from the sons of erin as ebbs the resounding sea through the hundred isles of inistore so loud so vast so immense returned the sons of lochlin against the king of the desert hill but bending weeping sad and slow and dragging his long spear behind cuchullin sunk in cromlas wood and mourned his fallen friends he feared the face of fingal who was wont to greet him from the fields of renown  how many lie there of my heroes the chiefs of inisfail they that were cheerful in the hall when the sound of the shells arose no more shall i find their steps in the heath or hear their voice in the chase of the hinds pale silent low on bloody beds are they who were my friends o spirits of the latelydead meet cuchullin on his heath converse with him on the wind when the rustling tree of turas cave resounds there far remote i shall lie unknown no bard shall hear of me no gray stone shall rise to my renown mourn me with the dead o bragela departed is my fame  such were the words of cuchullin when he sunk in the woods of cromla  fingal tall in his ship stretched his bright lance before him terrible was the gleam of the steel it was like the green meteor of death setting in the heath of malmor when the traveller is alone and the broad moon is darkened in heaven  the battle is over said the king and i behold the blood of my friends sad is the heath of lena and mournful the oaks of cromla the hunters have fallen there in their strength and the son of semo is no more  ryno and fillan my sons sound the horn of fingals war ascend that hill on the shore and call the children of the foe call them from the grave of lamdarg the chief of other times  be your voice like that of your father when he enters the battles of his strength i wait for the dark mighty man i wait on lenas shore for swaran and let him come with all his race for strong in battle are the friends of the dead  fair ryno flew like lightning dark fillan as the shade of autumn on lenas heath their voice is heard the sons of ocean heard the horn of fingals war as the roaring eddy of ocean returning from the kingdom of snows so strong so dark so sudden came down the sons of lochlin the king in their front appears in the dismal pride of his arms wrath burns in his darkbrown face and his eyes roll in the fire of his valor  fingal beheld the son of starno and he remembered agandecca  for swaran with the tears of youth had mourned his whitebosomed sister he sent ullin of the songs to bid him to the feast of shells for pleasant on fingals soul returned the remembrance of the first of his loves  ullin came with aged steps and spoke to starnos son o thou that dwell afar surrounded like a rock with thy waves come to the feast of the king and pass the day in rest to morrow let us sight o swaran and break the ecchoing shields  today said starnos wrathful son we break the ecchoing shields tomorrow my feast will be spread and fingal lie on earth  and tomorrow let his feast be spread said fingal with a smile for today o my sons we shall break the ecchoing shields  ossian stand thou near my arm gaul lift thy terrible sword fergus bend thy crooked yew throw fillan thy lance through heaven  lift your shields like the darkened moon be your spears the meteors of death follow me in the path of my fame and equal my deeds in battle  as a hundred winds on morven as the streams of a hundred hills as clouds fly successive over heaven or as the dark ocean assaults the shore of the desert so roaring so vast so terrible the armies mixed on lenas ecchoing heath  the groan of the people spread over the hills it was like the thunder of night when the cloud bursts on cona and a thousand ghosts shriek at once on the hollow wind  fingal rushed on in his strength terrible as the spirit of trenmor when in a whirlwind he comes to morven to see the children of his pride  the oaks resound on their hills and the rocks fall down before him bloody was the hand of my father when he whirled the lightning of his sword he remembers the battles of his youth and the field is wasted in his course  ryno went on like a pillar of fire  dark is the brow of gaul fergus rushed forward with feet of wind and fillan like the mist of the hill  myself here the poet celebrates his own actions but he does it in such a manner that we are not displeased the mention of the great actions of his youth immediately suggests to him the helpless situation of his age we do not despise him for selfish praise but feel his misfortunes  like a rock came down i exulted in the strength of the king many were the deaths of my arm and dismal was the gleam of my sword my locks were not then so gray nor trembled my hands of age my eyes were not closed in darkness nor failed my feet in the race  who can relate the deaths of the people or the deeds of mighty heroes when fingal burning in his wrath consumed the sons of lochlin groans swelled on groans from hill to hill till night had covered all pale staring like a herd of deer the sons of lochlin convene on lena we sat and heard the sprightly harp at lubars gentle stream fingal himself was next to the foe and listened to the tales of bards his godlike race were in the song the chiefs of other times attentive leaning on his shield the king of morven sat the wind whistled through his aged locks and his thoughts are of the days of other years near him on his bending spear my young my lovely oscar stood he admired the king of morven and his actions were swelling in his soul  son of my son begun the king o oscar pride of youth i saw the shining of thy sword and gloried in my race pursue the glory of our fathers and be what they have been when trenmor lived the first of men and trathal the father of heroes they fought the battle in their youth and are the song of bards  o oscar bend the strong in arm but spare the feeble hand be thou a stream of many tides against the foes of thy people but like the gale that moves the grass to those who ask thine aid  so trenmor lived such trathal was and such has fingal been my arm was the support of the injured and the weak rested behind the lightning of my steel  oscar i was young like thee when lovely fainasollis came that sunbeam that mild light of love the daughter of cracas what the craca here mentioned was is not at this distance of time easy to determine the most probable opinion is that it was one of the shetland isles  there is a story concerning a daughter of the king of craca in the sixth book king i then returned from conas heath and few were in my train a whitesailed boat appeared far off we saw it like a mist that rode on oceans blast it soon approached we saw the fair her white breast heaved with sighs the wind was in her loose dark hair her rosy cheek had tears  daughter of beauty calm i said what sigh is in that breast can i young as i am defend thee daughter of the sea my sword is not unmatched in war but dauntless is my heart  to thee i fly with sighs she replied o prince of mighty men to thee i fly chief of the generous shells supporter of the feeble hand the king of cracas ecchoing isle owned me the sunbeam of his race and often did the hills of cromala reply to the sighs of love for the unhappy fainasollis soras chief beheld me fair and loved the daughter of craca his sword is like a beam of light upon the warriors side but dark is his brow and tempests are in his soul i shun him on the rolling sea but soras chief pursues  rest thou i said behind my shield rest in peace thou beam of light the gloomy chief of sora will fly if fingals arm is like his soul in some lone cave i might conceal thee daughter of the sea but fingal never flies for where the danger threatens i rejoice in the storm of spears  i saw the tears upon her cheek i pitied cracas fair  now like a dreadful wave afar appeared the ship of stormy borbar his masts highbended over the sea behind their sheets of snow white roll the waters on either side the strength of ocean sounds come thou i said from the roar of ocean thou rider of the storm partake the feast within my hall it is the house of strangers  the maid stood trembling by my side he drew the bow she fell unerring is thy hand i said but feeble was the foe  we fought nor weak was the strife of death he sunk beneath my sword we laid them in two tombs of stones the hapless lovers of youth  such have i been in my youth o oscar be thou like the age of fingal never search for the battle nor shun it when it comes  fillan and oscar of the darkbrown hair ye children of the race fly over the heath of roaring winds and view the sons of lochlin far off i hear the noise of their fear like the storms of ecchoing cona go that they may not fly my sword along the waves of the north  for many chiefs of erins race lie here on the dark bed of death the children of the storm are low the sons of ecchoing cromla  the heroes flew like two dark clouds two dark clouds that are the chariots of ghosts when airs dark children come to frighten hapless men  it was then that gaul gaul the son of morni was chief of a tribe that disputed long the preeminence with fingal himself they were reduced at last to obedience and gaul from an enemy turned fingals best friend and greatest hero his character is something like that of ajax in the iliad a hero of more strength than conduct in battle he was very fond of military fame and here he demands the next battle to himself  the poet by an artifice removes fingal that his return may be the more magnificent  the son of morni stood like a rock in the night his spear is glittering to the stars his voice like many streams  son of battle cried the chief o fingal king of shells let the bards of many songs sooth erins friends to rest and fingal sheath thy sword of death and let thy people fight we wither away without our fame for our king is the only breaker of shields when morning rises on our hills behold at a distance our deeds let lochlin feel the sword of mornis son that bards may sing of me such was the custom heretofore of fingals noble race such was thine own thou king of swords in battles of the spear  o son of morni fingal replied i glory in thy fame  fight but my spear shall be near to aid thee in the midst of danger raise raise the voice sons of the song and lull me into rest here will fingal lie amidst the wind of night  and if thou agandecca art near among the children of thy land if thou sit on a blast of wind among the highshrowded masts of lochlin come to my dreams the poet prepares us for the dream of fingal in the next book  my fair one and show thy bright face to my soul  many a voice and many a harp in tuneful sounds arose of fingals noble deeds they sung and of the noble race of the hero and sometimes on the lovely sound was heard the name of the now mournful ossian  often have i fought and often won in battles of the spear but blind and tearful and forlorn i now walk with little men o fingal with thy race of battle i now behold thee not the wild roes feed upon the green tomb of the mighty king of morven  blessed be thy soul thou king of swords thou most renowned on the hills of cona  fingal an ancient epic poem book iv fingal being asleep and the action suspended by night the poet introduces the story of his courtship of evirallin the daughter of branno the episode is necessary to clear up several passages that follow in the poem at the same time that it naturally brings on the action of the book which may be supposed to begin about the middle of the third night from the opening of the poem  this book as many of ossians other compositions is addressed to the beautiful malvina the daughter of toscar she appears to have been in love with oscar and to have affected the company of the father after the death of the son  who comes with her songs from the mountain like the bow of the showery lena it is the maid of the voice of love the whitearmed daughter of toscar often have thou heard my song and given the tear of beauty do thou come to the battles of thy people and to hear the actions of oscar when shall i cease to mourn by the streams of the ecchoing cona my years have passed away in battle and my age is darkened with sorrow  daughter of the hand of snow i was not so mournful and blind i was not so dark and forlorn when everallin loved me everallin with the darkbrown hair the whitebosomed love of cormac a thousand heroes sought the maid she denied her love to a thousand the sons of the sword were despised for graceful in her eyes was ossian  i went in suit of the maid to legos sable surge twelve of my people were there the sons of the streamy morven we came to branno friend of strangers branno of the sounding mail  from whence he said are the arms of steel not easy to win is the maid that has denied the blueeyed sons of erin but blessed be thou o son of fingal happy is the maid that waits thee though twelve daughters of beauty were mine thine were the choice thou son of fame  then he opened the hall of the maid the darkhaired everallin joy kindled in our breasts of steel and blessed the maid of branno  above us on the hill appeared the people of stately cormac eight were the heroes of the chief and the heath flamed with their arms there colla durra of the wounds there mighty toscar and tago there frestal the victorious stood dairo of the happy deeds and dala the battles bulwark in the narrow way  the sword flamed in the hand of cormac and graceful was the look of the hero  eight were the heroes of ossian ullin stormy son of war mullo of the generous deeds the noble the graceful scelacha oglan and cerdal the wrathful and dumariccans brows of death and why should ogar be the last so wide renowned on the hills of ardven  ogar met dala the strong face to face on the field of heroes the battle of the chiefs was like the wind on oceans foamy waves the dagger is remembered by ogar the weapon which he loved nine times he drowned it in delas side the stormy battle turned three times i broke on cormacs shield three times he broke his spear but unhappy youth of love i cut his head away  five times i shook it by the lock the friends of cormac fled  whoever would have told me lovely maid when then i strove in battle that blind forsaken and forlorn i now should pass the night firm ought his mail to have been and unmatched his arm in battle  now the poet returns to his subject if one could six the time of the year in which the action of the poem happened from the scene described here i should be tempted to place it in autumn  the trees shed their leaves and the winds are variable both which circumstances agree with that season of the year on lenas gloomy heath the voice of music died away the unconstant blast blew hard and the high oak shook its leaves around me of everallin were my thoughts when she in all the light of beauty and her blue eyes rolling in tears stood on a cloud before my sight and spoke with feeble voice  o ossian rise and save my son save oscar prince of men near the red oak of lubars stream he fights with lochlins sons  she sunk into her cloud again i clothed me with my steel my spear supported my steps and my rattling armor rung i hummed as i was wont in danger the songs of heroes of old like distant thunder ossian gives the reader a high idea of himself his very song frightens the enemy this passage resembles one in the eighteenth iliad where the voice of achilles frightens the trojans from the body of patroclus forth marched the chief and distant from the crowd high on the rampartraisd his voice aloud so high his brazen voice the hero reared hosts drop their arms and trembled as they feared pope lochlin heard they fled my son pursued  i called him like a distant stream my son return over lena no further pursue the foe though ossian is behind thee  he came and lovely in my ear was oscars sounding steel why did thou stop my hand he said till death had covered all for dark and dreadful by the stream they met thy son and fillan they watched the terrors of the night our swords have conquered some but as the winds of night pour the ocean over the white sands of mora so dark advance the sons of lochlin over lenas rustling heath the ghosts of night shriek afar and i have seen the meteors of death let me awake the king of morven he that smiles in danger for he is like the sun of heaven that rises in a storm  fingal had strated from a dream and leaned on trenmors shield the darkbrown shield of his fathers which they had lifted of old in the battles of their race  my hero had seen in his rest the mournful form of agandecca she came from the way of the ocean and slowly lonely moved over lena her face was pale like the mist of cromla and dark were the tears of her cheek she often raised her dim hand from her robe her robe which was of the clouds of the desert she raised her dim hand over fingal and turned away her silent eyes  why weeps the daughter of starno said fingal with a sigh why is thy face so pale thou daughter of the clouds  she departed on the wind of lena and left him in the midst of the night  she mourned the sons of her people that were to fall by fingals hand  the hero started from rest and still beheld her in his soul  the sound of oscars steps approached the king saw the gray shield on his side for the faint beam of the morning came over the waters of ullin  what do the foes in their fear said the rising king of morven or fly they through oceans foam or wait they the battle of steel but why should fingal ask i hear their voice on the early wind  fly over lenas heath o oscar and awake our friends to battle  the king stood by the stone of lubar and thrice reared his terrible voice the deer started from the fountains of cromla and all the rocks shook on their hills like the noise of a hundred mountainstreams that burst and roar and foam like the clouds that gather to a tempest on the blue face of the sky so met the sons of the desert round the terrible voice of fingal for pleasant was the voice of the king of morven to the warriors of his land for often had he led them to battle and returned with the spoils of the foe  come to battle said the king ye children of the storm come to the death of thousands comhals son will see the fight  my sword shall wave on that hill and be the shield of my people but never may you need it warriors while the son of morni fights the chief of mighty men  he shall lead my battle that his fame may rise in the song  o ye ghosts of heroes dead ye riders of the storm of cromla receive my falling people with joy and bring them to your hills  and may the blast of lena carry them over my seas that they may come to my silent dreams and delight my soul in rest  fillan and oscar of the darkbrown hair fair ryno with the pointed steel advance with valor to the fight and behold the son of morni let your swords be like his in the strife and behold the deeds of his hands protect the friends of your father and remember the chiefs of old my children i will see you yet though here ye should fall in erin soon shall our cold pale ghosts meet in a cloud and fly over the hills of cona  now like a dark and stormy cloud edged round with the red lightning of heaven and flying westward from the mornings beam the king of hills removed terrible is the light of his armor and two spears are in his hand  his gray hair falls on the wind  he often looks back on the war three bards attend the son of fame to carry his words to the heroes  high on cromlas side he sat waving the lightning of his sword and as he waved we moved  joy rose in oscars face his cheek is red his eye sheds tears the sword is a beam of fire in his hand he came and smiling spoke to ossian  o ruler of the fight of steel my father hear thy son retire with morvens mighty chief and give me ossians fame and if here i fall my king remember that breast of snow that lonely sunbeam of my love the whitehanded daughter of toscar for with red cheek from the rock and bending over the stream her soft hair flies about her bosom as she pours the sigh for oscar tell her i am on my hills a lightlybounding son of the wind that hereafter in a cloud i may meet the lovely maid of toscar  raise oscar rather raise my tomb i will not yield the fight to thee for first and bloodiest in the war my arm shall teach thee how to fight but remember my son to place this sword this bow and the horn of my deer within that dark and narrow house whose mark is one gray stone oscar i have no love to leave to the care of my son for graceful evirallin is no more the lovely daughter of branno  such were our words when gauls loud voice came growing on the wind he waved on high the sword of his father and rushed to death and wounds  as waves whitebubbling over the deep come swelling roaring on as rocks of ooze meet roaring waves so foes attacked and fought man met with man and steel with steel shields sound men fall as a hundred hammers on the son of the furnace so rose so rung their swords  gaul rushed on like a whirlwind in ardven the destruction of heroes is on his sword swaran was like the fire of the desert in the ecchoing heath of gormal how can i give to the song the death of many spears my sword rose high and flamed in the strife of blood and oscar terrible were thou my best my greatest son i rejoiced in my secret soul when his sword flamed over the slain they fled amain through lenas heath and we pursued and slew as stones that bound from rock to rock as axes in ecchoing woods as thunder rolls from hill to hill in dismal broken peals so blow succeeded to blow and death to death from the hand of oscar ossian never fails to give a fine character of his beloved son his speech to his father is that of a hero it contains the submission due to a parent and the warmth that becomes a young warrior there is a propriety in dwelling here on the actions of oscar as the beautiful malvina to whom the book is addressed was in love with that hero and mine  but swaran closed round mornis son as the strength of the tide of inistore the king halfrose from his hill at the sight and halfassumed the spear go ullin go my aged bard begun the king of morven remind the mighty gaul of battle remind him of his fathers support the yielding fight with song for song enlivens war tall ullin went with steps of age and spoke to the king of swords  son the warsong of ullin varies from the rest of the poem in the versification it runs down like a torrent and consists almost entirely of epithets the custom of encouraging men in battle with extempore rhymes has been carried down almost to our own times several of these warsongs are extant but the most of them are only a group of epithets without beauty or harmony utterly destitute of poetical merit of the chief of generous steeds highbounding king of spears strong arm in every perilous toil hard heart that never yields chief of the pointed arms of death cut down the foe let no white sail bound round dark inistore be thine arm like thunder thine eyes like fire thy heart of solid rock whirl round thy sword as a meteor at night and lift thy shield like the flame of death son of the chief of generous steeds cut down the foe destroy  the heros heart beat high but swaran came with battle he cleft the shield of gaul in twain and the sons of the desert fled  now fingal arose in his might and thrice he reared his voice cromla answered around and the sons of the desert stood still  they bent their red faces to earth ashamed at the presence of fingal he came like a cloud of rain in the days of the sun when slow it rolls on the hill and fields expect the shower swaran beheld the terrible king of morven and stopped in the midst of his course dark he leaned on his spear rolling his red eyes around silent and tall he seemed as an oak on the banks of lubar which had its branches blasted of old by the lightning of heaven  it bends over the stream and the gray moss whistles in the wind so stood the king then slowly he retired to the rising heath of lena his thousands pour around the hero and the darkness of battle gathers on the hill  fingal like a beam from heaven shone in the midst of his people his heroes gather around him and he sends forth the voice of his power raise my standards the imperial ensign which full high advanced shone like a meteor streaming to the wind milton on high  spread them on lenas wind like the flames of an hundred hills let them sound on the winds of erin and remind us of the fight ye sons of the roaring streams that pour from a thousand hills be near the king of morven attend to the words of his power gaul strongest arm of death o oscar of the future fights connal son of the blue blades of sora dermid of the darkbrown hair and ossian king of many songs be near your fathers arm  we reared the sunbeam fingals standard was distinguished by the name of sunbeam probably on account of its bright color and its being studded with gold to begin a battle is expressed in old composition by lifting of the sunbeam of battle the standard of the king each heros soul exulted with joy as waving it flew on the wind it was studded with gold above as the blue wide shell of the nightly sky each hero had his standard too and each his gloomy men  behold said the king of generous shells how lochlin divides on lena  they stand like broken clouds on the hill or an half consumed grove of oaks when we see the sky through its branches and the meteor passing behind let every chief among the friends of fingal take a dark troop of those that frown so high nor let a son of the ecchoing groves bound on the waves of inistore  mine said gaul be the seven chiefs that came from lanos lake  let inistores dark king said oscar come to the sword of ossians son  to mine the king of iniscon said connal heart of steel or mudans chief or i said brownhaired dermid shall sleep on claycold earth my choice though now so weak and dark was termans battling king i promised with my hand to win the heros darkbrown shield  blessed and victorious be my chiefs said fingal of the mildest look swaran king of roaring waves thou art the choice of fingal  now like an hundred different winds that pour through many vales divided dark the sons of the hill advanced and cromla ecchoed around  how can i relate the deaths when we closed in the strife of our steel o daughter of toscar bloody were our hands the gloomy ranks of lochlin fell like the banks of the roaring cona  our arms were victorious on lena each chief fulfilled his promise beside the murmur of branno thou did often sit o maid when thy white bosom rose frequent like the down of the swan when slow she sails the lake and sidelong winds are blowing  thou have seen the sun sol quoque and exoriens and cum se condit in undas signa dabit solemn certissima signa sequunur ut quae mane refert and quae surgentibus astris ille ubi nascentem maculis variaverit ortum conditus in nubem medioque refugerit orb suspecti tibi sunt imbres virg above the rest the sun who never lies foretells the change of weather in the skies for if he rise unwilling to his race clouds on his brow and spots upon his face or if through mists he shoots his sullen beams frugal of light in loose and straggling streams suspect a drisling day dryden retire red and slow behind his cloud night gathering round on the mountain while the unfrequent blast continuo ventis surgentibus

working seas advance to wash the shore soft whispers run along the leafy wood and mountains whistle to the murmuring flood dryden roared in narrow vales at length the rain beats hard and thunder rolls

torrents swell the creeping rills dryden comes roaring down the hills such was the noise of battle maid of the arms of snow why daughter of the hill that tear the maids of lochlin have cause to weep the people of their country fell for bloody were the blue blades of the race of my heroes but i am sad forlorn and blind and no more the companion of heroes give lovely maid to me thy tears for i have seen the tombs of all my friends  it was then by fingals hand a hero fell to his grief  grayhaired he rolled in the dust and lifted his faint eyes to the king and is it by me thou have fallen said the son of comhal thou friend of agandecca i have seen thy tears for the maid of my love in the halls of the bloody starno thou have been the foe of the foes of my love and have thou fallen by my hand raise ullin raise the grave of the son of mathon and give his name to the song of agandecca for dear to my soul have thou been thou darklydwelling maid of ardven  cuchullin from the cave of cromla heard the noise of the troubled war he called to connal chief of swords and carril of other times the grayhaired heroes heard his voice and took their aspen spears  they came and saw the tide of battle like the crowded waves of the ocean when the dark wind blows from the deep and rolls the billows through the sandy vale  cuchullin kindled at the sight and darkness gathered on his brow his hand is on the sword of his fathers his redrolling eyes on the foe he thrice attempted to rush to battle and thrice did connal stop him chief of the isle of mist he said fingal subdues the foe seek not a part of the fame of the king himself is like the storm  then carril go replied the chief and greet the king of morven when lochlin falls away like a stream after rain and the noise of the battle is over then be thy voice sweet in his ear to praise the king of swords give him the sword of caithbat for cuchullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers  but o ye ghosts of the lonely cromla ye souls of chiefs that are no more be ye the companions of cuchullin and talk to him in the cave of his sorrow for never more shall i be renowned among the mighty in the land i am like a beam that has shone like a mist that fled away when the blast of the morning came and brightened the shaggy side of the hill connal talk of arms no more departed is my fame  my sighs shall be on cromlas wind till my footsteps cease to be seen  and thou whitebosomd bragela mourn over the fall of my fame for vanquished i will never return to thee thou sunbeam of dunscaich  fingal an ancient epic poem book v the fourth day still continues the poet by putting the narration in the mouth of connal who still remained with cuchullin on the side of cromla gives propriety to the praises of fingal the beginning of this book in the original is one of the most beautiful parts of the poem the versification is regular and full and agrees very well with the sedate character of connal  no poet has adapted the cadence of his verse more to the temper of the speaker than ossian has done it is more than probable that the whole poem was originally designed to be sung to the harp as the versification is so various and so much suited to the different passions of the human mind  now connal on cromlas windy side spoke to the chief of the noble car why that gloom son of semo our friends are the mighty in battle and renowned art thou o warrior many were the deaths of thy steel often has bragela met with bluerolling eyes of joy often has she met her hero returning in the midst of the valiant when his sword was red with slaughter and his foes silent in the fields of the tomb pleasant to her ears were thy bards when thine actions rose in the song  but behold the king of morven he moves below like a pillar of fire his strength is like the stream of lubar or the wind of the ecchoing cromla when the branchy forests of night are overturned  happy are thy people o fingal thine arm shall fight their battles thou art the first in their dangers the wisest in the days of their peace thou speak and thy thousands obey and armies tremble at the sound of thy steel happy are thy people fingal chief of the lonely hills  who is that so dark and terrible coming in the thunder of his course who is it but starnos son to meet the king of morven behold the battle of the chiefs it is like the storm of the ocean when two spirits meet far distant and contend for the rolling of the wave the hunter hears the noise on his hill and sees the high billows advancing to ardvens shore  such were the words of connal when the heroes met in the midst of their falling people there was the clang of arms there every blow like the hundred hammers of the furnace terrible is the battle of the kings and horrid the look of their eyes their darkbrown shields are cleft in twain and their steel flies broken from their helmets they ling their weapons down each rushes this passage resembles one in the twenty third iliad close locked above their heads and arms are mixed below their planted feet at distance fixed now to the grasp each manly body bends the humid sweat from every pore descends their bones resound with blows sides shoulders thighs swell to each gripe and bloody tumors rise pope to his heros grasp their sinewy arms bend round each other they turn from side to side and strain and stretch their large spreading limbs below but when the pride of their strength arose they shook the hill with their heels rocks tumble from their places on high the greenheaded bushes are overturned at length the strength of swaran fell and the king of the groves is bound  thus have i been on cona but cona i behold no more thus have i seen two dark hills removed from their place by the strength of the bursting stream they turn from side to side and their tall oaks meet one another on high then they fall together with all their rocks and trees the streams are turned by their sides and the red ruin is seen afar  sons of the king of morven said the noble fingal guard the king of lochlin for he is strong as his thousand waves his hand is taught to the battle and his race of the times of old gaul thou first of my heroes and ossian king of songs attend the friend of agandecca and raise to joy his grief  but oscar fillan and ryno ye children of the race pursue the rest of lochlin over the heath of lena that no vessel may hereafter bound on the darkrolling waves of inistore  they flew like lightning over the heath he slowly moved as a cloud of thunder when the sultry plain of summer is silent his sword is before him as a sunbeam terrible as the streaming meteor of night he came toward a chief of lochlin and spoke to the son of the wave  who is that like a cloud at the rock of the roaring stream he cannot bound over its course yet stately is the chief his bossy shield is on his side and his spear like the tree of the desert youth of the darkbrown hair art thou of fingals foes  i am a son of lochlin he cries and strong is my arm in war my spouse is weeping at home but orla the story of orla is so beautiful and affecting in the original that many are in possession of it in the north of scotland who never heand a syllable more of the poem it varies the action and awakes the attention of the reader when he expected nothing but languor in the conduct of the poem as the great action was over in the conquest of swaran will never return  or fights or yields the hero said fingal of the noble deeds foes do not conquer in my presence but my friends are renowned in the hall son of the wave follow me partake the feast of my shells and pursue the deer of my desert  no said the hero i assist the feeble my strength shall remain with the weak in arms my sword has been always unmatched o warrior let the king of morven yield  i never yielded orla fingal never yielded to man draw thy sword and choose thy foe many are my heroes  and does the king refuse the combat said orla of the darkbrown hair fingal is a match for orla and he alone of all his race  but king of morven if i shall fall as one time the warrior must die raise my tomb in the midst and let it be the greatest on lena and send over the darkblue wave the sword of orla to the spouse of his love that she may show it to her son with tears to kindle his soul to war  son of the mournful tale said fingal why do thou awaken my tears one day the warriors must die and the children see their useless arms in the hall but orla thy tomb shall rise and thy whitebosomed spouse weep over thy sword  they fought on the heath of lena but feeble was the arm of orla the sword of fingal descended and cleft his shield in twain it fell and glittered on the ground as the moon on the stream of night  king of morven said the hero lift thy sword and pierce my breast wounded and faint from battle my friends have left me here the mournful tale shall come to my love on the banks of the streamy loda when she is alone in the wood and the rustling blast in the leaves  no said the king of morven i will never wound thee orla on the banks of loda let her see thee escaped from the hands of war let thy grayhaired father who perhaps is blind with age hear the sound of thy voice in his hall  with joy let the hero rise and search for his son with his hands  but never will he find him fingal said the youth of the streamy loda  on lenas heath i shall die and foreign bards will talk of me my broad belt covers my wound of death and now i give it to the wind  the dark blood poured from his side he fell pale on the heath of lena fingal bends over him as he dies and calls his younger heroes  oscar and fillan my sons raise high the memory of orla here let the darkhaired hero rest far from the spouse of his love here let him rest in his narrow house far from the sound of loda the sons of the feeble will find his bow at home but will not be able to bend it his faithful dogs howl on his hills and his boars which he used to pursue rejoice fallen is the arm of battle the mighty among the valiant is low  exalt the voice and blow the horn ye sons of the king of morven let us go back to swaran and send the night away on song fillan oscar and ryno fly over the heath of lena where ryno art thou young son of fame thou art not wont to be the last to answer thy father  ryno said ullin first of bards is with the awful forms of his fathers with trathal king of shields and trenmor of the mighty deeds the youth is low  the youth is pale  he lies on lenas heath  and fell the swiftest in the race said the king the first to bend the bow thou scarce have been known to me why did young ryno fall but sleep thou softly on lena fingal shall soon behold thee soon shall my voice be heard no more and my footsteps cease to be seen the bards will tell of fingals name the stones will talk of me but ryno thou art low indeed  thou have not received thy fame ullin strike the harp for ryno tell what the chief would have been farewell thou first in every field no more shall i direct thy dart thou that have been so fair i behold thee not  farewell  the tear is on the cheek of the king for terrible was his son in war his son that was like a beam of fire by night on the hill when the forests sink down in its course and the traveller trembles at the sound  whose fame is in that darkgreen tomb begun the king of generous shells four stones with their heads of moss stand there and mark the narrow house of death near it let my ryno rest and be the neighbor of the valiant perhaps some chief of fame is here to fly with my son on clouds o ullin raise the songs of other times bring to memory the dark dwellers of the tomb if in the field of the valiant they never fled from danger my son shall rest with them far from his friends on the heath of lena  here said the mouth of the song here rest the first of heroes silent is lamderg lamhdhearg signifies bloody hand gelchossa white legged tuathal surly ulfadda longbeard ferchios the conqueror of men in this tomb and ullin king of swords and who soft smiling from her cloud shows me her face of love why daughter why so pale art thou first of the maids of cromla do thou sleep with the foes in battle gelchossa whitebosomed daughter of tuathal  thou have been the love of thousands but lamderg was thy love he came to selmas mossy towers and striking his dark buckler spoke  where is gelchossa my love the daughter of the noble tuathal i left her in the hall of selma when i fought with the gloomy ulfadda return soon o lamderg she said for here i am in the midst of sorrow her white breast rose with sighs her cheek was wet with tears but i see her not coming to meet me and to sooth my soul after battle silent is the hall of my joy i hear not the voice of the bard  bran bran is a common name of grayhounds to this day it is a custom in the north of scotland to give the names of the heroes mentioned in this poem to their dogs a proof that they are familiar to the ear and their fame generally known does not shake his chains at the gate glad at the coming of lamderg where is gelchossa my love the mild daughter of the generous tuathal  lamderg says ferchios the son of aidon gelchossa may be on cromla she and the maids of the bow pursuing the flying deer  ferchios replied the chief of cromla no noise meets the ear of lamderg no sound is in the woods of lena no deer fly in my sight no panting dog pursues i see not gelchossa my love sair as the full moon setting on the hills of cromla go ferchios go to allad allad is plainly a druid he is called the son of the rock from his dwelling in a cave and the circle of stones here mentioned is the pale of the druidical temple he is here consulted as one who had a supernatural knowledge of things from the druids no doubt came the ridiculous notion of the second sight which prevailed in the highlands and isles the grayhaired son of the rock his dwelling is in the circle of stones he may know of gelchossa  the son of aidon went and spoke to the ear of age allad thou that dwell in the rock thou that tremblest alone what saw thine eyes of age  i saw answered allad the old ullin the son of cairbar he came like a cloud from cromla and he hummed a surly song like a blast in a leafless wood he entered the hall of selma  lamderg he said most dreadful of men fight or yield to ullin lamderg replied gelchossa the son of battle is not here he fights ulfada mighty chief he is not here thou first of men but lamderg never yielded he will fight the son of cairbar  lovely art thou said terrible ullin daughter of the generous tuathal i carry thee to cairbars halls the valiant shall have gelchossa three days i remain on cromla to wait that son of battle lamderg on the fourth gelchossa is mine if the mighty lamderg flies  allad said the chief of cromla peace to thy dreams in the cave ferchios sound the horn of lamderg that ullin may hear on cromla lamderg the reader will find this passage altered from what it was in the fragments of ancient poetry  it is delivered down very differently by tradition and the translator has chosen that reading which savours least of bombast  like a roaring storm ascended the hill from selma he hummed a surly song as he went like the noise of a falling stream he stood like a cloud on the hill that varies its form to the wind he rolled a stone the sign of war ullin heard in cairbars hall the hero heard with joy his foe and took his fathers spear a smile brightens his darkbrown cheek as he places his sword by his side the dagger glittered in his hand he whistled as he went  gelchossa saw the silent chief as a wreath of mist ascending the hill  she struck her white and heaving breast and silent tearful feared for lamderg  cairbar hoary chief of shells said the maid of the tender hand i must bend the bow on cromla for i see the darkbrown hinds  she hasted up the hill in vain the gloomy heroes fought  why should i tell the king of morven how wrathful heroes fight  fierce ullin fell young lamderg came all pale to the daughter of generous tuathal  what blood my love the softhaired woman said what blood runs down my warriors side  it is ullins blood the chief replied thou fairer than the snow of cromla gelchossa let me rest here a little while the mighty lamderg died  and sleep thou so soon on earth o chief of shady cromla three days she mourned beside her love  the hunters found her dead they raised this tomb above the three thy son o king of morven may rest here with heroes  and here my son will rest said fingal the noise of their fame has reached my ears fillan and fergus bring hither orla the pale youth of the stream of loda not unequalled shall ryno lie in earth when orla is by his side weep ye daughters of morven and ye maids of the streamy loda like a tree they grew on the hills and they have fallen like the oak    hom ii     as the mountain oak nods to the ax till with a groaning sound it sinks and spreads its honors on the ground pope of the desert when it lies across a stream and withers in the wind of the mountain  oscar chief of every youth thou see how they have fallen be thou like them on earth renowned like them the song of bards terrible were their forms in battle but calm was ryno in the days of peace he was like the bow  a bow conspicuous with three listed colors gay  what mean those colored streaks in heaven distended as the brow of god appeased or serve they as a flowery verge to bind the fluid skirts of that same watery cloud milton of the shower seen far distant on the stream when the sun is setting on mora and silence on the hill of deer rest youngest of my sons rest o ryno on lena we too shall be no more for the warrior one day must fall  such was thy grief thou king of hills when ryno lay on earth what must the grief of ossian be for thou thyself art gone i hear not thy distant voice on cona my eyes perceive thee not often forlorn and dark i sit at thy tomb and feel it with my hands when i think i hear thy voice it is but the blast of the desert  fingal has long since fallen asleep the ruler of the war  then gaul and ossian sat with swaran on the soft green banks of lubar i touched the harp to please the king but gloomy was his brow he rolled his red eyes toward lena the hero mourned his people  i lifted my eyes to cromla and i saw the son of generous semo  sad and slow he retired from his hill toward the lonely cave of tura he saw fingal victorious and mixed his joy with grief the sun is bright on his armor and connal slowly followed they sunk behind the hill like two pillars of the fire of night when winds pursue them over the mountain and the flaming heath resounds beside a stream of roaring foam his cave is in a rock one tree bends above it and the rushing winds echo against its sides here rests the chief of dunscaich the son of generous semo his thoughts are on the battles he lost and the tear is on his cheek he mourned the departure of his fame that fled like the mist of cona o bragela thou art too far remote to cheer the soul of the hero but let him see thy bright form in his soul that his thoughts may return to the lonely sunbeam of dunscaich  who comes with the locks of age it is the son of the songs hail carril of other times thy voice is like the harp in the halls of tura thy words are pleasant as the shower that falls on the fields of the sun carril of the times of old why come thou from the son of the generous semo  ossian king of swords replied the bard thou best raisest the song long have thou been known to carril thou ruler of battles often have i touched the harp to lovely evirallin thou too have often accompanied my voice in brannos hall of generous shells and often amidst our voices was heard the mildest evirallin one day she sung of cormacs fall the youth that died for her love i saw the tears on her cheek and on thine thou chief of men her soul was touched for the unhappy though she loved him not how fair among a thousand maids was the daughter of the generous branno  bring not carril i replied bring not her memory to my mind my soul must melt at the remembrance my eyes must have their tears pale in the earth is she the softlyblushing fair of my love  but sit thou on the heath o bard and let us hear thy voice it is pleasant as the gale of spring that sighs on the hunters ear when he wakens from dreams of joy and has heard the music of the spirits  others more mild retreated in a silent valley sing with notes angelical   the harmony what could it less when spirits immortal sing suspended hell and took with ravishment the thronging audience milton of the hill  fingal an ancient epic poem book vi this book opens with the fourth night and ends on the morning of the sixth day the time of five days five nights and a part of the sixth day is taken up in the poem the scene lies in the heath of lena and the mountain cromla on the coast of ulster  the clouds of night came rolling down and rest on cromlas darkbrown steep the stars of the north arise over the rolling of the waves of ullin they show their heads of fire through the flying mist of heaven a distant wind roars in the wood but silent and dark is the plain of death  still on the darkening lena arose in my ears the tuneful voice of carril he sung of the companions of our youth and the days of former years when we met on the banks of lego and sent round the joy of the shell cromla with its cloudy steeps answered to his voice the ghosts of those he sung came in their rustling blasts they were seen to bend with joy toward the sound of their praise  be thy soul blessed o carril in the midst of thy eddying winds o that thou would come to my hall when i am alone by night  and thou do come my friend i hear often thy light hand on my harp when it hangs on the distant wall and the feeble sound touches my ear why do thou not speak to me in my grief and tell when i shall behold my friends but thou passest away in thy murmuring blast and thy wind whistles through the gray hair of ossian  now on the side of mora the heroes gathered to the feast a thousand aged oaks are burning to the wind  the strength by the strength of the shell is meant the liquor the heroes drunk of what kind it was cannot be ascertained at this distance of time the translator has met with several ancient poems that mention waxlights and wine as common in the halls of fingal the names of both are borrowed from the latin which plainly shows that our ancestors had them from the romans if they had them at all the caledonians in their frequent incursions to the province might become acquainted with those conveniences of life and introduce them into their own country among the booty which they carried from south britain of the shells goes round and the souls of warriors brighten with joy but the king of lochlin is silent and sorrow reddens in the eyes of his pride he often turned toward lena and remembered that he fell  fingal leaned on the shield of his fathers his gray locks slowly waved on the wind and glittered to the beam of night he saw the grief of swaran and spoke to the first of bards  raise ullin raise the song of peace and sooth my soul after battle that my ear may forget the noise of arms and let a hundred harps be near to gladden the king of lochlin he must depart from us with joy  none ever went sad from fingal oscar the lightning of my sword is against the strong in battle but peaceful it lies by my side when warriors yield in war  trenmor trenmor was great grandfather to fingal the story is introduced to facilitate the dismission of swaran  said the mouth of the songs lived in the days of other years he bounded over the waves of the north companion of the storm the high rocks of the land of lochlin and its groves of murmuring sounds appeared to the hero through the mist  he bound his whitebosomed sails  trenmor pursued the boar that roared along the woods of gormal many had fled from its presence but the spear of trenmor slew it  three chiefs that beheld the deed told of the mighty stranger they told that he stood like a pillar of fire in the bright arms of his valor the king of lochlin prepared the feast and called the blooming trenmor three days he feasted at gormals windy towers and got his choice in the combat  the land of lochlin had no hero that yielded not to trenmor the shell of joy went round with songs in praise of the king of morven he that came over the waves the first of mighty men  now when the fourth gray morn arose the hero launched his ship and walking along the silent shore waited for the rushing wind for loud and distant he heard the blast murmuring in the grove  covered over with arms of steel a son of the woody gormal appeared red was his cheek and fair his hair his skin like the snow of morven mild rolled his blue and smiling eye when he spoke to the king of swords  stay trenmor stay thou first of men thou have not conquered lonvals son my sword has often met the brave and the wise shun the strength of my bow  thou fairhaired youth trenmor replied i will not fight with lonvals son thine arm is feeble sunbeam of beauty retire to gormals darkbrown hinds  but i will retire replied the youth with the sword of trenmor and exult in the sound of my fame the virgins shall gather with smiles around him who conquered trenmor they shall sigh with the sighs of love and admire the length of thy spear when i shall carry it among thousands and lift the glittering point to the sun  thou shall never carry my spear said the angry king of morven  thy mother shall find thee pale on the shore of the ecchoing gormal and looking over the darkblue deep see the fails of him that slew her son  i will not lift the spear replied the youth my arm is not strong with years but with the feathered dart i have learned to pierce a distant foe throw down that heavy mail of steel for trenmor is covered all over  i first will lay my mail on earth  throw now thy dart thou king of morven  he saw the heaving of her breast it was the sister of the king  she had seen him in the halls of gormal and loved his face of youth  the spear dropped from the hand of trenmor he bent his red cheek to the ground for he had seen her like a beam of light that meets the sons of the cave when they revisit the fields of the sun and bend their aching eyes  chief of the windy morven begun the maid of the arms of snow let me rest in thy bounding ship far from the love of corlo for he like the thunder of the desert is terrible to inibaca he loves me in the gloom of his pride and shakes ten thousand spears  rest thou in peace said the mighty trenmor behind the shield of my fathers i will not fly from the chief though he shakes ten thousand spears  three days he waited on the shore and sent his horn abroad he called corlo to battle from all his ecchoing hills but corlo came not to battle the king of lochlin descended he feasted on the roaring shore and gave the maid to trenmor  king of lochlin said fingal thy blood flows in the veins of thy foe our families met in battle because they loved the strife of spears but often did they feast in the hall and send round the joy of the shell  let thy face brighten with gladness and thine far delight in the harp dreadful as the storm of thine ocean thou have poured thy valor forth thy voice has been like the voice of thousands when they engage in battle raise tomorrow thy white sails to the wind thou brother of agandecca bright as the beam of noon she comes on my mournful soul i have seen thy tears for the fair one and spared thee in the halls of starno when my sword was red with slaughter and my eye full of tears for the maid  or do thou choose the fight the combat which thy fathers gave to trenmor is thine that thou may depart renowned like the sun setting in the west  king of the race of morven said the chief of the waves of lochlin never will swaran fight with thee first of a thousand heroes i have seen thee in the halls of starno and few were thy years beyond my own  when shall i i said to my soul lift the spear like the noble fingal we have fought heretofore o warrior on the side of the shaggy malmor after my waves had carried me to thy halls and the feast of a thousand shells was spread let the bards send him who overcame to future years for noble was the strife of heathy malmor  but many of the ships of lochlin have lost their youths on lena take these thou king of morven and be the friend of swaran and when thy sons shall come to the mossy towers of gormal the feast of shells shall be spread and the combat offered on the vale  nor ship replied the king shall fingal take nor land of many hills the desert is enough to me with all its deer and woods rise on thy waves again thou noble friend of agandecca spread thy white sails to the beam of the morning and return to the ecchoing hills of gormal  blessed be thy soul thou king of shells said swaran of the darkbrown shield in peace thou art the gale of spring in war the mountainstorm take now my hand in friendship thou noble king of morven  let thy bards mourn those who fell let erin give the sons of lochlin to earth and raise the mossy stones of their fame that the children of the north hereafter may behold the place where their fathers fought and some hunter may say when he leans on a mossy tomb here fingal and swaran fought the heroes of other years thus hereafter shall he say and our fame shall last for ever  swaran said the king of the hills today our fame is greatest we shall pass away like a dream no sound will be in the fields of our battles our tombs will be lost in the heath the hunter shall not know the place of our rest our names may be heard in the song but the strength of our arms will cease  o ossran carril and ullin you know of heroes that are no more give us the song of other years let the night pass away on the sound and morning return with joy  we gave the song to the kings and a hundred harps accompanied our voice the face of swaran brightened like the full moon of heaven when the clouds vanish away and leave her calm and broad in the midst of the sky  it was then that fingal spoke to carril the chief of other times where is the son of semo the king of the isle of mist has he retired like the meteor of death to the dreary cave of tura  cuchullin said carril of other times lies in the dreary cave of tura his hand is on the sword of his strength his thoughts on the battles which he lost mournful is the king of spears for he has often been victorious he sends the sword of his war to rest on the side of fingal for like the storm of the desert thou have scattered all his foes take o fingal the sword of the hero for his fame is departed like mist when it flies before the rustling wind of the vale  no replied the king fingal shall never take his sword his arm is mighty in war and tell him his fame shall never fail many have been overcome in battle that have shone afterward like the sun of heaven  o swaran king of the resounding woods give all thy grief away  the vanquished if brave are renowned they are like the sun in a cloud when he hides his face in the south but looks again on the hills of grass  grumal was a chief of cona he sought the battle on every coast his soul rejoiced in blood his ear in the din of arms he poured his warriors on the sounding craca and cracas king met him from his grove for then within the circle of brumo this passage alludes to the religion of the king of craca see a note on a similar subject in the third book he spoke to the stone of power  fierce was the battle of the heroes for the maid of the breast of snow the fame of the daughter of craca had reached grumal at the streams of cona he vowed to have the whitebosomed maid or die on the ecchoing craca three days they strove together and grumal on the fourth was bound  far from his friends they placed him in the horrid circle of brumo where often they said the ghosts of the dead howled round the stone of their fear but afterward he shone like a pillar of the light of heaven they fell by his mighty hand and grumal had his fame  raise ye bards of other times raise high the praise of heroes that my soul may settle on their fame and the mind of swaran cease to be sad  they lay in the heath of mora the dark winds rustle over the heroes  a hundred voices at once arose a hundred harps were strung they sung of other times and the mighty chiefs of former years  when now shall i hear the bard or rejoice at the fame of my fathers the harp is not strung on morven nor the voice of music raised on cona dead with the mighty is the bard and fame is in the desert no more  morning trembles with the beam of the cast and glimmers on gray headed cromla over lena is heard the horn of swaran and the sons of the ocean gather around  silent and sad they mount the wave and the blast of ullin is behind their sails white as the mist of morven they float along the sea  call said fingal call my dogs the longbounding sons of the chase call whitebreasted bran and the surly strength of luath  fillan and ryno  but he is not here my son rests on the bed of death fillan and fergus blow my horn that the joy of the chase may arise that the deer of cromla may hear and start at the lake of roes  the shrill sound spreads along the wood the sons of heathy cromla arise  a thousand dogs fly off at once graybounding through the divided heath a deer fell by every dog and three by the whitebreasted bran he brought them in their flight to fingal that the joy of the king might be great  one deer fell at the tomb of ryno and the grief of fingal returned he saw how peaceful lay the stone of him who was the first at the chase  no more shall thou rise o my son to partake of the feast of cromla soon will thy tomb be hid and the grass grow rank on thy grave the sons of the feeble shall pass over it and shall not know that the mighty lie there  ossian and fillan sons of my strength and gaul king of the blue blades of war let us ascend the hill to the cave of tura and find the chief of the battles of erin  are these the walls of tura gray and lonely they rise on the heath the king of shells is sad and the halls are desolate come let us find the king of swords and give him all our joy  but is that cuchullin o fillan or a pillar of smoke on the heath the wind of cromla is on my eyes and i distinguish not my friend  fingal replied the youth it is the son of semo gloomy and sad is the hero his hand is on his sword hail to the son of battle breaker of the shields  hail to thee replied cuchullin hail to all the sons of morven delightful is thy presence o fingal it is like the sun on cromla when the hunter mourns his absence for a season and sees him between the clouds thy sons are like stars that attend thy course and give light in the night  it is not thus thou have seen me o fingal returning from the wars of the desert when the kings of the world this is the only passage in the poem wherein the wars of fingal against the romans are alluded to  the roman emperor is distinguished in old composition by the title of king of the world had fled and joy returned to the hill of hinds  many are thy words cuchullin said connan connan was of the family of morni he is mentioned in several other poems and always appears with the same character the poet passed him over in silence till now and his behavior here deserves no better usage of the small renown thy words are many son of semo but where are thy deeds in arms why did we come over the ocean to aid thy feeble sword thou flyest to thy cave of sorrow and connan fights thy battles resign to me these arms of light yield them thou son of erin  no hero replied the chief ever sought the arms of cuchullin and had a thousand heroes sought them it were in vain thou gloomy youth i fled not to the cave of sorrow as long as erins warriors lived  youth of the feeble arm said fingal connan say no more cuchullin is renowned in battle and terrible over the desert often have i heard thy fame thou stormy chief of inisfail spread now thy white sails for the isle of mist and see bragela leaning on her rock her tender eye is in tears and the winds lift her long hair from her heaving breast she listens to the winds of night to hear the voice of thy rowers the practice of singing when they row northwest coast of scotland and the isles is universal among the inhabitants of the it deceives time and inspirits the rowers  to hear the song of the sea and the sound of thy distant harp  and long shall she listen in vain cuchullin shall never return how can i behold bragela to raise the sigh of her breast fingal i was always victorious in the battles of other spears  and hereafter thou shall be victorious said fingal king of shells the fame of cuchullin shall grow like the branchy tree of cromla many battles await thee o chief and many shall be the wounds of thy hand  bring hither oscar the deer and prepare the seast of shells that our souls may rejoice after danger and our friends delight in our presence  we sat we feasted and we sung the soul of cuchullin rose the strength of his arm returned and gladness brightened on his face  ullin gave the song and carril raised the voice i often joined the bards and sung of battles of the spear  battles where i often fought but now i fight no more the fame of my former actions is ceased and i sit forlorn at the tombs of my friends  thus they passed the night in the song and brought back the morning with joy fingal arose on the heath and shook his glittering spear in his hand  he moved first toward the plains of lena and we followed like a ridge of fire  spread the sail said the king of morven and catch the winds that pour from lena  we rose on the wave with songs and rushed with joy through the foam of the ocean it is allowed by the best critics that an epic poem ought to end happily this rule in its most material circumstances is observed by the three most deservedly celebrated poets homer virgil and milton yet i know not how it happens the conclusions of their poems throw a melancholy damp on the mind one leaves his reader at a funeral another at the untimely death of a hero and a third in the solitary scenes of an unpeopled world  homer such honors ilion to her hero paid and peaceful slept the mighty hectors shade pope  ferrum adverso sub pectore condit fervidus ast illi solvuntur frigore membra vitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbras virgil he raised his arm aloft and at the word deep in his bosom drove the shining sword the streaming blood distained his arms around and the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound dryden they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow through eden took their solitary way milton   comala a dramatic poem this poem is valuable on account of the light it throws on the antiquity of ossians compositions the caracul mentioned here is the same with caracalla the son of severus who in the year     commanded an expedition against the caledonians  the variety of the measure shows that the poem was originally set to music and perhaps presented before the chiefs upon solemn occasions  tradition has handed down the story more complete than it is in the poem  comala the daughter of sarno king of inistore or orkney islands fell in love with fingal the son of comhal at a feast to which her father had invited him fingal b iii upon his return from lochlin after the death of agandecca her passion was so violent that she followed him disguised like a youth who wanted to be employed in his wars she was soon discovered by hidallan the son of lamor one of fingals heroes whose love she had slighted some time before  her romantic passion and beauty recommended her so much to the king that he had resolved to make her his wife when news was brought him of caraculs expedition he marched to stop the progress of the enemy and comala attended him  he left her on a hill within sight of caraculs army when he himself went to battle having previously promised if he survived to return that night the sequel of the story may be gathered from the poem itself  the persons fingal hidallan comala daughters of morni melilcoma dersagrena bards dersagrena the chase is over  no noise on ardven but the torrents roar  daughter of

between thy clouds that i may behold the light of his steel on the field of his promise  or rather let the meteor that lights our departed fathers through the night come with its red light to show me the way to my fallen hero who will defend me from sorrow who from the love of hidallan long shall comala look before she can behold fingal in the midst of his host bright as the beam of the morning in the cloud of an early shower   hidallan hidallan was sent by fingal to give notice to comala of his return he to revenge himself on her for slighting his love some time before told her that the king was killed in battle he even pretended that he carried his body from the field to be buried in her presence and this circumstance makes it probable that the poem was presented of old roll thou mist of gloomy crona roll on the path of the hunter hide his steps from mine eyes and let me remember my friend no more the bands of battle are scattered and no crowding steps are round the noise of his steel o carun roll thy streams of blood for the chief of the people fell   comala who fell on caruns grassy banks son of the cloudy night was he white as the snow of ardven blooming as the bow of the shower was his hair like the mist of the hill soft and curling in the day of the sun was he like the thunder of heaven in battle fleet as the roe of the desert   hidallan o that i might behold his love fairleaning from her rock her red eye dim in tears and her blushing cheek half hid in her locks blow thou gentle breeze and lift the heavy locks of the maid that i may behold her white arm and lovely

thee over thy plains and destruction overtake thee thou king of the world few be thy steps to thy grave and let one virgin mourn thee let her be like comala tearful in the days of her youth  why have thou told me hidallan that my hero fell i might have hoped a little while his return and have thought i saw him on the distant rock a tree might have deceived me with his appearance and the wind of the hill been the sound of his horn in mine ear o that i were on the banks of carun that my tears might be warm on his cheek   hidalllan he lies not on the banks of carun on ardven heroes raise his tomb look on them o moon from thy clouds be thy beam bright on his breast that comala may behold him in the light of his armor   comala stop ye sons of the grave till i behold my love he left me at the chase alone i knew not that he went to war he said he would return with the night and the king of morven is returned why did thou not tell me that he would fall o trembling son of the rock by the son of the rock she means a druid it is probable that some of the order of the druids remained as late as the beginning of the reign of fingal and that comala had consulted one of them concerning the event of the war with caracul  thou have seen him in the blood of his youth but thou did not tell comala   melilcoma what sound is that on ardven who is that bright in the vale who comes like the strength of rivers when their crowded waters glitter to the moon   comala who is it but the foe of comala the son of the king of the world ghost of fingal do thou from thy cloud direct comalas bow let him fall like the heart of the desert  it is fingal in the crowd of his ghosts  why do thou come my love to frighten and please my soul   fingal raise ye bards of the song the wars of the streamy carun caracul has fled from my arms along the fields of his pride he sets far distant like a meteor that incloses a spirit of night when the winds drive it over the heath and the dark woods are

secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice solomons song  my love and let me hear the voice of comala   comala take me to the cave of thy rest o lovely son of death

comala he is returned with his fame i feel the right hand of his battles  but i must rest beside the rock till my soul settle from fear  let the harp be near and raise the song ye daughters of morni   dersagrena comala has slain three deer on ardven and the fire ascends on the rock go to the feast of comala king of the woody morven   fingal raise ye sons of the song the wars of the streamy carun that my whitehanded maid may rejoice while i behold the feast of my love   bards roll streamy carun roll in joy the sons of battle fled the steed is not seen on our fields and the wings perhaps the poet alludes to the roman eagle of their pride spread in other lands the sun will now rise in peace and the shadows descend in joy the voice of the chase will be heard and the shields hang in the hall our delight will be in the war of the ocean and our hands be red in the blood of lochlin roll streamy carun roll in joy the sons of battle fled   melilcoma descend ye light mists from high ye moonbeams lift her soul  pale lies the maid at the rock comala is no more   fingal is the daughter of sarno dead the whitebosomed maid of my love meet me comala on my heaths when i sit alone at the streams of my hills   hidallan ceased the voice of the huntress of galmal why did i trouble the soul of the maid when shall i see thee with joy in the chase of the darkbrown hinds   fingal youth of the gloomy brow no more shall thou feast in my halls thou shall not pursue my chase and my foes shall not fall by thy sword the sequel of the story of hidallan is introduced as an episode in the poem which immediately follows in this collection   lead me to the place of her rest that i may behold her beauty  pale she lies at the rock and the cold winds lift her hair her bowstring sounds in the blast and her arrow was broken in her fall raise the praise of the daughter of sarno and give her name to the wind of the hills   bards see meteors roll around the maid and moonbeams lift her soul

still stood fixed to hear milton  and they shall think with joy on the dreams of their rest meteors roll around the maid and moonbeams lift her soul   the war of caros caros is probably the noted usurper carausius by birth a menapian who assumed the purple in the year     and seizing on britain defeated the emperor maximian herculius in several naval engagements which gives propriety to his being called in this poem the king of ships  he repaired agricolas wall in order to obstruct the incursions of the caledonians and when he was employed in that work it appears he was attacked by a party under the command of oscar the son of ossian this battle is the foundation of the present poem which is addressed to malvina the daughter of toscar  a poem bring daughter of toscar bring the harp the light of the song rises in ossians soul it is like the field when darkness covers the hills around and the shadow grows slowly on the plain of the sun  i behold my son o malvina near the mossy rock of crona crona is the name of a small stream which runs into the carron on its banks is the scene of the preceding dramatic poem  but it is the mist who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke solomons song of the desert tinged with the beam of the west lovely is the mist that assumes the form of oscar turn from it ye winds when ye roar on the side of ardven  who comes toward my son with the murmur of a song his staff is in his hand his gray hair loose on the wind surly joy lightens his face and he often looks back to caros it is ryno ryno is often mentioned in the ancient poetry  he seems to have been a bard of the first rank in the days of fingal of the song he that went to view the foe  what does caros king of ships said the son of the now mournful ossian spreads he the wings the roman eagle of his pride bard of the times of old  he spreads them oscar replied the bard but it is behind his gathered heap agricolas wall which carausius repaired  he looks over his stones with fear and beholds thee terrible as the ghost of night that rolls the wave to his ships  go thou first of my bards says oscar and take the spear of fingal fix a flame on its point and shake it to the winds of heaven bid him in songs to advance and leave the rolling of his wave tell to caros that i long for battle and that my bow is weary of the chase of cona tell him the mighty are not here and that my arm is young  he went with the murmur of his song oscar reared his voice on high it reached his heroes on ardven like the noise of a cave  as when the hollow rocks retain the sound of blustering winds  milton  when the sea of togorma rolls before it and its trees meet the roaring winds  they gather round my son like the streams of the hill when after rain they roll in the pride of their course  ryno came to the mighty caros and struck his flaming spear come to the battle of oscar o thou that sit on the rolling of waters fingal is distant far he hears the songs of his bards in morven and the wind of his hall is in his hair his terrible spear is at his side and his shield that is like that darkened moon come to the battle of oscar the hero is alone  he came not over the streamy carun the river carron  the bard returned with his song gray night grows dim on crona the feast of shells is spread a hundred oaks burn to the wind and faint light gleams over the heath the ghosts of ardven pass through the beam and show their dim and distant forms comala this is the scene of comalas death which is the subject of the dramatic poem  the poet mentions her in this place in order to introduce the sequel of hidallans story who on account of her death had been expelled from the wars of singal is halfunseen on her meteor and hidallan is sullen and dim like the darkened moon behind the mist of night  why art thou sad said ryno for he alone beheld the chief why art thou sad hidallan have thou not received thy fame the songs of ossian have been heard and thy ghost has brightened in the wind when thou did bend from thy cloud to hear the song of morvens bard  and do thine eyes behold the hero said oscar like the dim meteor of night say ryno say how fell the chief that was so renowned in the days of our fathers  his name remains on the rocks of cona and i have often seen the streams of his hills  fingal replied the bard had driven hidallan from his wars the kings soul was sad for comala and his eyes could not behold hidallan  lonely sad along the heath he slowly moved with silent steps his arms hang disordered on his side his hair flies loose from his helmet the tear is in his downcast eyes and the sigh halfsilent in his breast  three days he strayed unseen alone before he came to lamors halls the mossy halls of his fathers at the stream of balva this is perhaps that small stream still retaining the name of balva which runs through the romantic valley of glentivar in stirlingshire balva signifies a silent stream and glentivar the sequestered vale   there lamor sat alone beneath a tree for he had sent his people with hidallan to war the stream ran at his feet and his gray head rested on his staff sightless are his aged eyes he hums the song of other times  the noise of hidallans feet came to his ear he knew the tread of his son  is the son of lamor returned or is it the sound of his ghost have thou fallen on the banks of carun son of the aged lamor or if i hear the sound of hidallans feet where are the mighty in the war where are my people hidallan that were wont to return with their echoing shields  have they fallen on the banks of carun  no replied the sighing youth the people of lamor live they are renowned in battle my father but hidallan is renowned no more i must sit alone on the banks of balva when the roar of the battle grows  but thy fathers never sat alone replied the rising pride of lamor they never sat alone on the banks of balva when the roar of battle rose  do thou not behold that tomb my eyes discern it not there rests the noble garmallon who never fled from war  come thou renowned in battle he says come to thy fathers tomb  how am i renowned garmallon for my son has fled from war  king of the streamy balva said hidallan with a sigh why do thou torment my soul lamor i never feared  fingal was sad for comala and denied his wars to hidallan go to the gray streams of thy land he said and moulder like a leafless oak which the winds have bent over balva never more to grow  and must i hear lamor replied the lonely tread of hidallans feet when thousands are renowned in battle shall he bend over my gray streams spirit of the noble garmallon carry lamor to his place his eyes are dark his soul is sad and his son has lost his fame  where said the youth shall i search for same to gladden the soul of lamor from whence shall i return with renown that the sound of my arms may be pleasant in his ear  if i go to the chase of hinds my name will not be heard  lamor will not feel my dogs with his hands glad at my arrival from the hill he will not enquire of his mountains or of the darkbrown deer of his deserts  i must fall said lamor like a leafless oak it grew on a rock but the winds have overturned it  my ghost will be seen on my hills mournful for my young hidallan will not ye ye mists as ye rise hide him from my sight  my son  go to lamors hall there the arms of our fathers hang  bring the sword of garmallon  he took it from a foe  he went and brought the sword with all its studded thongs  he gave it to his father the grayhaired hero felt the point with his hand   my son  lead me to garmallons tomb it rises beside that rustling tree the long grass is withered  i heard the breeze whistling there  a little fountain murmurs near and sends its water to balva there let me rest it is noon and the sun is on our fields  he led him to garmallons tomb lamor pierced the side of his son  they sleep together and their ancient halls moulder on balvas banks  ghosts are seen there at noon the valley is silent and the people shun the place of lamor  mournful is thy tale said oscar son of the times of old  my soul sighs for hidallan he fell in the days of his youth he flies on the blast of the desert and his wandering is in a foreign land   sons of the ecchoing morven draw near to the foes of fingal send the night away in songs and watch the strength of caros oscar goes to the people of other times to the shades of silent ardven where his fathers sit dim in their clouds and behold the future war  and art thou there hidallan like a halfextinguished meteor come to my sight in thy sorrow chief of the roaring balva  the heroes move with their songs  oscar slowly ascends the hill  the meteors of night set on the heath before him a distant torrent faintly roars  unfrequent blasts rush through aged oaks the halfenlightened moon sinks dim and red behind her hill  feeble voices are heard on the heath  oscar drew his sword  come said the hero o ye ghosts of my fathers ye that fought against the kings of the world  tell me the deeds of future times and your converse in your caves when you talk together and behold your sons in the fields of the valiant  trenmor came from his hill at the voice of his mighty son  a cloud like the steed of the stranger supported his airy limbs his robe is of the mist of lano that brings death to the people his sword is a green meteor halfextinguished his face is without form and dark he sighed thrice over the hero and thrice the winds of the night roared around many were his words to oscar but they only came by halves to our ears they were dark as the tales of other times before the light of the song arose he slowly vanished like a mist that melts on the sunny hill  it was then o daughter of toscar my son begun first to be sad he foresaw the fall of his race and at times he was thoughtful and dark like the sun  caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit virg when he carries a cloud on his face but he looks afterward on the hills of cona  oscar passed the night among his fathers gray morning met him on the banks of carun  a green vale surrounded a tomb which arose in the times of old little hills lift their head at a distance and stretch their old trees to the wind the warriors of caros sat there for they had passed the stream by night they appeared like the trunks of aged pines to the pale light of the morning  oscar stood at the tomb and raised thrice his terrible voice the rocking hills ecchoed around the starting roes bounded away and the trembling ghosts of the dead fled shrieking on their clouds so terrible was the voice of my son when he called his friends  a thousand spears rose around the people of caros rose  why daughter of toscar why that tear my son though alone is brave oscar is like a beam of the sky he turns around and the people fall his hand is like the arm of a ghost when he stretches it from a cloud the rest of his thin form is unseen but the people die in the vale  my son beheld the approach of the foe and he stood in the silent darkness of his strength  am i alone said oscar in the midst of a thousand foes  many a spear is there  many a darklyrolling eye  shall i fly to ardven  but did my fathers ever fly  the mark of their arm is in a thousand battles  oscar too will be renowned  come ye dim ghosts of my fathers and behold my deeds in war  i may fall but i will be renowned like the race of the ecchoing morven this passage is very like the soliloquy of ulysses upon a similar occasion    etc hom ii    what farther subterfuge what hopes remain what shame inglorious if i quit the plain what danger singly if i stand the ground my friends all scattered all the foes around yet wherefore doubtful let this truth suffice the brave meets danger and the coward flies to die or conquer proves a heros heart and knowing this i know a soliders part pope   he stood growing in his place like the flood of the narrow vale the battle came but they fell bloody was the sword of oscar  the noise reached his people at crona they came like a hundred streams the warriors of caros fled and oscar remained like a rock left by the ebbing sea  now dark and deep with all his steeds caros rolled his might along the little streams are lost in his course and the earth is rocking round  battle spreads from wing to wing ten thousand swords gleam at once in the sky  but why should ossian sing of battles  for never more shall my steel shine in war i remember the days of my youth with sorrow when i feel the weakness of my arm happy are they who fell in their youth in the midst of their renown  they have not beheld the tombs of their friend or failed to bend the bow of their strength  happy art thou o oscar in the midst of thy rushing blast thou often go to the fields of thy fame where caros fled from thy lifted sword  darkness comes on my soul o fair daughter of toscar i behold not the form of my son at carun nor the figure of oscar on crona the rustling winds have carried him far away and the heart of his father is sad  but lead me o malvina to the found of my woods and the roar of my mountain streams let the chase be heard on cona that i may think on the days of other years  and bring me the harp o maid that i may touch it when the light of my soul shall arise  be thou near to learn the song and future times shall hear of ossian  the sons of the feeble hereafter will lift the voice on cona and looking up to the rocks say here ossian dwelt they shall admire the chiefs of old and the race that are no more while we ride on our clouds malvina on the wings of the roaring winds our voices shall be heard at times in the desert and we shall sing on the winds of the rock  the war of inisthona inisthona i e the island of waves was a country of scandinavia subject to its own king but depending upon the kingdom of lochlin  this poem is an episode introduced in a great work composed by ossian in which the actions of his friends and his beloved son oscar were interwoven  the work itself is lost but some episodes and the story of the poem are handed down by tradition there are some now living who in their youth have heard the whole repeated  a poem our youth is like the dream of the hunter on the hill of heath he sleeps in the mild beams of the sun but he awakes amidst a storm the red lightning flies around and the trees shake their heads to the wind he looks back with joy on the day of the sun and the pleasant dreams of his rest  when shall ossians youth return or his ear delight in the sound of arms when shall i like oscar travel traveling in the greatness of his strength isaiah lxiii   in the light of my steel  come with your streams ye hills of cona and listen to the voice of ossian the song rises like the sun in my soul and my heart feels the joys of other times  i behold thy towers o selma and the oaks of thy shaded wall  thy streams sound in my ear thy heroes gather round fingal sits in the midst and leans on the shield of trenmor  his spear stands against the wall he listens to the song of his bards  the deeds of his arm are heard and the actions of the king in his youth  oscar had returned from the chase and heard the heros praise  he took the shield of branno this is branno the father of everallin and grandfather to oscar he was of irish extraction and lord of the country round the lake of lego  his great actions are handed down by tradition and his hospitality has passed into a proverb from the wall his eyes were filled with tears red was the cheek of youth his voice was trembling low my spear shook its bright head in his hand he spoke to morvens king  fingal thou king of heroes ossian next to him in war ye have fought the battle in your youth your names are renowned in the song  oscar is like the mist of cona i appear and vanish  the bard will not know my name  the hunter will not search in the heath for my tomb let me fight o heroes in the battles of inisthona distant is the land of my war  ye shall not hear of oscars fall  some bard may find me there and give my name to the song  the daughter of the stranger shall see my tomb and weep over the youth that came from afar the bard shall say at the feast hear the song of oscar from the distant land  oscar replied the king of morven thou shall fight son of my fame  prepare my darkbosomed ship to carry my hero to inisthona son of my son regard our fame  for thou art of the race of renown let not the children of strangers say feeble are the sons of morven  be thou in battle like the roaring storm mild as the evening sun in peace  tell oscar to inisthonas king that fingal remembers his youth when we strove in the combat together in the days of agandecca  they lifted up the sounding sail the wind whistled through the thongs leather thongs were used in ossians time instead of ropes of their masts waves lashthe oozy rocks the strength of ocean roars  my son beheld from the wave the land of groves he rushed into the ecchoing bay of runa and sent his sword to annir king of spears  the grayhaired hero rose when he saw the sword of fingal his eyes were full of tears and he remembered the battles of their youth twice they lifted the spear before the lovely agandecca heroes stood far distant as if two ghosts contended  but now begun the king i am old the sword lies useless in my hall thou who art of morvens race annir has been in the strife of spears but he is pale and withered now like the oak of lano i have no son to meet thee with joy or to carry thee to the halls of his fathers argon is pale in the tomb and ruro is no more  my daughter is in the hall of strangers and longs to behold my tomb  her spouse shakes ten thousand spears and comes cormalo had resolved on a war against his father in law annir king of inis thona in order to deprive him of his kingdom the injustice of his designs was so much resented by fingal that he sent his grandson oscar to the assistance of annir both armies came soon to a battle in which the conduct and valor of oscar obtained a complete victory an end was put to the war by the death of cormalo who fell in a single combat by oscars hand  thus is the story delivered down by tradition though the poet to raise the character of his son makes oscar himself propose the expedition like cloud of death from lano  come to share the feast of annir son of ecchoing morven  three days they feasted together on the fourth annir heard the name of oscar  they rejoiced in the shell to rejoice in the shell is a phrase for feasting sumptuously and drinking freely i have observed in a preceding note that the ancient scots drunk in shells  and pursued the boars of runa  beside the fount of mossy stones the weary heroes rest the tear steals in secret from annir and he broke the rising sigh  here darkly rest the hero said the children of my youth  this stone is the tomb of ruro that tree sounds over the grave of argon do ye hear my voice o my sons within your narrow house or do ye speak in these rustling leaves when the winds of the desert rise  king of inisthona said oscar how fell the children of youth the wild boar often rushes over their tombs but he does not disturb the hunters they pursue deer the notion of ossian concerning the state of the deceased was the same with that of the ancient greeks and romans they imagined that the souls pursued in their separate state the employments and pleasures of their former life arma procul currusque virum miratur inanis stant terra defixae hastae passimque soluti per campum pascuntur equi quae gratia curruum armorumque fuit vivis quae cura nitentis pascere equss cadem sequitur tellure repostos virg the chief beheld their chariots from afar their shining arms and coursers trained to war their lances fixed in earth their steeds around free from the harness graze the flowery ground the love of horses which they had alive and care of chariots after death survive dryden        etc hom odyss    now i the strength of hercules behold a towering spectre of gigantic mold gloomy as night he stands in act to throw the aerial arrow from the twanging bow around his breast a wondrous zone is rolled where woodland monsters grin in fretted gold there sullen lions sternly seem to roar there war and havoc and destruction stood and vengeful murder red with human blood pope formed of clouds and bend their airy bow  they still love the sport of their youth and mount the wind with joy  cormalo replied the king is chief of ten thousand spears he dwells at the darkrolling waters of lano lano was a lake of scandinavia remarkable in the days of ossian for emitting a pestilential vapor in autumn and thou o valiant duchomar like the mist of marshy lano when it sails over the plains of autumn and brings death to the people fingal b i  which sent forth the cloud of death he came to runas ecchoing halls and sought the honor of the spear by the honor of the spear is meant the tournament practiced among the ancient northern nations  the youth was lovely as the first beam of the sun and few were they who could meet him in fight  my heroes yielded to cormalo and my daughter loved the son of lano  argon and ruro returned from the chase the tears of their pride descend  they rolled their silent eyes on runas heroes because they yielded to a stranger three days they feasted with cormalo on the fourth my argon fought  but who could fight with argon  lanos chief is overcome his heart swelled with the grief of pride and he resolved in secret to behold the death of my sons  they went to the hills of runa and pursued the darkbrown hinds the arrow of cormalo flew in secret and my children fell he came to the maid of his love to inisthonas darkhaired maid  they fled over the desert  and annir remained alone  night came on and day appeared nor argons voice nor ruros came at length their muchloved dog is seen the fleet and bounding runar he came into the hall and howled and seemed to look toward the place of their fall  we followed him we found them here and laid them by this mossy stream this is the haunt of annir when the chase of the hinds is over i bend like the trunk of an aged oak above them and my tears for ever flow  o ronnan said the rising oscar ogar king of spears call my heroes to my side the sons of streamy morven today we go to lanos water that sends forth the cloud of death cormalo will not long rejoice death is often at the point of our swords  they came over the desert like stormy clouds when the winds roll them over the heath their edges are tinged with lightning and the ecchoing groves foresee the storm the horn of oscars battle is heard and lano shook over all its waves the children of the lake convened around the sounding shield of cormalo  oscar fought as he was wont in battle cormalo fell beneath his sword and the sons of the dismal lano fled to their secret vales  oscar brought the daughter of inisthona to annirs ecchoing halls the face of age is bright with joy he blessed the king of swords  how great was the joy of ossian when he beheld the distant sail of his son it was like a cloud of light that rises in the east when the traveller is sad in a land unknown and dismal night with her ghosts is sitting around him  we brought him with songs to selmas halls fingal ordered the feast of shells to be spread a thousand bards raised the name of oscar and morven answered to the noise the daughter of toscar was there and her voice was like the harp when the distant sound comes in the evening on the softrustling breeze of the vale  o lay me ye that see the light near some rock of my hills let the thick hazels be around let the rustling oak be near green be the place of my rest and let the sound of the distant torrent be heard daughter of toscar take the harp and raise the lovely song of selma that sleep may overtake my soul in the midst of joy that the dreams of my youth may return and the days of the mighty fingal  selma i behold thy towers thy trees and shaded wall i see the heroes of morven and hear the song of bards oscar lifts the sword of cormalo and a thousand youths admire its studded thongs they look with wonder on my son and admire the strength of his arm they mark the joy of his fathers eyes they long for an equal fame  and ye shall have your fame o sons of streamy morven  my soul is often brightened with the song and i remember the companions of my youth  but sleep descends with the sound of the harp and pleasant dreams begin to rise ye sons of the chase stand far distant nor disturb my rest i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please solomons song  the bard of other times converses now with his fathers the chiefs of the days of old  sons of the chase stand far distant disturb not the dreams of ossian  the battle of lora a poem this poem is complete nor does it appear from tradition that it was introduced as an episode into any of ossians great works  it it called in the original duan a chuldich or the culdees poem because it was addressed to one of the first christian missionaries who were called from their retired life culdees or sequestered persons  the story bears a near resemblance to that which was the foundation of the iliad fingal on his return from ireland after he had expelled swaran from that kingdom made a feast to all his heroes he forgot to invite maronnan and aldo two chiefs who had not been along with him on his expedition they resented his neglect and went over to erragon king of sora a country of scandinavia the declared enemy of fingal the valor of aldo soon gained him a great reputation in sora and lorma the beautiful wife of erragon fell in love with him  he found means to escape with her and to come to fingal who resided then in selma on the western coast  erragon invaded scotland and was slain in battle by gaul the son of morni after he had rejected terms of peace offered him by fingal  in this war aldo fell in a single combat by the hands of his rival erragon and the unfortunate lorma afterward died of grief  son of the distant land who dwell in the secret cell do i hear the sounds of thy grove or is it thy voice of songs  the torrent was loud in my ear but i heard a tuneful voice do thou praise the chiefs of thy land or the spirits the poet alludes to the religious hymns of the culdees of the wind  but lonely dweller of the rock look over that heathy plain thou see green tombs with their rank whistling grass with their stones of mossy heads thou see them son of the rock but ossians eyes have failed  a mountainstream comes roaring down and sends its waters round a green hill four mossy stones in the midst of withered grass rear their heads on the top two trees which the storms have bent spread their whistling branches around  this is thy dwelling erragon erragon or ferg thonn signifies the rage of the waves probably a poetical name given him by ossian himself for he goes by the name of annir in tradition  this thy narrow house the sound of thy shells have been long forgot in sora and thy shield is become dark in thy hall  erragon king of ships chief of distant sora how have thou fallen on our mountains the beauty of israel is slain on thy high places how are the mighty fallen   samuel ii    how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathan thou wast slain in thine high places   samuel ii     how is the mighty low  son of the secret cell do thou delight in songs hear the battle of lora the sound of its steel is long since past so thunder on the darkened hill roars and is no more the sun returns with his silent beams the glittering rocks and green heads of the mountains smile  the bay of cona received our ships this was at fingals return from his war against swaran  from ullins rolling waves our white sheets hung loose to the masts and the boisterous winds roared behind the groves of morven  the horn of the king is sounded and the deer start from their rocks our arrows flew in the woods the feast of the hill is spread our joy was great on our rocks for the fall of the terrible swaran  two heroes were forgot at our feast and the rage of their bosoms burned they rolled their red eyes in secret the sigh bursts from their breasts they were seen to talk together and to throw their spears on earth they were two dark clouds in the midst of our joy like pillars of mist on the settled sea it glitters to the sun but the mariners fear a storm  raise my white sails said maronnan raise them to the winds of the west let us rush o aldo through the foam of the northern wave we are forgot at the feast but our arms have been red in blood let us leave the hills of fingal and serve the king of sora  his countenance is fierce and the war darkens round his spear let us be renowned o aldo in the battles of ecchoing sora  they took their swords and shields of thongs and rushed to lumars sounding bay they came to soras haughty king the chief of bounding steeds  erragon had returned from the chase his spear was red in blood he bent his dark face to the ground and whistled as he went  he took the strangers to his feasts they fought and conquered in his wars  aldo returned with his fame toward soras lofty walls  from her tower looked the spouse of erragon the humid rolling eyes of lorma  her darkbrown hair flies on the wind of ocean her white breast heaves like snow on heath when the gentle winds arise and slowly move it in the light she saw young aldo like the beam of soras setting sun her soft heart sighed tears filled her eyes and her white arm supported her head  three days she sat within the hall and covered grief with joy  on the fourth she fled with the hero along the rolling sea  they came to conas mossy towers to fingal king of spears  aldo of the heart of pride said the rising king of morven shall i defend thee from the wrath of soras injured king who will now receive my people into their halls or give the feast of strangers since aldo of the little soul has carried away the fair of sora go to thy hills thou feeble hand and hide thee in thy caves mournful is the battle we must fight with soras gloomy king  spirit of the noble trenmor when will fingal cease to fight i was born in the midst of battles comhal the father of fingal was slain in battle against the tribe of morni the very day that fingal was born so that he may with propriety be said to have been born in the midst of battles  and my steps must move in blood to my tomb but my hand did not injure the weak my steel did not touch the feeble in arms  i behold thy tempests o morven which will overtrun my halls when my children are dead in battle and none remains to dwell in selma then will the feeble come but they will not know my tomb my renown is in the song and my actions shall be as a dream to future times  his people gathered around erragon as the storms round the ghost of night when he calls them from the top of morven and prepares to pour them on the land of the stranger  he came to the shore of cona and sent his bard to the king to demand the combat of thousands or the land of many hills  fingal sat in his hall with the companions of his youth around him the young heroes were at the chase and far distant in the desert the grayhaired chiefs talked of other times and of the actions of their youth when the aged narthmor neartmor great strength lora noisy came the king of streamy lora  this is no time begun the chief to hear the songs of other years erragon frowns on the coast and lifts ten thousand swords gloomy is the king among his chiefs he is like the darkened moon amidst the meteors of night  come said fingal from thy hall thou daughter of my love come from thy hall bosmina bosmhina soft and tender hand she was the youngest of fingals children  maid of streamy morven narthmor take the steeds these were probably horses taken in the incursions of the caledonians into the roman province which seems to be intimated in the phrase of the steeds of strangers of the strangers and attend the daughter of fingal let her bid the king of sora to our feast to selmas shaded wall  offer him o bosmina the peace of heroes and the wealth of generous aldo our youths are far distant and age is on our trembling hands  she came to the host of erragon like a beam of light to a cloud  in her right hand shone an arrow of gold and in her left a sparkling shell the sign of morvens peace  erragon brightened in her presence as a rock before the sudden beams of the sun when they issue from a broken cloud divided by the roaring wind  son of the distant sora begun the mildly blushing maid come to the feast of morvens king to selmas shaded walls take the peace of heroes o warrior and let the dark sword rest by thy side  and if thou chusest the wealth of kings hear the words of the generous aldo  he gives to erragon an hundred steeds the children of the rein an hundred maids from distant lands an hundred hawks with fluttering wing that fly across the sky an hundred girdles sanctified girdles till very lately were kept in many families in the north of scotland they were bound about women in labor and were supposed to alleviate their pains and to accelerate the

darkness filled selmas hall when he stretched his hand to his spear  the ghosts of thousands were near and foresaw the death of the people terrible joy rose in the face of the aged heroes they rushed to meet the foe their thoughts are on the actions of other years and on the fame of the tomb  now the dogs of the chase appeared at trathals tomb fingal know that his young heroes followed them and he

streams and my thoughts were of mighty men fingal struck his bossy shield and gave the dismal sign of war a thousand swords he spoke and to confirm his words outslew millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze far round illumined hell milton  at once unsheathed gleam on the waving heath three grayhaired sons of the song raise the tunesul mournful voice  deep and dark with sounding steps we rush a gloomy ridge along like the shower of a storm when it pours on the narrow vale  the king of morven sat on his hill the sunbeam i have observed in a former note that the standard of fingal was called the sunbeam from its being studded with stones and gold of battle flew on the wind the companions of his youth are near with all their waving locks of age  joy rose in the heros eyes when he beheld his sons in war when he saw them amidst the lightning of swords and mindful of the deeds of their fathers  erragon came on in his strength like the roar of a winter stream the battle falls in his course and death is at his side  who comes said fingal like the bounding roe like the heart of ecchoing cona his shield glitters on his side and the clang of his armor is mournful  he meets with erragon in the strife  behold the battle of the chiefs  it is like the contending of ghosts in a gloomy storm  but fallest thou son of the hill and is thy white bosom stained with blood weep unhappy lorma aldo is no more  the king took the spear of his strength for he was sad for the fall of aldo he bent his deathful eyes on the foe but gaul met the king of sora  who can relate the fight of the chiefs  the mighty stranger fell  sons of cona fingal cried aloud stop the hand of death  mighty was he that is now so low and much is he mourned in sora the stranger will come toward his hall and wonder why it is silent the king is fallen o stranger and the joy of his house is ceased  listen to the sound of his woods perhaps his ghost is there but he is far distant on morven beneath the sword of a foreign foe  such were the words of fingal when the bard raised the song of peace we stopped our uplifted swords and spared the feeble foe we laid erragon in that tomb and i raised the voice of grief the clouds of night came rolling down and the ghost of erragon appeared to some  his face was cloudy and dark and an halfsormed sigh is in his breast  blessed be thy soul o king of sora thine arm was terrible in war  lorma sat in aldos hall at the light of a flaming oak the night came but he did not return and the soul of lorma is sad  what detains thee

ecchoing hills o my best beloved  her eyes are turned toward the gate and she listens to the rustling blast she thinks it is aldos tread and joy rises in her sace  but sorrow returns again like a thin cloud on the moon  and thou will not return my love let me behold the face of the hill the moon is in the east calm and bright is the breast of the lake when shall i behold his dogs returning from the chase when shall i hear his voice loud and distant on the wind come from thy ecchoing hills hunter of woody cona  his thin ghost appeared on a rock like the watery beam of the moon when it rushes from between two clouds and the midnight shower is on the field  she followed the empty sorm over the heath for she knew that her hero fell  i heard her approaching cries on the wind like the mournsul voice of the breeze when it sighs on the grass of the cave  she came she found her hero her voice was heard no more silent she rolled her sad eyes she was pale as a watery cloud that rises from the lake to the beam of the moon  few were her days on cona she sunk into the tomb fingal commanded his bards and they sung over the death of lorma the daughters the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year judges xi  0 of morven mourned her sor one day in the year when the dark winds of autumn returned  son of the distant land the poet addresses himself to the culdee  thou dwell in the field of fame o let thy song rise at times in the praise of those that fell that their thin ghosts may rejoice around thee and the soul of lorma come on a moonbeam be thou on a moonbeam o morna near the window of my rest when my thoughts are of peace and the din of arms is over fingal b i  when thou lie down to rest and the moon looks into thy cave then shall thou see her lovely but the tear is still on her cheek  conlath and cuthona a poem conlath was the youngest of mornis sons and brother to the celebrated gaul who is so often mentioned in ossians poems he was in love with cuthona the daughter of rumar when toscar the son of kinfena accompanied by fercuth his friend arrived from ireland at mora where conlath dwelt he was hospitably received and according to the custom of the times feasted three days with conlath on the fourth he set fail and coasting the island of waves probably one of the hebrides he saw cuthona hunting fell in love with her and carried her away by force in his ship he was forced by stress of weather into ithona a desert isle in the meantime conlath hearing of the rape sailed after him and found him on the point of sailing for the coast of ireland they fought and they and their followers fell by mutual wounds cuthona did not long survive for she died of grief the third day after fingal hearing of their unfortunate death sent stormal the son of moran to bury them but forgot to send a bard to sing the funeral song over their tombs the ghost of conlath came long after to ossian to entreat him to transmit to posterity his and cuthonas fame for it was the opinion of the times that the souls of the deceased were not happy till their elegies were composed by a bard  thus is the story of the poem handed down by tradition  did not ossian hear a voice or is it the sound of days that are no more often does the memory of former times come like the evening sun on my soul the noise of the chase is renewed and in thought i lift the spear  but ossian did hear a voice who art thou son of the night the sons of little men are asleep and the midnight wind is in my hall perhaps it is the shield of fingal that echoes to the blast it hangs in ossians hall and he feels it sometimes with his hands  yes  i hear thee my friend long has thy voice been absent from mine ear what brings thee on thy cloud to ossian son of the generous morni are the friends of the aged near thee where is oscar son of fame  he was often near thee o conlath when the din of battle rose  ghost of conlath sleeps the sweet voice of cona in the midst of his rustling hall sleeps ossian in his hall and his friends without their fame the sea rolls round the dark ithona ithonn island of waves one of the uninhabited western isles  and our tombs are not seen by the stranger how long shall our fame be unheard son of the ecchoing morven   ossian o that mine eyes could behold thee as thou sit dim on thy cloud art thou like the mist of lano or an half extinguished meteor of what are the skirts of thy robe of what is thine airy bow  but he is gone on his blast like the shadow of mist  come from thy wall my harp and let me hear thy sound let the light of memory rise on ithona that i may behold my friends and ossian does behold his friends on the darkblue isle  the cave of thona appears with its mossy rocks and bending trees a stream roars at its mouth and toscar bends over its course fercuth is sad by his side and the maid cuthona the daughter of rumar whom toscar had carried away by force of his love sits at a distance and weeps does the wind of the waves deceive me or do i hear them speak   toscar the night was stormy from their hills the groaning oaks came down the sea darklytumbled beneath the blast and the roaring waves were climbing against our rocks  the lightning came often and showed the blasted sern  fercuth i saw the ghost of night it was long thought in the north of scotland that storms were raised by the ghosts of the deceased this notion is still entertained by the vulgar for they think that whirlwinds and sudden squalls of wind are occasioned by spirits who transport themselves in that manner from one place to another  silent he stood on that bank his robe of mist flew on the wind  i could behold his tears an aged man he seemed and full of thought   fercuth it was thy father o toscar and he foresees some death among his race such was his appearance on cromla before the great maronnan ma ronnan was the brother of toscar the translator has a poem in his possession concerning the extraordinary death of that hero fell  ullin ulster in ireland  with thy hills of grass how pleasant are thy vales silence is near thy blue streams and the sun is on thy fields soft is the sound of the harp in selama selamath  beautiful to behold the name of toscars palace on the coast of ulster near the mountain cromla the scene of the epic poem  and lovely the cry of the hunter on cromla

locks of age i have seen thee undaunted in danger and thine eyes burning with joy in the fight whither is the soul of battle fled our fathers never feared  go view the settling sea the stormy wind is laid the billows still tremble  the face of ocean sleeps and a still horror saddens all the deeps popes homer on the deep and seem to fear the blast but view the settling sea morning is gray on our rocks the sun will look soon from his east in all his pride of light  i lifted up my sails with joy before the halls of generous conlath my course was by the isle of waves where his love pursued the deer i saw her like that beam of the sun that issues from the cloud her hair was on her heaving breast she bending forward drew the bow her white arm seemed behind her like the snow of cromla  come to my soul i said thou huntress of the isle of waves but she spends her time in tears and thinks of the generous conlath where can i find thy peace cuthona lovely maid   cuthona cuthona the mournful sound of the waves a poetical name given her by ossian on acount of her mourning to the sound of the waves her name in tradition is gormhuil the blueeyed maid a distant steep bends over the sea with aged trees and mossy rocks the billows roll at its feet on its side is the dwelling of roes the people call it ardven there the towers of mora rise there conlath looks over the sea for his only love the daughters of the chase returned and he beheld their downcast eyes where is the daughter of rumar but they answered not  my peace dwells on ardven son of the distant land   toscar and cuthona shall return to her peace to the halls of generous conlath he is the friend of toscar i have feasted in his halls  rise ye gentle breezes of ullin and stretch my sails toward ardvens shores cuthona shall rest on ardven but the days of toscar will be sad  i shall sit in my cave in the field of the sun the blast will rustle in my trees and i shall think it is cuthonas voice but she is distant far in the halls of the mighty conlath   cuthona oh what cloud is that it carries the ghosts of my fathers i see the skirts of their robes like gray and watery mist when shall i fall o rumar  sad cuthona sees her death will not conlath behold me before i enter the narrow house the grave    ossian and he will behold thee o maid he comes along the rolling sea the death of toscar is dark on his spear and a wound is in his side he is pale at the cave of thona and shows his ghastly wound  inhumati venit image conjugis ora modis adtellens pallida miris crudelis aras trajectaque pector a serro nudavit  virg

mind  i behold the chiefs no more but o ye bards of future times remember the fall of conlath with tears he fell before his day nam quia nec fato merita nec morte peribat sed misera ante diem etc virg  and sadness darkened in his hall his mother looked to his shield on the wall and it was bloody it was the opinion of the times that the arms left by the heroes at home became bloody the very instant their owners were killed though at ever so great a distance  she knew that her hero died and her sorrow was heard on mora  art thou pale on thy rock cuthona beside the fallen chiefs the night comes and the day returns but none appears to raise their tomb thou frightnest the screaming fowls the situation of cuthona is like that of rizpah readiness mistress who sat by her sons after they had been hanged by the gibeonites and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of the harvest until water dropped on them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of prey by night   samuel xxi  0   away and thy tears forever flow thou art pale as a watery cloud that rises from a lake  the sons

distant from my hall that sleep may descend at night o that i could forget my friends till my footsteps cease to be seen till i come among them with joy and lay my aged limbs in the narrow house   carthon this poem is complete and the subject of it as of most of ossians compositions tragical in the time of comhal the son of trathal and father of the celebrated fingal clessammor the son of thaddu and brother of morna fingals mother was driven by a storm into the river clyde on the banks of which stood balclutha a town belonging to the britons between the walls he was hospitably received by reuthamir the principal man in the place who gave him moina his only daughter in marriage reuda the son of cormo a briton who was in love with moina came to reuthamirs house and behaved haughtily toward clessammor a quarrel insued in which reuda was killed the britons who attended him pressed so hard on clessammor that he was obliged to throw himself into the clyde and swim to his ship he hoisted sail and the wind being favorable bore him out to sea he often endeavored to return and carry off his beloved moina by night but the wind continuing contrary he was forced to desist  moina who had been left with child by her husband brought forth a son and died soon after  reuthamir named the child carthon i e the murmur of waves from the storm which carried off clessammor his father who was supposed to have been cast away when carthon was three years old comhal the father of fingal in one of his expeditions against the britons took and burnt balclutha reuthamir was killed in the attack and carthon was carried safe away by his nurse who fled farther into the country of the britons carthon coming to mans estate was resolved to revenge the fall of balclutha on comhals posterity he set sail from the clyde and falling on the coast of morven defeated two of fingals heroes who came to oppose his progress he was at last unwittingly killed by his father clessammor in a single combat this story is the foundation of the present poem which opens on the night preceding the death of carthon so that what passed before is introduced by way of episode the poem is addressed to malvina the daughter of toscar    a poem a tale of the times of old the deeds of days of other years  the murmur of thy streams o lora brings back the memory of the past the sound of thy woods garmallar is lovely in mine ear do thou not behold malvina a rock with its head of heath three aged firs bend from its face green is the narrow plain at its feet there the flower of the mountain grows and shakes its white head in the breeze the thistle is there alone and shades its aged beard two stones half sunk in the ground show their heads of moss the deer of the mountain avoids the place for he beholds the gray ghost that guards it it was the opinion of the times that deer saw the ghosts of the dead to this day when beasts suddenly start without any apparent cause the vulgar think that they see the spirits of the deceased  for the mighty lie o malvina in the narrow plain of the rock a tale of the times of old the deeds of days of other years  who comes from the land of strangers with his thousands around him the sunbeam pours its bright stream before him and his hair meets the wind of his hills his face is settled from war he is calm as the evening beam that looks from the cloud of the west on conas silent vale who is it but comhals son fingal returns here from an expedition against the romans which was celebrated by ossian in a poem called the strife of crona  the king of mighty deeds he beholds his hills with joy and bids a thousand voices rise  ye have fled over your fields ye sons of the distant land the king of the world sits in his hall and hears of his peoples flight he lifts his red eye of pride and takes his fathers sword ye have fled over your fields sons of the distant land  such were the words of the bards when they came to selmas halls  a thousand lights probably waxlights which are often mentioned as carried among other booty from the roman province from the strangers land rose in the midst of the people the feast is spread around and the night passed away in joy  where is the noble clessammor clessamh mor mighty deeds  said the fairhaired fingal where is the companion of my father in the days of my joy sullen and dark he passes his days in the vale of ecchoing lora but behold he comes from the hill like a steed have thou given the horse strength have thou clothed his neck with thunder he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength job   etc hom ii   the wanton courser thus with reins unbound breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane disheveled over his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the distant plain and springs exulting pope qualis ubi abruptis fugit praesepia vinclis tandem liber equus campoque potitus aperto  ille in pastus armentaque tendit equarum  arrectisque fremit cervicibus alte luxurians luduntque iubae per colla per armos virg freed from his keepers thus with broken reins the wanton courser prances eor the plains or in the pride of youth oerleaps the mounds and snuffs the females in forbidden grounds  over his shoulders flows his waving mane he neighs he snorts he bears his head on high dryden in his strength who finds his companions in the breeze and tosses his bright mane in the wind  blessed be the soul of clessammor why so long from selma  returns the chief said clessammor in the midst of his fame such was the renown of comhal in the battles of his youth often did we pass over carun to the land of the strangers our swords returned not unstained with blood nor did the kings of the world rejoice  why do i remember the battles of my youth my hair is mixed with gray my hand forgets to bend the bow and i lift a lighter spear o that my joy would return as when i first beheld the maid the white bosomed daughter of strangers moina moina soft in temper and person we find the british names in this poem derived from the galic which is a proof that the ancient language of the whole island was one and the same with the darkblue eyes  tell said the mighty fingal the tale of thy youthful days sorrow like a cloud on the sun shades the soul of clessammor mournful are thy thoughts alone on the banks of the roaring lora let us hear the sorrow of thy youth and the darkness of thy days  it was in the days of peace replied the great clessammor i came in my bounding ship to balcluthas balclutha i e the town of clyde probably the alduth of bid walls of towers the winds had roared behind my sails and cluthas clutha or cluath the galic name of the river clyde the signification of the word is bending in allusion to the winding course of that river from clutha is derived its latin name glotta streams received my darkbosomed vessel three days i remained in reuthamirs halls and saw that beam of light his daughter the joy of the shell went round and the aged hero gave the fair her breasts were like foam on the wave and her eyes like stars of light her hair was dark as the ravens wing her soul was generous and mild my love for moina was great and my heart poured forth in joy  the son of a stranger came a chief who loved the whitebosomed moina his words were mighty in the hall and he often halfunsheathed his sword  where he said is the mighty comhal the restless wanderer the word in the original here rendered by restless wanderer is scuta which is the true origin of the scoti of the romans an opprobrious name imposed by the britons on the caledonians on account of the continual incursions into their country of the heath comes he with his host to balclutha since clessammor is so bold  my soul i replied o warrior burns in a light of its own i stand without fear in the midst of thousands though the valiant are distant far  stranger thy words are mighty for clessammor is alone but my sword trembles by my side and longs to glitter in my hand  speak no more of comhal son of the winding clutha  the strength of his pride arose we fought he fell beneath my sword the banks of clutha heard his fall and a thousand spears glittered around i fought the strangers prevailed i plunged into the stream of clutha my white sails rose over the waves and i bounded on the darkblue sea  moina came to the shore and rolled the red eye of her tears her dark hair flew on the wind and i heard her cries  often did i turn my ship but the winds of the east prevailed nor clutha ever since have i seen nor moina of the dark brown hair  she fell in balclutha for i have seen her ghost i knew her as she came through the dusky night along the murmur of lora she was like the new moon inter quas phoenissa recens a volnere dido errabat sylva in magna quam trious heroes ut primum juxta stetit agnovitque perumbram obscuram qualem primo qui surgere mense aut videt aut vidisse putat per nubila lunam etc virg not far from these phoenician dido stood fresh from her wound her bosom bathed in blood whom when the trojan hero hardly knew obscure in shades and with a doubtful view doubtful as he who runs through dusky night or thinks he sees the moons uncertain light etc dryd seen through the gathered mist when the sky pours down its flaky snow and the world is silent and dark  raise the title of this poem in the original is duan na nlai i e the poem of the hymns probably on account of its many digressions from the subject all which are in a lyric measure as this song of fingal fingal is celebrated by the irish historians for his wisdom in making laws his poetical genius and his foreknowledge of events  oflaherty goes so far as to say that fingals laws were extant in his own time  ye bards said the mighty fingal the praise of unhappy moina call her ghost with your songs to our hills that she may rest with the fair of morven the sunbeams of other days and the delight of heroes of old  i have seen the walls the reader may compare this passage with the three last verses of the   th chapter of isaiah where the prophet foretells the destruction of babylon of balclutha but they were desolate the fire had resounded in the halls and the voice of the people is heard no more the stream of clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls  the thistle shook there its lonely head the moss whistled to the wind the fox looked out from the windows the rank grass of the wall waved round his head  desolate is the dwelling of moina silence is in the house of her fathers  raise the song of mourning o bards over the land of strangers they have but fallen before us for one day we must fall  why do thou build the hall son of the winged days thou look from thy towers today yet a few years and the blast of the desert comes it howls in thy empty court and whistles round thy halfworn shield  and let the blast of the desert come we shall be renowned in our day the mark of my arm shall be in the battle and my name in the song of bards  raise the song send round the shell and let joy be heard in my hall  when thou sun of heaven shall fail if thou shall fail thou mighty light if thy brightness is for a season like fingal our fame shall survive thy beams  such was the song of fingal in the day of his joy his thousand bards leaned forward from their seats to hear the voice of the king it was like the music of the harp on the gale of the spring  lovely were thy thoughts o fingal why had not ossian the strength of thy soul  but thou stand alone my father and who can equal the king of morven  the night passed away in the song and morning returned in joy  the mountains showed their gray heads and the blue face of ocean smiled  the white wave is seen tumbling round the distant rock the gray mist rises slowly from the lake it came in the figure of an aged man along the silent plain its large limbs did not move in steps for a ghost supported it in mid air it came toward selmas hall and dissolved in a shower of blood  the king alone beheld the terrible sight and he foresaw the death of the people he came in silence to his hall and took his fathers spear  the mail rattled on his breast the heroes rose around they looked in silence on each other marking the eyes of fingal  they saw the battle in his face the death of armies on his spear  a thousand shields at once are placed on their arms and they drew a thousand swords the hall of selma brightened around the clang of arms ascends  the gray dogs howl in their place no word is among the mighty chiefs  each marked the eyes of the king and half assumed his spear  sons of morven begun the king this is no time to fill the shell the battle darkens near us and death hovers over the land some ghost the friend of fingal has forewarned us of the foe  the sons of the stranger come from the darklyrolling sea for from the water came the sign of morvens gloomy danger  let each  hom ii     his sharpened spear let every grecian wield and every grecian fix his brazen shield etc pope let each his adamantine coat gird well and each fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield borne even or high for this day will pour down if i conjecture right no drizling shower but rattling storm of arrows barbd with fire milton assume his heavy spear and gird on his fathers sword  let the dark helmet rise on every head and the mail pour its lightening from every side  the battle gathers like a tempest and soon shall ye hear the roar of death  the hero moved on before his host like a cloud before a ridge of green fire when it pours on the sky of night and mariners forsee a storm on conas rising heath they stood the whitebosomed maids beheld them above like a grove they foresaw the death of their youths and looked toward the sea with fear  the white wave deceived them for distant sails and the tear is on their cheek  the sun rose on the sea and we beheld a distant fleet  like the mist of ocean they came and poured their youth upon the coast  the chief was among them like the stag in the midst of the herd  his shield is studded with gold and stately strode the king of spears  he moved toward selma his thousands moved behind  go with thy song of peace said fingal go ullin to the king of swords tell him that we are mighty in battle and that the ghosts of our foes are many  but renowned are they who have feasted in my halls they show the arms it was a custom among the ancient scots to exchange arms with their guests and those arms were preserved long in the different families as monuments of the friendship which subsisted between their ancestors of my fathers in a foreign land the sons of the strangers wonder and bless the friends of morvens race for our names have been heard afar the kings of the world shook in the midst of their people  ullin went with his song fingal rested on his spear he saw the mighty foe in his armor and he blessed the strangers son  how stately art thou son of the sea said the king of woody morven thy sword is a beam of might by thy side thy spear is a fir that defies the storm the varied face of the moon is not broader than thy shield  ruddy is thy face of youth soft the ringlets of thy hair  but this tree may fall and his memory be forgot  the daughter of the stranger will be sad and look to the rolling sea  the children will say we see a ship perhaps it is the king of balclutha the tear starts from their mothers eye her thoughts are of him that sleeps in morven  such were the words of the king when ullin came to the mighty carthon he threw down the spear before him and raised the song of peace  come to the feast of fingal carthon from the rolling sea partake the feast of the king or lift the spear of war the ghosts of our foes are many but renowned are the friends of morven  behold that field o carthon many a green hill rises there with mossy stones and rustling grass these are the tombs of fingals foes the sons of the rolling sea  do thou speak to the feeble in arms said carthon bard of the woody morven is my face pale for fear son of the peaceful song why then do thou think to darken my soul with the tales of those who fell  my arm has fought in the battle my renown is known afar go to the feeble in arms and bid them yield to fingal  have not i seen the fallen balclutha and shall i feast with comhals son comhal who threw his fire in the midst of my fathers hall i was young and knew not the cause why the virgins wept the columns of smoke pleased mine eye when they rose above my walls i often looked back with gladness when my friends fled along the hill  but when the years of my youth came on i beheld the moss of my fallen walls my sigh arose with the morning and my tears descended with night  shall i not fight i said to my soul against the children of my foes and i will fight o bard i feel the strength of my soul  his people gathered around the hero and drew at once their shining swords he stands in the midst like a pillar of fire the tear halfstarting from his eye for he thought of the fallen balclutha and the crowded pride of his soul arose sidelong he looked up to the hill where our heroes shone in arms the spear trembled in his hand and bending foreward he seemed to threaten the king  shall i said fingal to his soul meet at once the king shall i stop him in the midst of his course before his fame shall arise but the bard hereafter may say when he sees the tomb of carthon fingal took his thousands along with him to battle before the noble carthon fell  no  bard of the times to come thou shall not lessen fingals fame my heroes will fight the youth and fingal behold the battle if he overcomes i rush in my strength like the roaring stream of cona  who of my heroes will meet the son of the rolling sea many are his warriors on the coast and strong is his ashen spear  cathul cathhuil the eye of battle rose in his strength the son of the mighty lormar three hundred youths attend the chief the race it appears from this passage that clanship was established in the days of fingal though not on the same footing with the present tribes in the north of scotland of his native streams feeble was his arm against carthon he fell and his heroes fled  connal this connal is very much celebrated in ancient poetry for his wisdom and valor there is a small tribe still subsisting in the north who pretend they are descended from him resumed the battle but he broke his heavy spear he lay bound on the field and carthon pursued his people  clessammor said the king fingal did not then know that carthon was the son of clessammor of morven where is the spear of thy strength will thou behold connal bound thy friend at the stream of lora rise in the light of thy steel thou friend of comhal let the youth of balclutha feel the strength of morvens race  he rose in the strength of his steel shaking his grizly locks he fitted the shield to his side and rushed in the pride of valor  carthon stood on that heathy rock and saw the heroes approach he loved the terrible joy of his face and his strength in the locks of age  shall i lift that spear he said that never strikes but once a foe or shall i with the words of peace preserve the warriors life stately are his steps of age  lovely the remnant of his years perhaps it is the love of moina the father of carborne carthon often have i heard that he dwelt at the ecchoing stream of lora  such were his words when clessammor came and lifted high his spear the youth received it on his shield and spoke the words of peace  warrior of the aged locks is there no youth to lift the spear have thou no son to raise the shield before his father and to meet the arm of youth is the spouse of thy love no more or weeps she over the tombs of thy sons art thou of the kings of men what will be the fame of my sword if thou shall fall  it will be great thou son of pride begun the tall clessammor i have been renowned in battle but i never told my name to tell ones name to an enemy was reckoned in those days of heroism a manifest evasion of fighting him for if it was once known that friendship subsisted of old between the ancestors of the combatants the battle immediately ceased and the ancient amity of their forefathers was renewed a man who tells his name to his enemy was of old an ignominious term for a coward to a so yield to me son of the wave and then thou shall know that the mark of my sword is in many a field  i never yielded king of spears replied the noble pride of carthon i have also fought in battles and i behold my future fame despise me not thou chief of men my arm my spear is strong retire among thy friends and let young heroes fight  why do thou wound my soul replied clessammor with a tear age does not tremble on my hand i still can lift the sword shall i fly in fingals sight in the sight of him i loved son of the sea i never fled exalt thy pointed spear  they fought like two contending winds that strive to roll the wave carthon bade his spear to err for he still thought that the foe was the spouse of moina  he broke clessammors beamy spear in twain and seized his shining sword but as carthon was binding the chief the chief drew the dagger of his fathers he saw the foes uncovered side and opened there a wound  fingal saw clessammor low he moved in the sound of his steel the host stood silent in his presence they turned their eyes toward the hero  he came like the sullen noise of a storm before the winds arise the hunter hears it in the vale and retires to the cave of the rock  carthon stood in his place the blood is rushing down his side he saw the coming down of the king and his hopes of fame arose this expression admits of a double meaning either that carthon hoped to acquire glory by killing fingal or to be rendered famous by falling by his hand the last is the most probable as carthon is already wounded  but pale was his cheek his hair flew loose his helmet shook on high the force of carthon failed but his soul was strong  fingal beheld the heros blood he stopped the uplifted spear yield king of swords said comhals son i behold thy blood thou have been mighty in battle and thy fame shall never fade  art thou the king so far renowned replied the carborne carthon art thou that light of death that frightens the kings of the world  but why should carthon ask for he is like the stream of his desert strong as a river in his course swift as the eagle of the sky  o that i had sought with the king that my same might be great in the song that the hunter beholding my tomb might say he fought with the mighty fingal but carthon dies unknown he has poured out his force on the feeble  but thou shall not die unknown replied the king of woody morven my bards are many o carthon and their songs descend to future times the children of the years to come shall hear the fame of carthon when they sit round the burning oak in the north of scotland till very lately they burnt a large trunk of an oak at their festivals it was called the trunk of the feast time had so much consecrated the custom that the vulgar thought it a kind of sacrilege to disuse it  and the night is spent in the songs of old the hunter sitting in the heath shall hear the rustling blast and raising his eyes behold the rock where carthon fell he shall turn to his son and show the place where the mighty fought there the king of balclutha fought like the strength of a thousand streams  joy rose in carthons face he lifted his heavy eyes  he gave his sword to fingal to lie within his hall that the memory of balcluthas king might remain on morven  the battle ceased along the field for the bard had sung the song of peace the chiefs gathered round the falling carthon and heard his words with sighs silent they leaned on their spears while balcluthas hero spoke his hair sighed in the wind and his words were feeble  king of morven carthon said i fall in the midst of my course a foreign tomb receives in youth the last of reuthamirs race darkness dwells in balclutha and the shadows of grief in crathmo  but raise my remembrance on the banks of lora where my fathers dwelt perhaps the husband of moina will mourn over his fallen carthon  his words reached the heart of clessammor he fell in silence on his son the host stood darkened around no voice is on the plains of lora night came and the moon from the east looked on the mournful field but still they stood like a silent grove that lifts its head on gormal when the loud winds are laid and dark autumn is on the plain  three days they mourned above carthon on the fourth his father died in the narrow plain of the rock they lie and a dim ghost defends their tomb there lovely moina is often seen when the sunbeam darts on the rock and all around is dark there she is seen malvina but not like the daughters of the hill her robes are from the strangers land and she is still alone  fingal was sad for carthon he desired his bards to mark the day when shadowy autumn returned and often did they mark the day and sing the heros praise who comes so dark from oceans roar like autumns shadowy cloud death is trembling in his hand his eyes are flames of fire  who roars along dark loras heath who but carthon king of swords the people fall see how he strides like the sullen ghost of morven  but there he lies a goodly oak which sudden blasts overturned when shall thou rise balcluthas joy lovely carborne carthon  who comes so dark from oceans roar like autumns shadowy cloud  such were the words of the bards in the day of their mourning i have accompanied their voice and added to their song my soul has been mournful for carthon he fell in the days of his valor and thou o clessammor where is thy dwelling in the air  has the youth forgot his wound and flies he on the clouds with thee  i feel the sun o malvina leave me to my rest perhaps they may come to my dreams i think i hear a feeble voice  the beam of heaven delights to shine on the grave of carthon i feel it warm around  o thou that rollest above this passage is something similar to satans address to the sun in the fourth book of paradise lost o thou that with surpassing glory crowned looks from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sight all the stars hide their diminished heads to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name o sun    round as the shield of my fathers whence are thy beams o sun thy everlasting light thou come forth in thy awful beauty and the stars hide themselves in the sky the moon cold and pale sinks in the western wave but thou thyself movest alone who can be a companion of thy course the oaks of the mountains fall the mountains themselves decay with years the ocean shrinks and grows again the moon herself is lost in heaven but thou art for ever the same rejoicing in the brightness of thy course when the world is dark with tempests when thunder rolls and lightning flies thou look in thy beauty from the clouds and laughest at the storm but to ossian thou look in vain for he beholds thy beams no more whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds or thou tremblest at the gates of the west but thou art perhaps like me for a season and thy years will have an end thou shall sleep in thy clouds careless of the voice of the morning  exult then o sun in the strength of thy youth age is dark and unlovely it is like the glimmering light of the moon quale per uncertain lunam sub luce maligna est iter in silvis ubi coelum condidit umbra jupiter and robus nox abstulit atra colorem virg thus wander travelers in woods by night by the moons doubtful and malignant light when jove in dusky clouds involves the skies and the saint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes dryd  when it shines through broken clouds and the mist is on the hills the blast of north is on the plain the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey  the death of cuchullin a poem tradition throws considerable light on the history of ireland during the long reign of fingal the son of comhal in morven  arth the son of cairbre supreme king of ireland dying was succeeded by his son cormac a minor  the petty kings and chiefs of the tribes met at temora the royal palace in order to choose out of their own number a guardian to the young king disputes concerning the choice of a proper person run high and it was resolved to end all differences by giving the tuition of the young king to cuchullin the son of semo who had rendered himself famous by his great actions and who resided at the time with connal the son of caithbat in ulster  cuchullin was but three and twenty years old when he assumed the management of affairs in ireland and the invasion of swaran happened two years after in the twentyseventh year of cuchullins age and the third of his administration torlath the son of cantela set up for himself in connaught and advanced toward temora in order to dethrone cormac cuchullin marched against him came up with him at the lake of lego and totally defeated his forces torlath fell in the battle by cuchullins hand but as he himself pressed too eagerly on the flying enemy he was mortally wounded by an arrow and died the second day after  the good fortune of cormac fell with cuchullin many set up for themselves and anarchy and confusion reigned at last cormac was taken off nobody knew how and cairbar one of the competitors for the throne having defeated all his rivals became sole monarch of ireland  the family of fingal who were in the interest of cormacs family were resolved to deprive cairbar of the throne he had usurped in particular oscar the son of offian had determined to revenge the death of cathol his friend who had been assassinated by cairbar  the threats of oscar reached cairbars ears he invited him in a friendly manner to a feast which he had prepared at the royal palace of temora resolving to pick a quarrel and have some pretext for killing him  the quarrel happened the followers of both fought and cairbar and oscar sell by mutual wounds in the mean time fingal arrived from scotland with an army defeated the friends of cairbar and reestablished the family of cormac in the possession of the kingdom  the present poem concerns the death of cuchullin it is in the original called duan loch leigo i e the poem of legos lake and is an episode introduced in a great poem which celebrated the last expedition of fingal into ireland the greatest part of the poem is lost and nothing remains but some episodes which a few old people in the north of scotland retain on memory  cuchullin is the most famous champion in the irish traditions and poems in them he is always called the redoubtable cuchullin and the fables concerning his strength and valor are innumerable ossian thought his expedition against the firbolg or belgae of britain a subject fit for an epic poem which was extant till of late and was called toranatana or a dispute about possessions as the war which was the foundation of it was commenced by the british belgae who inhabited ireland in order to extend their territories  the fragments that remain of this poem are animated with the genuine spirit of ossian so that there can be do doubt that it was of his composition    is the wind on fingals shield or is the voice of past times in my hall sing on sweet voice for thou art pleasant and carriest away my night with joy sing on o bragela daughter of carborne songlan  it is the white wave of the rock and not cuchullins sails often do the mists deceive me for the ship of my love when they rise round some ghost and spread their gray skirts on the wind why do thou delay thy coming son of the generous semo  four times has autumn returned with its winds and raised the seas of togorma togorma i e the island of blue waves one of the hebrides was subject to connal the son of caithbat cuchullins friend  he is sometimes called the son of colgar from one of that name who was the founder of the family  connal a few days before the news of torlaths revolt came to temora had sailed to togorma his native isle where he was detained by contrary winds during the war in which cuchullin was killed  since thou have been in the roar of battles and bragela distant far  hills of the isle of mist when will ye answer to his hounds  but ye are dark in your clouds and sad bragela calls in vain night comes rolling down the face of ocean fails the heathcocks head is beneath his wing the hind sleeps with the heart of the desert they shall rise with the mornings light and feed on the mossy stream but my tears return with the sun my sighs come on with the night when will thou come in thine arms o chief of mossy tura  pleasant is thy voice in ossians ear daughter of carborne sorglan but retire to the hall of shells to the beam of the burning oak  attend to the murmur of the sea it rolls at dunscaichs walls let sleep descend on thy blue eyes and the hero come to thy dreams  cuchullin sits at legos lake at the dark rolling of waters night is around the hero and his thousands spread on the heath a hundred oaks burn in the midst the feast of shells is smoking wide  carril strikes the harp beneath a tree his gray locks glitter in the beam the rustling blast of night is near and lifts his aged hair  his song is of the blue togorma and of its chief cuchullins friend  why art thou absent connal in the day of the gloomy storm the chiefs of the south have convened against the carborne cormac the winds detain thy sails and thy blue waters roll around thee but cormac is not alone the son of semo fights his battles semos son his battles fights the terror of the stranger he that is like the vapor of death   hom ii   as vapors blown by austers sultry breath pregnant with plagues and sheding seeds of death beneath the rage of burning sirius rise choke the parched earth and blacken all the skies pope  slowly borne by sultry winds the sun reddens in its presence the people fall around  such was the song of carril when a son of the foe appeared he threw down his pointless spear and spoke the words of torlath torlath the chief of heroes from legos sable surge he that led his thousands to battle against carborne cormac cormac who was distant far in temoras the royal palace of the irish kings teamhrath according to some of the bards ecchoing halls he learned to bend the bow of his fathers and to lift the spear nor long did thou lift the spear mildlyshining beam of youth death stands dim behind thee like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light  cuchullin rose before the bard the bards were the heralds of ancient times and their persons were sacred on account of their office in later times they abused that privilege and as their persons were inviolable they satyrised and lampooned so freely those who were not liked by their patrons that they became a public nuisance screened under the character of heralds they grossly abused the enemy when he would not accept the terms they offered  that came from generous torlath he offered him the shell of joy and honored the son of songs sweet voice of lego he said what are the words of torlath comes he to our feast or battle the carborne son of cantela ceanteola head of a family   he comes to thy battle replied the bard to the sounding strife of spears  when morning is gray on lego torlath will fight on the plain and will thou meet him in thine arms king of the isle of mist terrible is the spear of torlath it is a meteor of night he lifts it and the people fall death sits in the lightning of his sword  do i fear replied cuchullin the spear of carborne torlath he is brave as a thousand heroes but my soul delights in war the sword rests not by the side of cuchullin bard of the times of old morning shall meet me on the plain and gleam on the blue arms of semos son  but sit thou on the heath o bard and let us hear thy voice partake of the joyful shell and hear the songs of temora  this is no time replied the bard to hear the song of joy when the mighty are to meet in battle like the strength of the waves of lego why art thou so dark slimora silamor great bill  with all thy silent woods no green star trembles on thy top no moonbeam on thy side but the meteors of death are there and the gray watery forms of ghosts why art thou dark slimora with thy silent woods  he retired in the sound of his song carril accompanied his voice the music was like the memory of joys that are past pleasant and mournful to the soul the ghosts of departed bards heard it from slimoras side soft sounds spread along the wood and the silent valleys of night rejoice  so when he sits in the silence of noon in the valley of his breeze the humming of the mountain be comes to ossians ear the gale drowns it often in its course but the pleasant sound returns again  raise said cuchullin to his hundred bards the song of the noble fingal that song which he hears at night when the dreams of his rest descend when the bards strike the distant harp and the faint light gleams on selmas walls or let the grief of lara rise and the sighs of the mother of calmar calmar the son of matha his death is related at large in the third book of fingal he was the only son of matha and the family was extinct in him  the seat of the family was on the banks of the river lara in the neighborhood of lego and probably near the place where cuchullin lay which circumstance suggested to him the lamentation of alcletha over her son  when he was sought in vain on his hills and she beheld his bow in the hall  carril place the shield of caithbat on that branch and let the spear of cuchullin be near that the sound of my battle may rise with the gray beam of the east  the hero leaned on his fathers shield the song of lara rose the hundred bards were distant far carril alone is near the chief the words of the song were his and the sound of his harp was mournful  alcletha aldclatha decaying beauty probably a poetical name given the mother of calmar by the bard himself with the aged locks mother of carborne calmar why do thou look toward the desert to behold the return of thy son these are not his heroes dark on the heath nor is that the voice of calmar it is but the distant grove alcletha but the roar of the mountain wind  who alcletha speaks calmar had promised to return by a certain day and his mother and his sister alona are represented by the bard as looking with impatience toward that quarter where they expected calmar would make his first appearance bounds over laras stream sister of the noble calmar does not alcletha behold his spear but her eyes are dim is it not the son of matha daughter of my love  it is but an aged oak alcletha replied the lovely weeping alona aluine exquisitely beautiful  it is but an oak alcletha bent over laras stream but who comes along the plain sorrow is in his speed he lifts high the spear of calmar alcletha it is covered with blood  but it is covered with the blood of foes acletha speaks  sister of carborne calmar his spear never returned unstained with blood from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan returned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty   samuel i     nor his bow from the strife of the mighty the battle is consumed in his presence he is a flame of death alona  youth she addresses herself to larnir calmars friend who had returned with the news of his death of the mournful speed where is the son of alcletha does he return with his fame in the midst of his echoing shields  thou art dark and silent  calmar is then no more tell me not warrior how he fell for i cannot hear of his wound   why do thou look toward the desert mother of carborne calmar   such was the song of carril when cuchullin lay on his shield the bards rested on their harps and sleep fell softly around  the son of semo was awake alone his soul was fixed on the war  the burning oaks began to decay faint red light is spread around  a feeble voice is heard the ghost of calmar came he stalked in the beam dark is the wound in his side his hair is disordered and loose joy sits darkly on his face and he seems to invite cuchullin to his cave  son of the cloudy night said the rising chief of erin why do thou bend thy dark eyes on me ghost of the carborne calmar would thou frighten me o mathas son from the battles of cormac thy hand was not feeble in war neither was thy voice see calmars speech in the first book of fingal for peace how art thou changed chief of lara if thou now do advise to fly  but calmar i never fled i never feared see cuchuilins reply to connal concerning crugals ghost fin b   the ghosts of the desert small is their knowledge and weak their hands their dwelling is in the wind  but my soul grows in danger and rejoices in the noise of steel retire thou to thy cave thou art not calmars ghost he delighted in battle and his arm was like the thunder of heaven  he retired in his blast with joy for he had heard the voice of his praise the faint beam of the morning rose and the sound of caithbats buckler spread green ullins warriors convened like the roar of many streams  the horn of war is heard over lego the mighty torlath came  why do thou come with thy thousands cuchullin said the chief of lego i know the strength of thy arm and thy soul is an unextinguished fire  why fight we not on the plain and let our hosts behold our deeds let them behold us like roaring waves that tumble round a rock the mariners hasten away and look on their strife with fear  thou risest like the sun on my soul replied the son of semo thine arm is mighty o torlath and worthy of my wrath retire ye men of ullin to slimoras shady side behold the chief of erin in the day of his fame  carril tell to mighty connal if cuchullin must fall tell him i accused the winds which roar on togormas waves  never was he absent in battle when the strife of my fame arose  let this sword be before cormac like the beam of heaven let his counsel sound in temora in the day of danger   he rushed in the sound of his arms like the terrible spirit of loda loda in the third book of fingal is mentioned as a place of worship in scandinavia by the spirit of loda the poet probably means odin the great deity of the northern nations he is described here with all his terrors about him not unlike mars as he is introduced in a simile in the seventh iliad     so stalks in arms the grisly god of thrace when jove to punish saithless men prepares and gives whole nations to the waste of wars pope  when he comes in the roar of a thousand storms and scatters battles from his eyes  he sits on a cloud over lochlins seas his mighty hand is on his sword and the winds lift his flaming locks  so terrible was cuchullin in the day of his fame  torlath fell by his hand and legos heroes mourned  they gather around the chief like the clouds of the desert  a thousand swords rose at once a thousand arrows flew but he stood like a rock in the midst of a roaring sea  they fell around he strode in blood dark slimora ecchoed wide  the sons of ullin came and the battle spread over lego  the chief of erin overcame he returned over the field with his fame   but pale he returned the joy of his face was dark he rolled his eyes in silence  the sword hung unsheathed in his hand and his spear bent at every step  carril said the king in secret the strength of cuchullin fails my days are with the years that are past and no morning of mine shall arise  they shall seek me at temora but i shall not be found cormac will weep in his hall and fay where is turas chief  but my name is renowned my fame in the song of bards  the youth will say in secret o let me die as cuchullin died renown clothed him like a robe and the light of his fame is great draw the arrow from my side and lay cuchullin beneath that oak place the shield of caithbat near that they may behold me amidst the arms of my fathers   and is the son of semo fallen the irish historians have placed cuchullin in the first century  the translator has given his reasons for fixing him in the third in the dissertation which is prefixed to this collection in other particulars the accounts of keating and oflaherty coincide pretty nearly with ossians poems and the traditions of the highlands and isles they say that he was killed in the twentyseventh year of his age and they give him a great character for his wisdom and valor  said carril with a sigh  mournful are turas walls and sorrow dwells at dunscaich  thy spouse is left alone in her youth the son conloch who was afterward very famous for his great exploits in ireland he was so remarkable for his dexterity in handling the javelin that when a good marksman is described it has passed into a proverb in the north of scotland he is unerring as the arm of conloch of thy love is alone  he shall come to bragela and ask her why she weeps  he shall lift his eyes to the wall and see his fathers sword  whose sword is that he will say and the soul of his mother is sad who is that like the heart of the desert in the murmur of his course  his eyes look wildly round in search of his friend  connal son of colgar where have thou been when the mighty fell did the seas of togorma roll round thee was the wind of the south in thy sails the mighty have fallen in battle and thou wast not there  let none tell it in selma nor in morvens woody land fingal will be sad and the sons of the desert mourn  by the dark rolling waves of lego they raised the heros tomb  luath it was of old the custom to bury the favorite dog near the master this was not peculiar to the ancient scots for we find it practiced by many other nations in their ages of heroism  there is a stone shown still at dunscaich in the isle of sky to which cuchullin commonly bound his dog luath  the stone goes by his name to this day  at a distance lies the companion of cuchullin at the chase  blessed this is the song of the bards over cuchullins tomb every stanza closes with some remarkable title of the hero which was always the custom in funeral clegies  the verse of the song is a lyric measure and it was of old sung to the harp be thy soul son of semo thou were mighty in battle  thy strength was like the strength of a stream thy speed like the eagles they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions   samuel i    wing  thy path in the battle was terrible the steps of death were behind thy sword  blessed be thy soul son of semo carborne chief of dunscaich  thou have not fallen by the sword of the mighty neither was thy blood on the spear of the valiant  the arrow came like the sting of death in a blast nor did the feeble hand which drew the bow perceive it peace to thy soul in thy cave chief of the isle of mist  the mighty are dispersed at temora there is none in cormacs hall the king mourns in his youth for he does not behold thy coming the sound of thy shield is ceased his foes are gathering round soft be thy rest in thy cave chief of erins wars  bragela will not hope thy return or see thy sails in oceans foam  her steps are not on the shore nor her ear open to the voice of thy rowers  she sits in the hall of shells and sees the arms of him that is no more  thine eyes are full of tears daughter of carborne sorglan  blessed be thy soul in death o chief of shady cromla  darthula a poem it may not be improper here to give the story which is the foundation of this poem as it is handed down by tradition  usnoth lord of etha which is probably that part of argyleshire which is near loch eta an arm of the sea in lorn had three sons nathos althos and ardan by slissama the daughter of semo and sister to the celebrated cuchullin the three brothers when very young were sent over to ireland by their father to learn the use of arms under their uncle cuchullin who made a great figure in that kingdom they were just landed in ulster when the news of cuchullins death arrived nathos though very young took the command of cuchullins army made head against cairbar the usurper and defeated him in several battles cairbar at last having found means to murder cormac the lawful king the army of nathos shifted sides and he himself was obliged to return into ulster in order to pass over into scotland  darthula the daughter of colla with whom cairbar was in love resided at that time in selama a castle in ulster she saw fell in love and fled with nathos but a storm rising at sea they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coast of ulster where cairbar was encamped with his army the three brothers after having defended themselves for some time with great bravery were overpowered and slain and the unfortunate darthula killed herself upon the body of her beloved nathos  ossian opens the poem on the night preceding the death of the sons of usnoth and brings in by way of episode what passed before he relates the death of darthula differently from the common tradition his account is the most probable as suicide seems to have been unknown in those early times for no traces of it are found in the old poetry    daughter of heaven the address to the moon is very beautiful in the original it is in a lyric measure and appears to have been sung to the harp  fair art thou the silence of thy face is pleasant thou come forth in loveliness the stars attend thy blue steps in the east the clouds rejoice in thy presence o moon and brighten their darkbrown sides who is like thee in heaven daughter of the night the stars are ashamed in thy presence and turn aside their green sparkling eyes  whither do thou retire from thy course when the darkness the poet means the moon in her wane of thy countenance grows have thou thy hall like ossian dwell thou in the shadow of grief have thy sisters fallen from heaven are they who rejoiced with thee at night no more  yes  they have fallen fair light and thou do often retire to mourn  but thou thyself shall fail one night and leave thy blue path in heaven the stars will then lift their green heads they who were ashamed in thy presence will rejoice  thou art now clothed with thy brightness look from thy gates in the sky burst the cloud o wind that the daughter of night may look forth that the shaggy mountains may brighten and the ocean roll its blue waves in light  nathos nathos signifies youthful ailthos exquisite beauty ardan pride is on the deep and althos that beam of youth ardan is near his brothers they move in the gloom of their course the sons of usnoth move in darkness from the wrath of carborne cairbar cairbar who murdered cormac king of ireland and usurped the throne he was afterward killed by oscar the son of ossian in a single combat the poet upon other occasions gives him the epithet of redhaired   who is that dim by their side the night has covered her beauty her hair sighs on oceans wind her robe streams in dusky wreaths she is like the fair ghost of heaven in the midst of his shadowy mist who is it but darthula darthula or darthuile a woman with fine eyes she was the most famous beauty of antiquity to this day when a woman is praised for her beauty the common phrase is that she is as lovely as darthula  the first of erins maids she has fled from the love of cairbar with the carborne nathos but the winds deceive thee o darthula and deny the woody etha to thy sails these are not thy mountains nathos nor is that the roar of thy climbing waves the halls of cairbar are near and the towers of the foe lift their heads ullin stretches its green head into the sea and turas bay receives the ship where have ye been ye southern winds when the sons of my love were deceived but ye have been sporting on plains and pursuing the thistles beard o that ye had been rustling in the sails of nathos till the hills of etha rose till they rose in their clouds and saw their coming chief long have thou been absent nathos and the day of thy return is past that is the day appointed by destiny we find no deity in ossians poetry if fate is not one of that he is very full in some of his poems in the translators hands   but the land of strangers saw thee lovely thou wast lovely in the eyes of darthula thy face was like the light of the morning thy hair like the ravens wing thy soul was generous and mild like the hour of the setting sun thy words were the gale of the reeds or the gliding stream of lora  but when the rage of battle rose thou wast like a sea in a storm the clang of thy arms was terrible the host vanished at the sound of thy course  it was then darthula beheld thee from the top of her mossy tower from the tower of selama the poet does not mean that selama which is mentioned as the seat of toscar in ulster in the poem of conlath and cuthona the word in the original signifies either beautiful to behold or a place with a pleasant or wide prospect in those times they built their houses upon eminences to command a view of the country and to prevent their being surprised many of them on that account were called selama the famous selma of fingal is derived from the same root  where her fathers dwelt  lovely art thou o stranger she said for her trembling soul arose fair art thou in thy battles friend of the fallen cormac cormac the young king of ireland who was privately murdered by cairbar  why do thou rush on in thy valor youth of the ruddy look few are thy hands in battle against the carborne cairbar  o that i might be freed of his love that is of the love of cairbar  that i might rejoice in the presence of nathos  blessed are the rocks of etha they will behold his steps at the chase they will see his white bosom when the winds lift his raven hair  such were thy words darthula in selamas mossy towers but now the night is round thee and the winds have deceived thy sails the winds have deceived thy sails darthula their blustering sound is high cease a little while o north wind and let me hear the voice of the lovely thy voice is lovely darthula between the rustling blasts  are these the rocks of nathos and the roar of his mountainstreams comes that beam of light from usnoths nightly hall the mist rolls around and the beam is feeble but the light of darthulas soul is the carborne chief of etha son of the generous usnoth why that broken sigh are we not in the land of strangers chief of echoing etha  these are not the rocks of nathos he replied nor the roar of his streams no light comes from ethas halls for they are distant sar we are in the land of strangers in the land of carborne cairbar the winds have deceived us darthula ullin lifts here her green hills  go toward the north althos be thy steps ardan along the coast that the foe may not come in darkness and our hopes of etha fail   i will go toward that mossy tower and see who dwells about the beam  rest darthula on the shore rest in peace thou beam of light the sword of nathos is around thee like the lightning of heaven  he went she sat alone and heard the rolling of the wave the big tear is in her eye and she looked for the carborne nathos  her soul trembles at the blast and she turns her ear toward the tread of his feet  the tread of his feet is not heard where art thou son of my love the roar of the blast is around me dark is the cloudy night  but nathos does not return what detains thee chief of etha  have the foes met the hero in the strife of the night   he returned but his face was dark he had seen his departed friend  it was the wall of tura and the ghost of cuchullin stalked there the sighing of his breast was frequent and the decayed flame of his eyes terrible his spear was a column of mist the stars looked dim through his form his voice was like hollow wind in a cave and he told the tale of grief the soul of nathos was sad like the sun conditus in nubem medioque refugerit orb virg  through mists he shoots his sullen beams frugal of light in loose and straggling streams dryden in the day of mist when his face is watery and dim  why art thou sad o nathos said the lovely daughter of colla thou art a pillar of light to darthula the joy of her eyes is in ethas chief where is my friend       hom vi      but nathos my father rests in the tomb silence dwells on selama sadness spreads on the blue streams of my land my friends have fallen with cormac the mighty were slain in the battle of ullin  evening darkened on the plain the blue streams failed before mine eyes the unfrequent blast came rustling in the tops of selamas groves my feat was beneath a tree on the walls of my fathers truthil past before my soul the brother of my love he that was absent the family of colla preserved their loyalty to cormac long after the death of cuchullin in battle against the carborne cairbar  bending on his spear the grayhaired colla came his downcast face is dark and sorrow dwells in his soul his sword is on the side of the hero the helmet of his fathers on his head  the battle grows in his breast he strives to hide the tear  darthula he sighing said thou art the last of collas race truthil is fallen in battle the king it is very common in ossians poetry to give the title of king to every chief that was remarkable for his valor of selama is no more  cairbar comes with his thousands toward selamas walls  colla will meet his pride and revenge his son but where shall i find thy safety darthula with the darkbrown hair thou art lovely as the sunbeam of heaven and thy friends are low  and is the son of battle fallen i said with a bursting sigh ceased the generous soul of truthil to lighten through the field  my safety colla is in that bow i have learned to pierce the deer is not cairbar like the heart of the desert father of fallen truthil  the face of age brightened with joy and the crowded tears of his eyes poured down the lips of colla trembled his gray beard whistled in the blast thou art the sister of truthil he said and thou burnest in the fire of his soul take darthula take that spear that brazen shield that burnished helmet they are the spoils of a warrior a son the poet to make the story of darthulas arming herself for battle more probable makes her armor to be that of a very young man otherwise it would shock all belief that she who was very young should be able to carry it of early youth  when the light rises on selama we go to meet the carborne cairbar  but keep thou near the arm of colla beneath the shadow of my shield thy father darthula could once defend thee but age is trembling on his hand  the strength of his arm has failed and his soul is darkened with grief  we passed the night in sorrow the light of morning rose i shone in the arms of battle the grayhaired hero moved before the sons of selama convened around the sounding shield of colla but few were they in the plain and their locks were gray the youths had fallen with truthil in the battle of carborne cormac  companions of my youth said colla it was not thus you have seen me in arms it was not thus i strode to battle when the great confadan fell but ye are laden with grief the darkness of age comes like the mist of the desert my shield is worn with years my sword is fixed it was the custom of those times that every warrior at a certain age or when he became unfit for the field fixed his arms in the great hall where the tribe feasted upon joyful occasions he was afterward never to appear in battle and this stage of life was called the time of fixing of the arms in its place i said to my soul thy evening shall be calm and thy departure like a fading light but the storm has returned i bend like an aged oak my boughs are fallen on selama and i tremble in my place  where art thou with thy fallen heroes o my carborne truthil thou answerest not from thy rushing blast and the soul of thy father is sad but i will be sad no more cairbar or colla must fall i feel the returning strength of my arm my heart leaps at the sound of battle  the hero drew his sword the gleaming blades of his people rose they moved along the plain their gray hair streamed in the wind  cairbar sat at the feast in the silent plain of lona lona a marshy plain it was the custom in the days of ossian to feast after a victory cairbar had just provided an entertainment for his army upon the defeat of truthil the son of colla and the rest of the party of cormac when colla and his aged warriors arrived to give him battle  he saw the coming of the heroes and he called his chiefs to battle  why the poet by an artifice avoids the description of the battle of lona as it would be improper in the mouth of a woman and could have nothing new after the numerous descriptions of that kind in his other poems he at the same time gives an opportunity to dar thula to pass a fine compliment on her lover should i tell to nathos how the strife of battle grew i have seen thee in the midst of thousands like the beam of heavens fire it is beautiful but terrible the people fall in its red course  the spear of colla slew for he remembered the battles of his youth an arrow came with its sound and pierced the heros side he fell on his ecchoing shield my soul started with fear i stretched my buckler over him but my heaving breast was seen cairbar came with his spear and he beheld selamas maid joy rose on his darkbrown face he stayed the lifted steel he raised the tomb of colla and brought me weeping to selama he spoke the words of love but my soul was sad i saw the shields of my fathers and the sword of carborne truthil i saw the arms of the dead and the tear was on my cheek  then thou did come o nathos and gloomy cairbar fled he fled like the ghost of the desert before the mornings beam his hosts were not near and feeble was his arm against thy steel  why it is usual with ossian to repeat at the end of the episodes the sentence which introduced them it brings back the mind of the reader to the main story of the poem art thou sad o nathos said the lovely maid of colla  i have met replied the hero the battle in my youth my arm could not lift the spear when first the danger rose but my soul brightened before the war as the green narrow vale when the sun pours his streamy beams before he hides his head in a storm my soul brightened in danger before i saw selamas fair before i saw thee like a star that shines on the hill at night the cloud slowly comes and threatens the lovely light  we are in the land of the foe and the winds have deceived us darthula the strength of our friends is not near nor the mountains of etha where shall i find thy peace daughter of mighty colla the brothers of nathos are brave and his own sword has shone in war but what are the sons of usnoth to the host of carborne cairbar o that the winds had brought thy sails oscar oscar the son of ossian had long resolved on the expedition into ireland against cairbar who had assassinated his friend cathol the son of moran an irishman of noble extraction and in the interest of the family of cormac king of men thou did promise to come to the battles of fallen cormac then would my hand be strong as the flaming arm of death cairbar would tremble in his halls and peace dwell round the lovely darthula but why do thou fall my soul the sons of usnoth may prevail  and they will prevail o nathos said the rising soul of the maid never shall darthula behold the halls of gloomy cairbar give me those arms of brass that glitter to that passing meteor i see them in the darkbosomed ship darthula will enter the battle of steel  ghost of the noble colla do i behold thee on that cloud who is that dim beside thee it is the carborne truthil shall i behold the halls of him that slew selamas chief no i will not behold them spirits of my love  joy rose in the face of nathos when he heard the white bosomed maid daughter of selama thou shinest on my soul come with thy thousands cairbar the strength of nathos is returned and thou o aged usnoth shall not hear that thy son has fled i remember thy words on etha when my sails begun to rise when i spread them toward ullin toward the mossy walls of tura thou go he said o nathos to the king of shields to cuchullin chief of men who never fled from danger let not thine arm be feeble neither be thy thoughts of flight lest the son of semo say that ethas race are weak his words may come to usnoth and sadden his soul in the hall  the tear is on his cheek he gave this shining sword  i came to turas bay but the halls of tura were silent i looked around and there was none to tell of the chief of dunscaich i went to the hall of his shells where the arms of his fathers hung but the arms were gone and aged lamhor lamhmhor mighty hand sat in tears  whence are the arms of steel said the rising lamhor the light of the spear has long been absent from turas dusky walls  come ye from the rolling sea or from temoras temora was the royal palace of the supreme kings of ireland it is here called mournful on account of the death of cormac who was murdered there by cairbar who usurped his throne mournful halls  we come from the sea i said from usnoths rising towers we are the sons of slissama slisseamha ot bosom she was the wise of usnoth and daughter of semo the chief of the isle of mist  the daughter of carborne semo where is turas chief son of the silent hall but why should nathos ask for i behold thy tears how did the mighty fall son of the lonely tura  he fell not lamhor replied like the silent star of night when it shoots through darkness and is no more but he was like a meteor that salls in a distant land death attends its green course and itself is the sign of wars  mournful are the banks of lego and the roar of streamy lara there the hero fell son of the noble usnoth  and the hero fell in the midst of slaughter i said with a bursting sigh his hand was strong in battle and death was behind his sword  we came to legos mournful banks we found his rising tomb his conpanions in battle are there his bards of many songs three days we mourned over the hero on the fourth i struck the shield of caithbat the heroes gathered around with joy and shook their beamy spears  corlath was near with his host the friend of carborne cairbar we came like a stream by night and his heroes fell when the people of the valley rose and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand and when they rose early in the morning behold they were all dead men   kings xix     they saw their blood with mornings light but we rolled away like wreaths of mist to cormacs ecchoing hall our swords rose to defend the king but temoras halls were empty cormac had fallen in his youth the king of erin was no more  sadness seized the sons of ullin they slowly gloomily retired like clouds that long having threatened rain retire behind the hills the sons of usnoth moved in their grief toward turas sounding bay we passed by selama and cairbar retired like lanos mist when it is driven by the winds of the desert  it was then i beheld thee o maid like the light of ethas sun lovely is that beam i said and the crowded sigh of my bosom rose thou came in thy beauty darthula to ethas mournful chief  but the winds have deceived us daughter of colla and the foe is near  yes  the foe is near said the rustling strength of althos althos had just returned from viewing the coast of lena whither he had been sent by nathos the beginning of the night  i heard their clanging arms on the coast and saw the dark wreaths of erins standard distinct is the voice of cairbar cairbar had gathered an army to the coast of ulster in order to oppose fingal who prepared for an expedition into ireland to reestablish the house of cormac on the throne which cairbar had usurped between the wings of cairbars army was the bay of tura into which the ship of the sons of usnoth was driven so that there was no possibility of their escaping  and loud as cromlas falling stream he had seen the dark ship on the sea before the dusky night came down his people watch on lenas the scene of the present poem is nearly the same with that of the epic poem in this collection the heath of lena and tura are often mentioned plain and lift ten thousand swords  and let them lift ten thousand swords said nathos with a smile the sons of carborne usnoth will never tremble in danger why do thou roll with all thy foam thou roaring sea of ullin why do ye rustle on your dark wings ye whistling tempests of the sky  do ye think ye storms that ye keep nathos on the coast no his sold detains him children of the night  althos bring my fathers arms thou see them beaming to the stars bring the spear of semo semo was grandfather to nathos by the mothers side the spear mentioned here was given to usnoth on his marriage it being the custom then for the father of the lady to give his arms to his son in law the ceremony used upon these occasions is mentioned in other poems  it stands in the darkbosomed ship  he brought the arms nathos clothed his limbs in all their shining steel the stride of the chief is lovely the joy of his eyes terrible he looks toward the coming of cairbar the wind is rustling in his hair darthula is silent at his side her look is fixed on the chief she strives to hide the rising sigh and two tears swell in her eyes  althos said the chief of etha i see a cave in that rock place darthula there and let thy arm be strong ardan we meet the foe and call to battle gloomy cairbar o that he came in his sounding steel to meet the son of usnoth  darthula if thou shall escape look not on the fallen nathos lift thy sails o althos toward the ecchoing groves of etha  tell to the chief usnoth  that his son fell with fame that my sword did not shun the battle tell him i fell in the midst of thousands and let the joy of his grief be great daughter of colla call the maids to ethas echoing hall let their songs arise for nathos when shadowy autumn returns  o that the voice of cona ossian the son of fingal is often poetically called the voice of cona might be heard in my praise then would my spirit rejoice in the midst of my mountain winds  and my voice shall praise thee nathos chief of the woody etha the voice of ossian shall rise in thy praise son of the generous usnoth why was i not on lena when the battle rose then would the sword of ossian defend thee or himself fall low  we sat that night in selma round the strength of the shell the wind was abroad in the oaks the spirit of the mountain by the spirit of the mountain is meant that deep and melancholy sound which precedes a storm well known to those who live in a high country shrieked the blast came rustling through the hall and gently touched my harp the sound was mournful and low like the song of the tomb fingal heard it first and the crowded sighs of his bosom rose  some of my heroes are low said the grayhaired king of morven i hear the sound of death on the harp of my son ossian touch the sounding string bid the sorrow rise that their spirits may fly with joy to morvens woody hills  i touched the harp before the king the sound was mournful and low bend forward from your clouds i said ghosts of my fathers bend lay by the red terror of your course and receive the falling chief whether he comes from a distant land or rises from the rolling sea let his robe of mist be near his spear that is formed of a cloud place an halfextinguished meteor by his side in the form of the heros sword and oh let his countenance be lovely that his friends may delight in his presence bend from your clouds i said ghosts of my fathers bend  such was my song in selma to the lightlytrembling harp but nathos was on ullins shore surrounded by the night he heard the voice of the foe amidst the roar of tumbling waves silent he heard their voice and rested on his spear  morning rose with its beams the sons of erin appear like gray rocks with all their trees they spread along the coast cairbar stood in the midst and grimly smiled when he saw the foe  nathos rushed forward in his strength nor could darthula stay behind she came with the hero lifting her shining spear and who are these in their armor in the pride of youth who but the sons of usnoth althos and darkhaired ardan  come said nathos come chief of the high temora let our battle be on the coast for the whitebosomed maid his people are not with nathos they are behind that rolling sea why do thou bring thy thousands against the chief of etha thou did fly he alludes to the flight of cairbar from selama from him in battle when his friends were around him  youth of the heart of pride shall erins king fight with thee thy fathers were not among the renowned nor of the kings of men are the arms of soes in their halls or the shields of other times cairbar is renowned in temora nor does he fight with little men  the tear starts from carborne nathos he turned his eyes to his brothers their spears flew at once and three heroes lay on earth then the light of their swords gleamed on high the ranks of erin yield as a ridge of dark clouds before a blast of wind  then cairbar ordered his people and they drew a thousand bows a thousand arrows flew the sons of usnoth fell they fell like three young oaks which stood alone on the hill the traveller saw the lovely trees and wondered how they grew so lonely the blast of the desert came by night and laid their green heads low next day he returned but they were withered and the heath was bare  darthula stood in silent grief and beheld their fall no tear is in her eye but her look is wildly sad pale was her cheek her trembling lips broke short an halfformed word her dark hair flew on the wind  but gloomy cairbar came where is thy lover now the carborne chief of etha have thou beheld the halls of usnoth or the darkbrown hills of fingal my battle had roared on morven did not the winds meet darthula fingal himself would have been low and sorrow dwelling in selma  her shield fell from darthulas arm her breast of snow appeared it appeared but it was stained with blood for an arrow was fixed in her side she fell on the fallen nathos like a wreath of snow her dark hair spreads on his face and their blood is mixing round  daughter of colla thou art low said cairbars hundred bards silence is at the blue streams of selama for truthils truthil was the founder of darthulas family race have failed when will thou rise in thy beauty first of erins maids thy sleep is long in the tomb and the morning distant far the sun shall not come to thy bed and say awake rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of singing is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree puts forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away solomons song darthula awake thou first of women the wind of spring is abroad the flowers shake their heads on the green hills the woods wave their growing leaves retire o sun the daughter of colla is asleep she will not come forth in her beauty she will not move in the steps of her loveliness  such was the song of the bards when they raised the tomb i sung afterward over the grave when the king of morven came when he came to green ullin to fight with carborne cairbar  temora an epic poem though the history which is the foundation of the present poem was given in the notes on the two pieces preceding it may not be here improper to recapitulate some part of what has been said  immediately after the death of cuchullin cairbar lord of atha openly set up for himself in connaught and having privately murdered young king cormac became without opposition sole monarch of ireland the murder of cormac was so much resented by fingal that he resolved on an expedition into ireland against cairbar early intelligence of his designs came to cairbar and he had gathered the tribes together into ulster to oppose fingals landing at the same time his brother cathmor kept himself with an army near temora  this cathmor is one of the finest characters in the old poetry his humanity generosity and hospitality were unparallelled in short he had no fault but too much attachment to so bad a brother as cairbar  the present poem has its name from temora the royal palace of the irish kings near which the last and decisive battle was fought between fingal and cathmor what has come to the translators hands in a regular connection is little more than the opening of the poem  this work appears from the story of it which is still preserved to have been one of the greatest of ossians compositions the variety of the characters makes it interesting and the war as it is carried on by fingal and cathmor affords instances of the greatest bravery mixed with incomparably generous actions and sentiments one is at a loss for which side to declare himself and often wishes when both commanders march to battle that both may return victorious at length the good fortune of fingal preponderates and the family of cormac are reestablished on the irish throne  the irish traditions relate the affair in another light and exclaim against fingal for appointing thirty judges or rather tyrants at temora for regulating the affairs of ireland they pretend to enumerate many acts of oppression committed by those judges and affirm that both they and a part of fingals army which was left in ireland to enforce their laws were at last expelled the kingdom  thus the irish traditions say the historians of that nation it is said however that those gentlemen sometimes create facts in order afterward to make remarks upon them at least that they adopt for real facts the traditions of their bards when they throw luster on the ancient state of their country  the present poem opens in the morning cairbar is represented as retired from the rest of the irish chiefs and tormented with remorse for the murder of cormac when news was brought him of fingals landing what passed preceding that day and is necessary to be known for carrying on the poem is afterward introduced by way of episode    the blue waves of ullin roll in light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusky heads in the breeze and gray torrents pour their noisy streams  two green hills with their aged oaks surround a narrow plain the blue course of the mountainstream is there cairbar stands on its banks  his spear supports the king the red eyes of his fear are sad cormac rises in his soul with all his ghastly wounds the gray form of the youth appears in the midst of darkness and the blood pours from his airy sides  cairbar thrice threw his spear on earth and thrice he stroked his beard his steps are short he often stopped and tossed his sinewy arms he is like a cloud in the desert that varies its form to every blast the valleys are sad around and fear by turns the shower  the king at length resumed his soul and took his pointed spear he turned his eyes toward lena the scene described here is nearly that of the epic poem fingal in this neighborhood also the sons of usnoth were killed  the scouts of ocean appear they appeared with steps of fear and often looked behind cairbar knew that the mighty were near and called his gloomy chiefs the sounding steps of his heroes came they drew at once their swords there morlath morlath great in the day of battle hidalla wildly looking hero cormar expert at sea malthos slow to speak foldath generous stood with darkened face hidallas bushy hair sighs in the wind redhaired cormar bends on his spear and rolls his sidelonglooking eyes wild is the look of malthos from beneath two shaggy brows  foldath stands like an oozy rock that covers its dark sides with foam his spear is like slimoras fir that meets the wind of heaven his shield is marked with the strokes of battle and his red eye despises danger these and a thousand other chiefs surrounded carborne cairbar when the scout of ocean came morannal morannail strong breath a very proper name for a scout  from streamy lena  his eyes hang forward from his face his lips are trembling pale  do the chiefs of erin stand he said silent as the grove of evening stand they like a silent wood and fingal on the coast fingal who is terrible in battle the king of streamy morven  and have thou seen the warrior said cairbar with a sigh are his heroes many on the coast lifts he the spear of battle or comes the king in peace  he comes not in peace o cairbar for i have seen his forward spear morannal here alludes to the particular appearance of fingals spear  if a man upon his first landing in a strange country kept the point of his spear forward it denoted in those days that he came in a hostile manner and accordingly he was treated as an enemy if he kept the point behind him it was a token of friendship and he was immediately invited to the feast according to the hospitality of the times it is a meteor of death the blood of thousands is on its steel  he came first to the shore strong in the gray hair of age full rose his sinewy limbs as he strode in his might that sword is by his side which gives no second this was the famous sword of fingal made by luno a smith of lochlin and after him poetically called the son of luno it is said of this sword that it killed a man at every stroke and that fingal never used it but in times of the greatest danger wound his shield is terrible like the bloody moon when it rises in a storm  then came ossian king of songs and mornis son the first of men connal leaps forward on his spear dermid spreads his darkbrown locks  fillan bends his bow fergus strides in the pride of youth who is that with aged locks a dark shield is on his side his spear trembles at every step and age is on his limbs he bends his dark face to the ground the king of spears is sad  it is usnoth o cairbar coming to revenge his sons he sees green ullin with tears and he remembers the tombs of his children but far before the rest the son of ossian comes bright in the smiles of youth fair as the first beams of the sun his long hair falls on his back  his dark brows are half hid beneath his helmet of steel his sword hangs loose on the heros side his spear glitters as he moves i fled from his terrible eyes king of high temora  then fly thou feeble man said the gloomy wrath of foldath fly to the gray streams of thy land son of the little soul have not i seen that oscar i beheld the chief in battle he is of the mighty in danger but there are others who lift the spear  erin has many sons as brave yes  more brave o carborne cairbar  let foldath meet him in the strength of his course and stop this mighty stream  my spear is covered with the blood of the valiant my shield is like turas wall  shall foldath alone meet the foe replied the darkbrowed malthos are not they numerous on our coast like the waters of a thousand streams are not these the chiefs who vanquished swaran when the sons of erin fled and shall foldath meet their bravest hero foldath of the heart of pride take the strength of the people by thy side and let malthos come my sword is red with slaughter but who has heard my words that is who has heard my vaunting he intended the expression as a rebuke to the selfpraise of foldath   sons of green erin begun the mild hidalla let not fingal hear your words lest the foe rejoice and his arm be strong in the land  ye are brave o warriors and like the tempests of the desert they meet the rocks without fear and overturn the woods in their course  but let us move in our strength and slow as a gathered cloud when the winds drive it from behind  then shall the mighty tremble and the spear drop from the hand of the valiant  we see the cloud of death they will say and their faces will turn pale fingal will mourn in his age and say that his fame is ceased  morven will behold his chiefs no more the moss of years shall grow in selma  cairbar heard their words in silence like the cloud of a shower it stands dark on cromla till the lightning bursts its side the valley gleams with red light the spirits of the storm rejoice  so stood the silent king of temora at length his words are heard  spread the feast on lena and let my hundred bards attend and thou redhaird olla take the harp of the king go to oscar king of swords and bid him to our feast today we feast and hear the song tomorrow break the spears tell him that i have raised the tomb of cathol cathol the son of maronnan or moran was murdered by cairbar for his attachment to the family of cormac he had attended oscar to the war of inisthona where they contracted a great friendship for one another oscar immediately after the death of cathol had sent a formal challenge to cairbar which he prudently declined but conceived a secret hatred against oscar and had beforehand contrived to kill him at the feast to which he here invited him  and that my bards have sung to his ghost  tell him that cairbar has heard his fame at the stream of distant carun he alludes to the battle of oscar against caros king of ships who is supposed to be the same with carausius the usurper   cathmor cathmor great in battle cairbar takes advantage of his brothers absence to perpetrate his ungenerous designs against oscar for the noble spirit of cathmor had he been present would not have permitted the laws of that hospitality for which he was so renowned himself to be violated the brothers form a contrast we do not detest the mean soul of cairbar more than we admire the disinterested and generous mind of cathmor is not here the generous brother of cairbar he is not here with his thousands and our arms are weak cathmor is a foe to strife at the feast his soul is bright as the sun but cairbar shall fight with oscar chiefs of the high temora his words for cathol were many and the wrath of cairbar burns he shall fall on lena and my fame shall rise in blood  the faces of the heroes brightened they spread over lenas heath the feast of shells is prepared the songs of the bards arose  we heard fingals army heard the joy that was in cairbars camp the character given of cathmor is agreeable to the times some through ostentation were hospitable and others fell naturally into a custom handed down from their ancestors but what marks strongly the character of cathmor is his aversion to praise for he is represented to dwell in a wood to avoid the thanks of his guests which is still a higher degree of generosity than that of axylus in homer for the poet does not say but the good man might at the head of his own table have heard with pleasure the praise bestowed on him by the people he entertained     hom      next teuthras son distained the sands with blood axylus hospitable rich and good in fair arisbes walls his native place he held his seat a friend to human race fast by the road his ever open door obliged the wealthy and relieved the poor pope the voice of joy on the coast and we thought that the mighty cathmor came cathmor the friend of strangers the brother of redhaired cairbar but their souls were not the same for the light of heaven was in the bosom of cathmor his towers rose on the banks of atha seven paths led to his halls seven chiefs stood on those paths and called the stranger to the feast but cathmor dwelt in the wood to avoid the voice of praise  olla came with his songs oscar went to cairbars feast three hundred heroes attended the chief and the clang of their arms is terrible the gray dogs bounded on the heath and their howling is frequent fingal saw the departure of the hero the soul of the king was sad he dreads the gloomy cairbar but who of the race of trenmor seared the foe  my son lifted high the spear of cormac an hundred bards met him with songs cairbar concealed with smiles the death that was dark in his soul the feast is spread the shells resound joy brightens the face of the host but it was like the parting beam of the sun when he is to hide his red head in a storm  cairbar rose in his arms darkness gathers on his brow the hundred harps ceased at once the clang when a chief was determined to kill a man that was in his power already it was usual to signify that his death was intended by the sound of a shield struck with the blunt end of a spear at the same time that a bard at distance raised the deathsong a ceremony of another kind was long used in scotland upon such occasions every body has heard that a bulls head was served up to lord douglas in the castle of edinburgh as a certain signal of his approaching death of shields is heard far distant on the heath olla raised his song of woe my son knew the sign of death and rising seized his spear  oscar said the darkred cairbar i behold the spear cormac the son of arth had given the spear which is here the foundation of the quarrel to oscar when he came to congratulate him upon swarans being expelled from ireland of erins kings the spear of temora timorri the house of the great king the name of the royal palace of the supreme kings of ireland glitters in thy hand son of the woody morven it was the pride of an hundred kings the death of heroes of old yield it son of ossian yield it to carborne cairbar  shall i yield oscar replied the gift of erins injured king the gift of fairhaired cormac when oscar scattered his foes i came to his halls of joy when swaran sled from fingal gladness rose in the face of youth he gave the spear of temora nor did he give it to the feeble o cairbar neither to the weak in soul the darkness of thy face is not a storm to me nor are thine eyes the flames of death do i fear thy clanging shield does my soul tremble at ollas song no cairbar frighten thou the feeble oscar is like a rock  and will thou not yield the spear replied the rising pride of cairbar are thy words mighty because fingal is near the grayhaired warrior of morven he has fought with little men but he must vanish before cairbar like a thin pillar of mist before the winds of atha atha shallow river the name of cairbars seat in connaught   were he who fought with little men near the chief of atha athas chief would yield green erin to avoid his rage speak not of the mighty o cairbar but turn thy sword on me our strength is equal but fingal is renowned the first of mortal men  their people saw the darkening chiefs their crowding steps are heard around their eyes roll in fire a thousand swords are half unsheathed redhaired olla raised the song of battle the trembling joy of oscars soul arose the wonted joy of his soul when fingals horn was heard  dark as the swelling wave of ocean before the rising winds when it bends its head near the coast came on the host of cairbar  daughter of toscar the poet means malvina the daughter of toscar to whom he addressed that part of the poem which related to the death of oscar her lover  why that tear he is not fallen yet many were the deaths of his arm before my hero fell  behold they fall before my son like the groves in the desert when an angry ghost rushes through night and takes their green heads in his hand morlath falls maronnan dies conachar trembles in his blood cairbar shrinks before oscars sword and creeps in darkness behind his stone he lifted the spear in secret and pierced my oscars side he falls forward on his shield his knee sustains the chief but his spear is in his hand see gloomy cairbar the irish historians place the death of cairbar in the latter end of the third century they say he was killed in battle against oscar the son of ossian but deny that he fell by his hand as they have nothing to go upon but the traditions of their bards the translator thinks that the account of ossian is as probable at the worst it is but opposing one tradition to another falls the steel pierced his forehead and divided his red hair behind he lay like a shattered rock which cromla shakes from its side but never more shall oscar rise he leans on his bossy shield his spear is in his terrible hand erins sons stood distant and dark their shouts arose like the crowded noise of streams and lena echoed around  fingal heard the sound and took his fathers spear his steps are before us on the heath he spoke the words of woe i hear the noise of battle and oscar is alone rise ye sons of morven and join the heros sword  ossian rushed along the heath fillan bounded over lena fergus flew with feet of wind fingal strode in his strength and the light of his shield is terrible the sons of erin saw it far distant they trembled in their souls they knew that the wrath of the king arose and they foresaw their death we first arrived we fought and erins chiefs withstood our rage but when the king came in the sound of his course what heart of steel could stand erin fled over lena death pursued their flight  we saw oscar leaning on his shield we saw his blood around silence darkened on every heros face each turned his back and wept the king strove to hide his tears his gray beard whistled in the wind he bends his head over his son and his words are mixed with sighs  and art thou fallen oscar in the midst of thy course the heart of the aged beats over thee he sees thy coming battles he beholds the battles which ought to come but they are cut off from thy fame when shall joy dwell at selma when shall the song of grief cease on morven my sons fall by degrees fingal shall be the last of his race the fame which i have received shall pass away my age will be without friends i shall sit like a gray cloud in my hall nor shall i expect the return of a son in the midst of his sounding arms weep ye heroes of morven never more shall oscar rise  and they did weep o fingal dear was the hero to their souls he went out to battle and the foes vanished he returned in peace amidst their joy no father mourned his son slain in youth no brother his brother of love they fell without tears for the chief of the people was low bran bran was one of fingals dogs  hewas so remarkable for his fleetness that the poet in a piece which is not just now in the translators hands has given him the same properties with virgils camilla is howling at his feet gloomy luath is sad for he had often led them to the chase to the bounding roes of the desert  when oscar beheld his friends around his white breast rose with a sigh  the groans he said of my aged heroes the howling of my dogs the sudden bursts of the song of grief have melted oscars soul my soul that never melted before it was like the steel of my sword  ossian carry me to my hills raise the stones of my fame place the horn of the deer and my sword within my narrow dwelling  the torrent hereafter may raise the earth of my tomb the hunter may find the steel and say this has been oscars sword  and fallest thou son of my fame and shall i never see thee oscar when others hear of their sons i shall not hear of thee the moss is on the stones of his tomb and the mournful wind is there the battle shall be fought without him he shall not pursue the darkbrown hinds when the warrior returns from battles and tells of other lands he will say i have seen a tomb by the roaring stream where a warrior darkly dwells he was slain by carborne oscar the first of mortal men  i perhaps shall hear him and a beam of joy will rise in my soul  the night would have descended in sorrow and morning returned in the shadow of grief our chiefs would have stood like cold dropping rocks on lena and have forgot the war did not the king disperse his grief and raise his mighty voice the chiefs as newwakened from dreams lift their heads around  how long shall we weep on lena or pour our tears in ullin the mighty will not return oscar shall not rise in his strength the valiant must fall one day and be no more known on his hills  where are our fathers o warriors the chiefs of the times of old they have set like stars that have stone we only hear the sound of their praise but they were renowned in their day and the terror of other times thus shall we pass o warriors in the day of our fall then let us be renowned when we may and leave our fame behind us like the last beams of the sun when he hides his red head in the west  ullin my aged bard take the ship of the king carry oscar to selma and let the daughters of morven weep we shall fight in erin for the race of fallen cormac the days of my years begin to fail i feel the weakness of my arm my fathers bend from their clouds to receive their grayhaird son but trenmor before i go hence one beam of my fame shall rise so shall my days end as my years begun in fame my life shall be one stream of light to other times  ullin raised his white sails the wind of the south came forth he bounded on the waves toward selmas walls  i remained in my grief but my words were not heard  the feast is spread on lena an hundred heroes reared the tomb of cairbar but no song is raised over the chief for his soul had been dark and bloody we remembered the fall of cormac and what could we say in cairbars praise  the night came rolling down the light of an hundred oaks arose fingal sat beneath a tree the chief of etha sat near the king the grayhaird strength of usnoth  old althan althan the son of conachar was the chief bard of arth king of ireland after the death of arth althan attended his son cormac and was present at his death  he had made his escape from cairbar by the means of cathmor and coming to fingal related as here the death of his master cormac stood in the midst and told the tale of fallen cormac althan the son of conachar the friend of carborne cuchullin he dwelt with cormac in windy temora when semos son fought with generous torlath  the tale of althan was mournful and the tear was in his eye  althan speaks the setting sun was yellow on dora doira the woody side of a mountain it is here a hill in the neighborhood of temora  gray evening began to descend temoras woods shook with the blast of the unconstant wind a cloud at length gathered in the west and a red star looked from behind its edge  i stood in the wood alone and saw a ghost on the darkening air his stride extended from hill to hill his shield was dim on his side it was the son of semo i knew the sadness of his face but he passed away in his blast and all was dark around  my soul was sad i went to the hall of shells a thousand lights arose the hundred bards had strung the harp cormac stood in the midst like the morning star qualis ubi occani perfusus luciser unda quem venus anic alios astrorum diligit ignes extulit os sacrum coelo tenebrasque resolvit virg so from the seas exerts his radiant head the star by whom the lights of heaven are led shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews dispels the darkness and the day renews dryden  when it rejoices on the eastern hill and its young beams are bathed in showers  the sword of artho arth or artho the father of cormac king of ireland was in the hand of the king and he looked with joy on its polished studs thrice he attempted to draw it and thrice he failed his yellow locks are spread on his shoulders his cheeks of youth are red  i mourned over the beam of youth for he was soon to set  althan he said with a smile have thou beheld my father heavy is the sword of the king surely his arm was strong o that i were like him in battle when the rage of his wrath arose then would i have met like cuchullin the carborne son of cantela but years may come on o althan and my arm be strong  have thou heard of semos son the chief of high temora he might have returned with his fame for he promised to return tonight my bards wait him with their songs and my feast is spread   i heard the king in silence my tears began to flow i hid them with my gray locks but he perceived my grief  son of conachar he said is the king of tura low why bursts thy sigh in secret and why descends the tear  comes the carborne torlath or the sound of the redhaired cairbar  they come  for i see thy grief and turas king is low  shall i not rush to battle  but i cannot lift the arms of my fathers  o had mine arm the strength of cuchullin soon would cairbar fly the fame of my fathers would be renewed and the actions of other times  he took his bow of yew tears flow from his sparkling eyes  grief saddens around the bards bend forward from their harps the blast touches their strings and the sound of woe ascends  a voice is heard at a distance as of one in grief it was carril of other times who came from the dark slimora slimora a hill in connaught near which cuchullin was killed   he told of the death of cuchullin and of his mighty deeds the people were scattered around his tomb their arms lay on the ground they had forgot the battle for the sound of his shield had ceased  but who said the softvoiced carril come like the bounding roes their stature is like the young trees of the plain growing in a shower  soft and ruddy are their cheeks but fearless souls look forth from their eyes  who but the sons of usnoth the carborne chiefs of etha the people rise on every side like the strength of an halfextinguished fire when the winds come suddenly from the desert on their rustling wings  the sound of caithbats shield was heard the heroes saw cuchullin that is they saw a manifest likeness between the person of nathos and cuchullin  in the form of lovely nathos so rolled his sparkling eyes and such was his steps on his heath  battles are fought at lego the sword of nathos prevails soon shall thou behold him in thy halls king of woody temora   and soon may i behold him o carril replied the returning joy of cormac but my soul is sad for cuchullin his voice was pleasant in mine ear  often have we moved on dora at the chase of the darkbrown hinds his bow was unerring on the mountains  he spoke of mighty men he told of the deeds of my fathers and i felt the joy of my breast  but sit thou at the feast o carril i have often heard thy voice sing in the praise of cuchullin and of that mighty stranger  day rose on temora with all the beams of the east trathin came to the hall the son of old gellama geallamha whitehanded   i behold he said a dark cloud in the desert king of innisfail a cloud it seemed at first but now a crowd of men one strides before them in his strength and his red hair flies in the wind his shield glitters to the beam of the east his spear is in his hand  call him to the feast of temora replied the king of erin my hall is the house of strangers son of the generous gellama  perhaps it is the chief of etha coming in the sound of his renown  hail mighty stranger art thou of the friends of cormac  but carril he is dark and unlovely and he draws his sword is that the son of usnoth bard of the times of old  it is not the son of usnoth said carril but the chief of atha  why come thou in thy arms to temora cairbar of the gloomy brow let not thy sword rise against cormac whither do thou turn thy speed  he passed on in his darkness and seized the hand of the king cormac foresaw his death and the rage of his eyes arose  retire thou gloomy chief of atha nathos comes with battle  thou art bold in cormacs hall for his arm is weak  the sword entered cormacs side he fell in the halls of his fathers his fair hair is in the dust his blood is smoking round  and art thou fallen in thy halls i said althan speaks  o son of noble artho the shield of cuchullin was not near nor the spear of thy father mournful are the mountains of erin for the chief of the people is low  blessed be thy soul o cormac thou art snatched from the midst of thy course  my words came to the ears of cairbar and he closed us that is himself and carril as it afterward appears in the midst of darkness he feared to stretch his sword to the bards the persons of the bards were so sacred that even he who had just murdered his sovereign feared to kill them  though his soul was dark three days we pined alone on the fourth the noble cathmor came  he heard our voice from the cave he turned the eye of his wrath on cairbar  chief of atha he said how long will thou pain my soul thy heart is like the rock of the desert and thy thoughts are dark  but thou art the brother of cathmor and he will fight thy battles  but cathmors soul is not like thine thou feeble hand of war the light of my bosom is stained with thy deeds the bards will not sing of my renown they may say cathmor was brave but he fought for gloomy cairbar they will pass over my tomb in silence and my fame shall not be heard  cairbar loose the bards they are the sons of other times their voice shall be heard in other ages when the kings of temora have failed   we came forth at the words of the chief we saw him in his strength he was like thy youth o fingal when thou first did list the spear  his face was like the plain of the sun when it is bright no darkness traveled over his brow but he came with his thousands to ullin to aid the redhaired cairbar and now he comes to revenge his death o king of woody morven   and let him come replied the king i love a foe like cathmor his soul is great his arm is strong and his battles are full of fame  but the little soul is like a vapor that hovers round the marshy lake it never rises on the green hill lest the winds meet it there its dwelling is in the cave and it sends forth the dart of death  usnoth thou have heard the fame of ethas carborne chiefs  our young heroes o warrior are like the renown of our fathers  they fight in youth and they fall their names are in the song  but we are old o usnoth let us not fall like aged oaks which the blast overturns in secret the hunter came past and saw them lying gray across a stream how have these fallen he said and whistling passed along  raise the song of joy ye bards of morven that our souls may forget the past  the red stars look on us from the clouds and silently descend soon shall the gray beam of the morning rise and show us the foes of cormac  fillan take the spear of the king go to moras darkbrown side let thine eyes travel over the heath like flames of fire observe the foes of fingal and the course of generous cathmor i hear a distant sound like the falling of rocks in the desert  but strike thou thy shield at times that they may not come through night and the same of morven cease  i begin to be alone my son and i dread the fall of my renown  the voice of the bards arose the king leaned on the shield of trenmor  sleep descended on his eyes and his future battles rose in his dreams the host are sleeping around darkhaired fillan observed the foe his steps are on a distant hill we hear at times his clanging shield  one of the fragments of ancient poetry lately published gives a different account of the death of oscar the son of ossian the translator though he well knew the more probable tradition concerning that hero was unwilling to reject a poem which if not really of ossians composition has much of his manner and concise turn of expression a more correct copy of that fragment which has since come to the translators hands has enabled him to correct the mistake into which a similarity of names had led those who handed down the poem by tradition  the heroes of the piece are oscar the son of caruth and dermid the son of diaran ossian or perhaps his imitator opens the poem with a lamentation for oscar and afterward by an easy transition relates the story of oscar the son of caruth who seems to have bore the same character as well as name with oscar the son of ossian though the translator thinks he has good reason to reject the fragment as the composition of ossian yet as it is after all still somewhat doubtful whether it is or not he has here subjoined it  why openest thou afresh the spring of my grief o son of alpin inquiring how oscar fell my eyes are blind with tears but memory beams on my heart how can i relate the mournful death of the head of the people chief of the warriors oscar my son shall i see thee no more  he fell as the moon in a storm as the sun from the midst of his course when clouds rise from the waste of the waves when the blackness of the storm inwraps the rocks of ardannider i like an ancient oak on morven i moulder alone in my place the blast has lopped my branches away and i tremble at the wings of the north chief of the warriors oscar my son shall i see thee no more  but son of alpin the hero fell not harmless as the grass of the field the blood of the mighty was on his sword and he traveled with death through the ranks of their pride but oscar thou son of caruth thou have fallen low no enemy fell by thy hand thy spear was stained with the blood of thy friend  dermid and oscar were one they reaped the battle together their friendship was strong as their steel and death walked between them to the field they came on the foe like two rocks falling from the brows of ardven their swords were stained with the blood of the valiant warriors fainted at their names who was equal to oscar but dermid and who to dermid but oscar  they killed mighty dargo in the field dargo who never sled in war his daughter was fair as the morn mild as the beam of night her eyes like two stars in a shower her breath the gale of spring her breasts as the newfallen snow floating on the moving heath the warriors saw her and loved their souls were fixed on the maid each loved her as his fame each must possess her or die but her soul was fixed on oscar the son of caruth was the youth of her love she forgot the blood of her father and loved the hand that slew him  son of caruth said dermid i love o oscar i love this maid but her soul cleaves unto thee and nothing can heal dermid here pierce this bosom oscar relieve me my friend with thy sword  my sword son of diaran shall never be stained with the blood of dermid  who then is worthy to slay me o oscar son of caruth let not my life pass away unknown let none but oscar slay me send me with honor to the grave and let my death be renowned  dermid make use of thy sword son of diaran wield thy steel would that i fell with thee that my death came from the hand of dermid  they fought by the brook of the mountain by the streams of branno blood tinged the running water and curdled round the mossy stones the stately dermid fell he fell and smiled in death  and fallest thou son of diaran fallest thou by oscars hand dermid who never yielded in war thus do i see thee fall  he went and returned to the maid of his love he returned but she perceived his grief  why that gloom son of caruth what shades thy mighty soul  though once renowned for the bow o maid i have lost my same fixed on a tree by the brook of the hill is the shield of the valiant gormur whom i slew in battle i have wasted the day in vain nor could my arrow pierce it  let me try son of caruth the skill of dargos daughter my hands were taught the bow my father delighted in my skill  she went he stood behind the shield her arrow flew and pierced his breast  blessed be that hand of snow and blessed that bow of yew who but the daughter of dargo was worthy to slay the son of caruth lay me in the earth my fair one lay me by the side of dermid  oscar the maid replied i have the soul of the mighty dargo well pleased i can meet death my sorrow i can end  she pierced her white bosom with the steel she fell she trembled and died  by the brook of the hill their graves are laid a birchs unequal shade covers their tomb often on their green earthen tombs the branchy sons of the mountain feed when midday is all in flames and silence over all the hills  carricthura a poem fingal returning from an expedition which he had made into the roman province resolved to visit cathulla king of inistore and brother to comala whose story is related at large in the dramatic poem published in this collection upon his coming in sight of carricthura the palace of cathulla he observed a flame on its top which in those days was a signal of distress the wind drove him into a bay at some distance from carricthura and he was obliged to pass the night on the shore next day he attacked the army of frothal king of sora who had besieged cathulla in his palace of carricthura and took frothal himself prisoner after he had engaged him in a single combat the deliverance of carricthura is the subject of the poem but several other episodes are interwoven with it it appears from tradition that this poem was addressed to a culdee or one of the first christian missionaries and that the story of the spirit of loda supposed to be the ancient odin of scandinavia was introduced by ossian in opposition to the culdees doctrine be this as it will it lets us into ossians notions of a superior being and shows that he was not addicted to the superstition which prevailed all the world over before the introduction of christianity  have the song of ullin with which the poem opens is in a lyric measure it was usual with fingal when he returned from his expeditions to send his bards singing before him this species of triumph is called by ossian the song of victory thou left thy blue course in heaven goldenhaired son of the sky the west has opened its gates the bed of thy repose is there the waves come to behold thy beauty they lift their trembling heads they see thee lovely in thy sleep but they shrink away with fear rest in thy shadowy cave o sun and let thy return be in joy  but let a thousand lights arise to the sound of the harps of selma let the beam spread in the hall the king of shells is returned the strife of crona ossian has celebrated the strise of crona in a particular poem this poem is connected with it but it was impossible for the translator to procure that part which relates to crona with any degree of purity is past like sounds that are no more raise the song o bards the king is returned with his fame  such was the song of ullin when fingal returned from battle when he returned in the fair blushing of youth with all his heavy locks his blue arms were on the hero like a gray cloud on the sun when he moves in his robes of mist and shows but half his beams his heroes follow the king the feast of shells is spread fingal turns to his bards and bids the song to rise  voices of ecchoing cona he said o bards of other times ye on whose souls the blue hosts of our fathers rise strike the harp in my hall and let fingal hear the song pleasant is the joy of grief it is like the shower of spring when it softens the branch of the oak and the young leaf lifts its green head sing on o bards tomorrow we lift the sail my blue course is through the ocean to carricthuras walls the mossy walls of sarno where comala dwelt there the noble cathulla spreads the feast of shells the boars of his woods are many and the sound of the chase shall arise  cronnan one should think that the parts of shilric and vinvela were represented by cronnan and minona whose very names denote that they were singers who performed in public cronnan signifies a mournful sound minona or minonn soft air all the dramatic poems of ossian appear to have been presented before fingal upon solemn occasions  son of the song said ullin minona graceful at the harp raise the song of shilric to please the king of morven let vinvela come in her beauty like the showery bow when it shows its lovely head on the lake and the setting sun is bright and she comes o fingal her voice is soft but sad  vinvela my love is a son of the hill he pursues the flying deer his gray dogs are panting around him his bowstring sounds in the wind do thou rest by the sount of the rock or by the noise of the mountainstream the rushes are nodding with the wind the mist is flying over the hill i will approach my love unperceived and see him from the rock lovely i saw thee first by the aged oak of branno bran or branno signifies a mountainstream it is here some river known by that name in the days of ossian there are several small rivers in the north of scotland still retaining the name of bran in particular one which falls into the tay at dunkeld  thou were returning tall from the chase the fairest among thy friends   shilric what voice is that i hear that voice like the summerwind  i sit not by the nodding rushes i hear not the fount of the rock afar vinvela bhinbheul a woman with a melodious voice bh in the galic language has the same sound with the v in english  afar i go to the wars of fingal my dogs attend me no more no more i tread the hill no more from on high i see thee fairmoving by the stream of the plain bright as the bow of heaven as the moon on the western wave   vinvela then thou art gone o shilric and i am alone on the hill the deer are seen on the brow void of fear they graze along no more they dread the wind no more the rustling trce the hunter is far removed he is in the field of graves strangers sons of the waves spare my lovely shilric   shilric if fall i must in the field raise high my grave vinvela gray stones and heapedup earth shall mark me to future times when the hunter shall sit by the mound and produce his food at noon some warrior rests here he will say and my fame shall live in his praise remember me vinvela when low on earth i lie   vinvela yes  i will remember thee  indeed my shilric will fall what shall i do my love when thou art gone for ever through these hills i will go at noon i will go through the silent heath there i will see the place of thy rest returning from the chase indeed my shilric will fall but i will remember him  and i remember the chief said the king of woody morven he consumed the battle in his rage but now my eyes behold him not i met him one day on the hill his cheek was pale his brow was dark the sigh was frequent in his breast his steps were toward the desert but now he is not in the crowd of my chiefs when the sounds of my shields arise dwells he in the narrow house the grave  the chief of high carmora carnmor high rocky hill    cronnan said ullin of other times raise the song of shilric when he returned to his hills and vinvela was no more he leaned on her gray mossy stone he thought vinvela lived he saw her fairmoving the distinction which the ancient scots made between good and bad spirits was that the former appeared sometimes in the daytime in lonely unfrequented places but the latter never but by night and in a dismal gloomy scene on the plain but the bright form lasted not the sunbeam fled from the field and she was seen no more hear the song of shilric it is soft but sad  i sit by the mossy fountain on the top of the hill of winds one tree is rustling above me dark waves roll over the heath the lake is troubled below the deer descend from the hill no hunter at a distance is seen no whistling cowherd is nigh it is midday but all is silent sad are my thoughts alone did thou but appear o my love a wanderer on the heath thy hair floating on the wind behind thee thy bosom heaving on the sight thine eyes full of tears for thy friends whom the mist of the hill had concealed thee i would comfort my love and bring thee to thy fathers house  but is it she that there appears like a beam of light on the heath bright as the moon in autumn as the sun in a summerstorm come thou lovely maid over rocks over mountains to me  she speaks but how weak her voice like the breeze in the reeds of the pool  returnest thou safe from the war where are thy friends my love i heard of thy death on the hill i heard and mourned thee shilric  yes my fair i return but i alone of my race thou shall see them no more their graves i raised on the plain but why art thou on the desert hill why on the heath alone  alone i am o shilric alone in the winterhouse with grief for thee i expired shilric i am pale in the tomb  she fleets she sails away as gray mist before the wind  and will thou not stay my love stay and behold my tears fair thou appearest vinvela fair thou wast when alive  by the mossy fountain i will sit on the top of the hill of winds when midday is silent around converse o my love with me come on the wings of the gale on the blast of the mountain come let me hear thy voice as thou passest when midday is silent around  such was the song of cronnan on the night of selmas joy but morning rose in the east the blue waters rolled in light fingal bade his sails to rise and the winds come rustling from their hills inistore rose to sight and carricthuras mossy towers but the sign of distress was on their top the green flame edged with smoke the king of morven struck his breast he assumed at once his spear his darkened brow bends forward to the coast he looks back to the lagging winds his hair is disordered on his back the silence of the king is terrible  night came down on the sea rothas bay received the ship a rock bends along the coast with all its ecchoing wood on the top is the circle the circle of loda is supposed to be a place of worship among the scandinavians as the spirit of loda is thought to be the same with their god odin of loda and the mossy stone of power a narrow plain spreads beneath covered with grass and aged trees which the midnight winds in their wrath had torn from the shaggy rock the blue course of a stream is there and the lonely blast of ocean pursues the thistles beard  the flame of three oaks arose the feast is spread around but the soul of the king is sad for carricthuras battling chief the wan cold moon rose in the east sleep descended on the youths their blue helmets glitter to the beam the fading fire decays but sleep did not rest on the king he rose in the midst of his arms and slowly ascended the hill to behold the flame of sarnos tower  the flame was dim and distant the moon hid her red face in the east a blast came from the mountain and bore on its wings the spirit of loda he came to his place in his terrors he is described in a simile in the poem concerning the death of cuchullin  and he shook his dusky spear  his eyes appear like flames in his dark face and his voice is like distant thunder fingal advanced with the spear of his strength and raised his voice on high  son of night retire call thy winds and fly why do thou come to my presence with thy shadowy arms do i fear thy gloomy form dismal spirit of loda weak is thy shield of clouds feeble is that meteor thy sword the blast rolls them together and thou thyself do vanish fly from my presence son of night call thy winds and fly  do thou force me from my place replied the hollow voice the people bend before me i turn the battle in the field of the valiant i look on the nations and they vanish my nostrils pour the blast of death i come there is a great resemblance between the terrors of this mock divinity and those of the true god as they are described in the   th psalm abroad on the winds the tempests are before my face but my dwelling is calm above the clouds the fields of my rest are pleasant  dwell then in thy calm fields said fingal and let comhals son be forgot do my steps ascend from my hills into thy peaceful plains do i meet thee with a spear on thy cloud spirit of dismal loda why then do thou frown on fingal or shake thine airy spear but thou frownest in vain i never fled from mighty men and shall the sons of the wind frighten the king of morven no he knows the weakness of their arms  fly to thy land replied the form receive the wind and fly the blasts are in the hollow of my hand the course of the storm is mine the king of sora is my son he bends at the stone of my power his battle is around carricthura and he will prevail fly to thy land son of comhal or feel my flaming wrath  he lifted high his shadowy spear and bent forward his terrible height but the king advancing drew his sword the blade of darkbrown luno the famous sword of fingal made by lun or luno a smith of lochlin  the gleaming path of the steel winds through the gloomy ghost the form fell shapeless into air like a column of smoke which the staff of the boy disturbs as it rises from the halfextinguished furnace  the spirit of loda shrieked as rolled into himself he rose on the wind inistore shook at the sound the waves heard it on the deep they stopped in their course with fear the companions of fingal started at once and took their heavy spears they missed the king they rose with rage all their arms resound  the moon came forth in the east the king returned in the gleam of his arms the joy of his youths was great their souls settled as a sea from a storm ullin raised the song of gladness the hills of inistore rejoiced the flame of the oak arose and the tales of heroes are told  but frothal soras battling king sits in sadness beneath a tree the host spreads around carricthura he looks toward the walls with rage he longs for the blood of cathulla who once overcame the king in war  when annir reigned annir was also the father of erragon who was king after the death of his brother frothal the death of erragon is the subject of the battle of lora a poem in this collection in sora the father of carborne frothal a blast rose on the sea and carried frothal to inistore three days he feasted in sarnos halls and saw the slow rolling eyes of comala he loved her in the rage of youth and rushed to seize the whitearmed maid cathulla met the chief the gloomy battle rose frothal is bound in the hall three days he pined alone on the fourth sarno sent him to his ship and he returned to his land but wrath darkened in his soul against the noble cathulla when annirs stone that is after the death of annir to erect the stone of ones fame was in other words to say that the person was dead of fame arose frothal came in his strength the battle burned round carricthura and sarnos mossy walls  morning rose on inistore frothal struck his darkbrown shield his chiefs started at the sound they stood but their eyes were turned to the sea they saw fingal coming in his strength and first the noble thubar spoke  who comes like the stag of the mountain with all his herd behind him frothal it is a foe i see his forward spear perhaps it is the king of morven fingal the first of men his actions are well known on gormal the blood of his foes is in starnos halls shall i ask the peace honorable terms of peace of kings he is like the thunder of heaven  son of the feeble hand said frothal shall my days begin in darkness shall i yield before i have conquered in battle chief of streamy tora the people would say in sora frothal flew forth like a meteor but the dark cloud met it and it is no more no thubar i will never yield my fame shall surround me like light no i will never yield king of streamy tora  he went forth with the stream of his people but they met a rock fingal stood unmoved broken they rolled back from his side nor did they roll in safety the spear of the king pursued their flight the field is covered with heroes a rising hill preserved the flying host  frothal saw their flight the rage of his bosom rose he bent his eyes to the ground and called the noble thubar  thubar my people fled my fame has ceased to rise i will fight the king i feel my burning soul send a bard to demand the combat speak not against frothals words  but thubar i love a maid she dwells by thanos stream the whitebosomed daughter of herman utha with the softlyrolling eyes she feared the daughter by the daughter of inistore frothal means comala of whose death utha probably had not heard consequently she feared that the former passion of frothal for comala might return of inistore and her soft sighs rose at my departure tell to utha that i am low but that my soul delighted in her  such were his words resolved to fight but the soft sigh of utha was near she had followed her hero over the sea in the armor of a man she rolled her eye on the youth in secret from beneath a glittering helmet but now she saw the bard as he went and the spear fell thrice from her hand her loose hair flew on the wind her white breast rose with sighs she lifted up her eyes to the king she would speak but thrice she failed  fingal heard the words of the bard he came in the strength of steel they mixed their deathful spears and raised the gleam of their swords but the steel of fingal descended and cut frothals shield in twain his fair side is exposed half bent he foresees his death  darkness gathered on uthas soul the tear rolled down her cheek she rushed to cover the chief with her shield but a fallen oak met her steps she fell on her arm of snow her shield her helmet flew wide her white bosom heaved to the sight her darkbrown hair is spread on earth  fingal pitied the whitearmed maid he stayed the uplifted sword the tear was in the eye of the king as bending forward he spoke king of streamy sora fear not the sword of fingal it was never stained with the blood of the vanquished it never pierced a fallen foe let thy people rejoice along the blue waters of tora let the maids of thy love be glad why should thou fall in thy youth king of streamy sora  frothal heard the words of fingal and saw the rising maid they frothal and utha stood in silence in their beauty like two young trees of the plain when the shower of spring is on their leaves and the loud winds are laid  daughter of herman said frothal did thou come from toras streams did thou come in thy beauty to behold thy warrior low but he was low before the mighty maid of the slowrolling eye the feeble did not overcome the son of carborne annir terrible art thou o king of morven in battles of the spear but in peace thou art like the sun when he looks through a silent shower the flowers lift their fair heads before him and the gales shake their rustling wings o that thou were in sora that my feast were spread  the future kings of sora would see thy arms and rejoice they would rejoice at the fame of their fathers who beheld the mighty fingal  son of annir replied the king the fame of soras race shall be heard  when chiefs are strong in battle then does the song arise but if their swords are stretched over the feeble if the blood of the weak has stained their arms the bard shall forget them in the song and their tombs shall not be known the stranger shall come and build there and remove the heapedup earth an halfworn sword shall rise before him and bending above it he will say these are the arms of chiefs of old but their names are not in the song  come thou o frothal to the feast of inistore let the maid of thy love be there and our faces will brighten with joy  fingal took his spear moving in the steps of his might the gates of carricthura are opened the feast of shells is spread  the voice of music arose gladness brightened in the hall  the voice of ullin was heard the harp of selma was strung  utha rejoiced in his presence and demanded the song of grief the big tear hung in her eye when the soft there is a propriety in introducing this episode as the situations of crimora and utha were so similar crimora spoke crimora the daughter of rinval who dwelt at lothas lotha was the ancient name of one of the great rivers in the north of scotland the only one of them that still retains a name of a like sound is lochy in invernessshire but whether it is the river mentioned here the translator will not pretend to say mighty stream the tale was long but lovely and pleased the blushing maid of tora  crimora crimora a woman of a great soul   who comes from the hill like a cloud tinged with the beam of the west whose voice is that loud as the wind but pleasant as the harp of carril perhaps the carril mentioned here is the same with carril the son of kinfena cuchullins bard the name itself is proper to any bard as it signifies a sprightly and harmonious sound  it is my love in the light of steel but sad is his darkened brow live the mighty race of fingal or what disturbs my connal connal the son of diaran was one of the most famous heroes of fingal he was slain in a battle against dargo a briton but whether by the hand of the enemy or that of his mistress tradition does not determine    connal they live i saw them return from the chase like a stream of light the sun was on their shields like a ridge of fire they descended the hill loud is the voice of the youth the war my love is near tomorrow the terrible dargo comes to try the force of our race the race of fingal he defies the race of battle and wounds   crimora connal i saw his sails like gray mist on the sable wave they slowly came to land connal many are the warriors of dargo   connal bring me thy fathers shield the bossy iron shield of rinval that shield like the full moon when it moves darkened through heaven   crimora that shield i bring o connal but it did not defend my father by the spear of gormar he fell thou may fall o connal   connal fall indeed i may but raise my tomb crimora gray stones a mound of earth shall keep my memory bend thy red eye over my tomb and beat thy mournful heaving breast though fair thou art my love as the light more pleasant than the gale of the hill yet i will not stay raise my tomb crimora   crimora then give me those arms of light that sword and that spear of steel i shall meet dargo with thee and aid my lovely connal farewell ye rocks of ardven ye deer and ye streams of the hill  we shall return no more our tombs are distant far   and did they return no more said uthas bursting sigh fell the mighty in battle and did crimora live  her steps were lonely and her soul was sad for connal was he not young and lovely like the beam of the setting sun ullin saw the virgins tear and took the softlytrembling harp the song was lovely but sad and silence was in carricthura  autumn is dark on the mountains gray mist rests on the hills the whirlwind is heard on the heath dark rolls the river through the narrow plain a tree stands alone on the hill and marks the slumbering connal the leaves whirl round with the wind and strew the grave of the dead at times are seen here the ghosts of the deceased when the musing hunter alone stalks slowly over the heath  who can reach the source of thy race o connal and who recount thy fathers thy family grew like an oak on the mountain which meets the wind with its lofty head but now it is torn from the earth who shall supply the place of connal  here was the din of arms and here the groans of the dying bloody are the wars of fingal o connal it was here thou did fall thine arm was like a storm thy sword a beam of the sky thy height a rock on the plain thine eyes a furnace of fire louder than a storm was thy voice in the battles of thy steel warriors fell by thy sword as the thistle by the staff of a boy  dargo the mighty came on like a cloud of thunder his brows were contracted and dark his eyes like two caves in a rock bright rose their swords on each side dire was the clang of their steel  the daughter of rinval was near crimora bright in the armor of man her yellow hair is loose behind her bow is in her hand she followed the youth to the war connal her muchbeloved she drew the string on dargo but erring pierced her connal he falls like an oak on the plain like a rock from the shaggy hill what shall she do hapless maid  he bleeds her connal dies all the night long she cries and all the day o connal my love and my friend with grief the sad mourner dies  earth here incloses the loveliest pair on the hill the grass grows between the stones of the tomb i often sit in the mournful shade the wind sighs through the grass their memory rushes on my mind undisturbed you now sleep together in the tomb of the mountain you rest alone  and soft be your rest said utha children of streamy lotha i will remember you with tears and my secret song shall rise when the wind is in the groves of tora and the stream is roaring near then shall ye come on my soul with all your lovely grief  three days feasted the kings on the fourth their white sails arose the winds of the north carry the ship of fingal to morvens woody land  but the spirit of loda sat in his cloud behind the ships of frothal he hung forward with all his blasts and spread the whitebosomed sails  the wounds of his form were not forgot he still feared the story of fingal and the spirit of loda supposed to be the famous odin is the most extravagant fiction in all ossians poems it is not however without precedents in the best poets and it must be said for ossian that he says nothing but what perfectly agreed with the notions of the times concerning ghosts they thought the souls of the dead were material and consequently susceptible of pain whether a proof could be drawn from this passage that ossian had no notion of a divinity i shall leave to others to determine it appears however that he was of opinion that superior beings ought to take no notice of what passed among men the hand of the king  the songs of selma this poem fixes the antiquity of a custom which is well known to have prevailed afterward in the north of scotland and in ireland the bards at an annual feast provided by the king or chief repeated their poems and such of them as were thought by him worthy of being preserved were carefully taught to their children in order to have them transmitted to posterity  it was one of those occasions that afforded the subject of the present poem to ossian  it is called in the original the songs of selma which title it was thought proper to adopt in the translation  the poem is entirely lyric and has great variety of versification the address to the evening star with which it opens has in the original all the harmony that numbers could give it flowing down with all that tranquillity and softness which the scene described naturally inspires  three of the songs which are introduced in this piece were published among the fragments of ancient poetry printed last year    star of the falling night fair is thy light in the west thou liftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud thy steps are stately on thy hill what do thou behold in the plain the stormy winds are laid the murmur of the torrent comes from afar roaring waves climb the distant rock the flies of evening are on their feeble wings and the hum of their course is on the field what do thou behold fair light but thou do smile and depart the waves come with joy around thee and bathe thy lovely hair farewell thou silent beam  let the light of ossians soul arise  and it does arise in its strength i behold my departed friends their gathering is on lora as in the days that are past  fingal comes like a watery column of mist his heroes are around and see the bards of the song grayhaired ullin stately ryno alpin alpin is from the same root with albion or rather albin the ancient name of britain alp high inland or country the present name of our island has its origin in the celtic tongue so that those who derived it from any other betrayed their ignorance of the ancient language of our country  breact in variegated island so called from the face of the country from the natives painting themselves or from their partycolored clothes  with the tuneful voice and the soft complaint of minona  how are ye changed my friends since the days of selmas feast when we contended like the gales of the spring that flying over the hill by turns bend the feeblywhistling grafs  minona ossian introduces minona not in the ideal scene in his own mind which he had described but at the annual feast of selma where the bards repeated their works before fingal came sorth in her beauty with downcast look and tearful eye her hair flew slowly on the blast that rushed unfrequent from the hill  the souls of the heroes were sad when she raised the tuneful voice for often had they seen the grave of salgar sealger a hunter  and the dark dwelling of whitebosomed colma culmath a woman with fine hair  colma left alone on the hill with all her voice of music salgar promised to come but the night descended round  hear the voice of colma when she sat alone on the hill  colma it is night  i am alone forlorn on the hill of storms the wind is heard in the mountain the torrent shrieks down the rock no hut receives me from the rain forlorn on the hill of winds  rise moon from behind thy clouds stars of the night appear lead me some light to the place where my love rests from the toil of the chase his bow near him unstrung his dogs panting around him but here i must sit alone by the rock of the mossy stream the stream and the wind roar nor can i hear the voice of my love  why delays my salgar why the son of the hill his promise here is the rock and the tree and here the roaring stream thou did promise with night to be here ah whither is my salgar gone with thee i would fly my father with thee my brother of pride our race have long been soes but we are not foes o salgar  cease a little while o wind stream be thou silent a while let my voice be heard over the heath let my wanderer hear me salgar it is i who call here is the tree and the rock salgar my love i am here why delayest thou thy coming  lo the moon appears the flood is bright in the vale the rocks are gray on the face of the hill but i see him not on the brow his dogs before him tell not that he is coming here i must sit alone  but who are these that lie beyond me on the heath are they my love and my brother  speak to me o my friends they answer not my soul is tormented with fears  ah they are dead their swords are red from the fight o my brother my brother why have thou slain my salgar why o salgar have thou slain my brother dear were ye both to me what shall i say in your praise thou were fair on the hill among thousands he was terrible in fight speak to me hear my voice sons of mylove but alas they are silent silent for ever cold are their breasts of clay  oh from the rock of the hill from the top of the windy mountain speak ye ghosts of the dead speak i will not be afraid  whither are ye gone to rest in what cave of the hill shall i find you no feeble voice is on the wind no answer halfdrowned in the storms of the hill  i sit in my grief i wait for morning in my tears rear the tomb ye friends of the dead but close it not till colma come my life flies away like a dream why should i stay behind here shall i rest with my friends by the stream of the sounding rock when night comes on the hill when the wind is on the heath my ghost shall stand in the wind and mourn the death of my friends the hunter shall hear from his booth he shall fear but love my voice for sweet shall my voice be for my friends for pleasant were they both to me   such was thy song minona softlyblushing maid of torman our tears descended for colma and our souls were sad  ullin came with the harp and gave the song of alpin  the voice of alpin was pleasant the soul of ryno was a beam of fire but they had rested in the narrow house and their voice was not heard in selma  ullin had returned one day from the chase before the heroes fell he heard their strife on the hill their song was soft but sad they mourned the fall of morar first of mortal men his soul was like the soul of fingal his sword like the sword of oscar  but he fell and his father mourned his sisters eyes were full of tears  minonas eyes were full of tears the sister of carborne morar she retired from the song of ullin like the moon in the west when she foresees the shower and hides her fair head in a cloud  i touched the harp with ullin the song of mourning rose  ryno the wind and the rain are over calm is the noon of day the clouds are divided in heaven over the green hills flies the inconstant sun red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill sweet are thy murmurs o stream but more sweet is the voice i hear it is the voice of alpin the son of the song mourning for the dead bent is his head of age and red his tearful eye alpin thou son of the song why alone on the silent hill why complainest thou as a blast in the wood as a wave on the lonely shore   alpin my tears o ryno are for the dead my voice for the inhabitants of the grave tall thou art on the hill fair among the sons of the plain but thou shall fall like morar morer great man  and the mourner shall sit on thy tomb the hills shall know thee no more thy bow shall lie in the hall unstrung   thou were swift o morar as a roe on the hill terrible as a meteor of fire thy wrath was as the storm thy sword in battle as lightning in the field thy voice was like a stream after rain like thunder on distant hills many fell by thy arm they were consumed in the flames of thy wrath  but when thou did return from war how peaceful was thy brow thy face was like the sun after rain like the moon in the silence of night calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid  narrow is thy dwelling now dark the place of thine abode with three steps i compass thy grave o thou who wast so great before four stones with their heads of moss are the only memorial of thee a tree with scarce a leaf long grass which whistles in the wind mark to the hunters eye the grave of the mighty morar morar thou art low indeed thou have no mother to mourn thee no maid with her tears of love dead is she that brought thee forth fallen is the daughter of morglan  who on his staff is this who is this whose head is white with age whose eyes are red with tears who quakes at every step  it is thy father torman the son of carthul lord of imora one of the western isles  o morar the father of no son but thee he heard of thy fame in battle he heard of foes dispersed he heard of morars fame why did he not hear of his wound weep thou father of morar weep but thy son hears thee not deep is the sleep of the dead low their pillow of dust no more shall he hear thy voice no more shall he awake at thy call when shall it be morn in the grave to bid the slumberer awake  farewell thou bravest of men thou conqueror in the field but the field shall see thee no more nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel thou have left no son but the song shall preserve thy name future times shall hear of thee they shall hear of the fallen morar  the grief of all arose but most the bursting sigh of armin armin a hero he was chief or petty king of gorma i e the blue island supposed to be one of the hebrides  he remembers the death of his son who fell in the days of his youth carmor cearmor a tall darkcomplexioned man was near the hero the chief of the ecchoing galmal why bursts the sigh of armin he said is there a cause to mourn the song comes with its music to melt and please the soul it is like soft mist that rising from a lake pours on the silent vale the green flowers are filled with dew but the sun returns in his strength and the mist is gone why art thou sad o armin chief of seasurrounded gorma  sad i am indeed nor small my cause of woe  carmor thou have lost no son thou have lost no daughter of beauty colgar the valiant lives and annira fairest maid the boughs of thy family flourish o carmor but armin is the last of his race dark is thy bed o daura and deep thy sleep in the tomb  when shall thou awake with thy songs with all thy voice of music  rise winds of autumn rise blow upon the dark heath streams of the mountains roar howl ye tempests in the top of the oak walk through broken clouds o moon show by intervals thy pale face bring to my mind that sad night when all my children fell when arindal the mighty fell when dura the lovely failed  daura my daughter thou were fair fair as the moon on the hills of fura fuara cold island  white as the driven snow sweet as the breathing gale arindal thy bow was strong thy spear was swift in the field thy look was like mist on the wave thy shield a red cloud in a storm armar renowned in war came and sought dauras love he was not long denied fair was the hope of their friends  erath son of odgal repined for his brother was slain by armar he came disguised like a son of the sea fair was his skiff on the wave white his locks of age calm his serious brow fairest of women he said lovely daughter of armin a rock not distant in the sea bears a tree on its side red shines the fruit afar there armor waits for daura i came to carry his love along the rolling sea  she went and she called on armar naught answered but the son by the son of the rock the poet means the ecchoing back of the human voice from a rock the vulgar were of opinion that this repetition of found was made by a spirit within the rock and they on that account called it mactalla the son who dwells in the rock of the rock armor my love my love why tormentest thou me with fear hear son of ardnart hear it is daura who calls thee erath the traitor fled laughing to the land she lifted up her voice and cried for her brother and her father arindal armin none to relieve your daura  her voice came over the sea arindal my son descended from the hill rough in the spoils of the chase his arrows rattled by his side his bow was in his hand five dark gray dogs attended his steps he saw fierce erath on the shore he seized and bound him to an oak thick fly the thongs the poet here only means that erath was bound with leathern thongs of the hide around his limbs he loads the wind with his groans  arindal ascends the deep in his boat to bring daura to land armar came in his wrath and let fly the grayfeathered shaft it sung it sunk in thy heart o arindal my son for erath the traitor thou diedst the oar is stopped at once he panted on the rock and expired what is thy grief o daura when round thy feet is poured thy brothers blood  the boat is broken in twain by the waves armar plunges into the sea to rescue his daura or die sudden a blast from the hill comes over the waves he sunk and he rose no more  alone on the seabeat rock my daughter was heard to complain frequent and loud were her cries nor could her father relieve her all night i stood on the shore i saw her by the faint beam of the moon all night i heard her cries loud was the wind and the rain beat hard on the side of the mountain before morning appeared her voice was weak it died away like the eveningbreeze among the grass of the rocks spent with grief she expired and left thee armin alone gone is my strength in the war and fallen my pride among women  when the storms of the mountain come when the north lifts the waves on high i sit by the sounding shore and look on the fatal rock often by the setting moon i see the ghosts of my children halfviewless they walk in mournful conference together will none of you speak in pity they do not regard their father i am sad o carmor nor small my cause of woe  such were the words of the bards in the days of the song when the king heard the music of harps and the tales of other times the chiefs gathered from all their hills and heard the lovely sound they praised the voice ossian is sometimes poetically called the voice of cona of cona the first among a thousand bards but age is now on my tongue and my soul has failed i hear sometimes the ghosts of bards and learn their pleasant song but memory fails on my mind i hear the call of years they say as they pass along why does ossian sing soon shall he lie in the narrow house and no bard shall raise his fame  roll on ye darkbrown years for ye bring no joy on your course let the tomb open to ossian for his strength has failed the sons of the song are gone to rest my voice remains like a blast that roars lonely on a seasurrounded rock after the winds are laid the dark moss whistles there and the distant mariner sees the waving trees  calthon and colmal a poem this piece as many more of ossians compositions is addressed to one of the first christian missionaries  the story of the poem is handed down by tradition thus  in the country of the britons between the walls two chiefs lived in the days of fingal dunthalmo lord of teutha supposed to be the tweed and rathmor who dwelt at clutha well known to be the river clyde  rathmor was not more renowned for his generosity and hospitality than dunthalmo was infamous for his cruelty and ambition  dunthalmo through envy or on account of some private seuds which subsisted between the families murdered cathmor at a seast but being afterward touched with remorse he educated the two sons of rathmor calthon and colmar in his own house  they growing up to mans estate dropped some hints that they intended to revenge the death of their father upon which dunthalmo shut them up in two caves on the banks of teutha intending to take them off privately  colmal the daughter of dunthalmo who was secretly in love with calthon helped him to make his escape from prison and sled with him to fingal disguised in the habit of a young warrior and implored his aid against dunthalmo  fingal sent ossian with three hundred men to colmars relief  dunthalmo having previously murdered colmar came to a battle with ossian but he was killed by that hero and his army totally defeated  calthon married colmal his deliverer and ossian returned to morven    pleasant is the voice of thy song thou lonely dweller of the rock it comes on the sound of the stream along the narrow vale my soul awakes o stranger in the midst of my hall i stretch my hand to the spear as in the days of other years  i stretch my hand but it is seeble and the sigh of my bosom grows  will thou not listen son of the rock to the song of ossian my soul is full of other times the joy of my youth returns thus the sun if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his evening beam the fields revive the birds their notes renew and bleating herds attest their joy that hill and valley rings milton  the fair sunshine in summers day  when a dreadful storm away is flit through the broad world does spread his goodly ray at sight whereof each bird that sits on spray and every beast that to his den was fled come forth afresh out of their late dismay and to the light lift up their drooping head spencer appears in the west after the steps of his brightness have moved behind a storm the green hills lift their dewy heads the blue streams rejoice in the vale the aged hero comes forth on his staff and his gray hair glitters in the beam  do thou not behold son of the rock a shield in ossians hall it is marked with the strokes of battle and the brightness of its bosses has failed that shield the great dunthalmo bore the chief of streamy teutha  dunthalmo bore it in battle before he fell by ossians spear listen son of the rock to the tale of other years   rathmor was a chief of clutha the feeble dwelt in his hall the gates of rathmor were never closed his feast was always spread the sons of the stranger came and blessed the generous chief of clutha bards raised the song and touched the harp and joy brightened on the face of the mournful  dunthalmo came in his pride and rushed into the combat of rathmor the chief of clutha overcame the rage of dunthalmo rose  he came by night with his warriors and the mighty rathmor fell he fell in his halls where his feast was often spread for strangers   colmar and calthon were young the sons of carborne rathmor they came in the joy of youth into their fathers hall they behold him in his blood and their bursting tears descend  the soul of dunthalmo melted when he saw the children of youth he brought them to alteuthas alteutha or rather balteutha the town of tweed the name of dunthalmos seat it is observable that all the names in this poem are derived from the galic language which as i have remarked in a preceding note is a proof that it was once the universal language of the whole island  walls they grew in the house of their foe  they bent the bow in his presence and came forth to his battles  they saw the sallen walls of their fathers they saw the green thorn in the hall their tears descended in secret and at times their faces were mournful dunthalmo beheld their grief his darkening soul designed their death he closed them in two caves on the ecchoing banks of teutha the sun did not come there with his beams nor the moon of heaven by night the sons of rathmor remained in darkness and soresaw their death  the daughter of dunthalmo wept in silence the fairhaired blueeyed colmal caolmhal a woman with small eyebrows small eyebrows were a distinguishing part of beauty in ossians time and he seldom fails to give them to the sine women of his poems  her eye had rolled in secret on calthon his loveliness swelled in her soul she trembled for her warrior but what could colmal do her arm could not lift the spear nor was the sword sormed for her side her white breast never rose beneath a mail neither was her eye the terror of heroes what can thou do o colmal for the falling chief  her steps are unequal her hair is loose her eye looked wildly through her tears  she came by night to the hall that is the hall where the arms taken from enemies were hung up as trophies ossian is very careful to make his stories probable for he makes colmal put on the arms of a youth killed in his first battle as more proper for a young woman who cannot be supposed strong enough to carry the armor of a fuilgrown warrior  and armed her lovely form in steel the steel of a young warrior who fell in the first of his battles  she came to the cave of calthon and loosed the thong from his hands  arise son of rathmor she said arise the night is dark let us fly to the king of selma fingal  chief of fallen clutha i am the son of lamgal who dwelt in thy fathers hall i heard of thy dark dwelling in the cave and my soul arose arise son of rathmor for the night is dark   blessed voice replied the chief come thou from the darklyrolling clouds for often the ghosts of his fathers descend to calthons dreams since the sun has retired from his eyes and darkness has dwelt around him or art thou the son of lamgal the chief i often saw in clutha but will i fly to fingal and colmar my brother low will i fly to morven and the hero closed in night no give me that spear son of lamgal calthon will defend his brother  a thousand heroes replied the maid stretch their spears round carborne colmar what can calthon do against a host so great let us fly to the king of morven he will come with battle his arm is stretched forth to the unhappy the lightning of his sword is round the weak  arise thou son of rathmor the shadows will fly away dunthalmo will behold thy steps on the field and thou must fall in thy youth  the sighing hero rose his tears descend for carborne colmar he came with the maid to selmas hall but he knew not that it was colmal the helmet covered her lovely face and her breast rose beneath the steel fingal returned from the chase and found the lovely strangers they were like two beams of light in the midst of the hall  the kind heard the tale of grief and turned his eyes around a thousand heroes halfrose before him claiming the war of teutha  i came with my spear from the hill and the joy of battle rose in my breast for the king spoke to ossian in the midst of the people  son of my strength he said take the spear of fingal go to teuthas mighty stream and save the carborne colmar  let thy fame return before thee like a pleasant gale that my soul may rejoice over my son who renews the renown of our fathers  ossian be thou a storm in battle but mild when the foes are low  it was thus my fame arose o my son and be thou like selmas chief  when the haughty come to my halls my eyes behold them not but my arm is stretched forth to the unhappy my sword defends the weak  i rejoiced in the words of the king and took my rattling arms  diaran diaran father of that connal who was unfortunately killed by crimora his mistress rose at my side and dargo dargo the son of collath is celebrated in other poems by ossian he is said to have been killed by a boar at a hunting party the lamentation of his mistress or wise mingala over his body is extant but whether it is of ossians composition i cannot determine it is generally ascribed to him and has much of his manner but some traditions mention it as an imitation by some later bard  as it has some poetical merit i have subjoined it the spouse of dargo comes in tears for dargo was no more the heroes figh over larthos chief and what shall sad mingala do the dark soul vanished like morning mist before the king of spears but the generous glowed in his presence like the morning star  who was the fairest and most lovely who but collaths stately son who sat in the midst of the wise but dargo of the mighty deeds  thyhand touched the trembling harp thy voice was soft as summerwinds  ah me what shall the heroes say for dargo fell before a boar pale is the lovely cheek the look of which was firm in danger  why have thou failed on our hills thou farer than the beams of the sun  the daughter of adonsion was lovely in the eyes of the valiant she was lovely in their eyes but she chose to be the spouse of dargo  but thou art alone mingala the night is coming with its clouds where is the bed of thy repose where but in the tomb of dargo  why do thou lift the stone o bard why do thou shut the narrow house mingalas eyes are heavy bard she must sleep with dargo  last night i heard the song of joy in larthos lofty hall but silence dwells around my bed mingala rests with dargo   king of spears  three hundred youths followed our steps the lovely strangers were at my side dunthalmo heard the sound of our approach he gathered the strength of teutha  he stood on a hill with his host they were like rocks broken with thunder when their bent trees are singed and bare and the streams of their chinks have failed  the stream of teutha rolled in its pride before the gloomy foe i sent a bard to dunthalmo to offer the combat on the plain but he smiled in the darkness of his pride  his unsettled host moved on the hill like the mountaincloud when the blast has entered its womb and scatters the curling gloom on every side  they brought colmar to teuthas bank bound with a thousand thongs the chief is sad but lovely and his eye is on his friends for we stood in our arms on the opposite bank of teutha dunthalmo came with his spear and pierced the heros side he rolled on the bank in his blood and we heard his broken sighs  calthon rushed into the stream i bounded forward on my spear teuthas race fell before us night came rolling down dunthalmo rested on a rock amidst an aged wood the rage of his bosom burned against the carborne calthon  but calthon stood in his grief he mourned the fallen colmar colmar slain in youth before his fame arose  i bade the song of woe to rise to sooth the mournful chief but he stood beneath a tree and often threw his spear on earth  the humid eye of colmal rolled near in a secret tear she foresaw the fall of dunthalmo or of cluthas battling chief  now half the night had passed away silence and darkness were on the field sleep rested on the eyes of the heroes calthons settling soul was still his eyes were halfclosed but the murmur of teutha had not yet failed in his ear  pale and showing his wounds the ghost of colmar came he bended his head over the hero and raised his feeble voice  sleeps the son of rathmor in his night and his brother low did we not rise to the chase together and pursue the darkbrown hinds colmar was not forgot till he fell till death had blasted his youth i lie pale beneath the rock of lona o let calthon rise the morning comes with its beams and dunthalmo will dishonor the fallen  he passed away in his blast the rising calthon saw the steps of his departure  he rushed in the sound of his steel and unhappy colmal rose she followed her hero through night and dragged her spear behind  but when calthon came to lonas rock he found his fallen brother  the rage of his bosom rose and he rushed among the foe the groans of death ascend they close around the chief  he is bound in the midst and brought to gloomy dunthalmo  the shout of joy arose and the hills of night replied   i started at the sound and took my fathers spear diaran rose at my side and the youthful strength of dargo we missed the chief of clutha and our souls were sad  i dreaded the departure of my fame the pride of my valor rose  sons of morven i said it is not thus our fathers fought they rested not on the field of strangers when the foe did not fall before them  their strength was like the eagles of heaven their renown is in the song but our people fall by degrees and our fame begins to depart  what shall the king of morven say if ossian conquers not at teutha rise in your steel ye warriors and sollow the sound of ossians course he will not return but renowned to the echoing walls of selma  morning rose on the blue waters of teutha colmal stood before me in tears she told of the chief of clutha and thrice the spear fell from her hand my wrath turned against the stranger for my soul trembled for calthon  son of the feeble hand i said do teuthas warriors fight with tears the battle is not won with grief nor dwells the sigh in the soul of war  go to the deer of carmun or the lowing herds of teutha  but leave these arms thou son of fear a warrior may lift them in battle   i tore the mail from her shoulders her snowy breast appeared she bent her red face to the ground  i looked in silence to the chiefs the spear fell from my hand and the sigh of my bosom rose  but when i heard the name of the maid my crowding tears descended i blessed the lovely beam of youth and bade the battle move   why son of the rock should ossian tell how teuthas warriors died they are now forgot in their land and their tombs are not found on the heath  years came on with their tempests and the green mounds mouldered away  scarce is the grave of dunthalmo seen or the place where he fell by the spear of ossian  some gray warrior half blind with age sitting by night at the flaming oak of the hall tells now my actions to his sons and the fall of the dark dunthalmo the saces of youth bend sidelong toward his voice surprise and joy burn in their eyes   i found the son calthon of rathmor bound to an oak my sword cut the thongs from his hands and i gave him the whitebosomed colmal  they dwelt in the halls of teutha and ossian returned to selma  lathmon a poem lathmon a british prince taking advantage of fingals absence in ireland made a descent on morven and advanced within sight of selma the royal palace fingal arrived in the mean time and lathmon retreated to a hill where his army was surprised by night and himself taken prisoner by ossian and gaul the son of morni this exploit of gaul and ossian bears a near resemblance to the beautiful episode of nisus and euryalus in virgils ninth aeneid the poem opens with the first appearance of fingal on the coast of morven and ends it may be supposed about noon the next day the first paragraph is in a lyric measure and appears to have been sung of old to the harp as a prelude to the narrative part of the poem which is in heroic verse  selma thy halls are silent there is no sound in the woods of morven the wave tumbles alone on the coast the silent beam of the sun is on the field the daughters of morven come forth like the bow of the shower they look toward green ullin for the white sails of the king he had promised to return but the winds of the north arose  who pours from the eastern hill like a stream of darkness it is the host of lathmon he has heard of the absence of fingal he trusts in the wind of the north his soul brightens with joy why do thou come lathmon the mighty are not in selma why come thou with thy forward spear will the daughters of morven fight but stop o mighty stream in thy course does not lathmon behold these sails why do thou vanish lathmon like the mist of the lake but the squally storm is behind thee fingal pursues thy steps  the king of morven started from sleep as we rolled on the darkblue wave he stretched his hand to his spear and his heroes rose around we knew that he had seen his fathers for they often descended to his dreams when the sword of the foe rose over the land and the battle darkened before us  whither have thou fled o wind said the king of morven do thou rustle in the chambers of the south and pursue the shower in other lands why do thou not come to my sails to the blue face of my seas the foe is in the land of morven and the king is absent but let each bind on his mail and each assume his shield stretch every spear over the wave let every sword be unsheathed lathmon it is said by tradition that it was the intelligence of lathmons invasion that occasioned fingals return from ireland though ossion more poetically ascribes the cause of fingals knowledge to his dream is before us with his host he that fled he alludes to a battle wherein fingal had defeated lathmon the occasion of this first war between those heroes is told by ossian in another poem which the translator has seen from fingal on the plains of lona but he returns like a collected stream and his roar is between our hills  such were the words of fingal we rushed into carmonas bay ossian ascended the hill and thrice struck his bossy shield the rock of morven replied and the bounding roes came forth the foes were troubled in my presence and collected their darkened host for i stood like a cloud on the hill rejoicing in the arma of my youth  morni morni was chief of a numerous tribe in the days of fingal and his father comhal the last mentioned hero was killed in battle against mornis tribe but the valor and conduct of fingal reduced them at last to obedience we find the two heroes perfectly reconciled in this poem sat beneath a tree at the roaring waters of strumon strumone stream of the hill here the proper name of rivulet in the neighborhood of selma  his locks of age are gray he leans forward on his staff young gaul is near the hero hearing the battles of his youth often did he rise in the fire of his soul at the mighty deeds of morni  the aged heard the sound of ossians shield he knew the sign of battle he started at once from his place his gray hair parted on his back he remembers the actions of other years my son he said to fair haired gaul i hear the sound of battle the king of morven is returned the sign of war is heard go to the halls of strumon and bring his arms to morni bring the arms which my father wore in his age for my arm begins to fail take thou thy armor o gaul and rush to the first of thy battles let thine arm reach to the renown of thy fathers be thy course in the field like the eagles wing why should thou fear death my son the valiant fall with fame their shields turn the dark stream of danger away and renown dwells on their gray hairs do thou not see o gaul how the steps of my age are honored morni moves forth and the young meet him with reverence and turn their eyes with silent joy on his course but i never fled from danger my son my sword lightened through the darkness of battle the stranger melted before me the mighty were blasted in my presence  gaul brought the arms to morni the aged warrior covered himself with steel he took the spear in his hand which was often stained with the blood of the valiant he came toward fingal his son attended his steps the son of comhal rejoiced over the warrior when he came in the locks of his age  king of the roaring strumon said the rising joy of fingal do i behold thee in arms after thy strength has failed often has morni shone in battles like the beam of the rising sun when he disperses the storms of the hill and brings peace to the glittering fields but why did thou not rest in thine age thy renown is in the song the people behold thee and bless the departure of mighty morni why did thou not rest in thine age for the foe will vanish before fingal  son of comhal replied the chief the strength of mornis arm has failed i attempt to draw the sword of my youth but it remains in its place i throw the spear but it falls short of the mark and i feel the weight of my shield we decay like the grass of the mountain and our strength returns no more i have a son o fingal his soul has delighted in the actions of mornis youth but his sword has not been lifted against the foe neither has his fame begun i come with him to battle to direct his arm his renown will be a sun to my soul in the dark hour of my departure o that the name of morni were forgot among the people that the heroes would only say behold the father of gaul  king of strumon fingal replied gaul shall lift the sword in battle but he shall lift it before fingal my arm shall defend his youth but rest thou in the halls of selma and hear of our renown bid the harp be strung and the voice of the bard arise that those who fall may rejoice in their fame and the soul of morni brighten with gladness  ossian thou have sought in battles the blood of strangers is on thy spear let thy course be with gaul in the strife but depart not from the side of fingal lest the foe find you alone and your fame fail at once  i saw ossian speaks the contrast between the old and young heroes is strongly marked the circumstance of the latters drawing their swords is well imagined and agrees with the impatience of young soldiers just entered upon action gaul in his arms and my soul was mixed with his for the fire of the battle was in his eyes he looked to the so with joy we spoke the words of friendship in secret and the lightning of our swords poured together for we drew them behind the wood and tried the strength of our arms on the empty air  night came down on morven fingal sat at the beam of the oak morni sat by his side with all his gray waving locks their discourse is of other times and the actions of their fathers three bards at times touched the harp and ullin was near with his song he sung of the mighty comhal but darkness gathered ullin had chosen ill the subject of his song the darkness which gathered on mornis brow did not proceed from any dislike he had to comhals name though they were foes but from his fear that the song would awaken fingal to remembrance of the feuds which had subsisted of old between the families fingals speech on this occasion abounds with generosity and good sense on mornis brow he rolled his red eye on ullin and the song of the bard ceased fingal observed the aged hero and he mildly spoke  chief of strumon why that darkness let the days of other years be forgot our fathers contended in battle but we meet together at the feast our swords are turned on the foes and they melt before us on the field let the days of our fathers be forgot king of mossy strumon  king of morven replied the chief i remember thy father with joy he was terrible in battle the rage this expression is ambiguous in the original it either signifies that comhal killed many in battle or that he was implacable in his resentment the translator has endeavored to preserve the same ambiguity in the version as it was probably designed by the poet of the chief was deadly my eyes were full of tears when the king of heroes sell the valiant fall o fingal and the feeble remain on the hills how many heroes have passed away in the days of morni and i did not shun the battle neither did i fly from the strife of the valiant  now let the friends of fingal rest for the night is around that they may rise with strength to battle against carborne lathmon i hear the sound of his host like thunder heard on a distant heath ossian and fairhaired gaul ye are swift in the race observe the foes of fingal from that woody hill but approach them not your fathers are not near to shield you let not your fame fall at once the valor of youth may fail  we heard the words of the chief with joy and moved in the clang of our arms our steps are on the woody hill heaven burns with all its stars the meteors of death fly over the field the distant noise of the foe reached our ears it was then gaul spoke in his valor his hand halfunsheathed the sword  son of fingal he said why burns the soul of gaul my heart beats high my steps are disordered and my hand trembles on my sword when i look toward the foe my soul lightens before me and i see their sleeping host tremble thus the souls of the valiant in battles of the spear  how would the soul of morni rise if we should rush on the foe our renown would grow in the song and our steps be stately in the eyes of the brave  son of morni i replied my soul delights in battle i delight to shine in battle alone and to give my name to the bards but what if the foe should prevail shall i behold the eyes of the king they are terrible in his displeasure and like the flames of death  but i will not behold them in his wrath ossian shall prevail or fall but shall the fame of the vanquished rise  they pass away like a shadow but the fame of ossian shall rise his deeds shall be like his fathers let us rush in our arms son of morni let us rush to battle gaul if thou shall return go to selmas lofty wall tell to evirallin ossian had married her a little time before the story of his courtship of this lady is introduced as an episode in the fourth book of fingal that i fell with fame carry this sword to brannos daughter let her give it to oscar when the years of his youth shall arise  son of fingal gaul replied with a sigh will i return after ossian is low  what would my father say and fingal king of men the feeble would turn their eyes and say behold the mighty gaul who left his friend in his blood ye shall not behold me ye feeble but in the midst of my renown ossian i have heard from my father the mighty deeds of heroes their mighty deeds when alone for the soul increases in danger  son of morni i replied and strode before him on the heath our fathers shall praise our valor when they mourn our fall a beam of gladness shall rise on their souls when their eyes are full of tears they will say our sons have not fallen like the grass of the field for they spread death around them  but why should we think of the narrow house the sword defends the valiant but death pursues the flight of the feeble and their renown is not heard  we rushed forward through night and came to the roar of a stream which bent its blue course round the foe through trees that ecchoed to its noise we came to the bank of the stream and saw the sleeping host their fires were decayed on the plain and the lonely steps of their scouts were distant far i stretched my spear before me to support my steps over the stream but gaul took my hand and spoke the words of the valiant  shall this proposal of gaul is much more noble and more agreeable to true heroism than the behavior of ulysses and diomed in the iliad or that of nisus and euryalus in the aeneid what his valor and generosity suggested became the foundation of his success for the enemy being dismayed with the sound of ossians shield which was the common signal of battle thought that fingals whole army came to attack them so that they fly in reality from an army not from two heroes which reconciles the story to probability the son of fingal rush on a sleeping foe shall he come like a blast by night when it overturns the young trees in secret fingal did not thus receive his fame nor dwells renown on the gray hairs of morni for actions like these strike ossian strike the shield of battle and let their thousands rise let them meet gaul in his first battle that he may try the strength of his arm  my soul rejoiced over the warrior and my bursting tears descended and the foe shall meet gaul i said the fame of mornis son shall arise but rush not too far my hero let the gleam of thy steel be near to ossian let our hands join in slaughter  gaul do thou not behold that rock its gray side dimly gleams to the stars if the foe shall prevail let our back be toward the rock then shall they fear to approach our spears for death is in our hands  i struck thrice my ecchoing shield the starting foe arose we rushed on in the sound of our arms their crowded steps fly over the heath for they thought that the mighty fingal came and the strength of their arms withered away the sound of their flight was like that of flame when it rushes through the blasted groves  it was then the spear of gaul flew in its strength it was then his sword arose cremor fell and mighty leth dunthormo struggled in his blood the steel rushed through crothos side as bent he rose on his spear the black stream poured from the wound and hissed on the halfextinguished oak cathmin saw the steps of the hero behind him and ascended a blasted tree but the spear pierced him from behind shrieking panting he fell moss and withered branches pursue his fall and strew the blue arms of gaul  such were thy deeds son of morni in the first of thy battles nor slept the sword by thy side thou last of fingals race ossian rushed forward in his strength and the people fell before him as the grass by the staff of the boy when he whistles along the field and the gray beard of the thistle falls but careless the youth moves on his steps are toward the desert  gray morning rose around us the winding streams are bright along the heath the foe gathered on a hill and the rage of lathmon rose he bent the red eye of his wrath he is silent in his rising grief he often struck his bossy shield and his steps are unequal on the heath i saw the distant darkness of the hero and i spoke to mornis son  carborne carborne is a title of honor bestowed by ossian indiscriminately on every hero as every chief in his time kept a chariot or litter by way of state chief of strumon do thou behold the foe they gather on the hill in their wrath let our steps be toward the king fingal  he shall rise in his strength and the host of lathmon vanish our fame is around us warrior the eyes of the aged fingal and morni will rejoice but let us fly son of morni lathmon descends the hill  then let our steps the behavior of gaul throughout this poem is that of a hero in the most exalted sense the modesty of ossian concerning his own actions is not less remarkable than his impartiality with regard to gaul for it is well known that gaul afterward rebelled against fingal which might be supposed to have bred prejudices against him in the breast of ossian but as gaul from an enemy became fingals firmest friend and greatest hero the poet passes over one slip in his conduct on account of his many virtues be slow replied the fair  haired gaul lest the foe say with a smile behold the warriors of night they are like ghosts terrible in darkness but they melt away before the beam of the east ossian take the shield of gormar who fell beneath thy spear that the aged heroes may rejoice when they shall behold the actions of their sons  such were our words on the plain when sulmath suilmhath a man of good eyesight came to carborne lathmon sulmath chief of dutha at the darkrolling stream of duvranna dubhbhranna dark mountainstream what river went by this name in the days of ossian is not easily ascertained at this distance of time a river in scotland which falls into the sea at banff still retains the name of duvran if that is meant by ossian in this passage lathmon must have been a prince of the pictish nation or those caledonians who inhabited of old the eastern coast of scotland  why do thou not rush son of nuath with a thousand of thy heroes why do thou not descend with thy host before the warriors fly their blue arms are beaming to the rising light and their steps are before us on the heath  son of the feeble hand said lathmon shall my host descend they ossian seldom fails to give his heroes though enemies that generosity of temper which it appears from his poems was a conspicuous part of his own character those who too much despise their enemies do not reflect that the more they take from the valor of their foes the less merit they have themselves in conquering them the custom of depreciating enemies is not altogether one of the refinements of modern heroism this railing disposition is one of the capital faults in homers characters which by the bye cannot be imputed to the poet who kept to the manners of the times of which he wrote milton has followed homer in this respect but railing is less shocking in infernal spirits who are the objects of horror than in heroes who are set up as patterns of imitation are but two son of dutha and shall a thousand lift their steel nuath would mourn in his hall for the departure of his fame his eyes would turn from lathmon when the tread of his feet approached  go thou to the heroes chief of dutha for i behold the stately steps of ossian his fame is worthy of my steel let him fight with lathmon  the noble sulmath came i rejoiced in the words of the king i raised the shield on my arm and gaul placed in my hand the sword of morni we returned to the murmuring stream lathmon came in his strength his dark host rolled like the clouds behind him but the son of nuath was bright in his steel  son of fingal said the hero thy fame has grown on our fall how many lie there of my people by thy hand thou king of men lift now thy spear against lathmon and lay the son of nuath low lay him low among his people or thou thyself must fall it shall never be told in my halls that my warriors fell in my presence that they fell in the presence of lathmon when his sword rested by his side the blue eyes of cutha cutha appears to have been lathmons wife or mistress would roll in tears and her steps be lonely in the vales of dunlathmon  neither shall it be told i replied that the son of fingal fled were his steps covered with darkness yet would not ossian fly his soul would meet him and say does the bard of selma fear the foe no he does not fear the foe his joy is in the midst of battle  lathmon came on with his spear and pierced the shield of ossian i felt the cold steel at my side and drew the swored of morni i cut the spear in twain the bright point fell glittering on the ground the son of nuath burnt in his wrath and lifted high his sounding shield his dark eyes rolled above it as bending forward it shone like a gate of brass but ossians spear pierced the brightness of its bosses and sunk in a tree that rose behind the shield hung on the quivering lance but lathmon still advanced gaul foresaw the fall of the chief and stretched his buckler before my sword when it descended in a stream of light over the king of dunlathmon  lathmon beheld the son of morni and the tear started from his eye he threw the sword of his fathers on the ground and spoke the words of the valiant why should lathmon fight against the first of mortal men your souls are beams from heaven your swords the flames of death who can equal the renown of the heroes whose actions are so great in youth o that ye were in the halls of nuath in the green dwelling of lathmon then would my father say that his son did not yield to the feeble  but who comes a mighty stream along the ecchoing heath the little hills are troubled before him and a thousand ghosts are on the beams of his steel the ghosts it was thought in ossians time that each person had his attending spirit the traditions concerning this opinion are dark and unsatisfactory of those who are to fall by the arm of the king of resounding morven  happy art thou o fingal thy sons shall fight thy battles they go forth before thee and they return with the steps of their renown  fingal came in his mildness rejoicing in secret over the actions of his son mornis face brightened with gladness and his aged eyes look faintly through the tears of joy we came to the halls of selma and sat round the feast of shells the maids of the song came into our presence and the mildly blushing evirallin her dark hair spreads on her neck of snow her eye rolled in secret on ossian she touched the harp of music and we blessed the daughter of branno  fingal rose in his place and spoke to dunlathmons battling king the sword of trenmor trembled by his side as he lifted up his mighty arm son of nuath he said why do thou search for fame in morven we are not of the race of the feeble nor do our swords gleam over the weak when did we come to dunlathmon with the sound of war fingal does not delight in battle though his arm is strong my renown grows on the fall of the haughty the lightning of my steel pours on the proud in arms the battle comes and the tombs of the valiant rise the tombs of my people rise o my fathers and i at last must remain alone but i will remain renowned and the departure of my soul shall be one stream of light lathmon retire to thy place turn thy battles to other lands the race of morven are renowned and their foes are the sons of the unhappy  oithona a poem gaul the son of morni attended lathmon into his own country after his being defeated in morven as related in the preceding poem he was kindly entertained by nuath the father of lathmon and fell in love with his daughter oithona  the lady was no less enamoured of gaul and a day was fixed for their marriage in the mean time fingal preparing for an expedition into the country of the britons sent for gaul he obeyed and went but not without promising to oithona to return if he survived the war by a certain day  lathmon too was obliged to attend his father nuath in his wars and oithona was left alone at dunlathmon the seat of the family  dunrommath lord of uthal supposed to be one of the orkneys taking advantage of the absence of her friends came and carried off by force oithona who had formerly rejected his love into tromathon a desert island where he concealed her in a cave  gaul returned on the day appointed heard of the rape and sailed to tromathon to revenge himself on dunrommath when he landed he found oithona disconsolate and resolved not to survive the loss of her honor  she told him the story of her misfortunes and she scarce ended when dunrommath with his followers appeared at the further end of the island gaul prepared to attack him recommending to oithona to retire till the battle was over  she seemingly obeyed but she secretly armed herself rushed into the thickest of the battle and was mortally wounded  gaul pursuing the flying enemy found her just expiring on the field he mourned over her raised her tomb and returned to morven  thus is the story handed down by tradition nor is it given with any material difference in the poem which opens with gauls return to dunlathmon after the rape of oithona    darkness dwells around dunlathmon though the moon shows half her face on the hill the daughter of night turns her eyes away for she beholds the grief that is coming  the son of morni is on the plain but there is no sound in the hall no longstreaming some gentle taper  visit us with thy long levelled rule of streaming light milton beam of light comes trembling through the gloom the voice of oithona oithona the virgin of the wave is not heard amidst the noise of the streams of duvranna   whither art thou gone in thy beauty darkhaired daughter of nuath lathmon is in the field of the valiant but thou did promise to remain in the hall thou did promise to remain in the hall till the son of morni returned till he returned from strumon to the maid of his love the tear was on thy cheek at his departure the sigh rose in secret in thy breast but thou do not come to meet him with songs with the lightlytrembling sound of the harp   such were the words of gaul when he came to dunlathmons towers the gates were open and dark the winds were blustering in the hall the trees strowed the threshold with leaves and the murmur of night is abroad  sad and silent at a rock the son of morni sat his soul trembled for the maid but he knew not whither to turn his course the son morlo the son of leth is one of fingals most famous heroes he and three other men attended gaul on his expedition to tromathon of leth stood at a distance and heard the winds in his bushy hair but he did not raise his voice for he saw the sorrow of gaul  sleep descended on the heroes the visions of night arose oithona stood in a dream before the eyes of mornis son her dark hair was loose and disordered her lovely eye rolled in tears blood stained her snowy arm the robe half hid the wound of her breast she stood over the chief and her voice was heard  sleeps the son of morni he that was lovely in the eyes of oithona sleeps gaul at the distant rock and the daughter of nuath low the sea rolls round the dark isle of tromathon i sit in my tears in the cave nor do i sit alone o gaul the dark chief of cuthal is there he is there in the rage of his love  and what can oithona do  a rougher blast rushed through the oak the dream of night departed gaul took his aspen spear he stood in the rage of wrath often did his eyes turn to the east and accuse the lagging light  at length the morning came forth the hero lifted up the sail the winds came rustling from the hill and he bounded on the waves of the deep  on the third day arose tromathon      hom od v   0 then swelled to sight phaeacias dusky coast and woody mountains half in vapors lost that lay before him indistinct and vast like a broad shield amid the watery waste  tromthon heavy or deepsounding wave  like a blue shield in the midst of the sea the white wave roared against its rocks sad oithona sat on the coast she looked on the rolling waters and her tears descend  but when she saw gaul in his arms she started and turned her eyes away her lovely cheek is bent and red her white arm trembles by her side  thrice she strove to fly from his presence but her steps failed her as she went  daughter of nuath said the hero why do thou fly from gaul do my eyes send forth the flame of death or darkens hatred in my soul thou art to me the beam of the east rising in a land unknown but thou coverest thy face with sadness daughter of high dunlathmon is the foe of oithona near my soul burns to meet him in battle the sword trembles on the side of gaul and longs to glitter in his hand  speak daughter of nuath do thou not behold my tears  carborne chief of strumon replied the sighing maid why come thou over the darkblue wave to nuaths mournful daughter why did i not pass away in secret like the flower of the rock that lifts its fair head unseen and strows its withered leaves on the blast why did thou come o gaul to hear my departing sigh i pass away in my youth and my name shall not be heard or it will be heard with sorrow and the tears of nuath will fall thou will be sad son of morni for the fallen fame of oithona but she shall sleep in the narrow tomb far from the voice of the mourner  why did thou come chief of strumon to the seabeat rocks of tromathon  i came to meet thy foes daughter of carborne nuath the death of cuthals chief darkens before me or mornis son shall fall  oithona when gaul is low raise my tomb on that oozy rock and when the darkbounding ship shall pass call the sons of the sea call them and give this sword that they may carry it to mornis hall that the greyhaired hero may cease to look toward the desert for the return of his son  and shall the daughter of nuath live she replied with a bursting sigh shall i live in tromathon and the son of morni low my heart is not of that rock nor my soul careless as that sea which lifts its blue waves to every wind and rolls beneath the storm the blast which shall lay thee low shall spread the branches of oithona on earth we shall wither together son of carborne morni  the narrow house is pleasant to me and the gray stone of the dead for never more will i leave thy rocks seasurrounded tromathon  night oithona relates how she was carried away by dunrommath came on with her clouds after the departure of lathmon when he went to the wars of his fathers to the mosscovered rock of duthormoth night came on and i sat in the hall at the beam of the oak the wind was abroad in the trees i heard the sound of arms joy rose in my face for i thought of thy return it was the chief of cuthal the redhaired strength of dunrommath his eyes rolled in fire the blood of my people was on his sword they who defended oithona fell by the gloomy chief  what could i do my arm was weak it could not lift the spear he took me in my grief amidst my tears he raised the sail he feared the returning strength of lathmon the brother of unhappy oithona  but behold he comes with his people the dark wave is divided before him  whither will thou turn thy steps son of morni many are the warriors of dunrommath  my steps never turned from battle replied the hero as he unsheathed his sword and will i begin to fear oithona when thy foes are near go to thy cave daughter of nuath till our battle cease son of leth bring the bows of our fathers and the sounding quiver of morni let our three warriors bend the yew our selves will lift the spear they are an host on the rock but our souls are strong  the daughter of nuath went to the cave a troubled joy rose on her mind like the red path of the lightning on a stormy cloud  her soul was resolved and the tear was dried from her wildlylooking eye  dunrommath slowly approached for he saw the son of morni contempt contracted his face a smile is on his darkbrown cheek his red eye rolled halfconceald beneath his shaggy brows  whence are the sons of the sea begun the gloomy chief have the winds driven you to the rocks of tromathon or come you in search of the whitehanded daughter of nuath the sons of the unhappy ye feeble men come to the hand of dunrommath his eye spares not the weak and he delights in the blood of strangers oithona is a beam of light and the chief of cuthal enjoys it in secret would thou come on its loveliness like a cloud son of the feeble hand  thou may come but shall thou return to the halls of thy fathers  do thou not know me said gaul redhaired chief of cuthal thy feet were swift on the heath in the battle of carborne lathmon when the sword of mornis son pursued his host in morvens woody land dunrommath thy words are mighty for thy warriors gather behind thee but do i fear them son of pride i am not of the race of the feeble  gaul advanced in his arms dunrommath shrunk behind his people but the spear of gaul pierced the gloomy chief and his sword lopped off his head as it bended in death  the son of morni shook it thrice by the lock the warriors of dunrommath fled the arrows of morven pursued them ten fell on the mossy rocks the rest lift the sounding sail and bound on the ecchoing deep  gaul advanced toward the cave of oithona he beheld a youth leaning against a rock an arrow had pierced his side and his eye rolled faintly beneath his helmet  the soul of mornis son is sad he came and spoke the words of peace  can the hand of gaul heal thee youth of the mournful brow i have searched for the herbs of the mountains i have gathered them on the secret banks of their streams my hand has closed the wound of the valiant and their eyes have blessed the son of morni where dwelt thy fathers warrior were they of the sons of the mighty sadness shall come like night on thy native streams for thou art fallen in thy youth   my fathers replied the stranger were of the sons of the mighty but they shall not be sad for my fame is departed like morning mist high walls rise on the banks of duvranna and see their mossy towers in the stream a rock ascends behind them with its bending firs thou may behold it far distant there my brother dwells he is renowned in battle give him this glittering helmet  the helmet fell from the hand of gaul for it was the wounded oithona she had armed herself in the cave and came in search of death her heavy eyes are half closed the blood pours from her side   son of morni she said prepare the narrow tomb sleep comes like a cloud on my soul the eyes of oithona are dim o had i dwelt at duvranna in the bright beam of my fame then had my years come on with joy and the virgins would bless my steps but i fall in youth son of morni and my father shall blush in his hall   she fell pale on the rock of tromathon the mournful hero raised her tomb  he came to morven but we saw the darkness of his soul ossian took the harp in the praise of oithona the brightness of the face of gaul returned but his sigh rose at times in the midst of his friends like blasts that shake their unfrequent wings after the stormy winds are laid  croma a poem malvina the daughter of toscar is overheard by ossian lamenting the death of oscar her lover ossian to divert her grief relates his own actions in an ex edition which he undertook at fingals command to aid crothar the petty king of croma a country in ireland against rothmar who invaded his dominions the story is delivered down thus in tradition crothar king of croma being blind with age and his son too young for the field rothmar the chief of tromlo resolved to avail himself of the opportunity offered of annexing the dominions of crothar to his own he accordingly marched into the country subject to crothar but which he held of arth or artho who was at the time supreme king of ireland  crothar being on account of his age and blindness unfit for action sent for aid to fingal king of scotland who ordered his son ossian to the relief of crothar but before his arrival fovargormo the son of crothar attacking rothmar was slain himself and his forces totally defeated ossian renewed the war came to battle killed rothmar and routed his army croma being thus delivered of its enemies ossian returned to scotland    it was the voice of my love few are his visits to the dreams of malvina open your airy halls ye fathers of mighty toscar unfold the gates of your clouds the steps of malvinas departure are near i have heard a voice in my dream i feel the fluttering of my soul why did thou come o blast from the darkrolling of the lake thy rustling wing was in the trees the dream of malvina departed but she beheld her love when his robe of mist flew on the wind the beam of the sun was on his skirts they glittered like the gold of the stranger it was the voice of my love few are his visits to my dreams  but thou dwell in the soul of malvina son of mighty ossian my sighs arise with the beam of the east my tears descend with the drops of night i was a lovely tree in thy presence oscar with all my branches round me but thy death came like a blast from the desert and laid my green head low the spring returned with its showers but no leaf of mine arose the virgins saw me silent in the hall and they touched the harp of joy the tear was on the cheek of malvina the virgins beheld me in my grief why art thou sad they said thou first of the maids of lutha was he lovely as the beam of the morning and stately in thy sight  pleasant is thy song in ossians ear daughter of streamy lutha thou have heard the music of departed bards in the dream of thy rest when sleep fell on thine eyes at the murmur of moruth morruth great stream  when thou did return from the chase in the day of the sun thou have heard the music of the bards and thy song is lovely it is lovely o malvina but it melts the soul there is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the breast of the sad but sorrow wastes the mournful o daughter of toscar and their days are few they fall away like the flower on which the sun looks in his strength after the mildew has passed over it and its head is heavy with the drops of night attend to the tale of ossian o maid he remembers the days of his youth  the king commanded i raised my sails and rushed into the bay of croma into cromas sounding bay in lovely inisfail inisfail one of the ancient names of ireland  high on the coast arose the towers of crothar king of spears crothar renowned in the battles of his youth but age dwelt then around the chief rothmar raised the sword against the hero and the wrath of fingal burned he sent ossian to meet rothmar in battle for the chief of croma was the companion of his youth  i sent the bard before me with songs i came into the hall of crothar there sat the hero amidst the arms of his fathers but his eyes had failed his gray locks waved around a staff on which the warrior leaned he hummed the song of other times when the sound of our arms reached his ears crothar rose stretched his aged hand and blessed the son of fingal  ossian said the hero the strength of crothars arm has failed o could i list the sword as on the day that fingal fought at strutha he was the first of mortal men but crothar had also his fame the king of morven praised me and he placed on my arm the bossy shield of calthar whom the hero had slain in war do thou not behold it on the wall for crothars eyes have failed is thy strength like thy fathers ossian let the aged feel thine arm  i gave my arm to the king he seels it with his aged hands the sigh rose in his breast and his tears descended thou art strong my son he said but not like the king of morven but who is like the hero among the mighty in war let the feast of my halls be spread and let my bards raise the song great is he that is within my walls sons of ecchoing croma  the feast is spread the harp is heard and joy is in the hall but it was joy covering a sigh that darkly dwelt in every breast it was like the faint beam of the moon spread on a cloud in heaven at length the music ceased and the aged king of croma spoke he spoke without a tear but the sigh swelled in the midst of his voice  son of fingal do thou not behold the darkness of crothars hall of shells my soul was not dark at the feast when my people lived i rejoiced in the presence of strangers when my son shone in the hall but ossian he is a beam that is departed and left no streak of light behind he is fallen son of fingal in the battles of his father  rothmar the chief of grassy tromlo heard that my eyes had sailed he heard that my arms were fixed in the hall and the pride of his soul arose he came toward croma my people fell before him i took my arms in the hall but what could sightless crothar do my steps were unequal my grief was great i wished for the days that were past days wherein i fought and won in the field of blood my son returned from the chase the fairhaired fovargormo faobhargorm the blue point of steel  he had not lifted his sword in battle for his arm was young but the soul of the youth was great the fire of valor burnt in his eyes he saw the disordered steps of his father and his sigh arose king of croma he said is it because thou have no son is it for the weakness of fovargormos arm that thy sighs arise i begin my father to feel the strength of my arm i have drawn the sword of my youth and i have bent the bow let me meet this rothmar with the youths of croma let me meet him o my father for i feel my burning soul  and thou shall meet him i said son of the sightless crothar but let others advance before thee that i may hear the tread of thy feet at thy return for my eyes behold thee not fairhaired fovargormo  he went he met the foe he fell the foe advances toward croma he who slew my son is near with all his pointed spears  it is not time to fill the shell i replied and took my spear my people saw the fire of my eyes and they rose around all night we strode along the heath gray morning rose in the east a green narrow vale appeared before us nor did it want its blue stream the dark host of rothmar are on its banks with all their glittering arms we fought along the vale they fled rothmar sunk beneath my sword day had not descended in the west when i brought his arms to crothar the aged hero felt them with his hands and joy brightened in his soul  the people gather to the hall the shells of the feast are heard ten harps are strung five bards advance and sing by turns those extempore compositions were in great repute among succeeding bards the pieces extant of that kind show more of the good ear than of the poetical genius of their authors the translator has only met with one poem of this sort which he thinks worthy of being preserved it is a thousand years later than ossian but the authors seem to have observed his manner and adopted some of his expressions the story of it is this five bards passing the night in the house of a chief who was a poet himself went severally to make their observations on and returned with an extempore description of night the night happened to be one in october as appears from the poem and in the north of scotland it has all that variety which the bards ascribe to it in their descriptions first bard night is dull and dark the clouds rest on the hills no star with green trembling beam no moon looks from the sky i hear the blast in the wood but i hear it distant sar the stream of the valley murmurs but its murmur is fullen and sad from the tree at the grave of the dead the longhowling owl is heard i see a dim form on the plain  it is a ghost  it fades  it flies some funeral shall pass this way the meteor marks the path  the distant dog is howling from the hut of the hill the stag lies on the mountain moss the hind is at his side she hears the wind in his branchy horns she starts but lies again  the roe is in the cleft of the rock the heathcocks head is beneath his wing no beast no bird is abroad but the owl and the howling fox she on a leafless tree he in a cloud on the hill  dark panting trembling sad the traveller has lost his way through shrubs through thorns he goes along the gurgling rill he fears the rock and the fen he fears the ghost of night the old tree groans to the blast the falling branch resounds the wind drives the withered burs clung together along the grass it is the light tread of a ghost  he trembles amidst the night  dark dusky howling is night cloudy windy and full of ghosts the dead are abroad my friends receive me from the night   second bard the wind is up the shower descends the spirit of the mountain shrieks woods fall from high windows flap the growing river roars the traveller attempts the ford hark that shriek he dies  the storm drives the horse from the hill the goat the lowing cow they tremble as drives the shower beside the mouldering bank  the hunter starts from sleep in his lonely hut he wakes the fire decayed his wet dogs smoke around him he fills the chinks with heath loud roar two mountain streams which meet beside his booth  sad on the side of a hill the wandering shepherd sits the tree resounds above him the stream roars down the rock he waits for the rising moon to guide him to his home  ghosts ride on the storm tonight sweet is their voice between the squalls of wind their songs are of other worlds  the rain is past the dry wind blows streams roar and windows flap cold drops fall from the roof i see the starry sky but the shower gathers again the west is gloomy and dark night is stormy and dismal receive me my friends from night   third bard the wind still sounds between the hills and whistles through the grass of the rock the firs fall from their place the turfy hut is torn the clouds divided fly over the sky and show the burning stars the meteor token of death flies sparkling through the gloom it rests on the hill i see the withered fern the dark browed rock the fallen oak who is that in his shroud beneath the tree by the stream  the waves darktumble on the lake and lash its rocky sides the boat is brimfull in the cove the oars on the rocking tide a maid sits sad beside the rock and eyes the rolling stream her lover promised to come she saw his boat when yet it was light on the lake is this his broken boat on the shore are these his groans on the wind  hark the hail rattles around the flaky snow descends the tops of the hills are white the stormy winds abate various is the night and cold receive me my friends from night   fourth bard night is calm and fair blue starry settled is night the winds with the clouds are gone they sink behind the hill the moon is up on the mountain trees glister streams shine on the rock bright rolls the settled lake bright the stream of the vale  i see the trees overturned the shocks of corn on the plain the wakeful hind rebuilds the shocks and whistles on the distant field  calm settled fair is night  who comes from the place of the dead that form with the robe of snow white arms and darkbrown hair it is the daughter of the chief of the people she that lately fell come let us view thee o maid thou that have been the delight of heroes the blast drives the phantom away white without form it ascends the hill  the breezes drive the blue mist slowly over the narrow vale it rises on the hill and joins its head to heaven  night is settled calm blue starry bright with the moon receive me not my friends for lovely is the night   fifth bard night is calm but dreary the moon is in a cloud in the west slow moves that pale beam along the shaded hill the distant wave is heard the torrent murmurs on the rock the cock is heard from the booth more than half the night is past the housewise groping in the gloom rekindles the settled fire the hunter thinks that day approaches and calls his bounding dogs he ascends the hill and whistles on his way a blast removes the cloud he sees the starry plough of the north much of the night is to pass he nods by the mossy rock  hark the whirlwind is in the wood a low murmur in the vale it is the mighty army of the dead returning from the air  the moon rests behind the hill the beam is still on that lofty rock long are the shadows of the trees now it is dark over all night is dreary silent and dark receive me my friends from night   the chief let clouds rest on the hills spirits fly and travelers fear let the winds of the woods arise the sounding storms descend roar streams and windows flap and green winged meteors fly rise the pale moon from behind her hills or enclose her head in clouds night is alike to me blue stormy or gloomy the sky night flies before the beam when it is poured on the hill the young day returns from his clouds but we return no more  where are our chiefs of old where our kings of mighty name the fields of their battles are silent scarce their mossy tombs remain we shall also be forgot this lofty house shall fall our sons shall not behold the ruins in grass they shall ask of the aged where stood the walls of our fathers  raise the song and strike the harp send round the shells of joy suspend a hundred tapers on high youths and maids begin the dance let some gray bard be near me to tell the deeds of other times of kings renowned in our land of chiefs we behold no more thus let the night pass until morning shall appear in our halls then let the bow be at hand the dogs the youths of the chase we shall ascend the hill with day and awake the deer     the praise of ossian they poured forth their burning souls and the harp answered to their voice the joy of croma was great for peace returned to the land the night came on with silence and the morning returned with joy no foe came in darkness with his glittering spear the joy of croma was great for the gloomy rothmar fell  i raised my voice for fovargormo when they laid the chief in earth the aged crothar was there but his sigh was not heard he searched for the wound of his son and found it in his breast joy rose in the face of the aged he came and spoke to ossian  king of spears he said my son has not fallen without his fame the young warrior did not fly but met death as he went forward in his strength happy are they who die in youth when their renown is heard the seeble will not behold them in the hall or smile at their trembling hands their memory shall be honored in the song the young tear of the virgin falls but the aged wither away by degrees and the fame of their youth begins to be forgot they fall in secret the sigh of their son is not heard joy is around their tomb and the stone of their fame is placed without a tear happy are they who die in youth when their renown is around them  berrathon a poem this poem is reputed to have been composed by ossian a little time before his death and consequently it is known in tradition by no other name than ossians last hymn the translator has taken the liberty to call it berrathon from the episode concerning the reestablishment of larthmor king of that island after he had been dethroned by his own son uthal fingal in his voyage to lochlin fing b iii whither he had been invited by starno the father of agandecca so often mentioned in ossians poems touched at berrathon an island of scandinavia where he was kindly entertained by larthmor the petty king of the place who was a vassal of the supreme kings of lochlin the hospitality of larthmor gained him fingals friendship which that hero manifested after the imprisonment of larthmor by his own son by sending ossian and toscar the father of malvina so often mentioned to rescue larthmor and to punish the unnatural behavior of uthal uthal was handsome to a proverb and consequently much admired by the ladies ninathoma the beautiful daughter of torthoma a neighboring prince fell in love and fled with him he proved unconstant for another lady whose name is not mentioned gaining his affections he confined ninathoma to a desert island near the coast of berrathon she was relieved by ossian who in company with toscar landing on berrathon defeated the forces of uthal and killed him in a single combat ninathoma whose love not all the bad behavior of uthal could erase hearing of his death died of grief in the mean time larthmor is restored and ossian and toscar returned in triumph to fingal  the present poem opens with an elegy on the death of malvina the daughter of toscar and closes with presages of the poets death it is almost altogether in a lyric measure and has that melancholy air which distinguishes the remains of the works of ossian if ever he composed any thing of a merry turn it is long since lost the serious and melancholy make the most lasting impressions on the human mind and bid fairest for being transmitted from generation to generation by tradition nor is it probable that ossian deat much in cheerful composition melancholy is so much the companion of a great genius that it is difficult to separate the idea of levity from cheerfulness which is sometimes the mark of an amiable disposition but never the characteristic of elevated parts    bend thy blue course o stream round the narrow plain of lutha lutha swift stream it is impossible at this distance of time to ascertain where the scene here described lies tradition is silent on that head and there is nothing in the poem from which a conjecture can be drawn  let the green woods hang over it from their mountains and the sun look on it at noon the thistle is there on its rock and shakes its beard to the wind the flower hangs its heavy head waving at times to the gale why do thou awake me o gale it seems to say i am covered with the drops of heaven the time of of my fading is near and the blast that shall scatter my leaves tomorrow shall the traveller come he that saw me in my beauty shall come his eyes will search the field but they will not find me  so shall they search in vain for the voice of cona after it has failed in the field the hunter shall come forth in the morning and the voice of my harp shall not be heard where is the son of carborne fingal the tear will be on his cheek  then come thou o malvina malmhina soft or lovey brow mh in the galic language has the same sound with  in english  with all thy music come lay ossian in the plain of lutha let his tomb rise in the lovely field  malvina where art thou with thy songs with the soft sound of thy steps  son tradition has not handed down the name of this son of alpin his father was one of fingals principal bards and he appears himself to have had a poetical genius of alpin art thou near where is the daughter of toscar  i passed o son of fingal by tarluthas mossy walls the smoke of the hall was ceased silence was among the trees of the hill the voice of the chase was over i saw the daughters of the bow i asked about malvina but they answered not they turned their faces away thin darkness covered their beauty they were like stars on a rainy hill by night each looking faintly through her mist  pleasant ossian speaks he calls malvina a beam of light and continues the metaphor throughout the paragraph be thy rest o lovely beam soon have thou set on our hills the steps of thy departure were stately like the moon on the blue trembling wave but thou have left us in darkness first of the maids of lutha we sit at the rock and there is no voice no light but the meteor of fire son have thou set malvina daughter of generous toscar  but thou risest like the beam of the east among the spirits of thy friends where they sit in their stormy halls the chambers of the thunder  a cloud hovers over cona its blue curling sides are high the winds are beneath it with their wings within it is the dwelling the description of this ideal palace of fingal is very poetical and agreeable to the notions of those times concerning the state of the deceased who were supposed to pursue after death the pleasures and employments of their former life the situation of ossians heroes in their separate state if not entirely happy is more agreeable than the notions of the ancient greeks concerning their departed heroes see hom odyss i    of fingal there the hero sits in darkness his airy spear is in his hand his shield half covered with clouds is like the darkened moon when one half still remains in the wave and the other looks sickly on the field  his friends sit around the king on mist and hear the songs of ullin he strikes the halfviewless harp and raises the feeble voice the lesser heroes with a thousand meteors light the airy hall malvina rises in the midst a blush is on her cheek she beholds the unknown faces of her fathers and turns aside her humid eyes  art thou come so soon said fingal daughter of generous toscar sadness dwells in the halls of lutha my aged son ossian who had a great friendship for malvina both on account of her love for his son oscar and her attention to his own poems is sad i hear the breeze of cona that was wont to lift thy heavy locks it comes to the hall but thou art not there its voice is mournful among the arms of thy fathers go with thy rustling wing o breeze and sigh on malvinas tomb it rises yonder beneath the rock at the blue stream of lutha the maids that is the young virgins who sung the funeral clegy over her tomb are departed to their place and thou alone o breez mournest there  but who comes from the dusky west supported on a cloud a smile is on his gray watery face his locks of mist fly on the wind he bends forward on his airy spear it is thy father malvina why shinest thou so soon on our clouds he says o lovely light of lutha  but thou were sad my daughter for thy friends were passed away the sons of little men ossian by way of disrespect calls those who succeeded the heroes whose actions he celebrates the sons of little men tradition is entirely silent concerning what passed in the north immediately after the death of fingal and all his heroes but it appears from that term of ignominy just mentioned that the actions of their successors were not to be compared to those of the renowned fingalians were in the hall and none remained of the heroes but ossian king of spears  and do thou remember ossian carborne toscar toscar was the son of that conloch who was also father to the lady whose unfortunate death is related in the last episode of the second book of fingal son of conloch the battles of our youth were many our swords went together to the field they saw us coming like two falling rocks and the sons of the stranger fled there come the warriors of cona they said their steps are in the paths of the vanquished  draw near son of alpin to the song of the aged the actions of other times are in my soul my memory beams on the days that are past on the days of the mighty toscar when our path was in the deep draw near son of alpin to the last sound ossian seems to intimate by this expression that this poem was the last of his composition so that there is some foundation for the traditional title of the last hymn of ossian of the voice of cona  the king of morven commanded and i raised my sails to the wind toscar chief of lutha stood at my side as i rose on the darkblue wave our course was to seasurrounded berrathon barrathon a promontory in the midst of waves the poet gives it the epithet of seasurrounded to prevent its being taken for a peninsula in the literal sense  the isle of many storms there dwelt with his locks of age the stately strength of larthmor larthmor who spread the feast of shells to comhals mighty son when he went to starnos halls in the days of agandecca but when the chief was old the pride of his son arose the pride of fairhaired uthal the love of a thousand maids he bound the aged larthmor and dwelt in his sounding halls  long pined the king in his cave beside his rolling sea day did not come to his dwelling nor the burning oak by night but the wind of ocean was there and the parting beam of the moon the red star looked on the king when it trembled on the western wave snitho came to selmas hall snitho companion of larthmors youth he told of the king of berrathon the wrath of fingal rose thrice he assumed the spear resolved to stretch his hand to uthal but the memory the meaning of the poet is that fingal remembered his own great actions and consequently would not fully them by engaging in a petty war against uthal who was so far his inferior in valor and power of his actions rose before the king and he sent his son and toscar our joy was great on the rolling sea and we often halfunsheathed our swords the impatience of a young warrior going on their first expedition is well marked by their halfdrawing their swords the modesty of ossian in his narration of a story which does him so much honor is remarkable and his humanity to ninathoma would grace a hero of our own polished age though ossian passes over his own actions in silence or slightly mentions them tradition has done ample justice to his martial fame and perhaps has exaggerated the actions of the poet beyond the bounds of credibility  for never before had we fought alone in the battles of the spear night came down on the ocean the winds departed on their wings cold and pale is the moon the red stars lift their heads our course is slow along the coast of berrathon the white waves tumble on the rocks  what voice is that said toscar which comes between the sounds of the waves it is soft but mournsul like the voice of departed bards but i behold the maid ninathoma the daughter of torthoma who had been confined to a desert island by her lover uthal  she sits on the rock alone her head bends on her arm of snow her dark hair is in the wind hear son of fingal her song it is smooth as the gliding waters of lavath  we came to the silent bay and heard the maid of night  how long will ye roll around me bluetumbling waters of ocean my dwelling was not always in caves nor beneath the whistling tree the feast was spread in torthomas hall my father delighted in my voice the youths beheld me in the steps of my loveliness and they blessed the darkhaired ninathoma it was then thou did come o uthal like the sun of heaven the souls of the virgins are thine son of generous larthmor but why do thou leave me alone in the midst of roaring waters was my soul dark with thy death did my white hand lift the sword why then have thou left me alone king of high finthormo finthormo the palace of uthal the names in this episode are not of a celtic original which makes it probable that ossian sounds his poem on a true story   the tear started from my eye when i heard the voice of the maid i stood before her in my arms and spoke the words of peace  lovely dweller of the cave what sigh is in that breast shall ossian lift his sword in thy presence the destruction of thy foes  daughter of torthoma rise i have heard the words of thy grief the race of morven are around thee who never injured the weak come to our darkbosomed ship thou brighter than that setting moon our course is to the rocky berrathon to the ecchoing walls of finthormo  she came in her beauty she came with all her lovely steps silent joy brightened in her face as when the shadows fly from the field of spring the bluestream is rolling in brightness and the green bush bends over its course  the morning rose with its beams we came to rothmas bay a boar rushed from the wood my spear pierced his side i rejoiced over the blood ossian thought that his killing the boar on his first landing in berrathon was a good omen of his future success in that island the present highlanders look with a degree of superstition upon the success of their first action after they have engaged in any desperate undertaking  and foresaw my growing fame  but now the sound of uthals train came from the high finthormo they spread over the heath to the chance of the boar himself comes slowly on in the pride of his strength he lifts two pointed spears on his side is the heros sword three youths carry his polished bows the bounding of five dogs is before him his heroes move on at a distance admiring the steps of the king stately was the son of larthmor but his soul was dark dark as the troubled face of the moon when it foretells the storms  we rose on the heath before the king he stopped in the midst of his course his heroes gathered around and a grayhaired bard advanced whence are the sons of the strangers begun the bard of the song the children of the unhappy come to berrathon to the sword of carborne uthal he spreads no feast in his hall the blood of strangers is on his streams if from selmas walls ye come from the mossy walls of fingal choose three youths to go to your king to tell of the fall of his people perhaps the hero may come and pour his blood on uthals sword so shall the fame of finthormo arise like the growing tree of the vale  never will it rise o bard i said in the pride of my wrath he would shrink in the presence of fingal whose eyes are the flames of death the son of comhal comes and the kings vanish in his presence they are rolled together like mist by the breath of his rage shall three tell to fingal that his people fell yes  they may tell it bard but his people shall fall with fame  i stood in the darkness of my strength toscar drew his sword at my side the foe came on like a stream the mingled sound of death arose man took man shield met shield steel mixed its beams with steel  darts hiss through air spears ring on mails and swords on broken bucklers bound as the noise of an aged grove beneath the roaring wind when a thousand ghosts break the trees by night such was the din of arms  but uthal fell beneath my sword and the sons of berrathon fled  it was then i saw him in his beauty and the tear hung in my eye thou art fallen to mourn over the fall of their enemies was a practice universal among ossians heroes this is more agreeable to humanity than the shameful insulting of the dead so common in homer and after him servilely copied by all his imitators the humane virgil not excepted who have been more successful in borrowing the imperfections of that great poet than in their imitations of his beauties homer it is probable gave the manners of the times in which he wrote not his own sentiments ossian also seems to keep to the sentiments of his heroes the reverence which the most barbarous highlanders have still for the remains of the deceased seems to have descended to them from their most remote ancestors  young tree i said with all thy beauty round thee thou art fallen on thy plains and the field is bare the winds come from the desert and there is no sound in thy leaves lovely art thou in death son of carborne larthmor  ninathoma sat on the shore and heard the sound of battle she turned her red eyes on lethmal the grayhaired bard of selma for he had remained on the coast with the daughter of torthoma son of the times of old she said i hear the noise of death thy friends have met with uthal and the chief is low o that i had remained on the rock enclosed with the tumbling waves then would my soul be sad but his death would not reach my ear art thou fallen on thy heath o son of high finthormo thou did leave me on a rock but my soul was full of thee son of high finthormo art thou fallen on thy heath  she rose pale in her tears and saw the bloody shield of uthal she saw it in ossians hand her steps were distracted on the heath she flew she found him she fell her soul came forth in a sigh her hair is spread on his face my bursting tears descend a tomb arose on the unhappy and my song was heard  rest hapless children of youth and the noise of that mossy stream the virgins will see your tomb at the chase and turn away their weeping eyes your fame will be in the song the voice of the harp will be heard in your praise the daughters of selma shall hear it and your renown shall be in other lands  rest children of youth at the noise of the mossy stream  two days we remained on the coast the heroes of berrathon convened we brought larthmor to his halls the feast of shells is spread  the joy of the aged was great he looked to the arms of his fathers the arms which he left in his hall when the pride of uthal arose  we were renowned before larthmor and he blessed the chiefs of morven but he knew not that his son was low the stately strength of uthal they had told that he had retired to the woods with the tears of grief they had told it but he was silent in the tomb of rothmas heath  on the fourth day we raised our sails to the roar of the northern wind larthmor came to the coast and his bards raised the song the joy of the king was great he looked to rothmas gloomy heath he saw the tomb of his son and the memory of uthal rose  who of my heroes he said lies there he seems to have been of the kings of spears was he renowned in my halls before the pride of uthal rose  ye are silent ye sons of berrathon is the king of heroes low  my heart melts for thee o uthal though thy hand was against thy father  o that i had remained in the cave that my son had dwelt in finthormo  i might have heard the tread of his feet when he went to the chase of the boar  i might have heard his voice on the blast of my cave then would my soul be glad but now darkness dwells in my halls  such were my deeds son of alpin when the arm of my youth was strong such were ossian speaks the actions of toscar the carborne son of conloch but toscar is on his flying cloud and i am alone at lutha my voice is like the last sound of the wind when it forsakes the woods but ossian shall not be long alone he sees the mist that shall receive his ghost he beholds the mist that shall sorm his robe when he appears on his hills the sons of little men shall behold me and admire the stature of the chiefs of old they shall creep to their caves and look to the sky with fear for my steps shall be in the clouds and darkness shall roll on my side  lead son of alpin lead the aged to his woods the winds begin to rise the dark wave of the lake resounds bends there not a tree from mora with its branches bare it bends son of alpin in the rustling blast my harp hangs on a blasted branch the sound of its strings is mournful  does the wind touch thee o harp or is it some passing ghost  it is the hand of malvina but bring me the harp son of alpin another song shall rise my soul shall depart in the sound my fathers shall hear it in their airy hall  their dim faces shall hang with joy from their clouds and their hands receive their son  here begins the lyric piece with which tradition says ossian concluded his poems  it is set to music and still sung in the north with a great deal of wild simplicity but little variety of sound the aged oak bends over the stream it sighs with all its moss the withered fern whistles near and mixes as it waves with ossians hair  strike the harp and raise the song be near with all your wings ye winds bear the mournful sound away to fingals airy hall bear it to fingals hall that he may hear the voice of his son the voice of him that praised the mighty  the blast of north opens thy gates o king and i behold thee sitting on mist dimly gleaming in all thine arms thy form now is not the terror of the valiant but like a watery cloud when we see the stars behind it with their weeping eyes thy shield is like the aged moon thy sword a vapor halfkindled with fire dim and feeble is the chief who traveled in brightness before   but thy steps this magnificent description of the power of fingal over the winds and storms and the image of his taking the sun and hiding him in the clouds do not correspond with the preceding paragraph where he is represented as a feeble ghost and no more the terror of the valiant but it agrees with the notion of the times concerning the souls of the deceased who it was supposed had the command of the winds and storms but tock no concern in the affairs of men  it was the immoderate praise bestowed by the poets on their departed friends that gave the first hint to superstition to deify the deceased heroes and those new divinities owed all their attributes to the fancy of the bard who sung their elegies  we do not find that the praises of fingal had this effect upon his countrymen but that is to be imputed to the idea they had of power which they always connected with bodily strength and personal valor both which were dissolved by death   are on the winds of the desert and the storms darken in thy hand thou take the sun in thy wrath and hidest him in thy clouds the sons of little men are afraid and a thousand showers descend   but when thou come forth in thy mildness the gale of the morning is near thy course the sun laughs in his blue fields and the gray stream winds in its valley  the bushes shake their green heads in the wind the roes bound toward the desert  but there is a murmur in the heath the stormy winds abate i hear the voice of fingal long has it been absent from mine ear  come ossian come away he says fingal has received his fame we passed away like flames that had shone for a season our departure was in renown though the plains of our battles are dark and silent our fame is in the four gray stones the voice of ossian has been heard and the harp was strung in selma  come ossian come away he says and fly with thy fathers on clouds  and come i will thou king of men the life of ossian fails i begin to vanish on cona and my steps are not seen in selma beside the stone of mora i shall fall asleep the winds whistling in my gray hair shall not waken me  depart on thy wings o wind thou can not disturb the rest of the bard the night is long but his eyes are heavy depart thou rustling blast  but why art thou sad son of fingal why grows the cloud of thy soul the chiefs of other times are departed they have gone without their fame the sons of future years shall pass away and another race arise the people are like the waves of ocean like the leaves the same thought may be found almost in the same words in homer vi         mr pope falls short of his original in particular he has omitted altogether the beautiful image of the wind strewing the withered leaves on the ground like leaves on trees the race of men are sound now green in youth now withering on the ground another race the following spring supplies they fall successive and successive rise pope   of woody morven they pass away in the rustling blast and other leaves lift their green heads   did thy beauty last o ryno ryno the son of fingal who was killed in ireland in the war against swaran fing b   was remarkable for the beauty of his person his swiftness and great exploits minvane the daughter of morni and sister to gaul so often mentioned in ossians compositions was in love with ryno  her lamentation over her lover is introduced as an episode in one of ossians great poems the lamentation is the only part of the poem now extant and as it has some poetical merit i have subjoined it to this note the poet represents minvane as seeing from one of the rocks of morven the fleet of fingal returning from ireland she blushing sad from morvens rocks bends over the darklyrolling sea she saw the youths in all their arms  where ryno where art thou  our dark looks told that he was low  that pale the hero flew on clouds that in the grass of morvens hills his feeble voice was heard in wind  and is the son of fingal fallen on ullins mossy plains strong was the arm that conquered him  ah me i am alone  alone i will not be ye winds that lift my darkbrown hair my sighs will not long mix with your stream for i must sleep with ryno  i see thee not with beautys steps returning from the chase  the night is round minavens love and silence dwells with ryno  where are thy dogs and where thy bow thy shield that was so strong thy sword like heavens descending fire the bloody spear of ryno  i see them mixed in thy ship i see them stained with blood  no arms are in thy narrow hall o darklydwelling ryno  when will the morning come and say arise thou king of spears arise the hunters are abroad the hinds are near thee ryno  away thou fairhaired morning away the slumbering king hears thee not the hinds bound over his narrow tomb for death dwells round young ryno  but i will tread softly my king and steal to the bed of thy repose minvane will lie in silence near her slumbering ryno  the maids shall seek me but they shall not find me they shall follow my departure with songs but i will not hear you o maids i sleep with fairhaired ryno    stood the strength of carborne oscar fingal himself passed away and the halls of his fathers forgot his steps  and shall thou remain aged bard when the mighty have failed  but my fame shall remain and grow like the oak of morven which lifts its broad head to the storm and rejoices in the course of the wind  finis
