georges hill a poem if lofty hills the tuneful muse delight ye tuneful muses hither take your flight forsake parnassus and your virgin spring and soar where caesars eagles spread their wing when mad ambition fired the warriors brain to seek new conquests over the british main what though few laurels on the mountains grow a thousand fruitful landscapes smile below where phoebus trees perpetual honors wear and cedars flourish verdant all the year rich pasture here adorns the flowery mead there golden ceres waves her bending head a mingled scene of profit and delight which chears the peasant charms the poets sight his sight which over the various prospect roves now pleased with gardens and now pleased with groves now wanders over guilfords lovely plain where the fleet courser stretches every vein he paws he pants impatient for the chase then sweeps along the scarcelybending grass not swifter swallows skim along the flood to seize the wanton fly their destined food than over the plain the nimble coursers bound and champ the shining bit and toss their foam around let lofty pindar sing the grecian steed britannia glories in as choice a breed as gallant heroes too adorn her coast as famed olympias plain could ever boast thy groves o weston next the muse invite thy beechen groves must every muse delight here may she tune her lyre beneath the shade or meditate along thy

stores have plenteously enriched the farmers floors soon as aurora ushers in the day while pearly dews embellish every spray the wellbreathed beagles snuff the scented air before them swiftly flies the timorous hare over hills and vales the sprightly coursers bound while varioussounding music floats around the joyous youth pursue the noble chase fresh health and vigor blooming in their face unknown to those who drink the night away and waste in dozing idleness the day as over the checkered landscape fancy strays nature a thousand sylvan scenes displays plantations rise  the hills and valleys smile with various groves that suit the various soil dry rising ground the spreading beech improves wet spungy earth the weeping willow loves in vales the stately elms delight to grow and pines rejoice upon the mountains brow so should the parent with judicious care if tender youth with plants we may compare explore the temper of his childrens mind and six them where their genius seems

pleasing prospect grace the naiads and the dryads often embrace see through the groves descend the winding streams to pay their liquid tribute to the thames first chalky wey for ravenous pikes renowned rolls through the meads and fructifies the ground his milky waves enrich the thirsty soil and joyous crops reward the mowers toil next gentle mole through shady valleys strays and under

the sordid passion moved her to explore hills valleys rocks and caves for glittering ore and as she over the surry mountains roved pan saw the beauteous dame he saw and loved in tender verse he fung his pleasing pains and tuned his oaten pipe to amorous strains ten thousand fleecy flocks he cried are mine indulge my flame my fleecy flocks are thine in vain he strives her cruel breast to move she scorns alike his music and his love next old sylvanus left his sacred wood and smitten with her charms the nymph pursued return my passion lovely maid he cried nor scorn the forests where the gods reside in vain he strives her cruel breast to move she scorns alike his forests and his love apollo next advancing to the dame in tuneful numbers told his amorous flame long sung the god and long the listening maid was pleased to hear the courtship phoebus paid till grasping eager to enjoy her charms she swiftly turned and glided from his arms when from a cave a dusky gnome arose and various rocks of gold and dimond shows and here says he delight your eyes behold these flaming jewels this attractive gold ten thousand treasures in my palace shine love me ten thousand treasures shall be thine so saying down the cave he shot in haste the yielding damsel followed him as fast then quickly sunk into his longing arms and in a golden grot resigned her charms apollo to revenge his slighted flame into a sullen stream converts the dame and since she durst despise the god of day the god deprived her of his cheerful ray condemned her justly under ground to flow and visit mines of glittering dirt below it is hence her lazy waves impurely glide till thames refines them in his crystal tide thames on whose banks a stately hampton court which was first built by cardinal wolsey enlarged by k henry the  th and nobly finished by k william the  d frame appears finished by glorious williams generous cares the stern imperious monarch of our isle elizas sire enlarged the noble pile and made it wear a more majestic face yet still it wanted symmetry and grace till william formed the spacious courts complete bade strength and order use and beauty meet and raised the fabric uniformly great by equal steps our church and state improved twas henry first the papal yoke removed but government religion and the law were settled by the wisdom of nassau for this he bravely crossed the stormy main whilst adverse winds and waves opposed in vain when kings deceived with dreams of right divine had stretched their power beyond its true design when laws and liberty expiring lay and britain mourned an arbitrary sway great william born to succor human race reformed our government and fixed it is base restored our laws made freedom smile again and to confirm them bade augustus reign over twitnam bowers i next direct my sight where nature art and elegance unite three graces which on radnors will attend to deck the mansion of their noble friend from hence a lofty richmond hill hill attracts my eyes round which a thousand various beauties rise yet though it can such various beauties boast extensive bounty dignifies it most rise muse and catch a spark of heavenly flame to celebrate the generous richmond mrs knipe of richmond whose truly christian virtues and extensive charities should i describe particularly the note would  longer than the poem dame who modish pleasures bravely has withstood and dares be most unfashionably good who feeds the hungry succors the distressed is daily blessing others daily blessed nor to their bodies is her care confined her care with christian knowledge forms the mind her pious religious books which this lady sends to america treasures reach remotest lands new worlds are blessed with bounties from her hands o would the deathless muse my tongue inspire or phoebus warm me with celestial fire to sing her virtues and record her praise her fame should live immortal in my lays the man of rosss celebrated name should yield in honor to the richmond dame not far remote appear the richmond gardens verdant scenes the groves which once imbowrd the best of queens whose bounty raised the meanest muses wing and bade the poorest bard rejoice and sing while flocks in vernal pastures shall delight while sun and moon divide the day and night while memory holds her traces in the brain my grateful heart her goodness shall retain muse quit the subject nor renew the tide of tears that flowed when carolina died then wept the willows sighed the conscious bowers then drooped the myrtles and decayed the flowers again the flowers a blooming aspect wear is she returned or is augusta here yes here augusta with her children roves a widowed venus with her little loves who round their mother fondly sport and toy their mother smiles rejoicing in their joy here could the grateful muse contemplate long but other subjects claim the muses song windsor that winged the nervous denhams flight adorned with lofty towers attracts the sight where strength and dignity and beauty meet gracefully bold majestically sweet thy forests windsor equal praises claim and now shall flourish in immortal fame since george has thither sent his martial son to plant the laurels which his valor won when on cullodens field he bravely stood mid storms of fire and deluges of blood pouring his fathers thunder on his foes to rescue albion from impending woes but now rebellious wars and tumults cease he cultivates the milder arts of peace embellishes the hills with waving woods and through the valley leads expansive floods or bids the stately belvidere ascend or wondrous arches over the water bend subdues the rude rough wildness of the soil adorns the waste with groves and bids the desert smile thrice happy had it been for human kind had caesar thus employed his martial mind had he like glorious cumberland subdued his countrys foes then peaceful arts pursued his hostile eagles never had stretched their wings to ravage albion and dethrone her kings nor had the druids mourned their groves when round this hill he formed his military mound as thoughts like these revolved within my breast intruding sleep my weary eyes oppressed yet mimic fancy still pursued her theme and painted caesar present in my dream my dream the faithful muse remembers well and what the muse remembers she shall tell as round this hill the roman army lay the neighboring vale became their destined prey to feed them fruitful fields their harvests lend to fence their camp the lofty woods descend but while the legions felled a sacred oak thus to the chief a captive druid spoke illustrious robber when shall ruin cease thou enemy to property and peace is it not sufficient that your eagles soar from asias empire to iberias shore but must you shake our island with alarms must britain too submit to roman arms must all our crops be ravished from the land must all our forests fall beneath your hand yet though they fall by thy ambitious crimes again restored they rise in future times  i see those future times  i see with joy those who can faster plant than thou destroy thy camp where now embattled legions shine shall bear the spreading beech and towering pine roll swift ye years  produce the men of taste to crown with verdant woods the barren waste and lo they come  i see the sylvan swains whose shady groves shall decorate the plains and owe their beauty many ages hence to natures children hamilton and spence spence shall in natures choicest mould be cast of manners gentle elegant of taste in whom the passions shall so sweetly blend he never shall make a foe or lose a friend judicious learned and sincere of heart skilled in the poets and the planters art whose care and culture shall rejoice the soil and make the gloomy marshes round him smile what pleasure shall he feel to form his grove to plant new beauties and the old improve to open vistas to the circling hill or wind about his mount the pleasing rill or shape the rounding walk that gently bends encompassing his alluding to a field of mr spences which he calls the field of friendship  field of happy friends where often he shall employ his virtuous mind contriving how to serve or mend mankind prescient of future times my mental eyes see heroes statesmen peers and patriots rise who round thy camp shall noble structures raise and plant the paradise of latter days when george the if any person should be displeased with the word honest and think it too common and vulgar an epithet for the best of monarchs i would beg the favor of him to read over the following passage which i have quoted from a french prelates sermon preached before the parliament of normandy and which is perhaps the boldest if not the best performance of the kind that has been published in france for some years  after the good bp of lizieux bishop had been commending the french monarch he says let us at the same time do justice to our neighbor king let us speak of him as a king of wisdom and mercy  let us style him george the honest for if the general voice of sensible men and the voice of the representatives of a sensible people are to be credited he likewise merits that title a title revered by the greatest mr pope poet of his realm who truly says an honest mans the noblest work of god honest shall the realm command when york shall sit the themis of the land an honored briton hamilton his name shall nobly beautify that silent stream whose curious nymphs shall leave their native floods to the river mole not only runs close by mr hamiltons gardens but by the means of an excellent engine of his own invention is conveyed into them visit and admire his stately woods delighted to survey the checkered scene of flowery lawns and groves for ever green and vineyards pregnant with the generous bowl to cheer the drooping heart and warm the frozen soul time shall produce a valiant ligonier whom kings shall love and enemies shall fear a glorious chief nor caesar would disdain had fate allowed to meet him on the plain i see him calmly bold humanely brave expert to conquer generous to save intrepid when the martial trumpets sound content in peace to ornament the ground to plant his woods to spread the lawn or lead the docile river round his flowery mead to open prospects from the mount above or walks below meandring through his grove such rural arts the hero shall engage arts nobler far than wars destructive rage cornwall shall cultivate the plain below and make the lazy currents swifter flow hence to the poor his bounty shall be spread the naked shall be clothed the hungry fed that spacious field newcastle shall adorn and plenty over it pour her copious horn hesperian fables are but types to show what golden fruits shall in his garden grow in vision now the whitened turrets rear their heads and shine conspicuous from afar shade above shade the lofty woods ascend below the lofty woods the lawns extend lawns open ample free as if designed an emblem of the liberal masters mind while verdant groves around the whole unite at once affording shelter and delight but see his brotherpilot of the state anxious to steer the bark of britains fate upon the banks of mole his mansion stands obedient nature aiding his commands the rising hills adorned with waving woods the sloping vales with flocks with fish the floods a sweet variety with graceful ease contrived at once to profit and to please  here sighed the sage as though his pensive breast labored with sorrows not to be expressed then thus  uncertain state of humankind how short the pleasures that employ their mind too soon must pelham leave his beauteous scenes behind and yet if prayers could move celestial powers he longer should enjoy his esher bowers  but prayers are vain in vain his children dear and duteous wife shall pour the tender tear in vain britannia would prolong his breath her honest faithful statesman yields to death yet death adds luster to his virtuous fame as darkness gives the stars a brighter flame beneath thy camp in distant times a mr frederick swain with vivid greens shall plant the russet plain the russet plain shall variegate the scenes and add new beauties to the vivid greens while gazing shepherds walk delighted by charmed with the contrast grateful to their eye near him a noble the earl of middlesex bard his woods shall raise and in their shades tune sweet his amorous lays loves tender strains his bosom shall inspire and animate his song with dorsets fire portmore shall form another cyprian grove where other lovely venuses shall rove shall beautify the banks of silver thames and through his meadows call the winding streams the rivergods obedient to his will shall through his garden roll the crystal rill lavd with their urns the branching pines shall rise and tall majestic cedars climb the skies a farm shall turn a tempe of delight while gazing naiads wonder at the sight but who is he approaching through the shades whom handmaid art attends and nature leads this shall be southcote  eminently skilled to fix the rule of taste in woburn field i see his losty oaks advance their heads i see the slope rejoice beneath their shades the temple that adorns the rising brow the lovely lawnembracing stream below that gently winds and smoothly lingering moves unwilling to forsake the blissful groves the terrace where the branching pines arise where opening prospects suddenly surprise the soft acacias with their varied green diffusing shades around the sylvan scene acanthus jessamine and blushing rose a blooming beauteous wilderness compose while fragrant flowers embroider all the ground embellishing the walks and breathing odors round  what noble prospects open to my sight stupendous objects striking with delight see deckers arch magnificently bend decker the publics voluntary friend how opposite the motives of your mind it is thine to ruin his to serve mankind not far remote a venerable sage woodford the silvered ornament of age shall fix his seat in natures artless bowers and there improve his philosophic hours till hoary time shall end his studious days in peaceful honor dignity and ease what cannot art and human toil produce converting useless things to public use a the new river made navigable from weybridge to guilford river over that barren heath shall flow and vessels swim where pointed thistles grow upon the pleasing borders of the flood i see a rising hospitable wood where glades shall open verdant lawns extend and northern pines to kiss the elouds ascend where birds and beasts at liberty shall rove and future ages call it cotes grove where wanton fawns shall skip and timorous hares shall feed securely and forget their fears but ah their fears return  who gave them food pursues them through the field and echoing wood to hunt the puny prey his bosom glows the only cruel joy his bosom knows  here paused the druid for his heaving breast now swelled with scenes superior to the rest then thus again  what noble prospects rise what majesty and beauty strike my eyes the grand and amiable together meet the awful terrace and the happy seat the slope descending to the plain below where gently winding waters calmly flow till lost in shades the broad extensive streams look like a bending bay of silver thames here natures boldest beauties are designed  fly swistly time  let lincoln bless mankind he comes humanely generous and polite in whom the courtier patron friend unite blessed with a consort gracefully serene who walks a goddess over the vendant scene  waked with the pleasing sound of lincolns name i felt my bosom glow with grateful flame for after many storms and tempests past he brought me to this quiet port at last my fondest wish was such a rural scene the sages prayer was such a golden mean above pale povertys dejected state below the storms which often wreck the great remote from giddy crowds and noisy strife yet near the few whose converse sweetens life here let me live  be mindful of my end adore my maker and enjoy my friend that friend to whom  officious muse forbear nor with distasteful numbers wound his ear his ear too delicate to hear the lay his virtues claim and gratitude would pay finis
