sober advice from horace to the young gentlemen about town  as delivered in his second sermon  imitated in the manner of mr pope  together with the original text as  by the revd r bentley doctor of divinity and some remarks on the version  london printed for t boreman at the cock on ludgate hill and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster price one shilling  to alexander pope esquire sir i have so great a trust in your indulgence toward me as to believe you cannot but patronize this imitation so much in your own manner and whose birth i may truly say is owing to you in that confidence i would not suppress the criticisms made upon it by the reverend doctor the rather since he has promised to mend the faults in the next edition with the same goodness he has practiced to milton i hope you will believe that while i express my regard for you it is only out of modesty i conceal my name since though perhaps i may not profess myself your admirer so much as some others i cannot but be with as much inward respect good will and zeal as any man  dear sir your most affectionate and faithful servant  q horatii flacci sermo ii l i textum recensuit v r ricardus bentleius stp
