elements of criticism  volume iii  edinburgh printed for a millar london and a kincaid and j bell edinburgh mdcclxii  elements of criticism chap xix comparisons comparisons as observed above chap    serve two different purposes when addressed to the understanding their purpose is to instruct when to the heart their purpose is to give pleasure with respect to the latter a comparison may be employed to produce various pleasures by different means first by suggesting some unusual resemblance or contrast second by setting an object in the strongest light third by associating an object with others that are agreeable fourth by elevating an object and fifth by depressing it and that comparisons may produce various pleasures by these different means appears from what is said in the chapter above cited and will be made still more evident by examples which shall be given after premising some general observations  an object of one sense cannot be compared to an object of another for such objects are totally separated from each other and have no circumstance in common to admit either resemblance or contrast objects of hearing may be compared as also of taste and of touch but the chief fund of comparison are objects of sight because in writing or speaking things can only be compared in idea and the ideas of visible objects are by far more lively than those of any other sense  it has no good effect to compare things by way of simile that are of the same kind nor to contrast things of different kinds the reason is given in the chapter cited above and the reason shall be illustrated by examples the first is a resemblance instituted betwixt two objects so nearly related as to make little or no impression this just rebuke inflamed the lycian crew they join they thicken and the assault renew unmoved thembodyd greeks their fury dare and fixed support the weight of all the war nor could the greeks repel the lycian powers nor the bold lycians force the grecian towers as on the confines of adjoining grounds two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds they tugg they sweat but neither gain nor yield one foot one inch of the contended field thus obstinate to death they fight they fall nor these can keep nor those can win the wall iliad xii  0  another from milton labors under the same defect speaking of the fallen angels searching for mines of gold a numerous brigade hastened as when bands of pioneers with spade and pickax armed forerun the royal camp to trench a field or cast a rampart   the next shall be of things contrasted that are of different kinds queen what is my richard both in shape and mind transformed and weak has bolingbroke deposed thine intellect has he been in thy heart the lion dying thrusts forth his paw and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage to be oerpowerd and will thou pupillike take thy correction mildly kiss the rod and fawn on rage with base humility  richard ii act   sc   this comparison has scarce any force a man and a lion are of different species and there is no such resemblance betwixt them in general as to produce any strong effect by contrasting particular attributes or circumstances  a third general observation is that abstract terms can never be the subject of comparison otherwise than by being personified shakespeare compares adversity to a toad and slander to the bite of a crocodile but in such comparisons these abstract terms must be imagined sensible beings  i now proceed to illustrate by particular instances the different means by which comparison can afford pleasure and in the order above established i shall begin with those instances that are agreeable by suggesting some unusual resemblance or contrast sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in her head  as you like it act   sc   gardener bolingbroke has seized the wasteful king what pity is it that he had not so trimmed and dressed his land as we this garden dress and wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees lest being over proud with sap and blood with too much riches it confound itself had he done so to great and growing men they might have lived to bear and he to taste their fruits of duty all superfluous branches we lop away that bearing boughs may live had he done so himself had borne the crown which waste and idle hours have quite thrown down  richard ii act   sc   see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmed like a yonker prancing to his love  second part henry vi act   sc   brutus o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again  julius caesar act   sc   thus they their doubtful consulations dark ended rejoicing in their matchless chief as when from mountaintops the dusky clouds ascending while the north wind sleeps overspread heavens cheerful face the lowering element scowls over the darkened landscape snow and shower if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his evningbeam the fields revive the birds their notes renew and bleating herds attest their joy that hill and valley rings paradise lost book    the last exertion of courage compared to the blaze of a lamp before extinguishing tasso gierusalem canto    st    as the bright stars and milky way showed by the night are hid by day so we in that accomplished mind helped by the night new graces find which by the splendour of her view dazzled before we never knew waller  none of the foregoing similes as it appears to me have the effect to add any luster to the principal subject and therefore the pleasure they afford must arise from suggesting resemblances that are not obvious i mean the chief pleasure for undoubtedly a beautiful subject introduced to form the simile affords a separate pleasure which is felt in the similes mentioned particularly in that cited from milton  the next effect of a comparison in the order mentioned is to place an object in a strong point of view which i think is done sensibly in the following similes as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads from side to side the trembling balance nods while some laborious matron just and poor with nice exactness weighs her woolly store till poised aloft the resting beam suspends each equal weight nor this nor that descends so stood the war till hectors matchless might with fates prevailing turned the scale of fight fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies and fires his host with loud repeated cries iliad b xii     ut flos in septis secretis nascitur hortis ignotus pecori nullo contusus aratro quem mulcent aurae firmat sol educat imber multi illum pueri multae cupiere

thee bolingbroke  duchess alas poor richard where rides he the while  york as in a theater the eyes of men after a wellgracd actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next thinking his prattle to be tedious even so or with much more contempt mens eyes did scowl on richard no man cried god save him no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home but dust was thrown upon his sacred head which with such gentle sorrow he shook off his face still combating with tears and smiles the badges of his grief and patience that had not god for some strong purpose steeled the hearts of men they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him  richard ii act   sc   northumberland how does my son and brother thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek is apter than thy tongue

fury of rinaldo subsiding when not opposed to that of wind or water when it has a free passage canto  0 st     as words convey but a faint and obscure notion of great numbers a poet to give a high notion of the object he describes with regard to number does well to compare it to what is familiar and commonly known thus homer book   l     compares the grecian army in point of number to a swarm of bees in another passage book   l     he compares it to that profusion of leaves and flowers which appear in the spring or of insects in a summers evening and milton  as when the potent rod of amrams son in egypts evil day waved round the coast up called a pitchy cloud of locusts warping on the eastern wind that over the realm of impious pharaoh hung like night and darkened all the land of nile so numberless were those bad angels seen hovering on wing under the cope of hell twixt upper nether and surrounding fires paradise lost book   such comparisons have by some writers see vidae poetic lib   l      been condemned for the lowness of the images introduced but surely without reason for with regard to numbers they put the principal subject in a strong light  the foregoing comparisons operate by resemblance others have the same effect by contrast york i am the last of noble edwards sons of whom thy father prince of wales was first in war was never lion raged more fierce in peace was never gentle lamb more mild than was that young and princely gentleman his face thou have for even so looked he accomplished with the number of thy hours but when he frowned it was against the french and not against his friends his noble hand did win what he did spend and spent not that which his triumphant fathers hand had won his hands were guilty of no kindreds blood but bloody with the enemies of his kin oh richard york is too far gone with grief or else he never would compare between  richard ii act   sc    milton has a peculiar talent in embellishing the principal subject by associating it with others that are agreeable which is the third end of a comparison similes of this kind have beside a separate effect they diversify the narration by new images that are not strictly necessary to the comparison they are short episodes which without distracting us from the principal subject afford great delight by their beauty and variety he scarce had ceased when the superior fiend was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield ethereal temper massy large and round behind him cast the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb through optic glass the tuscan artist views at evening from the top of fesole or in valdarno to descry new lands rivers or mountains in her spotty globe milton b    thus far these beyond compare of mortal prowess yet observed their dread commander he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower his form had yet not lost all her original brightness nor appeared less than archangel ruined and the excess of glory obscured as when the sun newrisen looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind the moon in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs milton b   as when a vulture on imaus bred whose snowy ridge the roving tartar bounds dislodging from a region scarce of prey to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs of ganges or hydaspes indian streams but in his way lights on the barren plains of sericana where chinese drive with sails and wind their cany wagons light so on this windy sea of land the fiend walked up and down alone bent on his prey milton b    yet higher than their tops the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung which to our general sire gave prospect large into this nether empire neighboring round and higher than that wall a circling row of goodliest trees laden with fairest fruit blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeared with gay enameled colors mixed on which the sun more glad impressed his beams than in fair evening cloud or humid bow when god has showrd the earth so lovely seemed that landscape and of pure now purer air meets his approach and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy able to drive all sadness but despair now gentle gales fanning their odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes and whisper whence they stole those balmy spoils as when to them who sail beyond the cape of hope and now are past mozambic off at sea northeast winds blow sabean odor from the spicy shore of arabie the blessed with such delay well pleased they slack their course and many a league cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles milton b   with regard to similes of this kind it will readily occur to the reader that when the resembling subject or circumstance is once properly introduced in a simile the mind passes easily to the new objects and is transitorily amused with them without feeling any disgust at the slight interruption thus in fine weather the momentary excursions of a traveller for agreeable prospects or sumptuous buildings cheer his mind relieve him from the langour of uniformity and without much lengthening his journey in reality shorten it greatly in appearance  next of comparisons that aggrandize or elevate these make stronger impressions than any other sort the reason of which may be gathered from the chapter of grandeur and sublimity and without reasoning will be evident from the following instances as when a flame the winding valley fills and runs on crackling shrubs between the hills then over the stubble up the mountain flies fires the high woods and blazes to the skies this way and that the spreading torrent roars so sweeps the hero through the wasted shores aroud him wide immense destruction pours and earth is deluged with the anguine showers iliad xx     through blood through death achilles still proceeds over slaughtered heroes and over rolling steeds as when avenging flames with fury driven on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven the pale inhabitants some fall some fly and the red vapors purple all the sky so raged achilles death and dire dismay and toils and terrors filled the dreadful day iliad xxi  0  methinks king richard and myself should meet with no less terror than the elements of fire and water when their thundering shock at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven  richard ii act   sc   i beg peculiar attention to the following simile for a reason that shall be mentioned thus breathing death in terrible array the closecompacted legions urged their way fierce they drove on impatient to destroy troy charged the first and hector first of troy as from some mountains craggy forehead torn a rocks round fragment flies with fury born which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends precipitate the ponderous mass descends from steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds at every shock the crackling wood resounds still gathering force it smoaks and urged amain whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain there stops  so hector their whole force he proved resistless when he raged and when he stopped unmoved iliad xiii     the image of a falling rock is certainly not elevating see chap    yet undoubtedly the foregoing image fires and swells the mind it is grand therefore if not sublime and that there is a real though delicate distinction betwixt these two feelings will be illustrated from the following simile so saying a noble stroke he lifted high which hung not but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan that no sight nor motion of swift thought less could his shield such ruin intercept ten paces huge he back recoiled the tenth on bended knee his massy spear upstaid as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat half sunk with all pines milton b    a comparison by contrast may contribute to grandeur or elevation not less than by resemblance of which the following comparison of lucan is a remarkable instance victrix causa diis placuit sed victa catoni considering that the heathen deities possessed a rank but one degree above that of mankind i think it scarce possible by a single expression to elevate or dignify more one of the human species than is done by this comparison i am sensible at the same time that such a comparison among christians who entertain juster notions of the deity would justly be reckoned extravagant and absurd  the last article mentioned is that of lessening or depressing a hated or disagreeable object which is effectually done by resembling it to any thing that is low or despicable thus milton in his description of the rout of the rebelangels happily expresses their terror and dismay in the following simile  as a herd of goats or timorous flock together thronged drove them before him thunderstruck pursued with terrors and with furies to the bounds and crystal wall of heaven which opening wide rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed into the wasteful deep the monstrous sight struck them with horror backward but far worse urged them behind headlong themselves they threw down from the verge of heaven milton b   in the same view homer i think may be defended in comparing the shouts of the trojans in battle to the noise of cranes beginning of book    and to the bleating of a flock of sheep book   l      and it is no objection that these are low images for by opposing the noisy march of the trojans to the silent and manly march of the greeks he certainly intended to lessen the former addison guardian no      imagining the figure that men make in the sight of a superior being takes opportunity to mortify their pride by comparing them to a swarm of pismires  a comparison that has none of the good effects mentioned in this discourse but is built upon common and trifling circumstances makes a mighty silly figure non sum nescius grandia consilia a multis plerumque causis ceu magna navigia a plurimis remis impelli strada de bello belgico   by this time i imagine the different purposes of comparison and the various impressions it makes on the mind are sufficiently illustrated by proper examples this was an easy work it is more difficult to lay down rules about the propriety or impropriety of comparisons in what circumstances they may be introduced and in what circumstances they are out of place it is evident that a comparison is not proper upon every occasion a man in his cool and sedate moments is not disposed to poetical flights nor to sacrifice truth and reality to the delusive operations of the imagination far less is he so disposed when oppressed with cares or interested in some important transaction that occupies him totally the region of comparison and of all figurative expression lies betwixt these two extremes it is observable that a man when elevated or animated by any passion is disposed to elevate or animate all his objects he avoids familiar names exalts objects by circumlocution and metaphor and gives even life and voluntary action to inanimate beings in this warmth of mind the highest poetical flights are indulged and the boldest similes and metaphors relished it is accordingly observed by longinus in his treatise of the sublime that the proper time for metaphor is when the passions are so swelled as to hurry on like a torrent  but without soaring so high the mind is frequently in a tone to relish chaste and moderate ornament such as comparisons that set the principal object in a strong point of view or that embellish and diversify the narration in general when by any animating passion whether pleasant or painful an impulse is given to the imagination we are in that condition wonderfully disposed to every sort of figurative expression and in particular to comparisons this in a great measure is evident from the comparisons already mentioned and shall be further illustrated by other examples love for example in its infancy rousing the imagination prompts the heart to display itself in figurative language and in similes troilus tell me apollo for thy daphnes love what cressid is what pandar and what we her bed is india there she lies a pearl between our ilium and where she resides let it be called the wild and wandering flood ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark  troilus and cressida act   sc   again come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night give me my romeo and when he shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world shall be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun  romeo and juliet act   sc   the dread of a misfortune however imminent involving always some doubt and uncertainty agitates the mind and excites the imagination wolsey  nay then farewell i have touched the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation in the evening and no man see me more  henry viii act   sc    but it will be a better illustration of the present head to give examples where comparisons are improperly introduced i have had already occasion to observe that similes are not the language of a man in his ordinary state of mind going about the common affairs of life for that reason the following speech of a gardener to his servants is extremely improper go bind thou up you dangling apricocks which like unruly children make their sire stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight give some supportance to the bending twigs go thou and like an executioner cut off the heads of toofastgrowing sprays that look too lofty in our commonwealth all must be even in our government  richara ii act   sc   the fertility of shakespeares vein betrays him frequently into this error there is the same impropriety in another simile of his hero good margaret run thee into the parlour there shall thou find my cousin beatrice whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun forbid the sun to enter like to favorites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it  much ado about nothing act   sc   rooted grief deep anguish terror remorse despair and all the severe dispiriting passions are declared enemies perhaps not to figurative language in general but undoubtedly to the pomp and solemnity of comparison upon this account the simile pronounced by young rutland under terror of death from an inveterate enemy and praying mercy is unnatural so looks the pentup lion over the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws and so he walks insulting over his prey and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword and not with such a cruel threatninglook  third part henry vi act   sc   nothing appears more out of place or more aukwardly introduced than the following simile lucia  farewell my portius farewell though death is in the word forever  portius stay lucia stay what do thou say forever  lucia have i not sworn if portius thy success must throw thy brother on his fate farewell oh how shall i repeat the word forever  portius thus over the dying lamp the unsteady flame hangs quivering on a point leaps off by fits and falls again as loath to quit its hold  thou must not go my soul still hovers over thee and cannot get loose  cato act   sc   nor does the simile which closes the first act of the same tragedy make its appearance with a much better grace the situation there represented being too dispiriting for a simile a simile is improper for one who dreads the discovery of a secret machination zara the mute not yet returned ha twas the king the king that parted hence frowning he went his eyes like meteors rolled then darted down their red and angry beams as if his sight would like the raging dog star scorch the earth and kindle ruin in its course  mourning bride act   sc   a man spent and dispirited after losing a battle is not disposed to heighten or illustrate his discourse by similes york with this we charged again but out alas we bodgd again as i have seen a swan with bootless labor swim against the tide and spend her strength with overmatching waves ah hark the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury the sands are numbered that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end  third part henry vi act   sc   far less is a man disposed to similes who is not only defeated in a pitched battle but lies at the point of death mortally wounded warwick  my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axs edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose topbranch overpeerd joves spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winters powerful wind  third part henry vi act   sc   queen katharine deserted by the king and in the deepest affliction upon her divorce could not be disposed to any sallies of imagination and for that reason the following simile however beautiful in the mouth of a spectator is scarce proper in her own i am the most unhappy woman living shipwrecked upon a kingdom where no pity no friends no hope no kindred weep for me almost no grave allowed me like the lily that once was mistress of the field and flourished i will hang my head and perish  king henry viii act   sc    similes thus unseasonably introduced are finely ridiculed in the rehearsal bays now here she must make a simile   smith where is the necessity of that mr bays   bays because she is surprised that is a general rule you must ever make a simile when you are surprised it is a new way of writing     a comparison is not always faultless even where it is properly introduced i have endeavored above to give a general view of the different ends to which a comparison may contribute a comparison like other human productions may fall short of its end and of this defect instances are not rare even among good writers to complete the present subject it will be necessary to make some observations upon such faulty comparisons i begin with observing that nothing can be more erroneous than to institute a comparison too faint a distant resemblance or contrast fatigues the mind with its obscurity instead of amusing it and tends not to fulfill any one end of a comparison the following similes seem to labor under this defect albus ut obscuro deterget nubila coelo saepe notus neque parturit imbres perpetuos sic tu sapiens finire memento tristitiam vitaeque labores molli plance mero horace carm l   ode    medio dux

pursued by hungerstarved wolves  third part henry vi act   sc   the latter of the two similes is good the former because of the faintness of the resemblance produces no good effect and crowds the narration with an useless image  the next error i shall mention is a capital one in an epic poem or in any elevated subject a writer ought to avoid raising a simile upon a low image which never fails to bring down the principal subject in general it is a rule that a grand object ought never to be resembled to one that is diminutive however delicate the resemblance may be it is the peculiar character of a grand object to fix the attention and swell the mind in this state it is disagreeable to contract the mind to a minute object however elegant the resembling an object to one that is greater has on the contrary a good effect by raising or swelling the mind one passes with satisfaction from a small to a great object but cannot be drawn down without reluctance from great to small hence the following similes are faulty meanwhile the troops beneath patroculus care invade the trojans and commence the war as wasps provoked by children in their play pour from their mansions by the

resembling image so elevated or great as to bear no proportion to the principal subject the remarkable disparity betwixt them being the most striking circumstance seizes the mind and never fails to depress the principal subject by contrast instead of raising it by resemblance and if the disparity be exceeding great the simile takes on an air of burlesque nothing being more ridiculous than to force an object out of its proper rank in nature by equalling it with one greatly superior or greatly inferior this will be evident from the following comparisons fervet opus redolentque thymo

carefully noted by ancient critics and grammarians tropes and figures have indeed been multiplied with so little reserve as to make it no easy matter to distinguish them from plain language a discovery almost accidental made me think of giving them a place in this work i found that the most important of them depend on principles formerly explained and i was glad of an opportunity to show the extensive influence of these principles confining myself therefore to figures that answer this purpose i am luckily freed from much trash without dropping so far as i remember any figure that merits a proper name and i begin with prosopopoeia or personification which is justy entitled to the first place  sect i personification this figure which gives life to things inanimate is so bold a delusion as to require one should imagine very peculiar circumstances for operating the effect and yet in the language of poetry we find variety of expressions which though commonly reduced to this figure are used without ceremony or any sort of preparation i give for example the following expressions thirsty ground hungry churchyard furious dart angry ocean the epithets here in their proper meaning are attributes of sensible beings what is the effect of such epithets when applied to things inanimate do they raise in the mind of the reader a perception of sensibility do they make him conceive the ground the churchyard the dart the ocean to be endued with animal functions this is a curious inquiry and whether so or not it cannot be declined in handling the present subject  one thing is certain that the mind is prone to bestow sensibility upon things inanimate where that violent effect is necessary to gratify passion this is one instance among many of the power of passion to adjust our opinions and belief to its gratification chap   part    i give the following examples antony mourning over the body of caesar murdered in the senate house vents his passion in the following words antony o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times  julius caesar act   sc   here antony must have been impressed with some sort of notion that the body of caesar was listening to him without which the speech would be foolish and absurd nor will it appear strange after what is said in the chapter above cited that passion should have such power over the mind of man another example of the same kind is where the earth as a common mother is animated to give refuge against a fathers unkindness almeria o earth behold i kneel upon thy bosom and bend my flowing eyes to stream upon thy face imploring thee that thou will yield open thy bowels of compassion take into thy womb the last and most forlorn of all thy race hear me thou common parent  i have no parent else  be thou a mother and step between me and the curse of him who was  who was but is no more a father but brands my innocence with horrid crimes and for the tender names of child and daughter now calls me murderer and parricide  mourning bride act   sc    plaintive passions are extremely solicitous for vent a soliloquy commonly answers the purpose but when a passion swells high it is not satisfied with so slight a gratification it must have a person to complain to and if none be found it will animate things devoid of sense thus philoctetes complains to the rocks and promontories of the isle of lemnos philoctetes of sophocles act   sc    and alcestes dying invokes the sun the light of day the clouds the earth her husbands palace etc alcestes of euripides act   sc    plaintive passions carry the mind still farther among the many principles that connect individuals in society one is remarkable it is that principle which makes us earnestly wish that others should enter into our concerns and think and feel as we do see this principle accounted for chap     this social principle

irish expedition in a mixture of joy and resentment  i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs as a long parted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favor with my royal hands feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavygaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i prythee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall faulter under foul rebellious arms  richard ii act   sc    among the ancients it was customary after a long voyage to salute the natal soil a long voyage was of old a greater enterprise than at present the safe return to ones country after much fatigue and danger was a circumstance extremely delightful and it was natural to give the natal soil a temporary life in order to sympathise with the traveller see an example agamemnon of aeschilus act   in the beginning regret for leaving a place one has been accustomed to has the same effect philoctetes of sophocles at the close   terror produces the same effect a man to gratify this passion extends it to every thing around even to things inanimate speaking of polyphemus clamorem immensum tollit quo pontus et omnes intremuere undae penitusque exterrita tellus italiae aeneid iii

transfers from the spectators their terror to the sea with which they were connected le flot qui lapporta recule epouvante  a man also naturally communicates his joy to all objects around animate or

they slack their course and many a league cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles paradise lost b    i have been profuse of examples to show what power many passions have to animate their objects in all the foregoing examples the personification if i mistake not is so complete as to be derived from an actual conviction momentary indeed of life and intelligence but it is evident from numberless instances that personification is not always so complete personification is a common figure in descriptive poetry understood to be the language of the writer and not of any of his personages in a fit of passion in this case it seldom or never comes up to a conviction even momentary of life and intelligence i give the following examples first in his east the glorious lamp was seen regent of day and all the horizon round invested with bright rays jocund to run his longitude through heavens high road the gray dawn and the pleiades before him danced shedding sweet influence less bright the moon but opposite in levelled west was set his mirror with full face borrowing her light from him for other light she needed none paradise lost b   l   0 the chastity of the english language which in common usage distinguishes by genders no words but what signify beings male and female gives thus a fine opportunity for the prosopopoeia a beauty unknown in other languages where every word is masculine or feminine nights candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountaintops  romeo and juliet act   sc   but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks over the dew of you high eastward hill  hamlet act   sc   it may i presume be taken for granted that in the foregoing instances the personification either with the poet or his reader amounts not to a conviction of intelligence nor that the sun the moon the day the morn are here understood to be sensible beings what then is the nature of this personification upon considering the matter attentively i discover that this species of personification must be referred to the imagination the inanimate object is imagined to be a sensible being but without any conviction even for a moment that it really is so ideas or fictions of imagination have power to raise emotions in the mind see appendix containing definitions and explanation of terms  and when any thing inanimate is in imagination supposed to be a sensible being it makes by that means a greater figure than when an idea is formed of it according to truth the elevation however in this case is far from being so great as when the personification arises to an actual conviction and therefore must be considered as of a lower or inferior sort thus personification is of two kinds the first or nobler may be termed passionate personification the other or more humble descriptive personification because seldom or never is personification in a description carried the length of conviction  the imagination is so lively and active that its images are raised with very little effort and this justifies the frequent use of descriptive personification this figure abounds in miltons allegro and penseroso  abstract and general terms as well as particular objects are often necessary in poetry such terms however are not well adapted to poetry because they suggest not any image to the mind i can readily form an image of alexander or achilles in wrath but i cannot form an image of wrath in the abstract or of wrath independent of a person upon that account in works addressed to the imagination abstract terms are frequently personified but this personification never goes farther than the imagination sed mihi vel tellus optem prius ima dehiscat vel pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras pallentes umbras erebi noctemque profundam ante pudor quam te violo aut tua jura resolvo aeneid   l    thus to explain the effects of slander it is imagined to be a voluntary agent  no it is slander whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath rides on the posting winds and does belie all corners of the world kings queens and states maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave this viperous slander enters  shakespeare cymbeline act   sc   as also human passions take the following example  for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision  troilus and cressida act   sc   virgil explains fame and its effects by a still greater variety of action aeneid iv      and shakespeare personifies death and its operations in a manner extremely fanciful  within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feared and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if his flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humored thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castlewalls and farewell king  richard ii act   sc   not less successfully is life and action given even to sleep k henry how many thousands of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep o gentle sleep natures soft nurse how have i frighted thee that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness why rather sleep lie thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching thee and hushed with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber than in the perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulled with sounds of sweetest melody o thou dull god why lie thou with the vile in loathsome beds and leave the kingly couch a watchcase to a common larumbell will thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the shipboys eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude imperious surge and in the visitation of the winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with deafning clamours in the slippery shrouds that with the hurly death itself awakes can thou o partial sleep give thy repose to the wet seaboy in an hour so rude and in the calmest and the stillest night with all appliances and means to boot deny it to a king then happy low lie down uneasy lies the head that wears a crown  second part henry iv act   sc   i shall add one example more to show that descriptive personification may be used with propriety even where the purpose of the discourse is instruction merely oh let the steps of youth be cautious how they advance into a dangerous world our duty only can conduct us safe our passions are seducers but of all the strongest love he first approaches us in childish play wantoning in our walks if heedlessly we wander after him as he will pick out all the dancing way we are lost and hardly to return again we should take warning he is painted blind to show us if we fondly follow him the precipices we may fall into therefore let virtue take him by the hand directed so he leads to certain joy southern  hitherto our progress has been upon firm ground whether we shall be so lucky in the remaining part of the journey seems doubtful for after acquiring some knowledge of the subject when we now look back to the expressions mentioned in the beginning thirsty ground furious dart and such like it seems as difficult as at first to say what sort of personification it is such expressions evidently raise not the slightest conviction of sensibility nor do i think they amount to descriptive personification in the expressions mentioned we do not so much as figure the ground or the dart to be animated and if so they cannot at all come under the present subject and to show this more clearly i shall endeavor to explain what effect such expressions have naturally upon the mind in the expression angry ocean for example do we not tacitly compare the ocean in a storm to a man in wrath it is by this tacit comparison that the expression acquires a force or elevation beyond what is found when an epithet is used proper to the object for i have had occasion to show chap     that a thing inanimate acquires a certain elevation by being compared to a sensible being and this very comparison is itself a demonstration that there is no personification in such expressions for by the very nature of a comparison the things compared are kept distinct and the native appearance of each is preserved it will be shown afterward that expressions of this kind belong to another figure which i term a figure of speech and which employs the seventh section of the present chapter  though thus in general we can precisely distinguish descriptive personification from what is merely a figure of speech it is however often difficult to say with respect to some expressions whether they are of the one kind or of the other take the following instances the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the trojan wall and sighed his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night  merchant of venice act   sc    i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds  julius caesar act   sc   jane shore my form alas has long forgot to please the scene of beauty and delight is changed no roses bloom upon my fading cheek no laughing graces wanton in my eyes but haggard grief leanlooking sallow care and pining discontent a rueful train dwell on my brow all hideous and forlorn  jane shore act   sc   with respect to these and numberless other instances of the same kind whether they be examples of personification or of a figure of speech merely seems to be an arbitrary question they will be ranged under the former class by those only who are endued with a sprightly imagination nor will the judgment even of the same person be steady it will vary with the present state of the spirits lively or composed  having thus at large explained the present figure its different kinds and the principles from whence derived what comes next in order is to ascertain its proper province by showing in what cases it is suitable in what unsuitable i begin with observing upon passionate personification that this figure is not promoted by every passion indifferently all dispiriting passions are averse to it remorse in particular is too serious and severe to be gratified by a phantom of the mind i cannot therefore approve the following speech of enobarbus who had deserted his master antony be witness to me o thou blessed moon when men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory poor enobarbus did before thy face repent  oh sovereign mistress of true melancholy the poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me that life a very rebel to my will may hang no longer on me  antony and cleopatra act   sc   if this can be justified it must be upon the heathen system of theology which converted into deities the sun moon and stars  secondly after a passionate personification is properly introduced it ought to be confined strictly to its proper province that of gratifying the passion and no sentiment nor action ought to be exerted by the animated object but what answers that purpose personification is at any rate a bold figure and ought to be employed with great reserve the passion of love for example in a plaintive tone may give a momentary life to woods and rocks that the lover may vent his distress to them but no passion will support a conviction so far stretched as that these woods and rocks should be living witnesses to report the distress to others chi tami piu de la mia vita se tu nol sai crudele chiedilo a queste selve che tel diranno et tel diran con esse le fere loro e i duri sterpi e i sassi di questi alpestri monti chi ho si spesse volte inteneriti al suon de miei iamenti  pastor fido act   sc   no lover who is not crazed will utter such a sentiment it is plainly the operation of the writer indulging his imagination without regard to nature the same observation is applicable to the following passage in winters tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid goodnight to quiet their grief tell them the lamentable fall of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds for why the senseless brands will sympathise the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out  richard ii act   sc   one must read this passage very seriously to avoid laughing the following passage is quite extravagant the different parts of the human body are too intimately connected with self to be personified by the power of any passion and after converting such a part into a sensible being it is still worse to make it be conceived as rising in rebellion against self cleopatra haste bare my arm and rouse the serpents fury coward flesh  would thou conspire with caesar to betray me as thou were none of mine i will force thee to it  dryden all for love act    next comes descriptive personification upon which i must observe in general that it ought to be cautiously used a personage in a tragedy agitated by a strong passion deals in strong sentiments and the reader catching fire by sympathy relishes the boldest personifications but a writer even in the most lively description ought to take a lower flight and content himself with such easy personifications as agree with the tone of mind inspired by the description in plain narrative again the mind serious and sedate rejects personification altogether strada in his history of the belgic wars has the following passage which by a strained elevation above the tone of the subject deviates into burlesk vix descenderat a praetoria navi caesar cum foeda illico exorta in portu tempestas classem impetu disjecit praetoriam hausit quasi non vecturam amplius caesarem caesarisque fortunam dec   l    neither do i approve in shakespeare the speech of king john gravely exhorting the citizens of angiers to a surrender though a tragic writer has much greater latitude than a historian take the following specimen of this speech the cannons have their bowels full of wrath and ready mounted are they to spit forth their ironindignation against your walls  act   sc    secondly if extraordinary marks of respect put upon a person of the lowest rank be ridiculous not less so is the personification of a mean object this rule chiefly regards descriptive personification for an object can hardly be mean that is the cause of a violent passion in that circumstance at least it must be an object of importance with respect to this point it would be in vain to set limits to personification taste is the only rule a poet of superior genius has more than others the command of this figure because he has more than others the power of inflaming the mind homer appears not extravagant in animating his darts and arrows nor thomson in animating the seasons the winds the rains the dews he even ventures to animate the diamond and does it with propriety  that polished bright and all its native luster let abroad dares as it sparkles on the fairones breast with vain ambition emulate her eyes but there are things familiar and base to which personification cannot descend in a composed state of mind to animate a lump of matter even in the most rapid flight of fancy degenerates into burlesk how now what noise that spirits possessed with haste that wounds the unresisting postern with these strokes  shakespeare measure for measure act   sc   the following little better  or from the shore the plovers when to scatter over the heath and sing their wild notes to the listening waste thomson spring l    speaking of a mans hand cut off in battle te decisa suum laride dextera quaerit semianimesque micant digiti ferrumque retractant aeneid x     the personification here of a hand is insufferable especially in a plain narration not to mention that such a trivial incident is too minutely described  the same observation is applicable to abstract terms which ought not to be animated unless they have some natural dignity thomson in this article is quite licentious witness the following instances out of many o vale of bliss o softly swelling hills on which the power of cultivation lies and joys to see the wonders of his toil summer l      then sated hunger bids his brother thirst produce the mighty bowl nor wanting is the brown october drawn mature and perfect from his dark retreat of thirty years and now his honest front flames in the light refulgent autumn l      thirdly it is not sufficient to avoid improper subjects some preparation is necessary in order to rouse the mind the imagination refuses its aid till it be warmed at least if not inflamed yet thomson without the least ceremony or preparation introduces each season as a sensible being from brightening fields of ether fair disclosed child of the sun refulgent summer comes in pride of youth and felt through natures depth he comes attended by the sultry hours and everfanning breezes on his way while from his ardent look the turning spring averts her blushful face and earth and skies allsmiling to his hot dominion leaves summer l   see winter comes to rule the varied year sullen and sad with all his rising train vapors and clouds and storms winter l   this has violently the air of writing mechanically without taste it is not natural that the imagination of a writer should be so much heated at the very commencement and at any rate he cannot expect such ductility in his readers but if this practice can be justified by authority thomson has one of no mean note vida begins his first eclogue in the following words dicite vos musae et juvenum memorate querelas dicite nam motas ipsas ad carmina cautes et requiesse suos perhibent vaga flumina cursus even shakespeare is not always careful to prepare the mind for this bold figure take the following instance  upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put off the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compelled by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among them  henry viii act   sc    fourthly descriptive personification ought never to be carried farther than barely to animate the subject and yet poets are not easily restrained from making this phantom of their own creating behave and act in every respect as if it were really a sensible being by such license we lose sight of the subject and the description is rendered obscure or unintelligible instead of being more lively and striking in this view the following passage describing cleopatra on shipboard appears to me exceptionable the barge she sat in like a burnished throne burnt on the water the poop was beaten gold purple the fails and so perfumed that the winds were love sick with em  antony and cleopatra act   sc   let the winds be personified i make no objection but to make them lovesick is too far stretched having no resemblance to any natural action of wind in another passage where cleopatra is also the subject the personification of the air is carried beyond all bounds  the city cast its people out upon her and antony enthroned in the marketplace did sit alone whistling to the air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature  antony and cleopatra act   sc   the following personification of the earth or soil is not less wild she shall be dignified with this high honor to bear my ladys train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favor growing proud disdain to root the summerswelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly  the two gentlemen of verona act   sc   shakespeare far from approving such intemperance of imagination puts this speech in the mouth of a ranting lover neither can i relish what follows omnia quae phoebo quondam meditante beatus audiit eurotas jussitque ediscere lauros ille canit virgil buc vi    the cheerfulness singly of a pastoral song will scarce support personification in the lowest degree but admitting that a river gently flowing may be imagined a sensible being listening to a song i cannot enter into the conceit of the rivers ordering his laurels to learn the song here all resemblance to any thing real is quite lost this however is copied literally by one of our greatest poets early indeed before maturity of taste or judgment thames heard the numbers as he flowed along and bade his willows learn the moving song popes pastorals past   l    this author in riper years is guilty of a much greater deviation from the rule dullness may be imagined a deity or idol to be worshipped by bad writers but then some sort of disguise is requisite some bastard virtue must be bestowed to give this idol a plausible appearance yet in the dunciad dullness without the least disguise is made the object of worship the mind rejects such a fiction as unnatural for dullness is a defect of which even the dullest mortal is ashamed then he great tamer of all human art etc book i     the following instance is stretched beyond all resemblance it is bold to take a part or member of a living creature and to bestow upon it life volition and action after animating two such members it is still bolder to make them envy each other for this is wide of any resemblance to reality  de nostri baci meritamente sia giudice quella etc  pastor fido act   sc    fifthly the enthusiasm of passion may have the effect to prolong passionate personification but descriptive personification cannot be dispatched in too few words a minute description dissolves the charm and makes the attempt to personify appear ridiculous homer succeeds in animating his darts and arrows but such personification spun out in a french translation is mere burlesk et la fleche en fury avide de son sang part vole a lui latteint et lui perce le flanc horace

faint for so violent an effect as imagining the winds trees or floods to be sensible beings but when this figure is deliberately spread out with great regularity and accuracy through many lines the reader instead of relishing it is struck with its ridiculous appearance  sect ii apostrophe this figure and the former are derived from the same principle if to gratify a plaintive passion we can bestow a momentary sensibility upon an inanimate object it is not more difficult to bestow a momentary presence upon a sensible being who is absent hinc drepani me portus et illaetabilis ora accipit

effect  fauno picus pater isque parentem te saturn refert tu sanguinis ultimus auctor aeneid vii     sect iii hyperbole in this figure we have another effect of the foregoing principle an object uncommon with respect to size either very great of its kind or very little strikes us with surprise and this emotion like all others prone to gratification forces upon the mind a momentary conviction that the object is greater or less than it is in reality the same effect precisely attends figurative grandeur or littleness every object that produces surprise by its singularity is always seen in a false light while the emotion subsists circumstances are exaggerated beyond truth and it is not till after the emotion subsides that things appear as they are a writer taking advantage of this natural delusion enriches his description greatly by the hyperbole and the reader even in his coolest moments relishes this figure being sensible that it is the operation of nature upon a warm fancy  it will be observed that a writer is generally more successful in magnifying by a hyperbole than in diminishing a minute object contracts the mind and fetters its power of conception but the mind dilated and inflamed with a grand object moulds objects for its gratification with great facility longinus with respect to the diminishing power of a hyperbole cites the following ludicrous thought from a comic poet he was owner of a bit of ground not larger than a lacedemonian letter chap    of his treatise on the sublime  but for the reason now given the hyperbole has by far the greater force in magnifying objects of which take the following specimen for all the land which thou see to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered  genesis xiii       illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas aeneid vii  0   atque imo

che ne trema la terra el ciel balena gierusalem cant   st     quintilian l   cap   in fin is fensible that this figure is natural for says he not contented with truth we naturally incline to augment or diminish beyond it and for that reason the hyperbole is familiar even among the vulgar and illiterate and he adds very justly that the hyperbole is then proper when the subject of itself exceeds the common measure from these premises one would not expect the following conclusion the only reason he can find for justifying this figure of speech conceditur enim amplius dicere quia dici quantum est non potest meliusque ultra quam citra stat oration we are indulged to say more than enough because we cannot say enough and it is better to be over than under in the name of wonder why this slight and childish reason when immediately before he had made it evident that the hyperbole is founded on human nature i could not resist this personal stroke of criticism intended not against our author for no human creature is exempt from error but against the blind veneration that is paid to the ancient classic writers without distinguishing their blemishes from their beauties  having examined the nature of this figure and the principle on which it is erected i proceed as in the first section to some rules by which it ought to be governed and in the first place it is a capital fault to introduce an hyperbole in the description of an ordinary object or event which creates no surprise in such a case the hyperbole is altogether unnatural being destitute of surprise the only foundation that can support it take the following instance where the subject is extremely familiar viz swimming to gain the shore after a shipwreck i saw him beat the surges under him and ride upon their backs he trod the water whose enmity he flung aside and breasted the surge most swollen that met him his bold head bove the contentious waves he kept and oard himself with his good arms in lusty strokes to the shore that over his waveborn basis bowed as stooping to relieve him  tempest act   sc    in the next place it may be gathered from what is said that an hyperbole can never suit the tone of any dispiriting passion sorrow in particular will never prompt such a figure and for that reason the following hyperboles must be condemned as unnatural k rich aumerle thou weepst my tenderhearted cousin well make foul weather with despised tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summercorn and make a dearth in this revolting land  richard ii act   sc   draw them to tybers bank and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all  julius caesar act   sc    thirdly a writer if he wish to succeed ought always to have the reader in his eye he ought in particular never to venture a bold thought or expression till the reader be warmed and prepared for it for this reason an hyperbole in the beginning of any work can never be in its place example jam pauca aratro jugera regiae moles relinquent horat carm lib   ode     in the fourth place the nicest point of all is to ascertain the natural limits of an hyperbole beyond which being overstrained it has a bad effect longinus in the abovecited chapter with great propriety of thought enters a caveat against an hyperbole of this kind he compares it to a bowstring which relaxes by overstraining and produces an effect directly opposite to what is intended i pretend not to ascertain any precise boundary the attempt would be difficult if not impracticable i must therefore be satisfied with an humbler task which is to give a specimen of what i reckon overstrained hyperboles and i shall be also extremely curt upon this subject because examples are to be found every where no fault is more common among writers of inferior rank and instances are found even among those of the finest taste witness the following hyperbole too bold even for an hotspur hotspur talking of mortimer in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severns

  sc   speaking of henry v england never had a king until his time virtue he had deserving to command his brandished sword did blind men with its beams his arms spread wider than a dragons wings his sparkling eyes replete with awful fire more dazzled and drove back his enemies than midday sun fierce bent against their faces what should i say his deeds exceed all speech he never lifted up his hand but conquered  first part henry vi act   sc    lastly an hyperbole after it is introduced with all advantages ought to be comprehended within the fewest words possible as it cannot be relished but in the hurry and swelling of the mind a leisurely view dissolves the charm and discovers the description to be extravagant at least and perhaps also ridiculous this fault is palpable in a sonnet which passes for one of the most complete in the french language phillis is made as far to outshine the sun as he outshines the stars le silence regnoit sur la terre et sur londe lair devenoit serain etc collection of french epigrams vol   p    there is in chaucer a thought expressed in a single line which sets a young beauty in a more advantageous light than the whole of this muchlaboured poem up rose the sun and up rose emelie  sect iv the means or instrument conceived to be the agent in viewing a group of things we have obviously a natural tendency to bestow all possible perfection upon that particular object which makes the greatest figure the emotion raised by the object is by this means thoroughly gratified and if the emotion be lively it prompts us even to exceed nature in the conception we form of the object take the following examples for neleus sons alcides rage had slain a broken rock the force of pirus threw in these instances the rage of hercules and the force of pirus being the capital circumstances are so far exalted as to be conceived the agents that produce the effects  in the following instance hunger being the chief circumstance in the description is

son in egypts evil day waved round the coast upcalld a pitchy cloud of locusts paradise lost  sect v a figure which among related objects extends properties of one to another this figure is not dignified with a proper name because it has been overlooked by all writers it merits however place in this work and must be distinguished from those formerly handled as depending on a different principle giddy brink jovial wine daring wound are examples of this figure here are expressions that certainly import not the ordinary relation of an adjective to its substantive a brink for example cannot be termed giddy in a proper sense neither can it be termed giddy in any figurative sense that can import any of its qualities or attributes when we attend to the expression we discover that a brink is termed giddy from producing that effect in those who stand on it in the same manner a wound is said to be daring not with respect to itself but with respect to the boldness of the person who inflicts it and wine is said to be jovial as inspiring mirth and jollity thus the attributes of one subject are extended to another with which it is connected and such expression must be considered as a figure because it deviates from ordinary language  how are we to account for this figure for we see it lies in the thought and to what principle shall we refer it have poets a privilege to alter the nature of things and at pleasure to bestow attributes upon subjects to which these attributes do not belong it is an evident truth which we have had often occasion to inculcate that the mind in idea passes easily and sweetly along a train of connected objects and where the objects are intimately connected that it is disposed to carry along the good or bad properties of one to another especially where it is in any degree inflamed with these properties see chap   part   sect    from this principle is derived the figure under consideration language invented for the communication of thought would be imperfect if it were not expressive even of the slighter propensities and more delicate feelings but language cannot remain so imperfect among a people who have received any polish because language is regulated by internal feeling and is gradually so improved as to express whatever passes in the mind thus for example a sword in the hand of a coward is in poetical diction termed a coward sword the expression is significative of an internal operation for the mind in passing from the agent to its instrument is disposed to extend to the latter the properties of the former governed by the same principle we say listening fear by extending the attribute listening of the man who listens to the passion with which he is moved in the expression bold deed or audax facinus we extend to the effect what properly belongs to the cause but not to waste time by making a commentary upon every expression of this kind the best way to give a complete view of the subject is to exhibit a table of the different connections that may give occasion to this figure and in viewing this table it will be observed that the figure can never have any grace but where the connections are of the most intimate kind    an attribute of the cause expressed as an attribute of the effect audax facinus of yonder fleet a bold discovery make an impious mortal gave the daring wound  to my adventrous song

so intimate that an attribute may readily be transferred from the one to the other but awfulness cannot be so transferred because it is inconsistent with submission  sect vi metaphor and allegory a metaphor differs from a simile in form only not in substance in a simile the two different subjects are kept distinct in the expression as well as in the thought in a metaphor the two subjects are kept distinct in thought only not in expression a hero resembles a lion and upon that resemblance many similes have been made by homer and other poets but instead of resembling a lion let us take the aid of the imagination and feign or figure the hero to be a lion by this variation the simile is converted into a metaphor which is carried on by describing all the qualities of a lion that resemble those of the hero the fundamental pleasure here that of resemblance belongs to thought as distinguished from expression there is an additional pleasure which arises from the expression the poet by figuring his hero to be a lion goes on to describe the lion in appearance but in reality the hero and his description is peculiarly beautiful by expressing the virtues and qualities of the hero in new terms which properly speaking belong not to him but to a different being this will better be understood by examples a family connected with a common parent resembles a tree the trunk and branches of which are connected with a common root but let us suppose that a family is figured not barely to be like a tree but to be a tree and then the simile will be converted into a metaphor in the following manner edwards sevn sons whereof thyself art one were sevn fair branches springing from one root some of these branches by the destnies cut but thomas my dear lord my life my gloster one flourishing branch of his most royal root is hacked down and his summerleaves all faded by envys hand and murders bloody axe  richard ii act   sc   figuring human life to be a voyage at sea there is a tide in the

my leaves and left me bare to weather  cymbeline act   sc    i am aware that the term metaphor has been used in a more extensive sense than i give it but i thought it of consequence in matters of some intricacy to separate things that differ from each other and to confine words within their most proper sense an allegory differs from a metaphor and what i would choose to call a figure of speech differs from both i shall proceed to explain these differences a metaphor is defined above to be an operation of the imagination figuring one thing to be another an allegory requires no operation of the imagination nor is one thing figured to be another it consists in choosing a subject having properties or circumstances resembling those of the principal subject and the former is described in such a manner as to represent the latter the subject thus represented is kept out of view we are left to discover it by reflection and we are pleased with the discovery because it is our own work quintilian l   cap   sect   gives the following instance of an allegory o navis referent in mare te novi fluctus o quid agis fortiter occupa portum horat lib   ode    and explains it elegantly in the following words totusque ille horatii locus quo navim pro republica fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus portum pro pace atque concordia dicit  there cannot be a finer or more correct allegory than the following in which a vineyard is put for gods own people the jews thou have brought a vine out of egypt thou have cast out the heathen and planted it thou did cause it to take deep root and it filled the land the hills were covered with its shadow and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars why have thou then broken down her hedges so that all which pass do pluck her the boar out of the wood does waste it and the wild beast does devour it return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the vineyard thy right hand has planted and the branch thou made strong for thyself  psalm  0  in a word an allegory is in every respect similar to an hieroglyphical painting excepting only that words are used instead of colors their effects are precisely the same a hieroglyphic raises two images in the mind one seen which represents one not seen an allegory does the same the representative subject is described and it is by resemblance that we are enabled to apply the description to the subject represented  in a figure of speech neither is there any fiction of the imagination employed nor a representative subject introduced a figure of speech as implied from its name regards the expression only not the thought and it may be defined the employing a word in a sense different from what is proper to it thus youth or the beginning of life is expressed figuratively by morning of life morning is the beginning of the day and it is transferred sweetly and easily to signify the beginning of any other series life especially the progress of which is reckoned by days  figures of speech are reserved for a separate section but a metaphor and allegory are so much connected that it is necessary to handle them together the rules for distinguishing the good from the bad are common to both we shall therefore proceed to these rules after adding some examples to illustrate the nature of an allegory horace speaking of his love to pyrrha which was now extinguished expresses himself thus  me tabula sacer votiva paries indicat uvida suspendisse potenti vestimenta maris deo carm l   ode   again phoebus volentem praelia me loqui

  sc    the rules that govern metaphors and allegories are of two kinds those of the first kind concern the construction of a metaphor or allegory and ascertain what are perfect and what are faulty those of the other kind concern the propriety or impropriety of introduction in what circumstances these figures may be admitted and in what circumstances they are out of place i begin with rules of the first kind some of which coincide with those already given with respect to similes some are peculiar to metaphors and allegories  and in the first place it has been observed that a simile cannot be agreeable where the resemblance is either too strong or too faint this holds equally in a metaphor and allegory and the reason is the same in all in the following instances the resemblance is too faint to be agreeable malcolm  but there is no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust  macbeth act   sc   the best way to judge of this metaphor is to convert it into a simile which would be bad because there is scarce any resemblance betwixt lust and a cistern or betwixt enormous lust and a large cistern

weary steps esteem a foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy homereturn  richard ii act   sc   again here is a letter lady and every word in it a gaping wound issuing lifeblood  merchant of venice act   sc   the following metaphor is strained beyond all endurance timurbec known to us by the name of tamarlane the great writes to bajazet emperor of the ottomans in the following terms where is the monarch who dares resist us where is the potentate who does not glory in being numbered among our attendants as for thee descended from a turcoman sailor since the vessel of thy unbounded ambition has been wrecked in the gulf of they selflove it would be proper that thou should take in the sails of they temerity and cast the anchor of repentance in the port of sincerity and justice which is the port of safety lest the tempest of our vengeance make thee perish in the sea of the punishment thou deservest  such strained figures it is observable are not unfrequent in the first dawn of refinement the mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds and is generally carried to excess till experience discover the just medium  secondly whatever resemblance subjects may have it is wrong to put one for another if they bear no mutual proportion where a very high and a very low subject are compared the simile takes on an air of burlesk and the same will be the effect where the one is imagined to be the other as in a metaphor or made to represent the other as in an allegory  thirdly these figures a metaphor in particular ought not to be extended to a great length nor be crowded with many minute circumstances for in that case it is scarcely possible to avoid obscurity it is difficult during any course of time to support a lively image of one thing being another a metaphor drawn out to any length instead of illustrating or enlivening the principal subject becomes disagreeable by overstraining the mind cowley is extremely licentious in this way take the following instance great and wise conquror who wherever thou come do fortify and settle there who can defend as well as get and never had one quarter beat up yet now thou art in thou never will part with one inch of my vanquished heart for since thou tookst it by assault from me it is garrisoned so strong with thoughts of thee it fears no beauteous enemy for the same reason however agreeable at first long allegories may be by their novelty they never afford any lasting pleasure witness the fairy queen which with great power of expression variety of images and melody of versification is scarce ever read a second time  in the fourth place the comparison carried on in a simile being in a metaphor sunk and the principal subject being imagined that very thing which it only resembles an opportunity is furnished to describe it in terms taken strictly or literally with respect to its imagined nature this suggests another rule that in constructing a metaphor the writer ought to confine himself to the simplest expressions and make use of such words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his subject figurative words ought carefully to be avoided for such complicated images instead of setting the principal subject in a strong light involve it in a cloud and it is well if the reader without rejecting by the lump endeavor patiently to gather the plain meaning regardless of the figures a stubborn and unconquerable flame creeps in his veins and drinks the streams of life  lady jane gray act   sc   copied from ovid sorbent avidae praecordia flammae metamorphoses lib ix     let us analize this expression that a fever may be imagined a flame i admit though more than one step is necessary to come at the resemblance a fever by heating the body resembles fire and it is no stretch to imagine a fever to be a fire again by a figure of speech flame may be put for fire because they are commonly conjoined and therefore a fever may also be imagined a flame but now admitting a fever to be a flame its effects ought to be explained in words that agree literally to a flame this rule is not observed here for a flame drinks figuratively only not properly king henry to his son prince henry thou hidst a thousand daggers in thy thoughts which thou have whetted on thy stony heart to stab at half an hour of my frail life  second part henry iv act   sc    such faulty metaphors are pleasantly ridiculed in the rehearsal physician sir to conclude the place you fill has more than amply exacted the talents of a wary pilot and all these threatening storms which like impregnate clouds hover over our heads will when they once are grasped but by the eye of reason melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people   bays pray mark that allegory is not that good   johnson yes that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable   act   sc    fifthly the jumbling different metaphors in the same sentence or the beginning with one metaphor and ending with another is commonly called a mixed metaphor quintilian bears testimony against it in the bitterest terms nam id quoque in primis est custodiendum ut quo ex genere coeperis translationis hoc desinas multi enim cum initium a tempestate sumpserunt incendio aut ruina finiunt quae est inconsequentia rerum foedissima l   cap     k henry  will you again unknit this churlish knot of allabhorred war and move in that obedient

sea of troubles and by opposing end them  hamlet act   sc    in the sixth place it is unpleasant to join different metaphors in the same period even where they are preserved distinct it is difficult to imagine the subject to be first one thing and then another in the same period without interval the mind is distracted by the rapid transition and when the imagination is put on such hard duty its images are too faint to produce any good effect at regina gravi jamdudum saucia cura vulnus alit venis et caeco carpitur igni aeneid iv     est mollis flamma medullas interea et tacitum vivit sub

a period so as that it must be understood partly metaphorically partly literally the imagination cannot follow with sufficient ease changes so sudden and unprepared a metaphor begun and not carried on has no beauty and instead of light there is nothing but obscurity and confusion instances of such incorrect composition are without number i shall for a specimen select a few from different authors

fermentation stun and disable one another  bolingbroke  this fault of jumbling the figure and plain expression into one confused mass is not less common in allegory than in metaphor take the following

horat carm l   ode   lord halifax speaking of the ancient fabulists they says he wrote in signs and spoke in parables all their fables carry a double meaning the story is one and entire the characters

beast for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line  a few words more upon allegory nothing gives greater pleasure than this figure when the representative subject bears a strong analogy in all its circumstances to that which is represented but the choice is seldom so lucky the resemblance of the representative subject to the principal being generally so faint and obscure as to puzzle and not please an allegory is still more difficult in painting than in poetry the former can show no resemblance but what appears to the eye the latter has many other resources for showing the resemblance with respect to what the abbe du bos reflections sur la poesy etc vol   sect    terms mixed allegorical compositions these may do in poetry because in writing the allegory can easily be distinguished from the historical part no person mistakes virgils fame for a real being but such a mixture in a picture is intolerable because in a picture the objects must appear all of the same kind wholly real or wholly emblematical the history of mary de medicis in the palace of luxenbourg painted by rubens is in a vicious taste by a perpetual jumble of real and allegorical personages which produce a discordance of parts and an obscurity upon the whole witness in particular the tablature representing the arrival of mary de medicis at marseilles mixed with the real personages the nereids and tritons appear sounding their shells such a mixture of fiction and reality in the same group is strangely absurd the picture of alexander and roxana described by lucian is gay and fanciful but it suffers by the allegorical figures it is not in the wit of man to invent an allegorical representation deviating farther from any appearance of resemblance than one exhibited by lewis xiv anno      in which an overgrown chariot intended to represent that of the sun is dragged along surrounded with men and women representing the four ages of the world the celestial signs the seasons the hours etc a monstrous composition and yet scarce more absurd than guidos tablature of aurora  in an allegory as well as in a metaphor terms ought to be chosen that properly and literally are applicable to the representative subject nor ought any circumstance to be added that is not proper to the representative subject however justly it may be applicable figuratively to the principal upon this account the following allegory is faulty ferus et cupido semper ardentes acuens sagittas cote cruenta horat l   ode   for though blood may suggest the cruelty of love it is an improper or immaterial circumstance in the representative subject water not blood is proper for a whetstone  we proceed to the next head which is to examine in what circumstances these figures are proper in what improper this inquiry is not altogether superseded by what is said upon the same subject in the chapter of comparisons because upon trial it will be found that a short metaphor or allegory may be proper where a simile drawn out to a greater length and in its nature more solemn would scarce be relished the difference however is not considerable and in most instances the same rules are applicable to both and in the first place a metaphor as well as a simile are excluded from common conversation and from the description of ordinary incidents  in the next place in any severe passion which totally occupies the mind metaphor is unnatural for that reason we must condemn the following speech of macbeth methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravelld sleeve of care the birth of each days life sore labors bath balm of hurt minds great natures second course chief nourisher in lifes feast   act   sc   the next example of deep despair beside the highly figurative style has more the air of raving than of sense calista is it the voice of thunder or my father madness confusion let the storm come on let the tumultuous roar drive all upon me dash my devoted bark ye surges break it it is for my ruin that the tempest rises when i am lost sunk to the bottom low peace shall return and all be calm again  fair penitent act   the metaphor i next introduce is sweet and lively but it suits not the fiery temper of chamont inflamed with passion parables are not the language of wrath venting itself without restraint chamont you took her up a little tender flower just sprouted on a bank which the next frost had nipd and with a careful loving hand transplanted her into your own fair garden where the sun always shines there long she flourished grew sweet to sense and lovely to the eye till at the last a cruel spoiler came cropped this fair rose and rifled all its sweetness then cast it like a loathsome weed away  orphan act   the following speech full of imagery is not natural in grief and dejection of mind gonsalez o my son from the blind dotage of a fathers fondness these ills arose for thee i have been ambitious base and bloody for thee i have plunged into this sea of sin stemming the tide with only one weak hand while the other bore the crown to wreathe thy brow whose weight has sunk me ere i reached the shore  mourning bride act   sc   the finest picture that ever was drawn of deep distress is in macbeth act   sc    where macduff is represented lamenting his wife and children inhumanly murdered by the tyrant struck with the news he questions the messenger over and over not that he doubted the fact but that his heart revolted against so cruel a misfortune after struggling some time with his grief he turns from his wife and children to their savage butcher and then gives vent to his resentment but still with manliness and dignity o i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue but gentle heaven cut short all intermission front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself within my swords length set him  if he scape then heaven forgive him too this passage is a delicious picture of human nature one expression only seems doubtful in examining the messenger macduff expresses himself thus he has no children  all my pretty ones did you say all what all oh hellkite all what all my pretty little chickens and their dam at one fell swoop metaphorical expression i am sensible may sometimes be used with grace where a regular simile would be intolerable but there are situations so overwhelming as not to admit even the slightest metaphor it requires great delicacy of taste to determine with firmness whether the present case be of that nature i incline to think it is and yet i would not willingly alter a single word of this admirable scene  but metaphorical language is proper when a man struggles to bear with dignity or decency a misfortune however great the struggle agitates and animates the mind wolsey farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man to day he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do  henry viii act   sc    sect vii figure of speech in the section immediately foregoing a figure of speech is defined the employing a word in a sense different from what is proper to it and the new or uncommon sense of the word is termed the figurative sense the figurative sense must have a relation to that which is proper and the more intimate the relation is the figure is the more happy how ornamental this figure is to language will not be readily imagined by any one who has not given peculiar attention i shall endeavor to display its capital beauties and advantages in the first place a word used figuratively together with its new sense suggests what it commonly bears and thus it has the effect to present two objects one signified by the figurative sense which may be termed the principal object and one signified by the proper sense which may be termed accessory the principal makes a part of the thought the accessory is merely ornamental in this respect a figure of speech is precisely similar to concordant sounds in music which without contributing to the melody make it harmonious i explain myself by examples youth by a figure of speech is termed the morning of life this expression signifies youth the principal object which enters into the thought but it suggests at the same time the proper sense of morning and this accessory object being in itself beautiful and connected by resemblance to the principal object is not a little ornamental i give another example of a different kind where an attribute is expressed figuratively imperious ocean together with the figurative meaning of the epithet imperious there is suggested its proper meaning viz the stern authority of a despotic prince upon this figurative power of words vida descants with great elegance nonne vides verbis ut veris saepe relictis accersant simulata aliundeque nomina porro transportent aptentque aliis ea rebus ut ip sae exuviasque novas res insolitosque colores indutae saepe externi mirentur amictus unde illi laetaeque aliena luce fruantur mutatoque habitu nec jam sua nomina mallent saepe ideo cum bella canunt incendia cedas cernere diluviumque ingens surgentibus undis contra etiam martis pugnas imitabitur ignis cum furit accensis acies vulcania campis nec turbato oritur quondam minor aequore pugna confligunt animosi euri certamine vasto inter se pugnantque adversis molibus undae usque adeo passim sua res insignia laetae permutantque juvantque vicissim and mutua sese altera in alterius transformat protinus ora tum specie capti gaudent spectare legentes nam diversa simul datur e re cernere eadem multarum simulacra animo subeuntia rerum poet lib   l     in the next place this figure possesses a signal power of aggrandising an object by the following means words which have no original beauty but what arises from their sound acquire an adventitious beauty from their meaning a word signifying any thing that is agreeable becomes by that means agreeable for the agreeableness of the object is communicated to its name see chap   part   sect    this acquired beauty by the force of custom adheres to the word even when used figuratively and the beauty received from the thing it properly signifies is communicated to the thing which it is made to signify figuratively consider the foregoing expression imperious ocean how much more elevated it is than stormy ocean  thirdly this figure has a happy effect in preventing the familiarity of proper names the familiarity of a proper name is communicated to the thing it signifies by means of their intimate connection and the thing is thereby brought down in our feeling i have often regretted that a factious spirit of opposition to the reigning family made it necessary in public worship to distinguish the king by his proper name one will scarce imagine who has not made the trial how much better it sounds to pray for our sovereign lord the king without any addition  this bad effect is prevented by using a figurative word instead of one that is proper as for example when we express the sky by terming it the blue vault of heaven for though no work made with hands can compare with the sky in magnificence the expression however is good by preventing the object from being brought down by the familiarity of its proper name with respect to the degrading familiarity of proper names vida has the following passage hinc si dura mihi passus dicendus ulysses non illum vero memorabo nomine sed qui et mores hominum multorum vidit and urbes naufragus eversae post saeva incendia trojae poet lib   l     lastly by this figure language is enriched and rendered more copious in that respect were there no other a figure of speech is a happy invention this property is finely touched by vida quinetiam agricolas ea fandi nota voluptas exercet dum laeta seges dum trudere gemmas incipiunt vites sitientiaque aetheris imbrem prata bibunt ridentque satis surgentibus agri hanc vulgo speciem propriae penuria vocis intulit indictisque urgens in rebus egestas quippe ubi se vera ostendebant nomina nusquam fas erat hinc atque hinc transfer simillima veris poet lib   l  0  the beauties i have mentioned belong to every figure of speech several other beauties peculiar to one or other sort i shall have occasion to remark afterward  not only subjects but qualities actions effects may be expressed figuratively thus as to subjects the gates of breath for the lips the watery kingdom for the ocean as to qualities fierce for stormy in the expression fierce winter altus for profundus altus puteus altum mare breathing for perspiring breathing plants again as to actions the sea rages time will melt her frozen thoughts time kills grief an effect is put for the cause as lux for the sun and a cause for the effect as boum labores for corn the relation of resemblance is one plentiful source of figures of speech and nothing is more common than to apply to one object the name of another that resembles it in any respect height size and wordly greatness though in themselves they have no resemblance produce emotions in the mind that have a resemblance and led by this resemblance we naturally express worldly greatness by height or size one feels a certain uneasiness in looking down to a great depth and hence depth is made to express any thing disagreeable by excess as depth of grief depth of despair again height of place and time long past produce similar feelings and hence the expression ut altius repetam distance in past time producing a strong feeling is put for any strong feeling nihil mihi antiquius nostra amicitia shortness with relation to space for shortness with relation to time brevis esse laboro obscurus fio suffering a punishment resembles paying a debt hence pendere poenas upon the same account light may be put for glory sunshine for prosperity and weight for importance  many words originally figurative having by long and constant use lost their figurative power are degraded to the inferior rank of proper terms thus the words that express the operations of the mind have in all languages been originally figurative the reason holds in all that when these operations came first under consideration there was no other way of describing them but by what they resembled it was not practicable to give them proper names as may be done to objects that can be ascertained by sight and touch a soft nature jarring tempers weight of woe pompous phrase beget compassion assuage grief break a vow bend the eye downward shower down curses drowned in tears wrapped in joy warmed with eloquence laden with spoils and a thousand other expressions of the like nature have lost their figurative sense some terms there are that cannot be said to be either purely figurative or altogether proper originally figurative they are tending to simplicity without having lost altogether their figurative power virgils regina saucia cura is perhaps one of these expressions with ordinary readers saucia will be considered as expressing simply the effect of grief but one of a lively imagination will exalt the phrase into a figure  to epitomize this subject and at the same time to give a clear view of it i cannot think of a better method than to present to the reader a list of the several relations upon which figures of speech are commonly founded this list i divide into two tables one of subjects expressed figuratively and one of attributes  first table subjects expressed figuratively   a word proper to one subject employed figuratively to express a resembling subject there is no figure of speech so frequent as what is derived from the relation of resemblance youth for example is signified figuratively by the morning of life the life of a man resembles a natural day in several particulars the morning is the beginning of day youth the beginning of life the morning is cheerful so is youth etc by another resemblance a bold warrior is termed the thunderbolt of war a multitude of troubles a sea of troubles  no other figure of speech possesses so many different beauties as that which is founded on resemblance beside the beauties above mentioned common to all sorts it possesses in particular the beauty of a metaphor or of a simile a figure of speech built upon resemblance suggests always a comparison betwixt the principal subject and the accessory and by this means every good effect of a metaphor or simile may in a short and lively manner be produced by this figure of speech    a word proper to the effect employed figuratively to express the cause lux for the sun shadow for cloud a helmet is signified by the expression glittering terror a tree by shadow or umbrage hence the expression nec habet pelion umbras ovid where the dun umbrage hangs spring l  0   a wound is made to signify an arrow vulnere non pedibus te consequar ovid  there is a peculiar force and beauty in this figure the word which signifies figuratively the principal subject denotes it to be a cause by suggesting the effect    a word proper to the cause employed figuratively to express the effect boumque labores for corn sorrow or grief for tears again ulysses veiled his pensive head again unmannd a shower of sorrow shed streaming grief his faded cheek bedewed   blindness for darkness caecis erramus in undis aeneid iii  00  there is a peculiar energy in this figure similar to that in the former the figurative name denotes the subject to be an effect by suggesting its cause    two things being intimately connected the proper name of the one employed figuratively to signify the other day for light night for darkness hence a sudden night winter for a storm at sea interea magno misceri murmr pontum emissamque hyemem sensit neptunus aeneid i     this last figure would be too bold for a british writer as a storm at sea is not inseparably connected with winter in this climate    a word proper to an attribute employed figuratively to denote the subject youth and beauty for those who are young and beautiful youth and beauty shall be laid in dust  majesty for the king what art thou that usurpst this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometime march  hamlet act   sc    or have ye chosen this place after the toils of battle to repose your wearied virtue paradise lost verdure for a green field summer l  0  speaking of cranes to pigmy nations wounds and death they bring and all the war descends upon the wing iliad iii  0 cool age advances venerably wise iliad iii      the peculiar beauty of this figure arises from suggesting an attribute that embellishes the subject or puts it in a stronger light    a complex term employed figuratively to denote one of the component parts funus for a dead body burial for a grave    the name of one of the component parts instead of the complex term taeda for a marriage the east for a country situated east from us jovis vestigia servat for imitating jupiter in general    a word signifying time or place employed figuratively to denote a connected subject clime for a nation or for a constitution of government hence the expression merciful clime fleecy winter for snow seculum felix    a part for the whole the pole for the earth the head for the person triginta minas pro capite tuo dedi plautus tergum for the man fugiens tergum ovid vultus for the man jam fulgor armorum fugaces terret equos equitumque vultus horat quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus tam chari capitis horat dumque virent genua horat thy growing virtues justified my cares and promised comfort to my silver hairs iliad ix      forthwith from the pool he rears his mighty stature paradise lost the silent heart which grief assails parnell the peculiar beauty of this figure consists in marking out that part which makes the greatest figure   0 the name of the container employed figuratively to signify what is contained grove for the birds in it vocal grove ships for the seamen agonizing ships mountains for the sheep pasturing upon them bleating mountains zacynthus ithaca etc for the inhabitants ex moestis domibus livy     the name of the sustainer employed figuratively to signify what is sustained altar for the sacrifice field for the battle fought upon it wellfought field     the name of the materials employed figuratively to signify the things made of them ferrum for gladius     the names of the heathen deities employed figuratively to signify what they patronise jove for the air mars for war venus for beauty cupid for love ceres for corn neptune for the sea vulcan for fire  this figure bestows great elevation upon the subject and therefore ought to be confined to the higher strains of poetry   second table attributes expressed figuratively   when two attributes are connected the name of the one may be employed figuratively to express the other purity and virginity are attributes of the same person hence the expression virgin snow for pure snow    a word signifying properly an attribute of one subject employed figuratively to express a resembling attribute of another subject tottering state imperious ocean angry flood raging tempest shallow fears my sure divinity shall bear the shield and edge thy sword to reap the glorious field odyssey xx     black omen for an omen that portends bad fortune ater odor virgil  the peculiar beauty of this figure arises from suggesting a comparison    a word proper to the subject employed to express one of its attributes mens for intellectus mens for a resolution istam oro exue mentem    when two subjects have a resemblance by a common quality the name of the one subject may be employed figuratively to denote that quality in the other summer life for agreeable life    the name of the instrument made to signify the power of employing it  melpomene cui liquidam pater vocem cum cithara dedit  the ample field of figurative expression displayed in these tables affords great scope for reasoning and reflection several of the observations relating to metaphor are applicable to figures of speech these i shall slightly retouch with some additions peculiarly adapted to the present subject  in the first place as the figure under consideration is built upon relation we find from experience and it must be obvious from reason that the beauty of the figure depends on the intimacy of the relation betwixt the figurative and proper sense of the word a slight resemblance in particular will never make this figure agreeable the expression for example drink down a secret for listening to a secret with attention is harsh and uncouth because there is scarce any resemblance betwixt listening and drinking the expression weighty crack used by ben johnson for loud crack is worse if possible a loud sound has not the slightest resemblance to a piece of matter that is weighty the following expression of lucretius is not less faulty et lepido quae sunt fucata sonore i      sed magis pugnas et exactos tyrannos densum humeris bibit aure vulgus horat carm l   ode    phemius let acts of gods and heroes old what ancient bards in hall and bower have told

task to guide the horses practiced to their lords command shall hear the rein and answer to thy hand iliad v      the following figures of speech seem altogether wild and extravagant the figurative and proper meaning having no connection whatever moving softness freshness breathes breathing prospect flowing spring dewy light lucid coolness and many others of this false coin may be found in thomsons seasons  secondly the proper sense of the word ought to bear some proportion to the figurative sense and not soar much above it nor sink much below it this rule as well as the foregoing is finely illustrated by vida haec adeo cum sint cum fas audere poetis multa modis multis tamen observare memento si quando haud propriis rem mavis dicere verbis translatisque aliunde notis longeque petitis ne nimiam ostendas quaerendo talia curam namque aliqui exercent vim duram et rebus iniqui nativam eripiunt formam indignantibus ipsis invitasque jubent alienos sumere vultus haud magis imprudens mihi erit et luminis expers qui puero ingentes habitus det far gigantis quam siquis stabula alta lares appellet equinos aut crines magnae genitricis gramina dicat poet l iii      thirdly in a figure of speech every circumstance ought to be avoided that agrees with the proper sense only not the figurative sense for it is the latter that expresses the thought and the former serves for no other purpose but to make harmony zacynthus green with evershady groves and ithaca presumptuous boast their loves obtruding on my choice a second lord they press the hymenean rite abhorred odyssey xix     zacynthus here standing figuratively for the inhabitants the description of the island is quite out of place it puzzles the reader by making him doubt whether the word ought to be taken in its proper or figurative sense  write my queen and with mine eyes i will drink the words you send though ink be made of gall  cymbeline act   sc   the disgust one has to drink ink in reality is nothing to the purpose where the subject is drinking ink figuratively  in the fourth place to draw consequences from a figure of speech as if the word were to be understood literally is a gross absurdity for it is confounding truth with fiction be moubrays sins so heavy in his bosom that they may break his foaming coursers back and throw the rider headlong in the lists a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford  richard ii act   sc   sin may be imagined heavy in a figurative sense but weight in a proper sense belongs to the accessory only and therefore to describe the effects of weight is to desert the principal subject and to convert the accessory into a principal cromwell how does your grace  wolsey why well never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace

thy tomb but in my heart thou art interred  mourning bride act   sc   this would be very right if there were any inconsistence in being interred in one place really and in another place figuratively  from considering that a word employed in a figurative sense suggests at the same time its proper meaning a fifth rule occurs that to raise a figure of speech we ought to use no word the proper sense of which is inconsistent or incongruous with the subject for no incongruity far less inconsistency whether real or imagined ought to enter into the expression of any subject interea genitor tyberini ad fluminis undam vulnera siccabat lymphis  aeneid x     tres adeo incertos caeca caligine soles erramus pelago totidem sine sidere noctes aeneid iii  0   the foregoing rule may be extended to form a sixth that no epithet ought to be given to the figurative sense of a word that agrees not also with its proper sense  dicat opuntiae frater megillae quo beatus vulnere horat carm lib   ode    parcus deorum cultor et infrequens insanientis dum sapientiae consultus erro horat carm lib   ode     seventhly the crowding into one period or thought different figures of speech is not less faulty than crowding metaphors in that manner the mind is distracted in the quick transition from one image to another and is puzzled instead of being pleased i am of ladies most deject and wretched that sucked the honey of his music vows  hamlet my bleeding bosom sickens at the sound odyss i      ah miser quanta laboras in charybdi digne puer meliore flamma quae saga quis te solvere thessalis magus venenis quis poterit deus vix illigatum te triformi pegasus expediet chimaera horat carm lib   ode     eighthly if crowding figures be bad it is still worse to graft one figure upon another for instance while his keen falchion drinks the warriors lives iliad xi     a falchion drinking the warriors blood is a figure built upon resemblance which is passable but then in the expression lives is again put for blood and by thus grafting one figure upon another the expression is rendered obscure and unpleasant  ninthly intricate and involved figures that can scarce be analized or reduced to plain language

subject to which the word is sometimes applied in a figurative sense hear me oh neptune thou whose arms are hurled from shore to shore and gird the solid world odyss ix     neptune is here introduced personally and not figuratively for the ocean the description therefore which is only applicable to the ocean is altogether improper  it is not sufficient that a figure of speech be regularly constructed and be free from blemish it requires taste to discern when it is proper when improper and taste i suspect is the only guide we can rely on one however may gather from reflection and experience that ornaments and graces suit not any of the dispiriting passions nor are proper for expressing any thing grave and important in familiar conversation they are in some measure ridiculous prospero in the tempest speaking to his daughter miranda says the fringed curtains of thine eyes advance and say what thou see yond no exception can be taken to the justness of the figure and circumstances may be imagined to make it proper but it is certainly not proper in familiar conversation  in the last place though figures of speech have a charming effect when accurately constructed and properly introduced they ought however to be scattered with a sparing hand nothing is more luscious and nothing consequently more satiating than redundant ornament of any kind  chap xxi narration and description horace and many writers after him give instructions for choosing a subject adapted to the genius of the author but rules of criticism would be endless did one descend to peculiarities in talent or genius the aim of the present work is to consider human nature in general and to explore what is common to the species the choice of a subject comes not under such a plan but the manner of execution comes under it because the manner of execution is subjected to general rules these rules respect the things expressed as well as the language or expression which suggests a division of the present chapter into two parts first of thoughts and next of words i pretend not to justify this division as entirely accurate in discoursing of the thoughts it is difficult to abstract altogether from words and still more difficult in discoursing of the words to abstract altogether from thought  the first observation is that the thoughts which embellish a narration ought to be chaste and solid while the mind is intent upon facts it is little disposed to the operarations of the imagination poetical images in a grave history are intolerable and yet stradas belgic history is full of poetical images these being discordant with the subject are disgustful and they have a still worse effect by giving an air of fiction to a genuine history such flowers ought to be scattered with a sparing hand even in epic poetry and at no rate are they proper till the reader be warmed and by an enlivened imagination be prepared to relish them in that state of mind they are extremely agreeable but while we are sedate and attentive to an historical chain of facts we reject with disdain every fiction this belgic history is indeed woefully vicious both in matter and form it is stuffed with frigid and unmeaning reflections as well as with poetical flashes which even laying aside the impropriety are mere tinsel  vida poet lib   l  0  following horace recommends a modest commencement of an epic poem giving for a reason that the writer ought to husband his fire this reason has weight but what is said above suggests a reason still more weighty bold thoughts and figures are never relished till the mind be heated and thoroughly engaged which is not the readers case at the commencement shakespeare in the first part of his history of henry vi begins with a sentiment too bold for the most heated imagination bedford hung be the heavens with black yield day to night comets importing change of times and states brandish your crystal tresses in the sky and with them scourge the bad revolting stars that have consented unto henrys death henry the fifth too famous to live long england never lost a king of so much worth  the passage with which strada begins his history is too poetical for a subject of that kind and at any rate too high for the beginning of a grave performance a third reason ought to have not less influence than either of the former a man who upon his first appearance endeavors to exhibit all his talents is never relished the first periods of a work ought therefore to be short natural and simple cicero in his oration pro archia poeta errs against this rule his reader is out of breath at the very first period which seems never to end burnet begins the history of his own times with a period long and intricate  a third rule or observation is that where the subject is intended for entertainment solely not for instruction a thing ought to be described as it appears not as it is in reality in running for example the impulse upon the ground is accurately proportioned to the celerity of motion in appearance it is otherwise for a person in swift motion seems to skim the ground and scarcely to touch it virgil with great taste describes quick running according to its appearance and thereby raises an image far more lively than it could have been by adhering scrupulously to truth hos super advenit volsca de gente camilla agmen agens equitum et florentes aere catervas bellatrix non illa colo calathisve minervae foemineas assueta manus sed praelia virgo dura pati cursuque pedum praevertere ventos illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret gramina nec

impracticable to form distinct images of persons or things represented in a manner so superficial  it is observed above that every useless circumstance ought to be suppressed to deal in such

intimately connected with the ideas they represent and that the representation cannot be perfect unless the emotions raised by the sound and the sense be concordant it is not sufficient that the sense be clearly expressed the words must correspond to the subject in every particular an elevated subject requires an elevated style what is familiar ought to be familiarly expressed a subject that is serious and important ought to be clothed in plain nervous language a description on the other hand addressed to the imagination is susceptible of the highest ornaments that sounding words metaphor

language of homer is suited to his subject not less accurately than the actions and sentiments of his heroes are to their characters virgil in this particular falls short of perfection his language is stately throughout and though he descends at times to the simplest branches of cookery roasting and boiling for example yet he never relaxes a moment from the high tone see aeneid lib i           in adjusting his language to his subject no writer equals swift i can recollect but one exception which at the same time is far from being gross the journal of a modern lady is composed in a style where sprightliness is blended with familiarity perfectly suited to the subject in one passage however the poet assumes a higher tone which corresponds neither to the subject nor to the tone of language employed in the rest of that piece the passage i have in view begins l     but let me now a while survey etc and ends at l      it is proper to be observed upon this head that writers of inferior rank are continually upon the stretch to enliven and enforce their subject by exaggeration and superlatives this unluckily has an effect opposite to what is intended the reader disgusted with language that swells above the subject is led by contrast to think more meanly of the subject than it may possibly deserve a man of prudence beside will be not less careful to husband his strength in writing than in walking a writer too liberal of superlatives exhausts his whole stock upon ordinary incidents and reserves no share to express with greater energy matters of importance montaigne reflecting upon the then present modes observes that there never was at any other time so abject and servile prostitution of words in the addresses made by people of fashion to one another the humblest tenders of life and soul no professions under that of devotion and adoration the writer constantly declaring himself a vassal nay a slave so that when any more serious occasion of friendship or gratitude requires more genuine professions words are wanting to express them   the power that language possesses to imitate thought goes farther than to the capital circumstances above mentioned it reaches even the slighter modifications slow action for example is imitated by words pronounced slow labor or toil by words harsh or rough in their sound but this subject has been already handled chapter    sect     in dialoguewriting the condition of the speaker is chiefly to be regarded in framing the expression the sentinel in hamlet interrogated about the ghost whether his watch had been quiet answers with great propriety for a man in his station not a mouse stirring one can scarce avoid smiling at the blindness of a certain critic who with an air of selfsufficiency condemns this expression as low and vulgar a french poet says he would express the same thought in a more sublime manner mais tout dort et larmee et les vents et neptune and he adds the english poet may please at london but the french every where else   i proceed to a second remark not less important than the former no person of reflection but must be sensible that an incident makes a stronger impression on an eyewitness than when heard at second hand writers of genius sensible that the eye is the best avenue to the heart represent every thing as passing in our sight and from readers or hearers transform us as it were into spectators a skilful writer conceals himself and presents his personages in a word every thing becomes dramatic as much as possible plutarch de gloria atheniensium observes that thucydides makes his reader a spectator and inspires him with the same passions as if he were an eyewitness i am entitled to make the same observation upon our countryman swift from this happy talent arises that energy of style which is peculiar to him he cannot always avoid narration but the pencil is his choice by which he bestows life and coloring upon his objects pope is richer in ornament but possesses not in the same degree the talent of drawing from the life a translation of the sixth satire of horace begun by the former and finished by the latter affords the fairest opportunity for a comparison pope obviously imitates the picturesque manner of his friend yet every one of taste must be sensible that the imitation though fine falls short of the original in other instances where pope writes in his own style the difference of manner is still more conspicuous  abstract or general terms have no good effect in any composition for amusement because it is only of particular objects that images can be formed see chap    shakespeares style in that respect is excellent every article in his descriptions is particular as in nature and if accidentally a vague expression slip in the blemish is extremely discernible by the bluntness of its impression take the following example falstaff excusing himself for running away at a robbery says by the lord i knew ye as well as he that made ye why hear ye my masters was it for me to kill the heirapparent should i turn upon the true prince why thou know i am as valiant as hercules but beware instinct the lion will not touch the true prince instinct is a great matter i was a coward on instinct i shall think the better of myself and thee during my life i for a valiant lion and thou for a true prince but by the lord lads i am glad you have the money hostess clap to the doors watch tonight pray tomorrow gallants lads boys hearts of gold all the titles of good fellowship come to you what shall we be merry shall we have a play extempore   first part henry iv act   sc   the particular words i object to are instinct is a great matter which make but a poor figure compared with the liveliness of the rest of the speech it was one of homers advantages that he wrote before general terms were multiplied the superior genius of shakespeare displays itself in avoiding them after they were multiplied addison describes the family of sir roger de coverley in the following words you would take his valet de chamber for his brother his butler is gray headed his groom is one of the gravest men that i have ever seen and his coachman has the looks of a privy counselor  spectator no  0  the description of the groom is less lively than of the others plainly because the expression being vague and general tends not to form any image dives opum variarum georg l ii      is an expression still more vague and so are the following  maecenas mearum grande decus columenque rerum horat carm l   ode     et side teia dices laborantes in uno penelopen vitreamque circen horat carm l   ode     in the fine arts it is a rule to put the capital objects in the strongest point of view and even to present them oftener than once where it can be done in historypainting the principal figure is placed in the front and in the best light an equestrian statue is placed in a center of streets that it may be seen from many places at once in no composition is there a greater opportunity for this rule than in writing  sequitur pulcherrimus astur astur equo fidens et versicoloribus armis aeneid x   0  full many a lady i have eyed with best

occasion of much criticism suppose we were at a loss about the reason might not taste be sufficient to justify them at the same time one must be devoid of understanding not to be sensible that they make the narration dramatic and give an air of truth by making things appear as passing in our sight  a concise comprehensive style is a great ornament in narration and a superfluity of unnecessary words not less than of circumstances a great nuisance a judicious selection of the striking circumstances clothed in a nervous style is delightful in this style tacitus excels all writers ancient and modern instances are numberless take the following specimen crebra hinc praelia et saepius in modum latrocinii per saltus per paludes ut cuique fors aut virtus temere proviso ob iram ob praedam jussu et aliquando ignaris ducibus  annal lib        if a concise or nervous style be a beauty tautology must be a blemish and yet writers fettered by verse are not sufficiently careful to avoid this slovenly practice they may be pitied but they cannot be justified take for a specimen the following instances from the best poet for versification at least that england has to boast of high on his

instances are reduced to such epithets for the sake of versification for instance prata canis albicant pruinis of horace and liquidos fontes of virgil  as an apology for such careless expressions it may well suffice that pope in submitting to be a translator acts below his genius in a translation it is hard to require the same spirit or accuracy that is cheerfully bestowed on an original work and to support the reputation of this author i shall give some instances from virgil and horace more faulty by redundancy than any of those above mentioned saepe etiam immensum coelo venit agmen aquarum

sight is far from being so when represented by colors or by words what is the cause of this difference the cause with respect to painting is obvious a good picture whatever the subject be is agreeable because of the pleasure we take in imitation the agreeableness of imitation overbalances the disagreeableness of the subject and the picture upon the whole is agreeable it requires a greater compass to explain the cause with respect to the description of an ugly object to connect individuals in the social state no one particular contributes more than language by the power it possesses of an expeditious communication of thought and a lively representation of transactions but nature has not been satisfied to recommend language by its utility merely it is made susceptible of many beauties that have no relation to utility which are directly felt without the intervention of any reflection see chap     and this unfolds the mystery for the pleasure of language is so great as in a lively description to overbalance the disagreeableness of the image raised by it see chap   part    this however is no encouragement to deal in disagreeable subjects for the pleasure is out of sight greater

such an object every thing horrible ought therefore to be avoided in a description nor is this a severe law the poet will avoid such scenes for his own sake as well as for that of his reader and to vary his descriptions nature affords plenty of objects that disgust us in some degree without raising horror i am obliged therefore to condemn the picture of sin in the second book of paradise lost though drawn with a masterly hand the original would be a horrible spectacle and the horror is not much softened in the copy  pensive here i sat alone but long i sat not till my womb pregnant by thee

sighed from all her caves and back resounded death i fled but he pursued though more it seems inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far me overtook his mother all dismayed and in embraces forcible and foul ingendring with me of that rape begot these yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry surround me as thou saw hourly conceived and hourly born with sorrow infinite to me for when they list

shakespeares masterly hand can make the picture agreeable  though the objects introduced in the following scenes are not altogether so horrible as sin is in miltons picture yet with every person of

the epic more in form than in substance the ends proposed by each are instruction and amusement and each of them copy human actions as means to bring about these ends they differ in the manner only of copying epic poetry deals in narration tragedy represents its facts as transacted in our sight in the former the poet introduces himself as an historian in the latter he presents his actors and never himself the dialogue in a dramatic composition separates it so clearly from other compositions that no writer has thought it necessary to search for any other distinguishing mark but much useless labor has been bestowed to distinguish an epic poem by some such mark bossu defines this poem to be a composition in verse intended to form the manners by instructions disguised under the allegories of an importantaction which will exclude every epic poem founded upon real facts and perhaps include several of esops fables voltaire reckons verse so essential as for that single reason to exclude the adventures of telemachus see his essay upon epic poetry others affected with substance more than with ornament hesitate not to pronounce that poem to be epic it is not a little diverting to see so many shallow critics hunting for what is not to be found they always take for granted without the least foundation that there must be some precise criterion to distinguish epic poetry from every other species of writing literary compositions run into each other precisely like colors in their strong tints they are easily distinguished but are susceptible of so much variety and take on so many different forms that we never can say where one species ends and another begins as to the general taste there is little reason to doubt that a work where heroic actions are related in an elevated style will without further requisite be deemed an epic poem   this difference regarding form only may be thought slight but the effects it occasions are by no means so what we see makes a stronger impression than what we learn from others a narrative poem is a story told by another facts and incidents passing upon the stage come under our own observation and are beside much enlivened by action and gesture expressive of many sentiments beyond the reach of language  a dramatic composition has another property independent altogether of action a dialogue makes a deeper impression than a narration because in the former persons express their own sentiments whereas in the latter sentiments are related at second hand for that reason aristotle the father of critics lays it down as a rule that in an epic poem the author ought to take every opportunity to introduce his actors and to confine the narrative part within the narrowest bounds poet chapter    sect    homer understood perfectly the advantage of this method and his poems are both of them in a great measure dramatic lucan runs to the opposite extreme and is guilty of a still greater fault the pharsalia is stuffed with cold and languid reflections the merit of which the author assumes to himself and deigns not to share with his personages nothing can be more impertinent than a chain of such reflections which suspend the battle of pharsalia after the leaders had made their speeches and the two armies are ready to engage lib   from line     to line   0   aristotle from the nature of the fable divides tragedy into simple and complex but it is of greater moment with respect to dramatic as well as epic poetry to found a distinction upon the different ends attained by such compositions a poem whether dramatic or epic that has no tendency beyond moving the passions and exhibiting pictures of virtue and vice may be distinguished by the name of pathetic but where a story is purposely contrived to illustrate some important lesson of morality by showing the natural connection betwixt disorderly passions and external misfortunes such composition may be denominated moral the same distinction is applicable to that sort of fable which is said to be the invention of aesop a moral it is true is by all critics considered as essential to such a fable but nothing is more common than to be led blindly by authority of the numerous collections i have seen the fables that clearly inculcate a moral make a very small part in many fables indeed proper pictures of virtue and vice are exhibited but the bulk of these collections convey no instruction nor afford any amusement beyond what a child receives in reading an ordinary story  it indeed conveys moral instruction with a perspicuity that is not exceeded by the most accurate reasoning and makes a deeper impression than any moral discourse can do to be satisfied of this we need but reflect that a man whose affections are justly balanced has a better chance to escape misfortunes than one who is a slave to every passion indeed nothing is more evident than the natural connection that vice has with misery and virtue with happiness and such connection may be illustrated by stating a fact as well as by urging an argument let us assume for example the following moral truths that discord among the chiefs renders ineffectual all common measures and that the consequences of a slightlyfounded quarrel fostered by pride and arrogance are not less fatal than those of the grossest injury these truths may be inculcated by the quarrel betwixt agamemnon and achilles at the siege of troy in this view it ought to be the poets chief aim to invent proper circumstances presenting to our view the natural consequences of such discord these circumstances must seem to arise in the common course of human affairs no accidental or unaccountable event ought to be indulged for the necessary or probable connection betwixt vice and misery is learned from no events but what are governed by the characters and passions of the persons represented a real event of which we see no cause may be a lesson to us because what has happened may again happen but this cannot be inferred from a story that is known to be fictitious  many are the good effects of such compositions a pathetic composition whether epic or dramatic tends to a habit of virtue by exciting emotions that produce good actions and avert us from those that are vicious or irregular see chap   part   sect    it likewise by its frequent pictures of human woes humanizes the mind and fortifies us in bearing our own misfortunes a moral composition must obviously produce the same good effects because by being moral it does not cease to be pathetic it enjoys beside an excellence peculiar to itself for it not only improves the heart as above mentioned but instructs the head by the moral it contains for my part i cannot imagine any entertainment more suited to a rational being than a work thus happily illustrating some moral truth where a number of persons of different characters are engaged in an important action some retarding others promoting the great catastrophe and where there is dignity of style as well as of matter a work of this kind has our sympathy at command and can put in motion the whole train of the social affections we have at the same time great mental enjoyment in perceiving every event and every subordinate incident connected with its proper cause our curiosity is by turns excited and gratified and our delight is consummated at the close upon finding from the characters and situations exhibited at the commencement that every circumstance down to the final catastrophe is natural and that the whole in conjunction make a regular chain of causes and effects  considering an epic and dramatic poem as the same in substance and having the same aim or end it might be thought that they are equally fitted for the same subjects but considering their difference as to form there will be found reason to correct that thought at least in some degree many subjects may indeed be treated with equal advantage in either form but the subjects are still more numerous for which one of the forms is better qualified than the other and there are subjects proper for the one and not for the other to give some slight notion of the difference as there is no room here for enlarging upon every article i observe that dialogue is better qualified for expressing sentiments and narrative for displaying facts these peculiarities tend to confine each within certain limits heroism magnanimity undaunted courage and the whole tribe of the elevated virtues figure best in action tender passions and the whole tribe of sympathetic affections figure best in sentiment what we feel is the most remarkable in the latter what we perform is the most remarkable in the former it clearly follows that tender passions are more peculiarly the province of tragedy grand and heroic actions of epic poetry in racine tender sentiments prevail in corneille grand and heroic manners hence clearly the preference of the former before the latter as dramatic poets corneille would figure better in an heroic poem   i have no occasion to say more upon the epic considered as peculiarly adapted to certain subjects but as dramatic subjects are more complex i must take a narrower view of them which i do the more willingly in order to clear a point thrown into great obscurity by critics  in the chapter of emotions and passions part    it is occasionally shown that the subject best fitted for tragedy is the story of a man who has himself been the cause of his misfortune but this man must neither be deeply guilty nor altogether innocent the misfortune must be occasioned by a fault incident to human nature and therefore venial misfortunes of this kind call forth the whole force of the social affections and interest the spectator in the warmest manner an accidental misfortune if not extermely singular does not greatly move our pity the person who suffers being innocent is freed from the greatest of all torments viz the anguish of mind occasioned by remorse poco e funesta laltrui fortuna quando non resta ragione alcuna ne di pentirsi ne darrossir metastasio a criminal on the other hand who brings misfortunes upon himself excites little pity for a different reason his remorse it is true aggravates his distress and swells the first emotions of pity but then our hatred to the criminal blending with pity blunts its edge considerably misfortunes that are not innocent nor highly criminal partake the advantages of each extreme they are attended with remorse to embitter the distress which raises our pity to a great height and the slight indignation we have at a venial fault detracts not sensibly from our pity for this reason the happiest of all subjects for tragedy if such a one could be invented would be where a man of integrity falls into a great misfortune by doing an innocent action but which by some singular means he conceives to be criminal his remorse aggravates his distress and our compassion unrestrained by indignation rises to its highest pitch pity comes thus to be the ruling passion of a pathetic tragedy and by proper representation may be raised to a height scarce exceeded by any thing felt in real life a moral tragedy takes in a larger field for beside exercising our pity it raises another passion selfish indeed but which deserves to be cherished equally with the social affections when a misfortune is the natural consequence of some wrong bias in the temper every spectator who is conscious of some such defect in himself takes the alarm and considers that he is liable to the same misfortune this consideration raises in him an emotion of fear or terror and it is by this emotion frequently reiterated in a variety of moral tragedies that the spectators are put upon their guard against the disorders of passion  the commentators upon aristotle and other critics have been much graveled about the account given of tragedy by this author that by means of pity and terror it refines in us all sorts of passion but no one who has a clear conception of the end and effects of a good tragedy can have any difficulty about aristotles meaning our pity is engaged for the persons represented and our terror is upon our own account pity indeed is here made to stand for all the sympathetic emotions because of these it is the capital there can be no doubt that our sympathetic emotions are refined or improved by daily exercise and in what manner our other passions are refined by terror i have just now said one thing is certain that no other meaning can justly be given to the foregoing doctrine than that now mentioned and that it was really aristotles meaning appears from his   th chapter where he delivers several propositions agreeable to the doctrine as here explained these at the same time i the rather choose to mention because so far as authority can go they confirm the foregoing reasoning about the proper subjects for tragedy his first proposition is that it being the province of tragedy to excite pity and terror an innocent person falling into adversity ought never to be the subject this proposition is a necessary consequence of his doctrine as explained a subject of this nature may indeed excite pity and terror but the former in an inferior degree and the latter in no degree for moral instruction the second proposition is that we must not represent a wicked person emerging from misery to good fortune this excites neither terror nor compassion nor is agreeable in any respect the third is that the misfortunes of a wicked person ought not to be represented such representation may be agreeable in some measure upon a principle of justice but it will not move our pity or any degree of terror except in those of the same vicious disposition with the person represented his last proposition is that the only character fit for representation lies in the middle neither eminently good nor eminently bad where the misfortune is not the effect of deliberate vice but of some involuntary fault as our author expresses it if one can be amused with a grave discourse which promises much and performs nothing he may see this subject treated by brumoy in his theater grec preliminary discourse on the origin of tragedy  the only objection i find to aristotles account of tragedy is that he confines it within too narrow bounds by refusing admittance to the pathetic kind for if terror be essential to tragedy no representation deserves that name but where the misfortunes exhibited are caused by a wrong balance of mind or some disorder in the internal constitution such misfortunes always suggest moral instruction and by such misfortunes only can terror be excited for our improvement  thus aristotles four propositions above mentioned relate solely to tragedies of the moral kind those of the pathetic kind are not confined within so narrow limits subjects fitted for the theater are not in such plenty as to make us reject innocent misfortunes which rouse our sympathy though they inculcate no moral with respect to subjects of this kind it may indeed be a doubtful question whether the conclusion ought not always to be happy where a person of integrity is represented as suffering to the end under misfortunes purely accidental we depart discontented and with some obscure sense of injustice for seldom is man so submissive to the course of providence as not to revolt against the tyranny and vexations of blind chance he will be inclined to say this ought not to be i give for an example the romeo and juliet of shakespeare where the fatal catastrophe is occasioned by friar laurences coming to the monument a minute too late such a story we think of with regret we are vexed at the unlucky chance and go away dissatisfied this is a temper of mind which ought not to be cherished and for that reason i vote for excluding stories of this kind from the theater the misfortunes of a virtuous person arising from necessary causes or from a chain of unavoidable circumstances will i am apt to think be considered in a different light chance affords always a gloomy prospect and in every instance gives an impression of anarchy and misrule a regular chain on the other hand of causes and effects directed by the general laws of nature never fails to suggest the hand of providence to which we submit without resentment being conscious that submission is our duty see essays on the principles of morality edit   p      for that reason we are not dissatisfied with the distresses of voltaires mariamne though redoubled on her till the moment of her death without the least fault or failing on her part her misfortunes are owing to a cause extremely natural and not unfrequent the jealousy of a barbarous husband the fate of desdemona in the moor of venice affects us in the same manner we are not so easily reconciled to the fate of cordelia in king lear the causes of her misfortune are by no means so evident as to exclude the gloomy notion of chance in short it appears that a perfect character suffering under misfortunes is qualified for being the subject of a pathetic tragedy provided chance be excluded nor is it altogether inconsistent with a moral tragedy it may successfully be introduced as an underpart supposing the chief place to be filled with an imperfect character from which a moral can be drawn this is the case of desdemona and mariamne just now mentioned and it is the case of monimia and belvidera in otways two tragedies the orphan and venice preserved  i had an early opportunity to unfold a curious doctrine that fable operates on our passions by representing its events as passing in our sight and by deluding us into a conviction of reality chap   part   sect    hence in epic and dramatic compositions it is of importance to employ every means that may promote the delusion such as the borrowing from history some noted event with the addition of circumstances that may answer the authors purpose the principal facts are known to be true and we are disposed to extend our belief to every circumstance but in choosing a subject that makes a figure in history greater precaution is necessary than where the whole is invented in the first place no circumstances must be added but such as connect naturally with what are known to be true history may be supplied but it must not be contradicted in the next place a pure fable entirely new with respect to the persons as well as the incidents may be supposed an ancient or a modern story but if the poet build upon truth the subject he chooses must be distant in time or at least in place for he ought by all means to avoid the familiarity of persons and events nearly connected with us familiarity ought more especially to be avoided in an epic poem the peculiar character of which is dignity and elevation modern manners make but a poor figure in such a poem i would not from this observation be thought to undervalue modern manners the roughness plainness and impetuosity of ancient manners may show better in an epic poem without being better fitted for society but without regard to this circumstance it is the familiarity of modern manners that unqualifies them for a lofty subject the dignity of our present manners will be better understood in suture ages when they have become ancient   after voltaire no writer it is probable will think of erecting an epic poem upon a recent event in the history of his own country but an event of this kind is perhaps not altogether unqualified for tragedy it was admitted in greece and shakespeare has employed it successfully in several of his pieces one advantage it possesses above fiction that of more readily engaging our belief which tends above any other particular to raise our sympathy the scene of comedy is generally laid at home familiarity is no objection and we are peculiarly sensible of the ridicule of our own manners  after a proper subject is chosen there appears to me some delicacy in dividing it into parts the conclusion of a book in an epic poem or of an act in a play cannot be altogether arbitrary nor be intended for so slight a purpose as to make the parts of equal length the supposed pause at the end of every book and the real pause at the end of every act ought always to coincide with some pause in the action in this respect a dramatic or epic poem ought to resemble a sentence or period in language divided into members that are distinguished from each other by regular pauses or it ought to resemble a piece of music having a full close at the end preceded by imperfect closes that contribute to the melody every act therefore ought to close with some incident that makes a pause in the action for otherwise there can be no pretext for interrupting the representation it would be absurd to break off in the very heat of action against this every one would exclaim the absurdity still remains though the action relents if it be not actually suspended for some time this rule is also applicable to an epic poem though there a deviation from the rule is less remarkable because it is in the readers power to hide the absurdity by proceeding instantly to another book the first book of the paradise lost ends without any regular close perfect or imperfect it breaks off abruptly where satan seated on his throne is prepared to make a speech to the convocated host of the fallen angels and the second book begins with the speech milton seems to have copied the aeneid of which the two first books are divided much in the same manner neither is there any proper pause at the end of the fifth book of the aeneid there is no proper pause at end of the seventh book of paradise lost nor at the end of the eleventh  hitherto i have carried on together the epic and dramatic compositions i proceed to handle them separately and to mention circumstances peculiar to each beginning with the epic kind in a theatrical entertainment which employs both the eye and the ear it would be a monstrous absurdity to introduce upon the stage invisible beings in a visible shape but it has been much disputed whether such beings may not be properly introduced in an epic poem if we rest upon the authority of practice we must declare for the affirmative and boileau third part of his art of poetry  among many other critics is a stout champion for this sort of machinery but waving authority which is apt to impose upon the judgment let us draw what light we can from reason i begin with a preliminary remark that this matter is but indistinctly handled by critics it is laid down above that several passions incite the mind to animate its objects chap  0 sect    the moral virtues become so many goddesses and even darts and arrows are inspired with life and action but then it must not be overlooked that such personification being the work of imagination is descriptive only and assumes not even an appearance of truth ibid  this is very different from what is termed machinery where deities angels devils or other supernatural powers are introduced as real personages mixing in the action and contributing to the catastrophe and yet these two things are constantly jumbled together in the reasoning the poetical privilege of animating insensible objects for the sake of description cannot be controverted because it is founded on a natural principle but has the privilege of machinery if it be a privilege the same good foundation far from it nothing can be more unnatural its effects at the same time are deplorable first it gives an air of fiction to the whole and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections and to move our passions see chap   part   sect    this of itself is sufficient to explode machinery whatever entertainment it may give to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination and next were it possible to disguise the fiction and to delude us into a notion of reality which i think can hardly be an insuperable objection would still remain which is that the aim or end of an epic poem can never be accomplished in any perfection where machinery is introduced virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endued with passions and affections like our own that is by human actions and as for moral instruction it is evident that we can draw none from beings who act not upon the same principles with us a fable in aesops manner is no objection to this reasoning his lions bulls and goats are truly men under disguise they act and feel in every respect as human beings and the moral we draw is founded on that supposition homer it is true introduces the gods into his fable and he was authorized to take that liberty by the religion of his country it being an article in the grecian creed that the gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs i must however observe that homers deities do no honor to his poems fictions that transgress the bounds of nature seldom have a good effect they may inflame the imagination for a moment but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste let me add that of whatever use such fictions may be to a mean genius an able writer has much finer materials of natures production for elevating his subject and making it interesting  boileau a strenuous advocate for the heathen deities as observed declares against angels and devils though supported by the religious creed of his country one would be apt to imagine that a critic famed for his good taste could have no other meaning than to justify the employing heathen deities for enlivening or elevating the description but as the heathen deities make not a better figure in poetical language than angels and devils boileau in pleading for the former certainly meant if he had any distinct meaning that these may be introduced as actors and in fact he himself is guilty of this glaring absurdity where it is not so pardonable as in an epic poem in his ode upon the taking of namur he demands with a most serious countenance whether the walls were built by apollo or neptune and in relating the passage of the rhine anno      he describes the god of that river as fighting with all his might to oppose the french monarch this is confounding fiction with reality at a strange rate the french writers in general run into this error wonderful that they should not be sensible how ridiculous it is  that this is a capital error in the gierusalleme liberata tassos greatest admirers must acknowledge a situation can never be intricate nor the reader ever in pain about the catastrophe so long as there is an angel devil or magician to lend a helping hand voltaire in his essay upon epic poetry talking of the pharsalia observes judiciously that the proximity of time the notoriety of events the character of the age enlightened and political joined with the solidity of lucans subject deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction is it not amazing that a critic who reasons so justly with respect to others can be so blind with respect to himself voltaire not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior beings introduces them into the action in the sixth canto of the henriade st louis appears in person and terrifies the soldiers in the seventh canto st louis sends the god of sleep to henry and in the tenth the demons of discord fanaticism war etc assist aumale in a single combat with turenne and are chased away by a good angel brandishing the sword of god to blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals makes a bad figure at any rate and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of henry iv this singly is sufficient to make the henriade a shortlived poem were it otherwise possessed of every beauty i have tried serious reasoning upon this subject but ridicule i suppose will be found a more successful weapon which addison has applied in an elegant manner whereas the time of a general peace is in all appearance drawing near being informed that there are several ingenious persons who intend to show their talents on so happy an occasion and being willing as much as in me lies to prevent that effusion of nonsense which we have good cause to apprehend i do hereby strictly require every person who shall write on this subject to remember that he is a christian and not to sacrifice his catechism to his poetry in order to it i do expect of him in the first place to make his own poem without depending upon phoebus for any part of it or calling out for aid upon any of the muses by name i do likewise positively forbid the sending of mercury with any particular message or dispatch relating to the peace and shall by no means suffer minerva to take upon her the shape of any plenipotentiary concerned in this great work i do further declare that i shall not allow the destinies to have had an hand in the deaths of the several thousands who have been slain in the late war being of opinion that all such deaths may be very well accounted for by the christian system of powder and ball i do therefore strictly forbid the fates to cut the thread of mans life upon any pretense whatsoever unless it be for the sake of the rhyme and whereas i have good reason to fear that neptune will have a great deal of business on his hands in several poems which we may now suppose are upon the anvil i do also prohibit his appearance unless it be done in metaphor simile or any very short allusion and that even here he be not permitted to enter but with great caution and circumspection i desire that the same rule may be extended to his whole fraternity of heathen gods it being my design to condemn every poem to the flames in which jupiter thunders or exercises any other act of authority which does not belong to him in short i expect that no pagan agent shall be introduced or any fact related which a man cannot give credit to with a good conscience provided always that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to several of the female poets in this nation who shall still be left in full possession of their gods and goddesses in the same manner as if this paper had never been written spectator no      the mavelous is indeed so much promoted by machinery that it is not wonderful to find it embraced by the bulk of writers and perhaps of readers if indulged at all it is generally indulged to excess homer introduces his deities with no greater ceremony than his mortals and virgil has still less moderation an overwatched pilot cannot fall asleep and drop into the sea by natural means the two lovers aeneas and dido cannot take the same bed without the immediate interposition of superior powers the ridiculous in such fictions must appear even through the thickest vail of gravity and solemnity  angels and devils serve equally with the heathen deities as materials for figurative language perhaps better among christians because we believe in them and not in the heathen deities but every one is sensible as well as boileau that the invisible powers in our creed make a much worse figure as actors in a modern poem than the invisible powers in the heathen creed did in ancient poems the reason i take to be what follows the heathen deities in the opinion of their votaries were beings elevated one step only above mankind actuated by the same passions and directed by the same motives therefore not altogether improper to mix with mankind in an important action in our creed superior beings are placed at such a mighty distance from us and are of a nature so different that with no propriety can they appear with us upon the same stage man is a creature so much inferior that he loses all dignity when set in opposition  there seems to be no doubt that an historical poem admits the embellishment of allegory as well as of metaphor simile or other figure moral truth in particular is finely illustrated in the allegorical manner it amuses the fancy to find abstract terms by a sort of magic converted into active beings and it is delightful to trace a general proposition in a pictured event but allegorical beings should be confined within their own sphere and never be admitted to mix in the principal action nor to cooperate in retarding or advancing the catastrophe this would have a still worse effect than the introduction of invisible powers and i am ready to assign the reason an historical fable affords entertainment chiefly by making us conceive its personages to be really existing and acting in our presence in an allegory this agreeable delusion is denied for we must not imagine an allegorical personage to be a real being but the figure only of some virtue or vice otherwise the allegory is lost the impression of real existence essential to an epic poem is inconsistent with that figurative existence which is essential to an allegory and therefore no method can be more effectual to destroy the impression of reality than to introduce allegorical beings cooperating with those whom we conceive to be really existing the loveepisode in the henriade canto    is insufferable by the discordant mixture of allegory with real life this episode is copied from that of rinaldo and armida in the gierusalemme liberata which has no merit to entitle it to be copied an allegorical object such as fame in the aeneid and the temple of love in the henriade may find place in a description but to introduce discord as a real personage imploring the assistance of love as another real personage to enervate the courage of the hero is making these figurative beings act beyond their sphere and creating a strange jumble of discordant materials viz truth and fiction the allegory of sin and death in the paradise lost is i presume not generally relished though it is not entirely of the same nature with what i have been condemning the paradise lost is not confined to the history of our first parents and in a work comprehending the achievements of superior beings there is more room for fancy than where it is confined to human actions  what is the true notion of an episode or how is it to be distinguished from what is really a part of the principal action every incident that promotes or retards the catastrophe must be a part of the principal action this clears the nature of an episode which may be defined an incident connected with the principal action but which contributes not either to advance or retard it the descent of aeneas into hell does not advance or retard the catastrophe and therefore is an episode the story of nisus and euryalus producing an alteration in the affairs of the contending parties is a part of the principal action the familyscene in the sixth book of the iliad is of the same nature by hectors retiring from the field of battle to visit his wife the grecians got liberty to breathe and even to press upon the trojans it being thus the nature of an episode to break the unity of action it ought never to be indulged unless to refresh and unbend the mind after the fatigue of a long narration this purpose of an episode demands the following properties it ought to be well connected with the principal action it ought to be short and it ought to be lively and interesting  next upon the peculiarities of a dramatic poem and the first i shall mention is a double plot being naturally led to it by what is said immediately above one of these double plots must be of the nature of an episode in an epic poem for it would distract the spectator instead of entertaining him if he were forced to attend at the same time to two capital plots equally interesting an underplot in a tragedy has seldom a good effect because a passionate piece cannot be too simple the sympathetic emotions once roused cling to their objects and cannot bear interruption when a subject fills the mind it leaves no room for any separate concern racine in his preface to the tragedy of berenice is sensible that simplicity is a great beauty in tragedy but mistakes the cause nothing says he but verisimilitude pleases in tragedy but where is the verisimilitude that within the compass of a day events should be crowded which commonly are extended through months this is mistaking the accuracy of imitation for the probability or improbability of future events i explain myself the verisimilitude required in tragedy is that the actions correspond to the manners and the manners to nature when this resemblance is preserved the imitation is just because it is a true copy of nature but i deny that the verisimilitude of future events meaning the probability of future events is any rule in tragedy a number of extraordinary events are it is true seldom crowded within the compass of a day but what seldom happens may happen and when such events fall out they appear not less natural than the most ordinary accidents to make verisimilitude in the sense of probability a governing rule in tragedy would annihilate this sort of writing altogether for it would exclude all extraordinary events in which the life of tragedy consists it is very improbable or unlikely pitching upon any man at random that he will sacrifice his life and fortune for his mistress or for his country yet when this event happens supposing it agreeable to the character we recognize the verisimilitude as to nature whatever want of verisimilitude or of probability there was a priori that such would be the event  variety is more tolerable in comedy which pretends only to amuse without totally occupying the mind but even here to make a double plot agreeable a good deal of art is requisite the underplot ought not to vary greatly in its tone from that which is principal passions may be varied but discordant passions are unpleasant when jumbled together this is a solid objection to tragicomedy for this reason i blame the provoked husband all the scenes that bring the family of the wrongheads into action being ludicrous and farcical agree very ill with the sharpness and severity of the principal subject exhibiting the discord betwixt lord townly and his lady the same objection touches not the double plot of the careless husband the different subjects are sweetly connected and have only so much variety as to resemble shades of colors harmoniously mixed but this is not all the under plot ought to be connected with the principal action so as to employ the same persons the intervals or pauses of the principal action ought to be filled with the underplot and both ought to be concluded together this is the case of the merry wives of windsor  violent action ought to be excluded from the stage while the dialogue runs on a thousand particulars concur to delude us into an impression of reality genuine sentiments passionate language and persuasive gesture the spectator once engaged is willing to be deceived loses sight of himself and without scruple enjoys the spectacle as a reality from this absent state he is roused by violent action he wakes as from a pleasing dream and gathering his senses about him finds all to be a fiction horace delivers the same rule and founds it upon the reason given ne pueros coram populo medea trucidet aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius atreus aut in avem progne vertatur cadmus in anguem quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi the french critics as it appears to me misapprehend the reason of this rule shedding blood upon the stage say they is barbarous and shocking to a polite audience this no doubt is an additional reason for excluding bloodshed from the french stage supposing the french to be in reality so delicate but this evidently is not the reason that weighed with the greeks that polite people had no notion of such delicacy witness the murder of clytemnestra by her son orestes passing behind the scene as represented by sophocles her voice is heard calling out for mercy bitter expostulations on his part loud shrieks upon her being stabbed and then a deep silence i appeal to every person of feeling whether this scene be not more horrible than if the deed had been committed in sight of the spectators upon a sudden gust of passion according to the foregoing reasoning of the french critics there is nothing to exclude from the stage a duel occasioned by an affair of honor because in it there is nothing barbarous or shocking to a polite audience yet a scene of this nature is excluded from the french stage which shows without more argument that these critics have misapprehended the rule laid down by horace if corneille in representing the affair betwixt horatius and his sister upon which murder ensues behind the scene had no other view than to remove from the spectators a scene of horror he certainly was in a capital mistake for murder in cold blood which in some measure was the case as represented is more horrible even where the conclusive stab is not seen than the same act performed on the stage by violent and unpremeditated passion as suddenly repented of as committed i heartily agree with addison spectator no     that no part of this incident ought to have been represented but reserved for a narrative with all the alleviating circumstances possible in favor of the hero this is the only method to avoid the difficulties that unqualify this incident for representation a deliberate murder on the one hand and on the other a violent action performed on the stage which must rouse the spectator from his dream of reality  i shall finish with a few words upon the dialogue which ought to be so conducted as to be a true representation of nature i talk not here of the sentiments nor of the language for these come under different heads i talk of what properly belongs to dialoguewriting where every single speech short or long ought to arise from what is said by the former speaker and furnish matter for what comes after till the end of the scene in this view the whole speeches from first to last represent so many links all connected together in one regular chain no author ancient or modern possesses the art of dialogue equal to shakespeare dryden in this particular may justly be placed as his opposite he frequently introduces three or four persons speaking upon the same subject each throwing out his own sentiments separately without regarding what is said by the rest i give for an example the first scene of aurenzebe sometimes he makes a number club in relating an event not to a stranger supposed ignorant of it but to one another for the sake merely of speaking of this notable sort of dialogue we have a specimen in the first scene of the first part of the conquest of granada in the second part of the same tragedy scene second the king abenamar and zulema make their separate observations like so many soliloquies upon the fluctuating temper of the mob it puts one in mind of a pastoral where two shepherds are introduced reciting couplets alternately each in praise of his own mistress as if they were contending for a prize  the bandying sentiments in this manner beside an unnatural air has another bad effect it stays the course of the action because it is not productive of any consequence in congreves comedies the action is often suspended to make way for a play of wit but of this more particularly in the chapter immediately following  chap xxiii the three unities the first chapter unfolds the pleasure we have in a chain of connected facts in histories of the world of a country of a people this pleasure is but faint because the connections are slight or obscure we find more entertainment in biography where the incidents are connected by their relation to one person who makes a figure and commands our attention but the greatest entertainment of the kind is afforded by the history of a single event supposing it to be interesting the history of one event produces a more entire connection among the parts than the history of one person in the latter the circumstances are not otherwise connected than by their relation to that person in the former the circumstances are connected by the strongest of all relations that of cause and effect thus the circumstances of a single event having a mutual connection extremely intimate form a delightful train we survey with peculiar pleasure a number of facts that give birth to each other and we pass with ease and satisfaction from the first to the last  but this subject merits a more particular discussion when we consider the chain of causes and effects in the material world independent of purpose design or thought we find a train of incidents in succession without beginning middle or end every thing that happens is both a cause and an effect it is the effect of something that goes before and the cause of one or many things that follow one incident may affect us more another less but all of them great and small are so many links in the universal chain the mind in viewing these incidents cannot rest or settle ultimately upon any one but is carried along in the train without any close  but when the intellectual world is taken under view in conjunction with the material the scene is varied man acts with deliberation will and choice he acts with a view to some end glory for example or riches or conquest the procuring happiness to individuals or to his country in general and he proposes means and lays schemes to attain the end proposed here is recognized a capital end or event connected with subordinate events or incidents by the relation of causation in running over a series of subordinate events we cannot rest upon any one because they are presented to us as means only leading to some end but we rest with satisfaction upon the ultimate event because there the purpose the plan the aim of the chief person or persons is completed and brought to a final conclusion this indicates a beginning a middle and an end of what aristotle calls an entire action poet cap   see also cap    the story naturally begins with describing those circumstances which move the distinguished person to form a plan in order to compass some desired event the prosecution of that plan and the obstructions carry the reader into the heat of action the middle is properly where the action is the most involved and the end is where the event is brought about and the design accomplished  a design or plan thus happily perfected after many obstructions affords wonderful delight to the reader and to produce this delight a principle mentioned above chap   mainly contributes a principle that disposes the mind to complete every work commenced and in general to carry every thing to its ultimate conclusion  i have given the foregoing example of a plan laid down and completed because it affords the clearest conception of a beginning a middle and an end in which consists unity of action and indeed stricter unity cannot be imagined than in this case but an action may have unity or a beginning middle and end without so intimate a relation of parts the catastrophe may be different from what is intended or desired which is frequently the case in our best tragedies the aeneid is an instance of means employed to produce a certain event and these means crowned with success the iliad is formed upon a different model it begins with the quarrel betwixt achilles and agamemnon it goes on to describe the several effects produced by that cause and ends in a reconciliation here is unity of action no doubt a beginning a middle and an end it must however be acknowledged that the aeneid is more happy in point of connection the mind has a propensity to go forward in the chain of history it keeps always in view the expected event and when the incidents or underparts are connected together by their relation to the event the mind runs sweetly and easily along them this pleasure we have in the aeneid but it is not altogether so pleasant as in the iliad to connect effects by their common cause for such connection forces the mind to a continual retrospect looking backward is like walking backward  but homers plan is still more imperfect for another reason that the events described are but imperfectly connected with the wrath of achilles as their cause his wrath did not exert itself in action and the misfortunes of his countrymen were but negatively the effects of his wrath by depriving them of his assistance  if unity of action be a capital beauty in a fable imitative of human affairs a double action must be a capital defect by carrying on together two trains of unconnected objects for the sake of variety we indulge an underplot that contributes to the principal event but two unconnected events are a great deformity and it lessens the deformity but a very little to engage the same actors in both ariosto is quite licentious in this particular he carries on at the same time a plurality of unconnected stories his only excuse is that his plan is perfectly well adjusted to his subject for every thing in the orlando furioso is wild and extravagant  to state facts according to the order of time is the most natural and the most simple method a method however not so essential in an historical fable especially as not to yield to some conspicuous beauties see chap    if a noted story cold and simple in its first movements be made the subject of an epic poem the reader may be hurried into the heat of action reserving the preliminaries for a conversationpiece if it shall be thought necessary this method at the same time being dramatic has a peculiar beauty which narration cannot reach see chap     romancewriters who give little attention to nature deviate in this particular among many from a just standard they make no difficulty of presenting to the reader without the least preparation unknown persons engaged in some adventure equally unknown in cassandra two personages who afterward are discovered to be the heroes of the story start up completely armed upon the banks of the euphrates and engage in a single combat i am sensible that a commencement of this sort is much relished by certain readers disposed to wonder their curiosity is raised and they are much tickled in its gratification but curiosity is at an end with the first reading because the personages are no longer unknown and therefore at the second reading a commencement so artificial loses all its power even over the vulgar a writer of genius loves to deal in lasting beauties   a play analyzed is a chain of connected facts of which each scene makes a link each scene accordingly ought to produce some incident relative to the catastrophe or ultimate event by advancing or retarding it if no incident be produced such a scene which may be termed barren ought not to be indulged because it breaks the unity of action a barren scene can never be entitled to a place because the chain is complete without it in the old bachelor the  d scene of act   and all that follow to the end of that act are mere conversationpieces without any consequence the  0th and   th scenes act   double dealer the  0th   th   th   th and   th scenes act   love for love are of the same kind neither is the way of the world entirely guiltless of such scenes it will be no justification that they help to display characters it were better like dryden in his dramatis personae to describe characters beforehand which would not interrupt the chain of action but a writer of genius has no occasion for such artifice he can display the characters of his personages much more to the life in sentiment and action how successfully is this done by shakespeare in whose works there is not to be found a single barren scene  upon the whole it appears that all the facts in an historical fable ought to have a mutual connection by their common relation to the grand event or catastrophe and this relation in which the unity of action consists is equally essential to epic and dramatic compositions  how far the unities of time and of place are essential is a question of greater intricacy these unities were strictly observed in the grecian and roman theaters and they are inculcated by the french and english critics as essential to every dramatic composition in theory these unities are also acknowledged by our best poets though their practice is seldom correspondent they are often forced to take liberties which they pretend not to justify against the practice of the greeks and romans and against the solemn decision of their own countrymen but in the course of this inquiry it will be made evident that the example of the ancients ought upon this point to have no weight with us and that our critics are guilty of a mistake in admitting no greater latitude of place and time than was admitted in greece and rome  suffer me only to premise that the unities of place and time are not by the most rigid critics required in a narrative poem in such a composition if it pretend to copy nature these unities would be absurd because real events are seldom confined within narrow limits either of place or of time and yet we can follow history or an historical fable through all its changes with the greatest facility we never once think of measuring the real time by what is taken in reading nor of forming any connection betwixt the place of action and that which we occupy  i am sensible that the drama differs so far from the epic as to admit different rules it will be observed that an historical fable which affords entertainment by reading solely is under no limitation of time or of place more than a genuine history but that a dramatic composition cannot be accurately represented unless it be limited as its representation is to one place and to a few hours and therefore that no fable can be admitted but what has these properties because it would be absurd to compose a piece for representation that cannot be justly represented this argument i acknowledge has at least a plausible appearance and yet one is apt to suspect some fallacy considering that no critic however strict has ventured to confine the unities of place and of time within so narrow bounds bossu after observing with wonderful critical sagacity that winter is an improper season for an epic poem and night not less improper for tragedy admits however that an epic poem may be spread through the whole summer months and a tragedy through the whole sunshine hours of the longest summerday du poem epique l   chap    at this rate an english tragedy may be longer than a french tragedy and in nova zembla the time of a tragedy and of an epic poem may be the same   a view of the grecian drama and a comparison betwixt it and our own may perhaps help to relieve us from this dilemma if they be differently constructed as shall by and by be made evident it is possible that the foregoing reasoning may not be applicable with equal force to both this is an article that with relation to the present subject has not so far as i know been examined by any writer  all authors agree that the first notion of tragedy in greece was derived from the hymns in praise of bacchus which were sung in parts by a chorus thespis to relieve the singers and for the sake of variety introduced one actor who gave a narrative of the subject and sometimes represented one or other personage eschylus introducing a second actor formed the dialogue by which the performance became dramatic and the actors were multiplied when the subject represented made it necessary but still the chorus which gave a beginning to tragedy was considered as an essential part of its constitution in the first scene generally are unfolded the preliminary circumstances that lead to the grand event this scene is by aristotle termed the prologue in the second scene where the action properly begins the chorus is introduced which as originally continues upon the stage during the whole performance sophocles adheres to this plan religiously euripides is not altogether so correct in some of his pieces it becomes necessary to remove the chorus but this is seldom done and when done matters are so ordered as that their absence is but momentary the chorus often mix in the dialogue and when the dialogue happens to be suspended the chorus during the interval is employed in singing nor does the removal of the chorus when that unusual step is risked interrupt the representation they never leave the stage of their own accord but at the command of some principal personage who constantly waits their return  thus the grecian drama is a continued representation without any interruption a circumstance that merits attention a continued representation without a pause affords not opportunity to vary the place of action and has withal a very short duration to a representation so confined in place and time the foregoing reasoning is strictly applicable a real or feigned action that is brought to a conclusion after considerable intervals of time and frequent change of place cannot accurately be copied in a representation that admits of no latitude in either hence it is that the unities of place and of time were or ought to have been strictly observed in the grecian tragedies this is made necessary by the very constitution of their drama for it is absurd to compose a tragedy that cannot be justly represented  modern critics who for our drama pretend to establish rules founded on the practice of the greeks are guilty of an egregious blunder the unities of place and of time so much vaunted were in greece as we see a matter of necessity not of choice i am now ready to show that if we submit to these fetters it must be from choice not necessity this will be evident upon taking a view of the construction of our drama which differs widely from that of greece whether more or less perfect is a separate question which shall be handled afterward by dropping the chorus an opportunity is afforded to split our drama into parts or acts which in the representation are distinguished by intervals of time and during these intervals the stage is totally evacuated and the spectacle suspended this construction qualifies our drama for subjects spread through a wide space both of time and of place the time supposed to pass during the suspension of the representation is not measured by the time of the suspension nor is any connection formed betwixt the box we sit in and the place where things are supposed to be transacted in our absence and by that means many subjects can be justly represented in our theaters for which there was no place in those of ancient greece this doctrine may be illustrated by comparing a modern play to a set of historical pictures let us suppose them five in number and the resemblance will be complete each of the pictures resembles an act in one of our plays there must necessarily be the strictest unity of place and of time in each picture and the same necessity requires these two unities during each act of a play because during an act there is no interruption in the spectacle now when we view in succession a number of such historical pictures let it be for example the history of alexander by le brun we have no difficulty to conceive that months or years have passed betwixt the subjects exhibited in two different pictures though the interruption is imperceptible in passing our eye from the one to the other we have as little difficulty to conceive a change of place however great in this matter there is truly no difference betwixt five acts of a modern play and five such pictures where the representation is suspended we can with the greatest facility suppose any length of time or any change of place the spectator it is true may be conscious that the real time and place are not the same with what are employed in the representation even including the intervals but this is a work of reflection and by the same reflection he may also be conscious that garrick is not king lear that the playhouse is not dover cliffs nor the noise he hears thunder and lightning in a word during an interruption of the representation it is not more difficult for a spectator to imagine himself carried from place to place and from one period of time to another than at once when the scene first opens to be carried from london to rome or from the present time two thousand years back and indeed it must appear ridiculous that a critic who makes no difficulty of supposing candlelight to be sunshine and some painted canvasses a palace or a prison should affect so much difficulty in imagining a latitude of place or of time in the story beyond what is necessary in the representation  there are i acknowledge some effects of great latitude in time that ought never to be indulged in a composition for the theater nothing can be more absurd than at the close to exhibit a full grown person who appears a child at the beginning the mind rejects as contrary to all probability such latitude of time as is requisite for a change so remarkable the greatest change from place to place has not altogether the same bad effect in the bulk of human affairs place is not material and the mind when occupied with an interesting event is little regardful of minute circumstances these may be varied at will because they scarce make any impression  but though i have thus taken arms to rescue modern poets from the slavish fetters of modern critics i would not be understood to justify liberty without any reserve an unbounded license with relation to place and time is faulty for a reason that seems to have been overlooked it never fails to break in upon the unity of action in the ordinary course of human affairs single events such as are fit to be represented on the stage are confined to a narrow spot and generally employ no great extent of time we accordingly seldom find strict unity of action in a dramatic composition where any remarkable latitude is indulged in these particulars i must say farther that a composition which employs but one place and requires not a greater length of time than is necessary for the representation is so far the more perfect because the confining an event within so narrow bounds contributes to the unity of action and also prevents that labor however slight which the mind must undergo in imagining frequent changes of place and many intervals of time but still i must insist that the limitation of place and time which was necessary in the grecian drama is no rule to us and therefore that though such limitation adds one beauty more to the composition it is at best but a refinement which may justly give place to a thousand beauties more substantial and i may add that it is extremely difficult i was about to say impracticable to contract within the grecian limits any fable so fruitful of incidents in number and variety as to give full scope to the fluctuation of passion  it may now appear that critics who put the unities of place and of time upon the same footing with the unity of action making them all equally essential have not attended to the nature and construction of the modern drama if they admit an interrupted representation with which no writer finds fault it is plainly absurd to condemn the greatest advantage it procures us that of representing many interesting subjects excluded from the grecian stage if there needs must be a reformation why not restore the ancient chorus and the ancient continuity of action there is certainly no medium for to admit an interruption without relaxing from the strict unities of place and of time is in effect to load us with all the inconveniences of the ancient drama and at the same time to withold from us its advantages  and therefore the only proper question is whether our model be or be not a real improvement this indeed may justly be called in question and in order to a fair comparative trial some particulars must be premised when a play begins we have no difficulty to enter into the scene of action however distant it be in time or in place we know that the play is a representation only and the imagination with facility accommodates itself to every circumstance our situation is very different after we are engaged it is the perfection of representation to hide itself to impose upon the spectator and to produce in him an impression of reality as if he were spectator of a real event chap   part   sect    any interruption annihilates this impression he is roused out of his waking dream and unhappily restored to his senses so difficult it is to support this impression of reality that much slighter interruptions than the interval betwixt two acts are sufficient to dissolve the charm in the  th act of the mourning bride the three first scenes are in a room of state the fourth in a prison this change is operated by shifting the scene which is done in a trice but however quick the transition may be it is impracticable to impose upon the spectators so far as to make them conceive that they are actually carried from the palace to the prison they immediately reflect that the palace and prison are imaginary and that the whole is a fiction  from these premises one will be naturally led at first view to declare against the frequent interruptions in the modern drama it will occur that every interruption must have the effect to banish the dream of reality and with it to banish our concern which cannot subsist while we are conscious that all is a fiction and therefore that in the modern drama sufficient time is not afforded for the fluctuation and swelling of passion like what is afforded in the grecian drama where there is no interruption this reasoning it must be owned has a specious appearance but we must not turn fainthearted upon the first repulse let us rally our troops for a second engagement  considering attentively the ancient drama we find that though the representation is never interrupted the principal action is suspended not less frequently than in the modern drama there are five acts in each and the only difference is that in the former when the action is suspended as it is at the end of every act opportunity is taken of the interval to employ the chorus in singing hence it appears that the grecian continuity of representation cannot have the effect to prolong the impression of reality to banish this impression a suspension of the action while the chorus is employed in singing is not less operative than a total suspension both of the representation and action  but to open a larger view i am ready to show that a continued representation without a single pause even in the principal action so far from an advantage would be really an imperfection and that a representation with proper pauses is better calculated for moving the audience and making the strongest impressions representation cannot very long support an impression of reality when the spirits are exhausted by close attention and by the agitation of passion an uneasiness ensues which never fails to banish the waking dream now supposing an act to employ as much time as can easily be given with strict attention to any incident a supposition that cannot be far from the truth it follows that the impression of reality would not be prolonged beyond the space of an act even supposing a continued representation hence it appears that a continued representation without any pause would be a bad contrivance it would break the attention by overstraining it and produce a total absence of mind in this respect the four pauses have a fine effect by affording to the audience a seasonable respite when the impression of reality is gone and while nothing material is in agitation they relieve the mind from its fatigue and consequently prevent a wandering of thought at the very time possibly of the most interesting scenes  in one article indeed the grecian model has greatly the advantage its chorus during an interval not only preserves alive the impressions made upon the audience but also prepares their hearts finely for new impressions in our theaters on the contrary the audience at the end of every act are in a manner solicited to withdraw their thoughts from what has been passing and to trifle away the time the best way they can thus in the intervals betwixt the acts every warm impression is banished and the spectators begin the next act cool and indifferent as at the commencement of the play here is a gross malady in our theatrical representations but a malady that luckily is not incurable to revive the grecian chorus would be to revive the grecian slavery of place and time but i can figure a detached chorus coinciding with a pause in the representation as the ancient chorus did with a pause in the principal action what objection for example can there lie against music betwixt the acts vocal and instrumental adapted to the subject such detached chorus beside admitting the same latitude that we enjoy at present as to time and place would have more than one happy effect it would recruit the spirits and it would preserve entire the tone if not the tide of passion the music that comes first ought to accord with the tone of the preceding passion and be gradually varied till it accord with the tone of the passion that is to succeed in the next act the music and the representation would both of them be gainers by their conjunction which will thus appear music that accords with the present tone of mind is upon that account doubly agreeable and accordingly though music singly has not power to raise any passion it tends greatly to support a passion already raised further music though it cannot of itself raise a passion prepares us for the passion that follows by making cheerful tender melancholy or animated impressions music has power to dispose the heart to various passions of this power the first scene of the mourning bride is a shining instance without the preparation of soft music in a melancholy strain it would be extremely difficult to enter all at once into almerias deep distress in this manner music and representation support each other delightfully the impression made upon the audience by the representation is a fine preparation for the music that succeeds and the impression made by the music is a fine preparation for the representation that succeeds it appears to me clear that by some such contrivance the modern drama may be improved so as to enjoy the advantage of the ancient chorus without its slavish limitation of place and time and as to music in particular i cannot figure any plan that would tend more to its improvement composers those for the stage at least would be reduced to the happy necessity of studying and imitating nature instead of indulging according to the present fashion in wild fantastic and unnatural conceits but we must return to our subject and finish the comparison betwixt the ancient and the modern drama  the numberless improprieties forced upon the grecian dramatic poets by the constitution of their drama are of themselves one should think a sufficient reason for preferring that of the moderns even abstracting from the improvement proposed to prepare the reader for this article it must be premised that as in the ancient drama the place of action never varies a place necessarily must be chosen to which every person may have access without any improbability this confines the scene to some open place generally the court or area before a palace which excludes from the grecian theater transactions within doors though these commonly are the most important such cruel restraint is of itself sufficient to cramp the most pregnant invention and accordingly the grecian writers in order to preserve unity of place are reduced to woeful improprieties in the hippolytus of euripides act   sc    phedra distressed in mind and body is carried without any pretext from her palace to the place of action is there laid upon a couch unable to support herself upon her limbs and made to utter many things improper to be heard by a number of women who form the chorus what is still worse her female attendant uses the strongest entreaties to make her reveal the secret cause of her anguish which at last phedra contrary to decency and probability is prevailed upon to do in presence of this very chorus act   sc    alcestes in euripides at the point of death is brought from the palace to the place of action groaning and lamenting her untimely fate act   sc    in the trachiniens of sophocles act    a secret is imparted to dejanira the wife of hercules in presence of the chorus in the tragedy of iphigenia the messenger employed to carry clitemnestra the news that iphigenia was sacrificed stops short at the place of action and with a loud voice calls the queen from her palace to hear the news again in the iphigenia in tauris the necessary presence of the chorus forces euripides into a gross absurdity which is to form a secret plot in their hearing act   at the close  and to disguise the absurdity much courtship is bestowed on the chorus not one woman but a number to engage them to secrecy in the medea of euripides that princess makes no difficulty in presence of the chorus to plot the death of her husband of his mistress and of her father the king of corinth all by poison it was necessary to bring medea upon the stage and there is but one place of action which is always occupied by the chorus this scene closes the second act and in the end of the third she frankly makes the chorus her confidents in ploting the murder of her own children terence by identity of place is often forced to make a conversation within doors be heard on the open street the cries of a woman in labor are there heard distinctly  the grecian poets are not more happy with respect to time than with respect to place in the hippolytus of euripides that prince is banished at the end of the fourth act in the first scene of the following act a messenger relates to theseus the whole particulars of the death of hippolytus by the sea monster this remarkable event must have employed many hours and yet in the representation it is confined to the time employed by the chorus upon the song at the end of the  th act the inconsistency is still greater in the iphigenia in tauris act   sc    the song could not exhaust half an hour and yet the incidents supposed to have happened in that time could not naturally be transacted in less than half a day  the grecian artists are not less frequently obliged to transgress another rule derived also from a continued representation which is that the place of action must constantly be occupied for the very least vacuity is an interruption of the representation sophocles with regard to this rule as well as others is generally correct but euripides cannot bear such restraint he often evacuates the stage and leaves it empty for others in succession iphigenia in tauris after pronouncing a soliloquy in the first scene leaves the place of action and is succeeded by orestes and pylades they after some conversation walk off and iphigenia reenters accompanied with the chorus in the alcestes which is of the same author the place of action is void at the end of the third act it is true that to cover this irregularity and to preserve the representation in motion euripides is extremely careful to fill the stage without loss of time but this is still an interruption and a link of the chain broken for during the change of the actors there must always be a space of time when we cannot justly say that the stage is occupied by either set it makes indeed a more remarkable interruption to change the place of action as well as the actors but that was not practicable upon the grecian stage  it is hard to say upon what model terence has formed his plays having no chorus there is a cessation in the representation at the end of every act but advantage is not taken of this cessation even to vary the place of action the street is always chosen where every thing passing may be seen by every person and by this choice the most sprightly and interesting parts of the action which commonly pass within doors are excluded witness the last act of the eunuch he has submitted to the same slavery with respect to time in a word a play with a regular chorus is not more confined in place and time than his plays are thus a zealous sectary follows implicitly ancient forms and ceremonies without once considering whether their introductive cause be still subsisting plautus of a bolder genius than terence makes good use of the liberty afforded by an interrupted representation he varies the place of action upon all occasions when the variation suits his purpose  the intelligent reader will by this time understand that i plead for no change of place in our plays but after an interval nor for any latitude in point of time but what falls in with an interval the unities of place and time ought to be strictly observed during each act for during the representation there is no opportunity for the smallest deviation from either hence it is an essential requisite that during an act the stage be always occupied for even a momentary vacuity makes an interval another rule is not less essential it would be a gross breach of the unity of action to exhibit upon the stage two separate actions at the same time and therefore to preserve this unity it is necessary that each personage introduced during an act be linked to those in possession of the stage so as to join all in one action these things follow from the very conception of an act which admits not the slightest interruption the moment the representation is intermitted there is an end of that act and we have no other notion of a new act but where after a pause or interval the representation is again put in motion french writers generally speaking are extremely correct in this particular the english on the contrary are so irregular as scarce to deserve a criticism actors not only succeed each other in the same place without connection but what is still worse they frequently succeed each other in different places this change of place in the same act ought never to be indulged for beside breaking the unity of the act it has a disagreeable effect after an interval the mind can readily accommodate itself to any place that is necessary just as readily as at the commencement of the play but during the representation the mind rejects change of place from the foregoing censure must be excepted the mourning bride of congreve where regularity concurs with the beauty of sentiment and of language to make it one of the most complete pieces england has to boast of i must acknowledge however that in point of regularity this elegant performance is not altogether unexceptionable in the four first acts the unities of place and time are strictly observed but in the last act there is a capital error with respect to unity of place in the three first scenes of that act the place of action is a room of state which is changed to a prison in the fourth scene the chain of the actors withal is broken for the persons introduced in the prison are different from those who made their appearance in the room of state this remarkable interruption of the representation makes in effect two acts instead of one and therefore if it be a rule that a play ought not to consist of more acts than five this performance is so far defective in point of regularity i may add that even admitting six acts the irregularity would not be altogether removed without a longer pause in the representation than is allowed in the acting for it requires more than a momentary interruption to enable the imagination readily to accommodate itself to a new place or to prorogation of time in the way of the world of the same author unity of place is preserved during every act and a stricter unity of time during the whole play than is necessary  chap xxiv gardening and architecture the books that have been composed upon architecture and upon embellishing ground abound in practical instruction necessary for a mechanic but in vain would we rummage them for rational principles to improve our taste in a general system it might be thought sufficient to have unfolded the principles that govern these and other fine arts leaving the application to the reader but as i would neglect no opportunity of illustrating these principles i propose to give a specimen of their application to gardening and architecture being favorite arts though i profess no peculiar skill in either  gardening was at first an useful art in the garden of alcinoous described by homer we find nothing done for pleasure merely but gardening is now improved into a fine art and when we talk of a garden without any epithet a pleasure garden by way of eminence is understood the garden of alcinoous in modern language was but a kitchengarden architecture has run the same course it continued many ages an useful art merely before it aspired to be classed with the fine arts architecture therefore and gardening must be handled in a twofold view as being useful arts as well as fine arts the reader however will not here expect rules for improving any work of art in point of utility it is no part of my plan to treat of any useful art as such but there is a beauty in utility and in discoursing of beauty that of utility ought not to be neglected this leads us to consider gardens and buildings in different views they may be destined for use solely for beauty solely or for both such variety in the destination bestows upon gardening and architecture a great command of beauties complex not less than various which makes it difficult to form an accurate taste in these arts and hence that difference and wavering of taste which is more remarkable here than in any art that has but a single destination  architecture and gardening cannot otherwise entertain the mind than by raising certain agreeable emotions or feelings and before we descend to particulars these arts shall be presented in a general view by showing what are the emotions or feelings that can be raised by them poetry as to its power of raising emotions possesses justly the first place among the fine arts for scarce one emotion of human nature is beyond its reach painting and sculpture are more circumscribed having the command of no emotions but what are produced by sight they are peculiarly successful in expressing painful passions which are displayed by external signs extremely legible see chap     gardening beside the emotions of beauty by means of regularity order proportion color and utility can raise emotions of grandeur of sweetness of gaiety melancholy wildness and even of surprise or wonder in architecture regularity order and proportion and the beauties that result from them are still more conspicuous than in gardening but with respect to the beauty of color architecture is far inferior grandeur can be expressed in a building perhaps more successfully than in a garden but as to the other emotions above mentioned architecture hitherto has not been brought to the perfection of expressing them distinctly to balance this defect architecture can display the beauty of utility in the highest perfection  but gardening possesses one advantage which never can be equalled in the other art a garden may be so contrived as in various scenes to raise successively all its different emotions but to operate this delicious effect the garden must be extensive so as to admit a slow succession for a small garden comprehended at one view ought to be confined to one expression see chap    it may be gay it may be sweet it may be gloomy but an attempt to mix these would create a jumble of emotions not a little unpleasant for the same reason a building even the most magnificent is necessarily confined to one expression  architecture considered as a fine art instead of rivaling gardening in its progress toward perfection seems not far advanced beyond its infantstate to bring it to maturity two things mainly are wanted first a greater variety of parts and ornaments than it seems provided with gardening here has greatly the advantage it is provided with such plenty and such variety of materials that it must be the fault of the artists if the spectator be not entertained with different scenes and affected with various emotions but materials in architecture are so scanty that artists hitherto have not been successful in raising emotions other than those of beauty and grandeur with respect to the former there are indeed plenty of means regularity order symmetry simplicity and with respect to the latter the addition of size is sufficient but though it be evident that every building ought to have a certain character or expression suitable to its destination yet this is a refinement which artists have scarce ventured upon a deaths head and bones employed in monumental buildings will indeed produce an emotion of gloom and melancholy but every ornament of this kind if these can be termed so ought to be rejected because they are in themselves disagreeable the other thing wanted to bring the art to perfection is to ascertain the precise impression made by every single part and ornament cupolas spires columns carvings statues vases etc for in vain will an artist attempt rules for employing these either singly or in combination until the different emotions or feelings they produce be distinctly explained gardening in this particular has also the advantage the several emotions raised by trees rivers cascades plains eminences and other materials it employs are understood and the nature of each can be described with some degree of precision which is done occasionally in the foregoing parts of this work  in gardening as well as in architecture simplicity ought to be the governing taste profuse ornament has no better effect than to confound the eye and to prevent the object from making an impression as one entire whole an artist destitute of genius for capital beauties is naturally prompted to supply the defect by crowding his plan with slight embellishments hence in gardens triumphal arches chinese houses temples obelisks cascades fountains without end and hence in buildings pillars vases statues and a profusion of carved work thus a woman who has no just taste is apt to overcharge every part of her dress with ornament superfluity of decoration has another bad effect it gives the object a diminutive look an island in a wide extended lake makes it appear larger but an artificial lake which must always be little appears still less by making an island in it see appendix to part   chap     in forming plans for embellishing a field an artist void of taste deals in straight lines circles squares because these show best upon paper he perceives not that to humor and adorn nature is the perfection of his art and that nature neglecting regularity reaches superior beauties by distributing her objects in great variety with a bold hand a large field laid out with strict regularity is stiff and artificial nature indeed in organized bodies comprehended under one view studies regularity which for the same reason ought to be studied in architecture but in large objects which cannot otherwise be surveyed than in parts and by succession regularity and uniformity would be useless properties because they cannot be discovered by the eye a square field appears not such to the eye when viewed from any part of it and the center is the only place where a circular field preserves in appearance its real figure  nature therefore in her large works neglects these properties and in copying nature the artist ought to neglect them  having thus far carried on a comparison betwixt gardening and architecture i proceed to rules peculiar to each and i begin with gardening the simplest idea of a garden is that of a spot embellished with a number of natural objects trees walks polished parterres flowers streams etc one more complex comprehends statues and buildings that nature and art may be mutually ornamental a third approaching nearer perfection is of objects assembled together in order to produce not only an emotion of beauty essential to gardens of every kind but also some other particular emotion grandeur for example gaiety or any other of those above mentioned the most perfect idea of a garden is an improvement upon the third requiring the adjustment of the several parts in such a manner as to inspire all the different emotions that can be raised by gardening in this idea of a garden the arrangement is an important circumstance for it has been shown that some emotions figure best in conjunction and that others ought always to appear in succession and never in conjunction i have had occasion to observe above chap    that when the most opposite emotions such as gloominess and gaiety stillness and activity follow each other in succession the pleasure on the whole will be the greatest but that opposite or dissimilar emotions ought not to be united because they produce an unpleasant mixture chap   part    for that reason a ruin affording a sort of melancholy pleasure ought not to be seen from a flowerparterre which is gay and cheerful but to pass immediately from an exhilerating object to a ruin has a glorious effect for each of the emotions is the more sensibly felt by being contrasted with the other similar emotions on the other hand such as gaiety and sweetness stillness and gloominess motion and grandeur ought to be raised together for their effects upon the mind are greatly heightened by their conjunction see the place immediately above cited   kents method of embellishing a field is admirable it is painting a field with beautiful objects natural and artificial disposed like colors upon a canvas it requires indeed more genius to paint in the gardening way in forming a landscape upon a canvas no more is required but to adjust the figures to each other an artist who lays out ground in kents manner has an additional task which is to adjust his figures to the several varieties of the field  one garden must be distinguished from a plurality and yet it is not obvious wherein the unity of a garden consists a notion of unity is indeed suggested from viewing a garden surrounding a palace with views from each window and walks leading to every corner but there may be a garden without a house in this case i must pronounce that what makes it one garden is the unity of design every single spot appearing part of a whole the gardens of versailles properly expressed in the plural number being no fewer than sixteen are indeed all of them connected with the palace but have scarce any mutual connection they appear not like parts of one whole but rather like small gardens in contiguity were these gardens at some distance from each other they would have a better effect their junction breeds confusion of ideas and upon the whole gives less pleasure than would be felt in a slower succession  regularity is required in that part of a garden which joins the dwelling house for being considered as a more immediate accessory it ought to partake the regularity of the principal object the influence of this connection surpassing all bounds is visible in many gardens left in their original form of horizontal plains forced with great labor and expense perpendicular faces of earth supported with massy stone walls terracewalks in stages one above another regular ponds and canals without the least motion and the whole surrounded like a prison with high walls excluding every external object at first view it may puzzle one to account for a taste running cross to nature in every particular but nothing happens without a cause perfect regularity and uniformity are required in a house and this idea is extended to its accessory the garden especially if it be a small spot incapable of grandeur or much variety the house is regular so must the garden be the floors of the house are horizontal and the garden must have the same position in the house we are protected from every intruding eye so must we be in the garden this it must be confessed is carrying the notion of resemblance very far but where reason and taste are laid asleep nothing is more common than to carry resemblance beyond proper bounds  but in proportion to the distance from the house considered as the center regularity ought less and less to be studied in an extensive plan it has a fine effect to lead the mind insensibly from regularity to a bold variety giving an impression of grandeur and grandeur ought to be studied as much as possible even in a more confined plan by avoiding a multiplicity of small parts see chap    nothing contributes more to grandeur than a right disposition of trees let them be scattered extremely thin near the dwelling house and thickened in proportion to their distance distant eminences to be filled with trees and laid open to view a small garden on the other hand which admits not grandeur ought to be strictly regular  milton describing the garden of eden prefers justly the grand taste to that of regularity flowers worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots but nature boon poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field and where the unpiercd shade imbrownd the noontidebowrs paradise lost b    in the manner of planting a wood or thicket much art may be displayed a common center of walks termed a star from whence are seen a number of remarkable objects appears too artificial to be agreeable the crowding withal so many objects together lessens the pleasure that would be felt in a slower succession abandoning therefore the star being stiff and formal let us try to substitute some form more natural that will lay open all the remarkable objects in the neighborhood this may be done by openings in the wood at various distances which in walking bring successively under the eye every object as by accident some openings display single objects some a plurality in a line and some a rapid succession of them in this plan the mind at intervals is roused and cheared by agreeable objects and the scene is greatly heightened by the surprise it occasions when we stumble as it were upon objects of which we had no expectation  as gardening is not an inventive art but an imitation of nature or rather nature itself ornamented it follows necessarily that every thing unnatural ought to be rejected with disdain statues of wild beasts vomiting water a common ornament in gardens prevails in those of versailles is this ornament in a good taste a jet deau being purely artificial may without disgust be tortured into a thousand shapes but a representation of what really exists in nature admits not any unnatural circumstance these statues therefore in the gardens of versailles must be condemned and yet so insensible has the artist been to just imitation as to have displayed his vicious taste without the least color or disguise a lifeless statue of an animal pouring out water may be endured without much disgust but here the lions and wolves are put in violent action each has seized its prey a deer or a lamb in act to devour and yet instead of extended claws and open mouth the whole as by a hocuspocus trick is converted into a different scene the lion forgetting his prey pours out water plentifully and the deer forgetting its danger performs the same operation a representation not less absurd than that in the opera where alexander the great after mounting the wall of a town besieged turns about and entertains his army with a song  in gardening every lively exhibition of what is beautiful in nature has a fine effect on the other hand distant and faint imitations are displeasing to every one of taste the cutting evergreens in the shape of animals is a very ancient practice as appears from the epistles of pliny who seems to be a great admirer of this puerile conceit the propensity to imitation gave birth to this practice and has supported it wonderfully long considering how faint and insipid the imitation is but the vulgar great and small devoid of taste are entertained with the oddness and singularity of a resemblance however distant betwixt a tree and an animal an attempt in the gardens of versailles to imitate a grove of trees by a group of jets deau appears for the same reason not less ridiculous  in laying out a garden every thing trivial or whimsical ought to be avoided is a labyrinth then to be justified it is a mere conceit like that of composing verses in the shape of an axe or an egg the walks and hedges may be agreeable but in the form of a labyrinth they serve to no end but to puzzle a riddle is a conceit not so mean because the solution is a proof of sagacity which affords no aid in tracing a labyrinth  the gardens of versailles executed with infinite expense by men at that time in high repute are a lasting monument of a taste the most vicious and depraved the faults above mentioned instead of being avoided are chosen as beauties and multiplied without end nature it would seem was deemed too vulgar to be imitated in the works of a magnificent monarch and for that reason preference was given to things unnatural which probably were mistaken for supernatural i have often amused myself with a fanciful resemblance betwixt these gardens and the arabian tales each of them is a performance intended for the amusement of a great king in the sixteen gardens of versailles there is no unity of design more than in the thousand and one arabian tales and lastly they are equally unnatural groves of jets deau statues of animals conversing in the manner of aesop water issuing out of the mouths of wild beasts give an impression of fairyland and witchcraft not less than diamondpalaces invisible rings spells and incantations  a straight road is the most agreeable because it shortens the journey but in an embellished field a straight walk has an air of stiffness and confinement and at any rate is less agreeable than a winding or waving walk for in surveying the beauties of a fine field we love to roam from place to place at freedom winding walks have another advantage at every step they open new views in short the walks in a field intended for entertainment ought not to have any appearance of a road my intention is not to make a journey but to feast my eye with the beauties of art and nature this rule excludes not long straight openings terminating upon distant objects these beside variety never fail to raise an emotion of grandeur by extending in appearance the size of the field an opening without a terminating object soon closes upon the eye but an object at whatever distance continues the opening and deludes the spectator into a conviction that the trees which confine the view are continued till they join the object straight walks also in recesses do extremely well they vary the scenery and are favorable to meditation  an avenue ought not to be directed in a straight line upon a dwelling house better far an oblique approach in a waving line with single trees and other scattered objects interposed in a direct approach the first appearance continues the same to the end we see a house at a distance and we see it all along in the same spot without any variety in an oblique approach the intervening objects put the house seemingly in motion it moves with the passenger and appears to direct its course so as hospitably to intercept him an oblique approach contributes also to variety the house being seen successively in different directions takes on at every step a new figure  a garden on a flat ought to be highly and variously ornamented in order to occupy the mind and prevent its regretting the insipidity of an uniform plain artificial mounts in this view are common but no person has thought of an artificial walk elevated high above the plain such a walk is airy and tends to elevate the mind it extends and varies the prospect and it makes the plain seen from a height appear more agreeable  whether should a ruin be in the gothic or grecian form in the former i say because it exhibits the triumph of time over strength a melancholy but not unpleasant thought a grecian ruin suggests rather the triumph of barbarity over taste a gloomy and discouraging thought  fountains are seldom in a good taste statues of animals vomiting water which prevail every where stand condemned a statue of a whale spouting water upward from its head would in one sense be natural as whales of a certain species have that power the design however would scarce be relished because its singularity would give it the appearance of being unnatural there is another reason against it that the figure of a whale is in itself not agreeable in the many fountains in and about rome statues of fishes are frequently employed to support a large basin of water this unnatural conceit cannot be otherwise explained than by the connection betwixt water and the fish that swim in it which by the way is a proof of the influence that even the slighter connections have on the mind the only good design for a fountain i have met with is what follows in an artificial rock rugged and abrupt there is a cavity out of sight at the top the water conveyed to it by a pipe pours or trickles down the broken parts of the rock and is collected into a basin at the foot it is so contrived as to make the water fall in sheets or in rills at pleasure  hitherto a garden has been treated as a work intended solely for pleasure or in other words for giving impressions of intrinsic beauty what comes next in order is the beauty of a garden destined for use termed relative beauty see these terms defined chap    and this branch shall be dispatched in a few words in gardening luckily relative beauty need never stand in opposition to intrinsic beauty all the ground that can be requisite for use makes but a small proportion of an ornamented field and may be put in any corner without obstructing the disposition of the capital parts at the same time a kitchengarden or an orchard is susceptible of intrinsic beauty and may be so artfully disposed among the other parts as by variety and contrast to contribute to the beauty of the whole in this respect architecture is far more intricate as will be seen immediately for there it being often requisite to blend intrinsic and relative beauty in the same building it becomes a difficult task to attain both in any perfection  as gardening is brought to greater perfection in china than in any other known country an account of the means practiced by chinese artists to inspire all the various emotions of gardening will be a fine illustration of the foregoing doctrine in general it is an indispensable law with them never to deviate from nature but in order to produce that degree of variety which is pleasing every method is used that is consistent with nature nature is strictly imitated in the banks of their artificial lakes and rivers which sometimes are bare and gravelly sometimes covered with wood quite to the brink of the water to flat spots adorned with flowers and shrubs are opposed others steep and rocky we see meadows covered with cattle ricegrounds that run into the lakes groves into which enter navigable creeks and rivulets these generally conduct to some interesting object a magnificent building terraces cut in a mountain a cascade a grotto an artificial rock and other such inventions their artificial rivers are generally serpentine sometimes narrow noisy and rapid sometimes deep broad and slow and to make the scene still more active mills and other moving machines are often erected in the lakes are interspersed islands some barren surrounded with rocks and shoals others enriched with every thing that art and nature can furnish even in their cascades they avoid regularity as forcing nature out of its course the waters are seen bursting out from among the caverns and windings of the artificial rocks here an impetuous cataract there many lesser falls and in its passage the water is often impeded by trees and heaps of stones that seem brought down by the violence of the current straight lines generally avoided are sometimes indulged in order to take the advantage of any interesting object at a distance by directing openings upon it  sensible of the influence of contrast the chinese artists deal in sudden transitions and in opposing to each other forms colors and shades the eye is conducted from limited to extensive views and from lakes and rivers to plains hills and woods to dark and gloomy colors are opposed the more brilliant the different masses of light and shade are disposed in such a manner as to render the composition distinct in its parts and striking on the whole in plantations the trees are artfully mixed according to their shape and color those of spreading branches with the pyramidal and the light with the deep green they even introduce decayed trees some erect and some half out of the ground taste has suggested to kent the same artifice the placing a decayed tree properly contributes to contrast and also produces a sort of pity grounded on an imaginary personification  in order to heighten contrast much bolder strokes are risked they sometimes introduce rough rocks dark caverns trees ill formed and seemingly rent by tempests or blasted by lightning a building in ruins or half consumed by fire but to relieve the mind from the harshness of such objects they are always succeeded by the sweetest and most beautiful scenes  the chinese study to give play to the imagination they hide the termination of their lakes the view of a cascade is frequently interrupted by trees through which are seen obscurely the waters as they fall the imagination once roused is disposed to magnify every object  nothing is more studied in chinese gardens than to raise wonder or surprise in scenes calculated for that end every thing appears like fairyland a torrent for example conveyed under ground producing an uncommon sound that puzzles a stranger to guess what it may be and to increase our wonder by multiplying such uncommon sounds the rocks and buildings are contrived with cavities and interstices sometimes one is led insensibly into dark caverns terminating unexpectedly in a landscape enriched with all that nature affords the most delicious at other times beautiful walks insensibly conduct us to a rough uncultivated field where bushes briers and stones interrupt the passage when we look about for an outlet some rich prospect unexpectedly opens to view another artifice is to obscure some capital part by trees or other interposed objects our curiosity is raised to know what lies beyond and after a few steps we are greatly surprised with some scene totally different from what was expected  i close these cursory observations upon gardening with a remark that must touch every reader rough uncultivated ground dismal to the eye inspires peevishness and discontent may not this be one cause of the harsh manners of savages in a field richly ornamented are collected beautiful objects of various kinds such a field displays in full luster the goodness of the deity and the ample provision he has made for our happiness which must fill every spectator with gratitude to his maker and with benevolence to his fellow creatures other fine arts may be perverted to excite irregular and even vicious emotions but gardening which inspires the purest and most refined pleasures cannot but promote every good affection the gaiety and harmony of mind it produces must naturally incline the spectator to communicate his satisfaction to others by acts of humanity and kindness  having finished what occurred on gardening i proceed to rules and observations that more peculiarly concern architecture architecture being an useful as well as a fine art buildings and parts of buildings must be distinguished into three kinds viz what are intended for utility solely what for ornament solely and what for both a building intended for utility solely such as detached offices ought in every part to correspond precisely to that intention the least deviation from use though contributing to ornament will be disagreeable for every work of use being considered as a means to an end its perfection as a means is the capital circumstance and every other beauty in opposition is neglected as improper and impertinent in things again intended for ornament such as pillars obelisks triumphal arches beauty solely ought to be regarded a heathen temple must be considered as merely ornamental for being dedicated to some deity and not intended for habitation it is susceptible of any figure and any embellishment that fancy can suggest and beauty require the great difficulty of contrivance respects buildings that are intended for pleasure as well as for use these ends employing different and often opposite means are with difficulty reconciled in palaces and other buildings sufficiently extensive to admit a variety of useful contrivance regularity justly takes the lead but in dwellinghouses that are too small for variety of contrivance utility ought to prevail neglecting regularity so far as it stands in opposition to convenience  intrinsic and relative beauty being founded on different principles must be handled separately and i begin with relative beauty as of the greater importance  the proportions of a door are determined by the use to which it is destined the door of a dwelling house which ought to correspond to the human size is confined to seven or eight feet in height and three or four in breadth the proportions proper for the door of a barn or coachhouse are widely different another consideration enters to study intrinsic beauty in a coachhouse or barn intended merely for use is obviously improper but a dwelling house may admit ornaments and the principal door of a palace demands all the grandeur that is consistent with the foregoing proportions dictated by utility it ought to be elevated and approached by steps and it may be adorned with pillars supporting an architrave or in any other beautiful manner the door of a church ought to be wide in order to afford an easy passage for a multitude the wideness at the same time regulates the height as will appear by and by the size of windows ought to be proportioned to that of the room they serve with light for if the apperture be not sufficiently large to convey light to every corner the room is dark and gloomy steps of stairs ought to be accommodated to the human figure without regarding any other proportion these steps accordingly are the same in large and in small buildings because both are inhabited by men of the same size  i proceed to consider intrinsic beauty blended with that which is relative a cube in itself is more agreeable than a parallelopipedon which will constantly hold in small figures but a large building in the form a cube appears lumpish and heavy while the other figure set on its smaller base is by its elevation more agreeable and hence the beauty of a gothic tower but let us suppose this parallelopipedon destined for a dwelling house to make way for relative beauty here utility prevails over elevation and a parallelopipedon inconvenient by its height is set upon its larger base the loftiness is gone but that loss is more than compensated by additional convenience and for that reason the form of a building spread more upon the ground than raised in height is always preferred for a dwelling house without excepting even the most sumptuous palace  with respect to the divisions within utility requires that the rooms be rectangular for otherwise void spaces will be left of no use a hexagonal figure leaves no void spaces but then it determines the rooms to be all of one size which is extremely inconvenient a cube will at first be pronounced the most agreeable figure and this may hold in a room of a moderate size but in a very large room utility requires a different figure the chief convenience of a great room is unconfined motion this directs us to the greatest length that can be obtained but a square room of a great size is inconvenient by removing far from the hand chairs and tables which when unemployd must be ranged along the sides of the room utility therefore requires a large room to be a parallelogram this figure at the same time is the best calculated for receiving light because to avoid crosslight all the windows ought to be in one wall and if the opposite wall be at such distance as not to be fully lighted the room must be obscure the height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet has little or no relation to utility and therefore proportion is the only rule for determining the height when above that number of feet  as all artists who deal in the beautiful are naturally prone to entertain the eye they have great opportunity to exert their taste upon palaces and sumptuous buildings where as above observed intrinsic beauty ought to have the ascendant over that which is relative but such propensity is unhappy with respect to private dwellinghouses because in these relative beauty cannot be displayed in any perfection without abandoning intrinsic beauty there is no opportunity for great variety of form in a small house and in an edifice of this kind internal convenience has not hitherto been happily adjusted to external regularity i am apt to believe that an accurate coincidence here is beyond the reach of art and yet architects always split upon this rock for they never will give over attempting to reconcile these two incompatibles how else should it be accounted for that of the endless variety of private dwellinghouses there is not one to be found that is generally agreed upon as a good pattern the unwearied propensity to make a house regular as well as convenient forces the architect in some articles to sacrifice convenience to regularity and in others regularity to convenience by this means the house which turns out neither regular nor convenient never fails to displease the faults are obvious and the difficulty of doing better is known to the artist only houses are built to live in and not to look on therefore let use be preferred before uniformity except where both may be had lo verulam essay        nothing can be more evident than that the form of a dwelling house ought to be suited to the climate and yet no error is more common than to copy in britain the form of italian houses not forgetting even those parts that are purposely contrived for air and for excluding the sun i shall give one or two instances a colonnade along the front of a building has a fine effect in greece and italy by producing coolness and obscurity agreeable properties in warm and luminous climates the cold climate of britain is altogether averse to this ornament a colonnade therefore can never be proper in this country unless when employed to communicate with a detached building again a logio opening the house to the north contrived in italy for gathering cool air is if possible still more improper for this climate scarce endurable in summer it in winter exposes the house to the bitter blasts of the north and to every shower of snow and rain  having discussed what appeared necessary to be said upon relative beauty singly considered or in combination with intrinsic beauty the next step is to view architecture as one of the fine arts and to examine those buildings and parts of buildings that are solely calculated to please the eye in the works of nature grand and magnificent variety prevails the timid hand of art is guided by rule and compass hence it is that in works which imitate nature the great art is to hide every appearance of art which is done by avoiding regularity and indulging variety but in works of art that are original and not imitative such as architecture strict regularity and uniformity ought to be studied so far as consistent with utility  in buildings intended to please the eye proportion is not less essential than regularity and uniformity for we are so framed by nature as to be pleased equally with each of these by many writers it is taken for granted that in all the parts of a building there are certain strict proportions which please the eye precisely as there are certain strict proportions of sound which please the ear and that in both the slightest deviation is equally disagreeable others again seem to relish more a comparison betwixt proportion in numbers and proportion in quantity and hold that the same proportions are agreeable in both the proportions for example of the numbers       and    are agreeable and so say they are the proportions of a room the height of which is    feet the breadth    and the length    this point with relation to the present subject being of importance the reader will examine it with attention and impartiality to refute the notion of a resemblance betwixt musical proportions and those of architecture it might be sufficient to observe in general that the one is addressed to the ear the other to the eye and that objects of different senses have no resemblance nor indeed any relation to each other but more particularly what pleases the ear in harmony is not the proportion of the strings of the instrument but of the sounds that these strings produce in architecture on the contrary it is the proportion of different quantities that pleases the eye without the least relation to sound beside were quantity here to be the sole ground of comparison we have no reason to presume that there is any natural analogy betwixt the proportions that please in a building and the proportions of strings that produce concordant sounds i instance in particular an octave the most complete of all concords an octave is produced by two strings of the same tension and diameter and as to length in the proportion of one to two i do not know that this proportion will be agreeable in any two parts of a building i add that concordant notes are produced by wind instruments which as to proportion appear not to have even the slightest resemblance to a building  with respect to the other notion instituting a comparison betwixt proportion in numbers and proportion in quantity i urge that number and quantity are so distinct from each other as to afford no probability of any natural relation betwixt them quantity is a real quality of every substance or body number is not a real quality but merely a conception that arises upon viewing a plurality of things in succession because an arithmetical proportion is agreeable in numbers have we any reason to conclude that it must also be agreeable in quantity at this rate a geometrical proportion and many others ought also to be agreeable in both a certain proportion may coincide in both and among an endless variety of proportions it would be wonderful if there never should be a coincidence one example is given of this coincidence in the numbers       and    but to be convinced that it is merely accidental we need but reflect that the same proportions are not applicable to the external figure of a house and far less to a column  that we are framed by nature to relish proportion as well as regularity is indisputable but that agreeable proportion like concord in sounds is confined to certain precise measures is not warranted by experience on the contrary we learn from experience that various proportions are equally agreeable that proportion is never tied down to precise measures but admits more and less and that we are not sensible of disproportion till the difference betwixt the quantities compared become the most striking circumstance columns evidently admit different proportions equally agreeable the case is the same in houses rooms and other parts of a building and this opens an interesting reflection the foregoing difference betwixt concord and proportion is an additional instance of that admirable harmony which subsists among the several branches of the human frame the ear is an accurate judge of sounds and of their smallest differences and that concord in sounds should be regulated by accurate measures is perfectly well suited to this accuracy of perception the eye is more uncertain about the size of a large object than of one that is small and in different situations the same object appears of different sizes delicacy of feeling therefore with respect to proportion in quantities would be an useless quality it is much better ordered that there should be such a latitude with respect to agreeable proportions as to correspond to the uncertainty of the eye with respect to quantity  but this scene is too interesting to be passed over in a cursory view all its beauties are not yet displayed i proceed to observe that to make the eye as delicate with respect to proportion as the ear is with respect to concord would not only be an useless quality but be the source of continual pain and uneasiness i need go no farther for a proof than the very room i possess at present every step i take varies to me in appearance the proportion of the length and breadth at that rate i should not be happy but in one precise spot where the proportion appears agreeable let me further observe that it would be singular indeed to find in the nature of man any two principles in perpetual opposition to each other this would precisely be the case if proportion were circumscribed like concord for it would exclude all but one of those proportions that utility requires in different buildings and in different parts of the same building  it is ludicrous to observe all writers acknowledging the necessity of accurate proportions and yet differing widely about them laying afide reasoning and philosophy one fact universally agreed on ought to have undeceived them that the same proportions which please in a model are not agreeable in a large building a room    feet in length and    in breadth and height is well proportioned but a room    feet wide and high and    long looks like a gallery  perrault in his comparison of the ancients and moderns p     is the only author who runs to the opposite extreme maintaining that the different proportions assigned to each order of columns are arbitrary and that the beauty of these proportions is entirely the effect of custom this bewrays ignorance of human nature which evidently delights in proportion as well as in regularity order and propriety but without any acquaintance with human nature a single reflection might have convinced him of his error that if these proportions had not originally been agreeable they could not have been established by custom if a thing be universal it must be natural  to illustrate the present point i shall add a few examples of the agreeableness of different proportions in a sumptuous edifice the capital rooms ought to be large for otherwise they will not be proportioned to the size of the building on the other hand a very large room in a small house is disproportioned but in things thus related the mind requires not a precise or single proportion rejecting all others on the contrary many different proportions are made equally welcome it is only when a proportion becomes loose and distant that the agreeableness abates and at last vanishes in all buildings accordingly we find rooms of different proportions equally agreeable even where the proportion is not influenced by utility with respect to the height of a room the proportion it ought to bear to the length and breadth is extremely arbitrary and it cannot be otherwise considering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a room when it exceeds    or    feet in columns again even architects must confess that the proportion of height and thickness varies betwixt   diameters and  0 and that every proportion betwixt these two extremes is agreeable but this is not all there must certainly be a further variation of proportion depending on the size of the column a row of columns  0 feet high and a row twice that height require different proportions the intercolumniations must also differ in proportion according to the height of the row  proportion of parts is not only itself a beauty but is inseparably connected with a beauty of the first magnitude parts that in conjunction appear proportional never fail separately to produce similar emotions which existing together are extremely pleasant as i have had occasion to show chap   part    thus a room of which the parts are all finely adjusted to each other strikes us with the beauty of proportion it produces at the same time a pleasure far superior the length the breadth the height the windows raise each of them separately an emotion these emotions are similar and though faint when felt separately they produce in conjunction the emotion of concord or harmony which is extremely pleasant on the other hand where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth the mind comparing together parts so intimately connected immediately perceives a disagreement or disproportion which disgusts but this is not all viewing them separately different emotions are produced that of grandeur from the great length and that of meanness or littleness from the small breadth which in union are disagreeable by their discordance hence it is that a long gallery however convenient for exercise is not an agreeable figure of a room we consider it like a stable as destined for use and expect not that in any other respect it should be agreeable  regularity and proportion are essential in buildings destined chiefly or solely to please the eye because they are the means to produce intrinsic beauty but a skilful artist will not confine his view to regularity and proportion he will also study propriety which is perceived when the form and ornaments of a structure are suited to the purpose for which it is appointed the sense of propriety dictates the following rule that every building ought to have an expression corresponding to its destination a palace ought to be sumptuous and grand a private dwelling neat and modest a playhouse gay and splendid and a monument gloomy and melancholy a heathen temple has a double destination it is considered chiefly as a house dedicated to some divinity and in that respect it ought to be grand elevated and magnificent it is considered also as a place of worship and in that respect it ought to be somewhat dark or gloomy because dimness produces that tone of mind which is suited to humility and devotion a christian church is not considered as a house for the deity but merely a place of worship it ought therefore to be decent and plain without much ornament a situation ought to be chosen humble and retired because the congregation during worship ought to be humble and disengaged from the world columns beside their chief destination of being supports contribute to that peculiar expression which the destination of a building requires columns of different proportions serve to express loftiness lightness etc as well as strength situation also may contribute to expression convenience regulates the situation of a private dwelling house but as i have had occasion to observe chap  0  the situation of a palace ought to be lofty  and this leads me to examine whether the situation of a great house where the artist is limited in his choice ought in any measure to regulate its form the connection betwixt a great house and the neighboring grounds though not extremely intimate demands however some congruity it would for instance displease us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country congruity requires a polished field for such a building and beside the pleasure of congruity the spectator is sensible of the pleasure of concordance from the similarity of the emotions produced by the two objects the old gothic form of building seems well suited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was invented the only mistake was the transferring this form to the fine plains of france and italy better fitted for buildings in the grecian taste but by refining upon the gothic form every thing in the power of invention has been done to reconcile it to its new situation the profuse variety of wild and grand objects about inverary demanded a house in the gothic form and every one must approve the taste of the proprietor in adjusting so finely as he has done the appearance of his house to that of the country where it is placed  the external structure of a great house leads naturally to its internal structure a large and spacious room receives us commonly upon our entrance this seems to me a bad contrivance in several respects in the first place when immediately from the open air we step into such a room its size in appearance is diminished by contrast it looks little compared with the great canopy the sky in the next place when it recovers its grandeur as it soon does it gives a diminutive appearance to the rest of the house passing from it every apartment looks little this room therefore may be aptly compared to the swollen commencement of an epic poem bella per emathios plusquam civilia campos in the third place by its situation it serves only for a waitingroom and a passage to the principal apartments and yet undoubtedly the room of the greatest size ought to be reserved for company a great room which enlarges the mind and gives a certain elevation to the spirits is destined by nature for conversation rejecting therefore this form i take a hint from the climax in writing for another form that appears more suitable my plan is first a handsome portico proportioned to the size and fashion of the front this portico leads into a waitingroom of a larger size and this again to the great room all by a progression from small to great if the house be very large there may be space for the following suit of rooms first a portico second a passage within the house bounded by rows of columns on each side connected by arcades third an octagon room or of any other figure about the center of the building and lastly the great room  of all the emotions that can be raised by architecture grandeur is that which has the greatest influence on the mind it ought therefore to be the chief study of the artist to raise this emotion in great buildings but it seems unhappy for architecture that it is necessarily governed by certain principles opposite to grandeur the direct effect of regularity and proportion is to make a building appear less than it is in reality any invention to reconcile these with grandeur would be a capital improvement in architecture  next of ornaments which contribute greatly to give buildings a peculiar expression it has been a doubt with me whether a building can regularly admit any ornament but what is useful or at least appears to be useful but considering the double aim of architecture a fine as well as an useful art there is no good reason why ornaments may not be added to please the eye without any relation to use this liberty is allowed in poetry painting and gardening and why not in architecture considered as a fine art a private dwellinghouse it is true and other edifices where use is the chief aim admit not regularly any ornament but what has the appearance at least of use but temples triumphal arches and other buildings intended chiefly or solely for show may be highly ornamented  this suggests a division of ornaments into three kinds viz ornaments that are beautiful without relation to use such as statues in niches vases basso or alto relievo next things in themselves not beautiful but possessing the beauty of utility by imposing on the spectator and appearing to be of use blind windows for example the third kind is where the thing is in itself beautiful and also takes on the appearance of use the case of a pilaster with respect to the second it is an egregious blunder to contrive the ornament so as to make it appear useless if a blind window therefore be necessary for regularity it ought to be so disguised as not to be distinguished from the real windows if it appear to be a blind window it is disgustful as a vain attempt to supply the want of invention it shows the irregularity in a stronger light by signifying that a window ought to be there in point of regularity but that the architect had not skill sufficient to connect external regularity with internal convenience  from ornaments in general we descend to a pillar the chief ornament in great buildings the destination of a pillar is to support really or in appearance another part termed the architrave with respect to the form of this ornament i observe that a circle is a more agreeable figure than a square a globe than a cube and a cylinder than a parallelopipedon this last in the language of architecture is saying that a column is a more agreeable figure than a pilaster for that reason it ought to be preferred all other circumstances being equal another reason concurs that a column annexed to a wall which is a plain surface makes a greater variety than a pilaster there is an additional reason for rejecting pilasters in the external front of a building arising from a principle unfolded above chap    viz a remarkable tendency in the mind of man to advance every thing to its perfection as well as to its final issue if i see a thing obscurely in a dim light and by disjointed parts my curiosity is roused and prompts me out of the disjointed parts to compose an entire whole i suppose it to be for example a horse my eyesight being obedient to this conjecture i immediately perceive a horse almost as distinctly as in daylight this principle is applicable to the case in hand the most superb front at a great distance appears a plain surface approaching gradually we begin to perceive inequalities these inequalities advancing a few steps more take on the appearance of pillars but whether round or square we are uncertain our curiosity anticipating our progress cannot rest in suspense we naturally suppose the most complete pillar or that which is the most agreeable to the eye and we immediately perceive or seem to perceive a number of columns if upon a near approach we find pilasters only the disappointment makes these pilasters appear disagreeable when abstracted from that circumstance they would only have appeared somewhat less agreeable but as this deception cannot happen in the inner front enclosing a court i see no reason for excluding pilasters there when there is any reason for preferring them before columns  with respect now to the parts of a column a bare uniform cylinder without base or capital appears naked and scarce agreeable it ought therefore to have some finishing at the top and at the bottom hence the three chief parts of a column the shaft the base and the capital nature undoubtedly requires a certain proportion among these parts but not limited within precise bounds i suspect that the proportions in use have been influenced in some degree by the human figure the capital being conceived as the head the base as the feet with respect to the base indeed the principle of utility interposes to vary it from the human figure the base must be so proportioned to the whole as to give the column the appearance of stability  in architecture as well as in gardening contradictory expressions ought to be avoided firmness and solidity are the proper expressions of a pedestal carved work on the contrary ought to be light and delicate a pedestal therefore whether of a column or of a statue ought to be sparingly ornamented the ancients never ventured any bolder ornament than the bassorelievo  to succeed in allegorical or emblematic ornaments is no slight effort of genius for it is extremely difficult to dispose them so in a building as to produce any good effect the mixing them with realities makes a miserable jumble of truth and fiction see chap  0 sect    in a bassorelievo on antonins pillar rain obtained by the prayers of a christian legion is expressed by joining to the group of soldiers a rainy jupiter with water in abundance running from his head and beard de piles fond of the conceit carefully informs his reader that he must not take this for a real jupiter but for a symbol which among the pagans signified rain an emblem ought not to make a part of the group representing real objects or real events but be detached from it so as even at first view to appear an emblem but this is not all nor the chief point every emblem ought to be rejected that is not clearly expressive of its meaning if it be in any degree obscure it never can be relished the temples of ancient and modern virtue in the gardens of stow appear not at first view emblematical and when we are informed that they are so it is not easy to gather their meaning the spectator sees one temple in full repair another in ruins but without an explanatory inscription he may guess but cannot be certain that the former being dedicated to ancient virtue the latter to modern virtue are intended a satire upon the present times on the other hand a trite emblem like a trite simile is disgustful see chap    nor ought an emblem more than a simile to be founded on low or familiar objects for if the objects be not agreeable as well as their meaning the emblem upon the whole will not be relished a room in a dwelling house containing a monument to a deceased friend is dedicated to melancholy its furniture is a clock that strikes every minute to signify how swiftly time passes upon the monument weeping figures and other hackneyd ornaments commonly found upon tombstones with a stuffed raven in a corner verses on death and other serious subjects inscribed all around the objects are too familiar and the artifice too apparent to produce the intended effect  the statue of moses striking a rock from which water actually issues is also in a false taste for it is mixing reality with representation moses himself may bring water out of the rock but this miracle is too much for his statue the same objection lies against a cascade where we see the statue of a watergod pouring out of his urn real water  it is observed above of gardening that it contributes to rectitude of manners by inspiring gaiety and benevolence i add another observation that both gardening and architecture contribute to the same end by inspiring neatness and elegance it is observed in scotland that even a turnpikeroad has some influence of this kind upon the low people in the neighborhood they acquire a taste for regularity and neatness which is displayed first upon their yards and little enclosures and next within doors a taste for regularity and neatness thus gathering strength comes insensibly to be extended to dress and even to behavior and manners  chap xxv standard of taste that there is no disputing about taste meaning taste in its most extensive sense is a saying so generally received as to have become a proverb one thing indeed is evident that if the proverb hold true with respect to any one external sense it must hold true with respect to all if the pleasures of the palate disdain a comparative trial and reject all criticism the pleasures of touch of smell of sound and even of sight must be equally privileged at this rate a man is not within the reach of censure even where insensible to beauty grandeur or elegance he prefers the saracens head upon a signpost before the best tablature of raphael or a rude gothic tower before the finest grecian building nor where he prefers the smell of a rotten carcass before that of the most odoriferous flower nor jarring discords before the most exquisite harmony  but we must not stop here if the pleasures of external sense be exempted from criticism why not every one of our pleasures from whatever source derived if taste in the proper sense of the word cannot be disputed there is as little room for disputing it in its figurative sense the proverb accordingly comprehends both and in that large sense may be resolved into the following general proposition that with respect to the sensitive part of our nature by which some objects are agreeable some disagreeable there is not such a thing as a good or bad a right or wrong that every mans taste is to himself an ultimate standard without appeal and consequently that there is no ground of censure against any one if such a one there be who prefers blackmore before homer selfishness before benevolence or cowardice before magnanimity  the proverb in the foregoing instances is indeed carried very far it seems difficult however to sap its foundation or with success to attack it from any quarter for in comparing the various tastes of individuals it is not obvious what standard must be appealed to is not every man equally a judge of what is agreeable or disagreeable to himself does it not seem odd and perhaps absurd that a man ought not to be pleased when he is or that he ought to be pleased when he is not  this reasoning may perplex but in contradiction to sense and feeling will never afford conviction a man of taste must necessarily feel the reasoning to be false however unqualified to detect the fallacy at the same time though no man of taste will subscribe to the proverb as holding true in every case no man will venture to affirm that it holds true in no case subjects there are undoubtedly that we may like or dislike indifferently without any imputation upon our taste were a philosopher to make a scale for human pleasures with many divisions in order that the value of each pleasure may be denoted by the place it occupies he would not think of making divisions without end but would rank together many pleasures arising perhaps from different objects either as being equally valuable or differing so imperceptibly as to make a separation unnecessary nature has taken this course so far as appears to the generality of mankind there may be subdivisions without end but we are only sensible of the grosser divisions comprehending each of them many pleasures of various kinds to these the proverb is applicable in the strictest sense for with respect to pleasures of the same rank what ground can there be for preferring one before another if a preference in fact be given by any individual it cannot be taste but custom imitation or some peculiarity of mind  nature in her scale of pleasures has been sparing of divisions she has wisely and benevolently filled every division with many pleasures in order that individuals may be contented with their own lot without envying the happiness of others many hands must be employed to procure us the conveniences of life and it is necessary that the different branches of business whether more or less agreeable be filled with hands a taste too nice and delicate would obstruct this plan for it would crowd some employments leaving others not less useful totally neglected in our present condition happy it is that the plurality are not delicate in their choice they fall in readily with the occupations pleasures food and company that fortune throws in their way and if at first there be any displeasing circumstance custom soon makes it easy  the proverb will be admitted so far as it regards the particulars now explained but when applied in general to every subject of taste the difficulties to be encountered are insuperable what shall we say in particular as to the difficulty that arises from human nature itself do we not talk of a good and a bad taste of a right and a wrong taste and upon that supposition do we not with great confidence censure writers painters architects and every one who deals in the fine arts are such criticisms absurd and void of foundation have the foregoing expressions familiar in all languages and among all people no sort of meaning this can hardly be what is universal must have a foundation in nature if we can reach this foundation the standard of taste will no longer be a secret  all living creatures are by nature distributed into classes the individuals of each however diversified by slighter differences having a wonderful uniformity in their capital parts internal and external each class is distinguishable from others by an external form and not less distinguishable by an internal constitution manifested by certain powers feelings desires and actions peculiar to the individuals of each class thus each class may be conceived to have a common nature which in framing the individuals belonging to the class is taken for a model or standard  independent altogether of experience men have a sense or conviction of a common nature or standard not only in their own species but in every species of animals and hence it is a matter of wonder to find any individual deviating from the common nature of the species whether in its internal or external construction a child born with an aversion to its mothers milk is a matter of wonder not less than if born without a mouth or with more than one see essays on morality and natural religion part   essay   chapter     with respect to this common nature or standard we are so constituted as to conceive it to be perfect or right and consequently that individuals ought to be made conformable to it every remarkable deviation accordingly from the standard makes an impression upon us of imperfection irregularity or disorder it is disagreeable and raises in us a painful emotion monstrous births exciting the curiosity of a philosopher fail not at the same time to excite aversion in a high degree  lastly we have a conviction that the common nature of man is invariable not less than universal we conceive that it has no relation to time nor to place but that it will be the same hereafter as at present and as it was in time past the same among all nations and in all corners of the earth nor are we deceived giving allowance for the difference of culture and gradual refinement of manners the fact corresponds to our conviction  this conviction of a common nature or standard and of its perfection is the foundation of morality and accounts clearly for that remarkable conception we have of a right and a wrong taste in morals it accounts not less clearly for the conception we have of a right and a wrong taste in the fine arts a person who rejects objects generally agreeable and delights in objects generally disagreeable is condemned as a monster we disapprove his taste as bad or wrong and we have a clear conception that he deviates from the common standard if man were so framed as not to have any notion of a common standard the proverb mentioned in the beginning would hold universally not only in the fine arts but in morals upon that supposition the taste of every man with respect to both would to himself be an ultimate standard but the conviction of a common standard being made a part of our nature we intuitively conceive a taste to be right or good if conformable to the common standard and wrong or bad if disconformable  no particular concerning human nature is more universal than the uneasiness a man feels when in matters of importance his opinions are rejected by others why should difference in opinion create uneasiness more than difference in stature in countenance or in dress the sense of a common standard is the only principle that can explain this mystery every man generally speaking taking it for granted that his opinions agree with the common sense of mankind is therefore disgusted with those of a contrary opinion not as differing from him but as differing from the common standard hence in all disputes we find the parties each of them equally appealing constantly to the common sense of mankind as the ultimate rule or standard were it not for this standard of which the conviction is universal icannot discover the slightest foundation for rancor or animosity when persons differ in essential points more than in points purely indifferent with respect to the latter which are not supposed to be regulated by any standard individuals are permitted to think for themselves with impunity the same liberty is not indulged with respect to the former for what reason other than that the standard by which these are regulated ought as we judge to produce an uniformity of opinion in all men in a word to this sense of a common standard must be wholly attributed the pleasure we take in those who espouse the same principles and opinions with ourselves as well as the aversion we have at those who differ from us in matters left indifferent by the standard we find nothing of the same pleasure or pain a bookish man unless swayed by convenience relisheth not the contemplative more than the active part of mankind his friends and companions are chosen indifferently out of either class a painter consorts with a poet or musician as readily as with those of his own art and one is not the more agreeable to me for loving beef as i do nor the less agreeable for preferring mutton  i have said that my disgust is raised not by differing from me but by differing from what i judge to be the common standard this point being of importance ought to be firmly established men it is true are prone to flatter themselves by taking it for granted that their opinions and their taste are in all respects agreeable to the common standard but there may be exceptions and experience shows there are some there are instances without number of persons who cling to the grosser amusements of gaming eating drinking without having any relish for more elegant pleasures such for example as are afforded by the fine arts yet these very persons talking the same language with the rest of mankind pronounce in favor of the more elegant pleasures they invariably approve those who have a more refined taste and are ashamed of their own as low and sensual it is in vain to think of giving a reason for this singular impartiality against self other than the authority of the common standard every individual of the human species the most grovelling not excepted has a natural sense of the dignity of human nature see chap     hence every man is esteemed and respected in proportion to the dignity of his character sentiments and actions and from the instances now given we discover that the sense of the dignity of human nature is so vigorous as even to prevail over selfpartiality and to make us despise our own taste compared with the more elevated taste of others  in our sense of a common standard and in the pleasure individuals give us by their conformity to it a curious final cause is discovered an uniformity of taste and sentiment in matters of importance forms an intimate connection among individuals and is a great blessing in the social state with respect to morals in particular unhappy it would be for mankind did not this uniformity prevail it is necessary that the actions of all men be uniform with respect to right and wrong and in order to uniformity of action it is necessary that all men think the same way in these particulars if they differ through any irregular bias the common sense of mankind is appealed to as the rule and it is the province of judges in matters especially of equity to apply that rule the same uniformity it is yielded is not so strictly necessary in other matters of taste men though connected in general as members of the same state are by birth office or occupation separated and distinguished into different classes and are thereby qualified for different amusements variety of taste so far is no obstruction to the general connection but with respect to the more capital pleasures such as are best enjoyed in common uniformity of taste is necessary for two great ends first to connect individuals the more intimately in the social life and next to advance these pleasures to their highest perfection with respect to the first if instead of a common taste every man had a taste peculiar to himself leading him to place his happiness upon things indifferent or perhaps disagreeable to others these capital pleasures could not be enjoyed in common every man would pursue his own happiness by flying from others and instead of a natural tendency to union remarkable in the human species union would be our aversion man would not be a consistent being his interest would lead him to society and his taste would draw him from it the other end will be best explained by entering upon particulars uniformity of taste gives opportunity for sumptuous and elegant buildings for fine gardens and extensive embellishments which please universally works of this nature could never have reached any degree of perfection had every man a taste peculiar to himself there could not be any suitable reward either of profit or honor to encourage men of genius to labor in such works the same uniformity of taste is equally necessary to perfect the arts of music sculpture and painting and to support the expense they require after they are brought to perfection nature is in every particular consistent with herself we are formed by nature to have a high relish for the fine arts which are a great source of happiness and extremely friendly to virtue we are at the same time formed with an uniformity of taste to furnish proper objects for this high relish if uniformity of taste did not prevail the fine arts could never have made any figure  thus upon a sense common to the species is erected a standard of taste which without hesitation is applied to the taste of every individual this standard ascertaining what actions are right what wrong what proper what improper has enabled moralists to establish rules for our conduct from which no person is allowed to swerve we have the same standard for ascertaining in all the fine arts what is beautiful or ugly high or low proper or improper proportioned or disproportioned and here as in morals we justly condemn every taste that swerves from what is thus ascertained by the common standard  the discovery of a rule or standard for trying the taste of individuals in the fine arts as well as in morals is a considerable advance but completes not our journey we have a great way yet to travel it is made out that there is a standard but it is not made out by what means we shall prevent mistaking a false standard for that of nature if from opinion and practice we endeavor to ascertain the standard of nature we are betrayed into endless perplexities viewing this matter historically nothing appears more various and more wavering than taste in the fine arts if we judge by numbers the gothic taste of architecture will be preferred before that of greece and the chinese taste probably before both it would be endless to recount the various tastes of gardening that have prevailed in different ages and still prevail in different countries despising the modest coloring of nature women of fashion in france daub their cheeks with a red powder nay the unnatural swelling in the neck a disease peculiar to the inhabitants of the alps is relished by that people but we ought not to be discouraged by such untoward instances for do we not find the like contradictions with respect to morals was it not once held lawful for a man to expose his infant children and when grown up to sell them for slaves was it not held equally lawful to punish children for the crime of their parents was not the murder of an enemy in cold blood an universal practice what stronger instance can be given than the abominable practice of human sacrifices not less impious than immoral such aberrations from the rules of morality prove only that men originally savage and brutish acquire not rationality or any delicacy of taste till they be long disciplined in society to ascertain the rules of morality we appeal not to the common sense of savages but of men in their more perfect state and we make the same appeal in forming the rules that ought to govern the fine arts in neither can we safely rely on a local or transitory taste but on what is the most universal and the most lasting among polite nations  in this very manner a standard for morals has been established with a good deal of accuracy and so well fitted for practice that in the hand of able judges it is daily applied with general satisfaction the standard of taste in the fine arts is not yet brought to such perfection and there is an obvious reason for its slower progress the sense of a right and a wrong in action is conspicuous in the breast of every individual almost without exception the sense of a right and a wrong in the fine arts is more faint and wavering it is by nature a tender plant requiring much culture to bring it to maturity in a barren soil it cannot live and in any soil without cultivation it is weak and sickly i talk chiefly with relation to its more refined objects for some objects make such lively impressions of beauty grandeur and proportion as without exception to command the general taste there appears to me great contrivance in distinguishing thus the moral sense from a taste in the fine arts the former as a rule of conduct and as a law we ought to obey must be clear and authoritative the latter is not entitled to the same authority since it contributes to our pleasure and amusement only were it more strong and lively it would usurp upon our duty and call off the attention from matters of greater moment were it more clear and authoritative it would banish all difference of taste a refined taste would not form a character nor be entitled to esteem this would put an end to rivalship and consequently to all improvement  but to return to our subject however languid and cloudy the common sense of mankind may be with respect to the fine arts it is yet the only standard in these as well as in morals and when the matter is attentively considered this standard will be sound less imperfect than it appears to be at first sight in gathering the common sense of mankind upon morals we may safely consult every individual but with respect to the fine arts our method must be different a wary choice is necessary for to collect votes indifferently will certainly mislead us those who depend for food on bodily labor are totally void of taste of such a taste at least as can be of use in the fine arts this consideration bars the greater part of mankind and of the remaining part many have their taste corrupted to such a degree as to unqualify them altogether for voting the common sense of mankind must then be confined to the few that fall not under these exceptions but as such selection seems to throw matters again into uncertainty we must be more explicit upon this branch of our subject  nothing tends more than voluptuousness to corrupt the whole internal frame and to vitiate our taste not only in the fine arts but even in morals it never fails in course of time to extinguish all the sympathetic affections and to bring on a beastly selfishness which leaves nothing of man but the shape about excluding persons of this stamp there will be no dispute let us next bring under trial the opulent whose chief pleasure is expense riches coveted by most men for the sake of superiority and to command respect are generally bestowed upon costly furniture numerous attendants a princely dwelling every thing superb and gorgeous to amaze and humble all beholders simplicity elegance propriety and every thing natural sweet or amiable are despised or neglected for these are not at the command of riches and make no figure in the public eye in a word nothing is relished but what serves to gratify pride by an imagined exaltation of the possessor above those he reckons the vulgar such a tenor of life contracts the heart and makes every principle give way to selfinterest benevolence and public spirit with all their refined emotions are little felt and less regarded and if these be excluded there can be no place for the faint and delicate emotions of the fine arts  the exclusion of classes so many and various reduces within a narrow compass those who are qualified to be judges in the fine arts many circumstances are necessary to form a judge of this sort there must be a good natural taste this taste must be improved by education reflection and experience it must be preserved alive by a regular course of life by using the goods of fortune with moderation and by following the dictates of improved nature which gives welcome to every rational pleasure without deviating into excess this is the tenor of life which of all contributes the most to refinement of taste and the same tenor of life contributes the most to happiness in general  if there appear much uncertainty in a standard that requires so painful and intricate a selection we may possibly be reconciled to it by the following consideration that with respect to the fine arts there is less difference of taste than is commonly imagined nature has marked all her works with indelible characters of high or low plain or elegant strong or weak these if at all perceived are seldom misapprehended by any taste and the same marks are equally perceptible in works of art a defective taste is incurable and it hurts none but the possessor because it carries no authority to impose upon others i know not if there be such a thing as a taste naturally bad or wrong a taste for example that prefers a grovelling pleasure before one that is high and elegant grovelling pleasures are never preferred they are only made welcome by those who know no better differences about objects of taste it is true are endless but they generally concern trifles or possibly matters of equal rank where the preference may be given either way with impunity if on any occasion the dispute go deeper and persons differ where they ought not a depraved taste will readily be discovered on one or other side occasioned by imitation custom or corrupted manners such as are described above  if after all that is said the standard of taste be thought not yet sufficiently ascertained there is still one resource in which i put great confidence what i have in view are the principles that constitute the sensitive part of our nature by means of these principles common to all men a wonderful uniformity is preserved among the emotions and feelings of different individuals the same object making upon every person the same impression the same in kind at least if not in degree there have been aberrations as above observed from these principles but soon or late they always prevail by restoring the wanderers to the right track the uniformity of taste here accounted for is the very thing that in other words is termed the common sense of mankind and this discovery leads us to means for ascertaining the common sense of mankind or the standard of taste more unerringly than the selection above insisted on every doubt with relation to this standard occasioned by the practice of different nations and different times may be cleared by applying to the principles that ought to govern the taste of every individual in a word a thorough acquaintance with these principles will enable us to form the standard of taste and to lay a foundation for this valuable branch of knowledge is the declared purpose of the present undertaking  appendix terms defined or explained   considering the things i am conscious of some are internal or within my mind some external or without passion thinking volition are internal objects objects of sight of hearing of smell of touch of taste are external    the faculty by which i discover an internal object is termed an internal sense the faculty by which i discover an external object is termed an external sense this distinction among the senses is made with reference to their objects merely for the senses external and internal are equally powers or faculties of the mind    but as self is an object and the only one that cannot be termed either external or internal the faculty by which i am conscious of myself must be distinguished from both the internal and external senses    by sight we perceive the qualities of figure color motion etc by the ear we perceive the qualities high low loud soft by touch we perceive rough smooth hot cold etc by taste we perceive sweet sour bitter etc by smell we perceive fragrant stinking etc qualities from our very conception of them are not capable of an independent existence but must belong to something of which they are the qualities a thing with respect to its qualities is termed a subject or substratum because its qualities rest as it were upon it or are founded upon it the subject or substratum of visible qualities is termed substance of audible qualities sound of tangible qualities body in like manner taste is the substratum of qualities perceived by our sense of tasting and smell is the substratum of qualities perceived by our sense of smelling    substance and sound are perceived existing in a certain place often at a considerable distance from the organ but smell touch and taste are perceived at the organs of sense    objects of internal sense are conceived to be attributes deliberation reasoning resolution willing consenting are internal actions passions and emotions are internal agitations with regard to the former i am conscious of being active with regard to the latter i am conscious of being passive    again we are conscious of internal action as in the head of passions and emotions as in the heart    many actions may be exerted internally and many effects produced of which we are not conscious when we investigate the ultimate cause of animal motions it is the most probable opinion that they proceed from some internal power and if so we are in this particular unconscious of our own operations but consciousness being implied in the very conception of deliberating reasoning resolving willing consenting these operations cannot go on without our knowledge the same is the case of passions and emotions for no internal agitation is denominated a passion or emotion but what we are conscious of    the mind is not always in the same state it is at times cheerful melancholy severe peevish these different states may not improperly be denominated tones an object by making an impression produces an emotion or passion which again gives the mind a certain tone suited to it   0 perception and sensation are commonly reckoned synonymous terms signifying the consciousness we have of objects but in accurate language they are distinguished the consciousness we have of external objects is termed perception thus we are said to perceive a certain animal a certain color sound taste smell etc the consciousness we have of pleasure or pain arising from external objects is termed sensation thus we have a sensation of cold of heat of the pain of a wound of the pleasure of a landscape of music of beauty of propriety of behavior etc the consciousness we have of internal action such as deliberation resolution choice is never termed either a perception or a sensation     conception ought to be distinguished from perception external things and their attributes are objects of perception relations among things are objects of conception i see two men james and john the consciousness i have of them is a perception but the consciousness i have of their relation as father and son is termed a conception again perception relates to objects really existing conception to fictitious objects or to those framed by the imagination     feeling beside denoting one of the external senses has two different significations of these the most common includes not only sensation but also that branch of consciousness which relates to passions and emotions it is proper to say i have a feeling of cold of heat or of pain and it is not less proper to say i have a feeling of love of hatred of anger or of any other passion but it is not applied to internal action for it is not proper to say that a man feels himself deliberating or resolving in a sense less common feeling is put for the thing that is felt and in this sense it is a general term for every one of our passions and emotions     that we cannot perceive an external object till an impression be made upon our body is probable from reason and is ascertained by experience but it is not necessary that we be made sensible of the impression it is true that in touching tasting and smelling we feel the impression made at the organ of sense but in seeing and hearing we feel no impression we know indeed by experience that before we perceive a visible object its image is spread upon the retina tunica and that before we perceive a sound an impression is made upon the drum of the ear and yet here we are not conscious either of the organic image or the organic impression nor are we conscious of any other operation preparatory to the act of perception all we can say is that we see that river or hear that trumpet yet a singular opinion that impressions are the only objects of perception has been espoused by some philosophers of no mean rank not attending to the foregoing peculiarity in the senses of seeing and hearing that we perceive objects without being conscious of an organic impression or of any impression see the treatise upon human nature where we find the following passage book   p   sect   properly speaking it is not our body we perceive when we regard our limbs and members so that the ascribing a real and corporeal existence to these impressions or to their objects is an act of the mind as difficult to explain etc      objects once perceived may be recalled to the mind by the power of memory when i recall an object in this manner it appears to me the same as in the original survey only more faint and obscure for example i saw yesterday a spreading oak growing on the brink of a river i endeavor to recall it to my mind how is this operation performed do i endeavor to form in my mind a picture of it or representative image not so i transport myself ideally to the place where i saw the tree yesterday upon which i have a perception of the tree and river similar in all respects to the perception i had of it when i viewed it with my eyes only more obscure and in this recollection i am not conscious of a picture or representative image more than in the original survey the perception is of the tree itself as at first i confirm this by another experiment after attentively surveying a fine statue i close my eyes what follows the same object continues without any difference but that it is less distinct than formerly this indistinct secondary perception of an object is termed an idea and therefore the precise and accurate definition of an idea in contradistinction to an original perception is that perception or consciousness of a real object which a person has by exercising the power of memory every thing one is conscious of whether internal or external passions emotions thinking resolving willing heat cold etc as well as external objects may be recalled as above by the power of memory from this definition of an idea the following proposition must be evident that there can be no such thing as an innate idea if the original perception of an object be not innate which is obvious it is not less obvious that the idea or secondary perception of that object cannot be innate and yet to prove this selfevident proposition lock has bestowed a whole book of his treatise upon human understanding so necessary it is to give accurate definitions and so preventive of dispute are definitions when accurate dr berkeley has taken great pains to prove another proposition equally evident that there can be no such thing as a general idea all our original perceptions are of particular objects and our secondary perceptions or ideas must be equally so      the original perceptions of external objects are either simple or complex a sound may be so simple as not to be resolvable into parts so may a taste and a smell a perception of touch is generally compounded of the more simple perceptions of hardness or softness joined with smoothness or roughness heat or cold etc but of all the perceptions of external sense that of a visible object is the most complex because the eye takes in more particulars than any other organ a tree is composed of its trunk branches leaves it has color figure size every one of these separately produces a perception in the mind of the spectator which are all combined into the complex perception of the tree     the original perception of an object of sight is more complete lively and distinct than that of any other external sense and for that reason an idea or secondary perception of a visible object is more distinct and lively than that of any other object a fine passage in music may for a moment be recalled to the mind with tolerable accuracy but the idea of any other object and also of sound after the shortest interval is extremely obscure     as the range of an individual is commonly within narrow bounds of space opportunities seldom offer of an enlarged acquaintance with external objects original perceptions therefore and their corresponding ideas are a provision too scanty for the purposes of life language is an admirable contrivance for supplying this deficiency for by language the original perceptions of each individual may be communicated to all and the same may be done by painting and other imitative arts it is natural to suppose that the most lively ideas are the most susceptible of being communicated to others this holds more especially when language is the vehicle of communication for language hitherto has not arrived at any greater perfection than to express clear and lively ideas hence it is that poets and orators who are extremely successful in describing objects of sight find objects of the other senses too faint and obscure for language an idea thus acquired of an object at second hand ought to be distinguished from an idea of memory though their resemblance has occasioned the same term to be applied to both this is to be regretted for when knowledge is to be communicated by language ambiguity in the signification of words is a great obstruction to accuracy of conception thus nature has furnished the means of multiplying ideas without end and of providing every individual with a sufficient stock to answer not only the necessities but even the elegancies of life     further man is endued with a sort of creative power he can fabricate images of things that have no existence the materials employed in this operation are ideas of sight which may be taken to pieces and combined into new forms at pleasure their complexity and vivacity make them fit materials but a man has no such power over any of his other ideas whether of the external or internal senses he cannot after the utmost effort combine these into new forms his ideas of such objects are too obscure for this operation an image thus fabricated cannot be called a secondary perception not being derived from an original perception the poverty of language however as in the case immediately above mentioned has occasioned the same term idea to be applied to all this singular power of fabricating images independent of real objects is distinguished by the name imagination     as ideas are the chief materials employed in thinking reasoning and reflecting it is of consequence that their nature and differences be understood it appears now that ideas may be distinguished into three kinds first ideas or secondary perceptions properly termed ideas of memory second ideas communicated by language or other signs and third ideas of imagination these ideas differ from each other in many respects but the chief foundation of the distinction is the difference of their causes the first kind are derived from real existences that have been objects of our senses language is the cause of the second or any other sign that has the same power with language and a mans imagination is to himself the cause of the third it is scarce necessary to add that an idea originally of imagination being conveyed to others by language or any other vehicle becomes in the mind of those to whom it is conveyed an idea of the second kind and again that an idea of this kind being afterward recalled to the mind becomes in that circumstance an idea of memory   0 human nature is not so constituted as that its objects are perceived with indifferency these with very few exceptions raise in us either pleasant or painful emotions external objects at the same time appear in themselves agreeable or disagreeable but with some difference betwixt those which produce organic impressions and those which affect us from a distance when we touch a soft and smooth body we have a pleasant feeling as at the place of contact and this feeling we distinguish not at least not accurately from the agreeableness of the body itself the same holds in general with regard to all the organic impressions it is otherwise in hearing and seeing a sound is perceived as in itself agreeable and at the same time raises in the hearer a pleasant emotion an object of sight appears in itself agreeable and at the same time raises in the seer a pleasant emotion these are accurately distinguished the pleasant emotion is felt as within the mind the agreeableness of the object is placed upon the object and is perceived as one of its qualities or properties the agreeable appearance of an object of sight is termed beauty and the disagreeable appearance of such an object is termed ugliness     but though beauty and ugliness in their proper and genuine signification are confined to objects of sight yet in a more lax and figurative signification they are applied to objects of the other senses they are sometimes applied even to abstract terms for it is not unusual to say a beautiful theorem a beautiful constitution of government but i am inclined to think that we are led to use such expression by conceiving the thing as delineated upon paper and as in some sort an object of sight     a line composed by a precise rule is perceived and said to be regular a straight line a parabola a hyperbola the circumference of a circle and of an ellipse are all of them regular lines a figure composed by a precise rule is perceived and said to be regular thus a circle a square a hexagon an equilateral triangle are regular figures being composed by a rule that determines the form of each when the form of a line or of a figure is ascertained by a rule that leaves nothing arbitrary the line and the figure are said to be perfectly regular this is the case of the figures now mentioned and it is the case of a straight line and of the circumference of a circle a figure and a line are not perfectly regular where any part or circumstance is left arbitrary a parallelogram and a rhomb are less regular than a square the parallelogram is subjected to no rule as to the length of sides other than that the opposite sides be equal the rhomb is subjected to no rule as to its angles other than that the opposite angles be equal for the same reason the circumference of an ellipse the form of which is susceptible of much variety is less regular than that of a circle     regularity properly speaking belongs like beauty to objects of sight like beauty it is also applied figuratively to other objects thus we say a regular government a regular composition of music and regular discipline     when two figures are composed of similar parts they are said to be uniform perfect uniformity is where the constituent parts of two figures are precisely similar to each other thus two cubes of the same dimensions are perfectly uniform in all their parts an imperfect uniformity is where the parts mutually correspond but without being precisely similar the uniformity is imperfect betwixt two squares or cubes of unequal dimensions and still more so betwixt a square and a parallelogram     uniformity is also applicable to the constituent parts of the same figure the constituent parts of a square are perfectly uniform its sides are equal and its angles are equal wherein then differs regularity from uniformity for a figure composed of similar or uniform parts must undoubtedly be regular regularity is predicated of a figure considered as a whole composed of resembling or uniform parts uniformity again is predicated of these parts as related to each other by resemblance we say a square is a regular not an uniform figure but with respect to the constituent parts of a square we say not that they are regular but that they are uniform     in things destined for the same use as legs arms eyes windows spoons we expect uniformity proportion ought to govern parts intended for different uses we require a certain proportion betwixt a leg and an arm in the base the shaft the capital of a pillar and in the length the breadth the height of a room some proportion is also required in different things intimately connected as betwixt a dwelling house the garden and the stables but we require no proportion among things slightly connected as betwixt the table a man writes on and the dog that follows him proportion and uniformity never coincide things perfectly similar are uniform but proportion is never applied to them the four sides and angles of a square are equal and perfectly uniform but we say not that they are proportional thus proportion always implies inequality or difference but then it implies it to a certain degree only the most agreeable proportion resembles a maximum in mathematics a greater or less inequality or difference is less agreeable     order regards various particulars first in tracing or surveying objects we are directed by a sense of order we conceive it to be more orderly that we should pass from a principle to its accessories and from a whole to its parts than in the contrary direction next with respect to the position of things a sense of order directs us to place together things intimately connected thirdly in placing things that have no natural connection that order appears the most perfect where the particulars are made to bear the strongest relation to each other that position can give them thus parallelism is the strongest relation that position can bestow upon straight lines if they be so placed as by production to intersect each other the relation is less perfect a large body in the middle and two equal bodies of less size one on each side is an order that produces the strongest relation the bodies are susceptible of by position the relation betwixt the two equal bodies would be stronger by juxtaposition but they would not both have the same relation to the third     the beauty or agreeableness of an object as it enters into the original perception enters also into the secondary perception or idea an idea of imagination is also agreeable though in a lower degree than an idea of memory where the objects are of the same kind but this defect in the ideas of imagination is abundantly supplied by their greatness and variety for the imagination acting without control can fabricate ideas of finer visible objects of more noble and heroic actions of greater wickedness of more surprising events than ever in fact existed and by communicating these ideas in words painting sculpture etc the influence of the imagination is not less extensive than great     in the nature of every man there is somewhat original that serves to distinguish him from others that tends to form a character and with the concurrence of external accidents to make him meek or fiery candid or deceitful resolute or timorous cheerful or morose this original bent is termed disposition which must be distinguished from a principle no original bent obtains the latter appellation but what belongs to the whole species a principle makes part of the common nature of man a disposition makes part of the nature of this or that man a propensity comprehends both for it signifies indifferently either a principle or a disposition   0 affection signifying a settled bent of mind toward a particular being or thing occupies a middle place betwixt propensity on the one hand and passion on the other a propensity being original must exist before any opportunity be offered to exert it affection can never be original because having a special relation to a particular object it cannot exist till the object be presented again passion depends on the presence of the object in idea at least if not in reality when the idea vanishes the passion vanishes with it affection on the contrary once settled on a person is a lasting connection and like other connections subsists even when we do not think of it a familiar example will clear the whole there may be in the mind a propensity to gratitude which through want of an object happens never to be exerted and which therefore is never discovered even by the person who has it another who has the same propensity meets with a kindly office that makes him grateful to his benefactor an intimate connection is formed betwixt them termed affection which like other connections has a permanent existence though not always in view the affection for the most part lies dormant till an opportunity offer of exerting it in this circumstance it is converted into the passion of gratitude and the opportunity is greedily seized for testifying gratitude in the most complete manner     aversion i think must be opposed to affection and not to desire as it commonly is we have an affection for one person we have an aversion to another the former disposes us to do good to its object the latter to do ill     what is a sentiment it is not a perception for a perception signifies our consciousness of external objects it is not consciousness of an internal action such as thinking suspending thought inclining resolving willing etc neither is it a conception of relation amongst objects or of their differences a conception of this kind is termed opinion the term sentiment is appropriated to those thoughts that are suggested by a passion or emotion     attention is that state of mind which prepares a man to receive impressions according to the degree of attention objects make a stronger or weaker impression bacon in his natural history makes the following observations sounds are meliorated by the intension of the sense where the common sense is collected most to the particular sense of hearing and the sight suspended therefore sounds are sweeter as well as greater in the night than in the day and i suppose they are sweeter to blind men than to others and it is manifest that between sleeping and waking when all the senses are bound and suspended music is far sweeter than when one is fully waking  in an indolent state or in a reverie objects make but a slight impression far from what they make when they command our attention in a train of perceptions no single object makes such a figure as it would do single and apart for when the attention is divided among many objects no single object is entitled to a large share hence the stillness of night contributes to terror there being nothing to divert the attention horror ubique animos simul ipsa silentia terrent aeneid   zara silence and solitude are every where through all the gloomy ways and iron doors that hither lead nor human face nor voice is seen or heard a dreadful din was wont to grate the sense when entered here from groans and howls of slaves condemned from clink of chains and crash of rusty bars and creeking hinges and ever and anon the sight was dashed with frightful faces and the meagre looks of grim and ghastly executioners yet more this stillness terrifies my soul than did that scene of complicated horrors  mourning bride act   sc   and hence it is that an object seen at the termination of a confined view is more agreeable than when seen in a group with the surrounding objects the crow does sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren  merchant of venice     in matters of slight importance attention in a great measure is directed by will and for that reason it is our own fault if trifling objects make any deep impression had we power equally to withold our attention from matters of importance we might be proof against any deep impression but our power fails us here an interesting object seizes and fixes the attention beyond the possibility of control and while our attention is thus forcibly attached by one object others may solicit for admittance but in vain for they will not be regarded thus a small misfortune is scarce felt in presence of a greater lear thou think it is much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin so it is to thee but where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt thoudst shun a bear but if thy flight lay towered the roaring sea thoudst meet the bear in the mouth when the minds free the bodys delicate the tempest in my mind does from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there  king lear act   sc       genus species modification are terms invented to distinguish beings from each other individuals are distinguished by their qualities a large class of individuals enjoying qualities in common is termed a genus a subdivision of such class is termed a species again that circumstance which distinguishes one genus one species or even one individual from another is termed a modification the same particular that is termed a property or quality when considered as belonging to an individual or a class of individuals is termed a modification when considered as distinguishing the individual or the class from another a black skin and soft curled hair are properties of a negro the same circumstances considered as marks that distinguish a negro from a man of a different species are denominated modifications     objects of sight being complex are distinguishable into the several particulars that enter into the composition these objects are all of them colored and they all have length breadth and thickness when i behold a spreading oak i distinguish in this object size figure color and sometimes motion viewing a flowing river i distinguish color figure and constant motion a dye has color black spots six plain surfaces all equal and uniform the objects of touch have all of them extension some of them are felt rough some smooth some of them are hard some soft with respect to the other senses some of their objects are simple some complex a sound a taste a smell may be so simple as not to be distinguishable into any parts others are perceived to be compounded of different sounds different tastes and different smells     the eye at one look can take in a number of objects as of trees in a field or men in a crowd as these objects are distinct from each other each having a separate and independent existence they are distinguishable in the mind as well as in reality and there is nothing more easy than to abstract from some and to confine our contemplation to others a large oak with its spreading branches fixes our attention upon itself and abstracts us from the shrubs that surround it in the same manner with respect to compounded sounds tastes or smells we can fix our thoughts upon any one of the component parts abstracting our attention from the rest but the power of abstraction is not confined to objects that are separable in reality as well as mentally it also takes place where there can be no real separation the size the figure the color of a tree are inseparably connected and cannot exist independent of each other the same of length breadth and thickness and yet we can mentally confine our observations to one of these neglecting or abstracting from the rest here abstraction takes place where there cannot be a real separation     this power of abstraction is of great utility a carpenter considers a log of wood with regard to hardness firmness color and texture a philosopher neglectting these properties makes the log undergo a chemical analysis and examines its taste its smell and its component principles the geometrician confines his reasoning to the figure the length breadth and thickness in general every artist abstracting from all other properties confines his observations to those which have a more immediate connection with his profession     hence clearly appears the meaning of an abstract term and abstract idea if in viewing an object we can abstract from some of its parts or properties and attach ourselves to others there must be the same facility when we recall this object to the mind in idea this leads directly to the definition of an abstract idea viz a partial view of a complex object limited to one or more of the component parts or properties laying aside or abstracting from others a word that denotes an abstract idea is called an abstract term   0 the power of abstraction is bestowed upon man for the purposes solely of reasoning it tends greatly to the facility as well as clearness of any process of reasoning that withdrawing from every other circumstance we can confine our attention to the single property we desire to investigate     abstract ideas may i think be distinguished into three different kinds all equally subservient to the reasoning faculty individuals appear to have no end and did we not possess the faculty of distributing them into classes the mind would be lost in an endless variety and no progress be made in knowledge it is by the faculty of abstraction that we distribute beings into genera and species finding a number of individuals connected by certain qualities common to all we give a name to these individuals considered as thus connected which name by gathering them together into one class serves in a curt manner to express the whole of these individuals as distinct from others thus the word animal serves to denote every being which has selfmotion and the words man horse lion etc answer similar purposes this is the first and most common sort of abstraction and it is of the most extensive use by enabling us to comprehend in our reasoning whole kinds and sorts instead of individuals without end the next sort of abstract ideas and terms comprehends a number of individual objects considered as connected by some occasional relation a great number of persons collected together in one place without any other relation but merely that of contiguity are denominated a crowd in forming this term we abstract from sex from age from condition from dress etc a number of persons connected by being subjected to the same laws and to the same government are termed a nation and a number of men subjected to the same military command are termed an army a third sort of abstraction is where a single property or part which may be common to many individuals is selected to be the subject of our contemplation for example whiteness heat beauty length roundness head arm     abstract terms are a happy invention it is by their means chiefly that the particulars which we make the subject of our reasoning are brought into close union and separated from all others however naturally connected without the aid of such terms the mind could never be kept steady to its proper subject but would perpetually be in hazard of assuming foreign circumstances or neglecting what are essential in a word a general term denotes in a curt manner certain objects occasionally combined we can without the aid of language compare real objects by intuition when these objects are present and when absent we can compare them by means of the ideas we have of them but when we advance farther and attempt to make inferences and draw conclusions we always employ abstract terms even in thinking it would be as difficult to reason without them as to perform operations in algebra without signs for there is scarce any reasoning without some degree of abstraction and we cannot abstract to purpose without making use of general terms hence it follows that without language man would scarce be a rational being     the same thing in different respects has different names with respect to certain qualities it is termed a substance with respect to other qualities a body and with respect to qualities of all sorts a subject it is termed a passive subject with respect to an action exerted upon it an object with respect to a percipient a cause with respect to the effect it produces and an effect with respect to its cause  index the volumes are denoted by numeral letters the pages by
