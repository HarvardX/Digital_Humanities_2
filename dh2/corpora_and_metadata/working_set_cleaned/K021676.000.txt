a letter from the right honorable edmund burke to a noble lord on the attacks made upon him and his pension in the house of lords by the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale early in the present sessions of parliament  london printed for j owen no     piccadilly and f and c rivington no    st pauls churchyard       my lord i could hardly flatter myself with the hope that so very early in the season i should have to acknowledge obligations to the duke of bedford and to the earl of lauderdale these noble persons have lost no time in conferring upon me that sort of honor which it is alone within their competence and which it is certainly most congenial to their nature and their manners to bestow  to be ill spoken of in whatever language they speak by the zealots of the new sect in philosophy and politics of which these noble persons think so charitably and of which others think so justly to me is no matter of uneasiness or surprise to have incurred the displeasure of the duke of orleans or the duke of bedford to fall under the censure of citizen brissot or of his friend the earl of lauderdale i ought to consider as proofs not the least satisfactory that i have produced some part of the effect i proposed by my endeavors i have labored hard to earn what the noble lords are generous enough to pay personal offense i have given them none the part they take against me is from zeal to the cause it is well it is perfectly well i have to do homage to their justice i have to thank the bedfords and the lauderdales for having so faithfully and so fully acquitted toward me whatever arrear of debt was left undischarged by the priestleys and the pains  some perhaps may think them executors in their own wrong i at least have nothing to complain of they have gone beyond the demands of justice they have been a little perhaps beyond their intention favorable to me they have been the means of bringing out by their invectives the handsome things which lord grenville has had the goodness and condescension to say in my behalf retired as i am from the world and from all it is affairs and all it is pleasures i confess it does kindle in my nearly extinguished feelings a very vivid satisfaction to be so attacked and so commended it is soothing to my wounded mind to be commended by an able vigorous and well informed statesman and at the very moment when he stands forth with a manliness and resolution worthy of himself and of his cause for the preservation of the person and government of our sovereign and therein for the security of the laws the liberties the morals and the lives of his people to be in any fair way connected with such things is indeed a distinction no philosophy can make me above it no melancholy can depress me so low as to make me wholly insensible to such an honor  why will they not let me remain in obscurity and inaction are they apprehensive that if an atom of me remains the sect has something to fear must i be annihilated lest like old john ziscas my skin might be made into a drum to animate europe to eternal battle against a tyranny that threatens to overwhelm all europe and all the human race  my lord it is a subject of aweful meditation before this of france the annals of all time have not furnished an instance of a complete revolution that revolution seems to have extended even to the constitution of the mind of man it has this of wonderful in it that it resembles what lord verulam says of the operations of nature it was perfect not only in all its elements and principles but in all it is members and it is organs from the very beginning the moral scheme of france furnishes the only pattern ever known which they who admire will instantly resemble it is indeed an inexhaustible repertory of one kind of examples in my wretched condition though hardly to be classed with the living i am not safe from them they have tigers to fall upon animated strength they have hyenas to prey upon carcasses the national menagerie is collected by the first physiologists of the time and it is defective in no description of savage nature they pursue even such as me into the obscurest retreats and haul them before their revolutionary tribunals neither sex nor age  not the sanctuary of the tomb is sacred to them they have so determined a hatred to all privileged orders that they deny even to the departed the sad immunities of the grave they are not wholly without an object their turpitude purveys to their malice and they unplumb the dead for bullets to assassinate the living if all revolutionists were not proof against all caution i should recommend it to their consideration that no persons were ever known in history either sacred or profane to vex the sepulcher and by their sorceries to call up the prophetic dead with any other event than the prediction of their own disastrous fate  leave oh leave me to repose  in one thing i can excuse the duke of bedford for his attack upon me and my mortuary pension he cannot readily comprehend the transaction he condemns what i have obtained was the fruit of no bargain the production of no intrigue the result of no compromise the effect of no solicitation the first suggestion of it never came from me mediately or immediately to his majesty or any of his ministers it was long known that the instant my engagements would permit it and before the heaviest of all calamities had for ever condemned me to obscurity and sorrow i had resolved on a total retreat i had executed that design i was entirely out of the way of serving or of hurting any statesman or any party when the ministers so generously and so nobly carried into effect the spontaneous bounty of the crown both descriptions have acted as became them when i could no longer serve them the ministers have considered my situation when i could no longer hurt them the revolutionists have trampled on my infirmity my gratitude i trust is equal to the manner in which the benefit was conferred it came to me indeed at a time of life and in a state of mind and body in which no circumstance of fortune could afford me any real pleasure but this was no fault in the royal donor or in his ministers who were pleased in acknowledging the merits of an invalid servant of the public to assuage the sorrows of a desolate old man  it would ill become me to boast of any thing it would as ill become me thus called upon to depreciate the value of a long life spent with unexampled toil in the service of my country since the total body of my services on account of the industry which was shown in them and the fairness of my intentions have obtained the acceptance of my sovereign it would be absurd in me to range myself on the side of the duke of bedford and the corresponding society or as far as in me lies to permit a dispute on the rate at which the authority appointed by our constitution to estimate such things has been pleased to set them  loose libels ought to be passed by in silence and contempt by me they have been so always i knew that as long as i remained in public i should live down the calumnies of malice and the judgments of ignorance if i happened to be now and then in the wrong as who is not like all other men i must bear the consequence of my faults and my mistakes the libels of the present day are just of the same stuff as the libels of the past but they derive an importance from the rank of the persons they come from and the gravity of the place where they were uttered in some way or other i ought to take some notice of them to assert myself thus traduced is not vanity or arrogance it is a demand of justice it is a demonstration of gratitude if i am unworthy the ministers are worse than prodigal on that hypothesis i perfectly agree with the duke of bedford  for whatever i have been i am now no more i put myself on my country i ought to be allowed a reasonable freedom because i stand upon my deliverance and no culprit ought to plead in irons even in the utmost latitude of defensive liberty i wish to preserve all possible decorum whatever it may be in the eyes of these noble persons themselves to me their situation calls for the most profound respect if i should happen to trespass a little which i trust i shall not let it always be supposed that a confusion of characters may produce mistakes that in the masquerades of the grand carnival of our age whimsical adventures happen odd things are said and pass off if i should fail a single point in the high respect i owe to those illustrious persons i cannot be supposed to mean the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale of the house of peers but the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale of palace yard  the dukes and earls of brentford there they are on the pavement there they seem to come nearer to my humble level and virtually at least to have waved their high privilege  making this protestation i refuse all revolutionary tribunals where men have been put to death for no other reason than that they had obtained favors from the crown i claim not the letter but the spirit of the old english law that is to be tried by my peers i decline his graces jurisdiction as a judge i challenge the duke of bedford as a juror to pass upon the value of my services whatever his natural parts may be i cannot recognize in his few and idle years the competence to judge of my long and laborious life if i can help it he shall not be on the inquest of my quantum meruit poor rich man he can hardly know any thing of public industry in it is exertions or can estimate it is compensations when it is work is done i have no doubt of his graces readiness in all the calculations of vulgar arithmetic but i shrewdly suspect that he is very little studied in the theory of moral proportions and has never learned the rule of three in the arithmetic of policy and state  his grace thinks i have obtained too much i answer that my exertions whatever they have been were such as no hopes of pecuniary reward could possibly excite and no pecuniary compensation can possibly reward them between money and services of this kind i said it long since speech on oeconomical reform    0  when i was not myself concerned there is no common measurer money is made for the comfort and convenience of animal life it cannot be a reward for what mere animal life must indeed sustain but never can inspire with submission to his grace i have not had more than sufficient as to any noble use i trust i know how to employ as well as he a much greater fortune than he possesses in a more confined application i certainly stand in need of every kind of relief and easement much more than he does when i say i have not received more than i deserve is this the language i hold to majesty no far very far from it before that presence i claim no merit at all every thing toward me is favor and bounty one style to a gracious benefactor another to a proud and insulting foe  his grace is pleased to aggravate my guilt by charging my acceptance of his majestys grant as a departure from my ideas and the spirit of my conduct with regard to economy if it be my ideas of economy were false and ill founded but they are the duke of bedfords ideas of economy i have contradicted and not my own if he means to allude to certain bills brought in by me on a message from the throne in      i tell him that there is nothing in my conduct that can contradict either the letter or the spirit of those acts  does he mean the payoffice act i take it for granted he does not the act to which he alludes is i suppose the establishment act i greatly doubt whether his grace has ever read the one or the other the first of these systems cost me with every assistance which my then situation gave me pains incredible i found an opinion common through all the offices and general in the public at large that it would prove impossible to reform and methodize the office of paymaster general i undertook it however and i succeeded in my undertaking whether the military service or whether the general economy of our finances have profited by that act i leave to those who are acquainted with the army and with the treasury to judge  an opinion full as general prevailed also at the same time that nothing could be done for the regulation of the civillist establishment the very attempt to introduce method into it and any limitations to it is services was held absurd i had not seen the man who so much as suggested one oeconomical principle or an oeconomical expedient upon that subject nothing but coarse amputation or coarser taxation were then talked of both of them without design combination or the least shadow of principle blind and headlong zeal or factious fury were the whole contribution brought by the most noisy on that occasion toward the satisfaction of the public or the relief of the crown  let me tell my youthful censor that the necessities of that time required something very different from what others then suggested or what his grace now conceives let me inform him that it was one of the most critical periods in our annals  astronomers have supposed that if a certain comet whose path intersected the ecliptic had met the earth in some i forget what sign it would have whirled us along with it in it is excentrick course into god knows what regions of heat and cold had the portentous comet of the rights of man which from it is horrid hair shakes pestilence and war and with fear of change perplexes monarchs had that comet crossed upon us in that internal state of england nothing human could have prevented our being irresistibly hurried out of the highway of heaven into all the vices crimes horrors and miseries of the french revolution  happily france was not then jacobinized her hostility was at a good distance we had a limb cut off but we preserved the body we lost our colonies but we kept our constitution there was indeed much intestine heat there was a dreadful fermentation wild and savage insurrection quitted the woods and prowled about our streets in the name of reform such was the distemper of the public mind that there was no madman in his maddest ideas and maddest projects who might not count upon numbers to support his principles and execute his designs  many of the changes by a great misnomer called parliamentary reforms went not in the intention of all the professors and supporters of them undoubtedly but went in their certain and in my opinion not very remote effect home to the utter destruction of the constitution of this kingdom had they taken place not france but england would have had the honor of leading up the deathdance of democratick revolution other projects exactly coincident in time with those struck at the very existence of the kingdom under any constitution there are who remember the blind fury of some and the lamentable helplessness of others here a torpid confusion from a panic fear of the danger there the same inaction from a stupid insensibility to it here wellwishers to the mischief there indifferent lookerson at the same time a sort of national convention dubious in its nature and perilous in its example nosed parliament in the very seat of its authority sat with a sort of superintendance over it and little less than dictated to it not only laws but the very form and essence of legislature itself in ireland things ran in a still more eccentrick course government was unnerved confounded and in a manner suspended it is equipoise was totally gone i do not mean to speak disrespectfully of lord north he was a man of admirable parts of general knowledge of a versatile understanding fitted for every sort of business of infinite wit and pleasantry of a delightful temper and with a mind most perfectly disinterested but it would be only to degrade myself by a weak adulation and not to honor the memory of a great man to deny that he wanted something of the vigilance and spirit of command that the time required indeed a darkness next to the fog of this awful day loured over the whole region for a little time the helm appeared abandoned  ipse diem noctemque negat discernere coelo nec meminisse viae media palinurus in unda   at that time i was connected with men  high place in the community they loved lberty as much as the duke of bedford can do and they understood it at least as well perhaps their politics as usual took a tincture from their character and they cultivated what they loved the liberty they pursued was a liberty inseparable from order from virtue from morals and from religion and was neither hypocritically nor fanatically followed they did not wish that liberty in itself one of the first of blessings should in it is perversion become the greatest curse which could fall upon mankind to preserve the constitution entire and practically equal to all the great ends of it is formation not in one single part but in all it is parts was to them the first object popularity and power they regarded alike these were with them only different means of obtaining that object and had no preference over each other in their minds but as one or the other might afford a surer or a less certain prospect of arriving at that end it is some consolation to me in the chearless gloom which darkens the evening of my life that with them i commenced my political career and never for a moment in reality nor in appearance for any length of time was separated from their good wishes and good opinion  by what accident it matters not nor upon what desert but just then and in the midst of that hunt of obloquy which ever has pursued me with a full cry through life i had obtained a very considerable degree of public confidence i know well enough how equivocal a test this kind of popular opinion forms of the merit that obtained it i am no stranger to the insecurity of it is tenure i do not boast of it it is mentioned to show not how highly i prize the thing but my right to value the use i made of it i endeavored to turn that shortlived advantage to myself into a permanent benefit to my country far am i from detracting from the merit of some gentlemen out of office or in it on that occasion no  it is not my way to refuse a full and heaped measure of justice to the aids that i receive i have through life been willing to give every thing to others and to reserve nothing for myself but the inward conscience that i had omitted no pains to discover to animate to discipline to direct the abilities of the country for it is service and to place them in the best light to improve their age or to adorn it this conscience i have i have never suppressed any man never checked him for a moment in his course by any jealousy or by any policy i was always ready to the height of my means and they were always infinitely below my desires to forward those abilities which overpowered my own he is an illfurnished undertaker who has no machinery but his own hands to work with poor in my own faculties i ever thought myself rich in theirs in that period of difficulty and danger more especially i consulted and sincerely cooperated with men of all parties who seemed disposed to the same ends or to any main part of them nothing to prevent disorder was omitted when it appeared nothing to subdue it was left uncounselled nor unexecuted as far as i could prevail at the time i speak of and having a momentary lead so aided and so encouraged and as a feeble instrument in a mighty hand  i do not say i saved my country i am sure i did my country important service there were few indeed that did not at that time acknowledge it and that time was thirteen years ago it was but one voice that no man in the kingdom better deserved an honorable provision should be made for him  so much for my general conduct through the whole of the portentous crisis from    0 to      and the general sense then entertained of that conduct by my country but my character as a reformer in the particular instances which the duke of bedford refers to is so connected in principle with my opinions on the hideous changes which have since barbarized france and spreading thence threaten the political and moral order of the whole world that it seems to demand something of a more detailed discussion  my oeconomical reforms were not as his grace may think the suppression of a paltry pension or employment more or less economy in my plans was as it ought to be secondary subordinate instrumental i acted on state principles i found a great distemper in the commonwealth and according to the nature of the evil and of the object i treated it the malady was deep it was complicated in the causes and in the symptoms throughout it was full of contraindicants on one hand government daily growing more invidious for an apparent increase of the means of strength was every day growing more contemptible by real weakness nor was this dissolution confined to government commonly so called it extended to parliament which was losing not a little in it is dignity and estimation by an opinion of it is not acting on worthy motives on the other hand the desires of the people partly natural and partly infused into them by art appeared in so wild and inconsiderate a manner with regard to the oeconomical object for i set aside for a moment the dreadful tampering with the body of the constitution itself that if their petitions had literally been complied with the state would have been convulsed and a gate would have been opened through which all property might be sacked and ravaged nothing could have saved the public from the mischiefs of the false reform but it is absurdity which would soon have brought itself and with it all real reform into discredit this would have left a rankling wound in the hearts of the people who would know they had failed in the accomplishment of their wishes but who like the rest of mankind in all ages would impute the blame to any thing rather than to their own proceedings but there were then persons in the world who nourished complaint and would have been thoroughly disappointed if the people were ever satisfied i was not of that humor i wished that they should be satisfied it was my aim to give to the people the substance of what i knew they desired and what i thought was right whether they desired it or not before it had been modified for them into senseless petitions i knew that there is a manifest marked distinction which ill men with ill designs or weak men incapable of any design will constantly be confounding that is a marked distinction between change and reformation the former alters the substance of the objects themselves and gets rid of all their essential good as well as of all the accidental evil annexed to them change is novelty and whether it is to operate any one of the effects of reformation at all or whether it may not contradict the very principle upon which reformation is desired cannot be certainly known beforehand reform is not a change in the substance or in the primary modification of the object but a direct application of a remedy to the grievance complained of so far as that is removed all is sure it stops there and if it fails the substance which underwent the operation at the very worst is but where it was  all this in effect i think but am not sure i have said elsewhere it cannot at this time be too often repeated line upon line precept upon precept until it comes into the currency of a proverb to innovate is not to reform the french revolutionists complained of every thing they refused to reform any thing and they left nothing no nothing at all unchanged the consequences are before us  not in remote history not in future prognostication they are about us they are upon us they shake the public security they menace private enjoyment they dwarf the growth of the young they break the quiet of the old if we travel they stop our way they infest us in town they pursue us to the country our business is interrupted our repose is troubled our pleasures are saddened our very studies are poisoned and perverted and knowledge is rendered worse than ignorance by the enormous evils of this dreadful innovation the revolution harpies of france sprung from night and hell or from that chaotick anarchy which generates equivocally all monstrous all prodigious things cuckoolike adulterously lay their eggs and brood over and hatch them in the nest of every neighboring state these obscene harpies who deck themselves in i know not what divine attributes but who in reality are foul and ravenous birds of prey both mothers and daughters flutter over our heads and souse down upon our tables and leave nothing unrent unrifled unravaged or unpolluted with the slime of their filthy offal tristius haud illis monstrum nec saevior ulla pestis and ira deum stygiis sese extulit undis virginei volucrum vultus faedissima ventris proluvies uncaeque manus and pallida semper ora fame  here the poet breaks the line because he and that he is virgil had not verse or language to describe that monster even as he had conceived her had he lived to our time he would have been more overpowered with the reality than he was with the imagination virgil only knew the horror of the times before him had he lived to see the revolutionists and constitutionalists of france he would have had more horrid and disgusting features of his harpies to describe and more frequent failures in the attempt to describe them     if his grace can contemplate the result of this complete innovation or as some friends of his will call it reform in the whole body of it is solidity and compound mass at which as hamlet says the face of heaven glows with horror and indignation and which in truth makes every reflecting mind and every feeling heart perfectly thoughtsick without a thorough abhorrence of every thing they say and every thing they do i am amazed at the morbid strength or the natural infirmity of his mind  it was then not my love but my hatred to innovation that produced my plan of reform without troubling myself with the exactness of the logical diagram i considered them as things substantially opposite it was to prevent that evil that i proposed the measures which his grace is pleased and i am not sorry he is pleased to recall to my recollection i had what i hope that noble duke will remember in all his operations a state to preserve as well as a state to reform i had a people to gratify but not to inflame or to mislead i do not claim half the credit for what i did as for what i prevented from being done in that situation of the public mind i did not undertake as was then proposed to new model the house of commons or the house of lords or to change the authority under which any officer of the crown acted who was suffered at all to exist crown lords commons judicial system system of administration existed as they had existed before and in the mode and manner in which they had always existed my measures were what i then truly stated them to the house to be in their intent healing and mediatorial a complaint was made of too much influence in the house of commons i reduced it in both houses and i gave my reasons article by article for every reduction and showed why i thought it safe for the service of the state i heaved the lead every inch of way i made a disposition to expense was complained of to that i opposed not mere retrenchment but a system of economy which would make a random expense without plan or foresight in future not easily practicable i proceeded upon principles of research to put me in possession of my matter on principles of method to regulate it and on principles in the human mind and in civil affairs to secure and perpetuate the operation i conceived nothing arbitrarily nor proposed any thing to be done by the will and pleasure of others or my own but by reason and by reason only i have ever abhorred since the first dawn of my understanding to this it is obscure twilight all the operations of opinion fancy inclination and will in the affairs of government where only a sovereign reason paramount to all forms of legislation and administration should dictate government is made for the very purpose of opposing that reason to will and to caprice in the reformers or in the reformed in the governors or in the governed in kings in senates or in people  on a careful review therefore and analysis of all the component parts of the civil list and on weighing them each against other in order to make as much as possible all of them a subject of estimate the foundation and cornerstone of all regular provident economy it appeared to me evident that this was impracticable whilst that part called the pension list was totally discretionary in it is amount for this reason and for this only i proposed to reduce it both in it is gross quantity and in it is larger individual proportions to a certainty lest if it were left without a general limit it might eat up the civil list service if suffered to be granted in portions too great for the fund it might defeat it is own end and by unlimited allowances to some it might disable the crown in means of providing for others the pension list was to be kept as a sacred fund but it could not be kept as a constant open fund sufficient for growing demands if some demands could wholly devour it the tenor of the act will show that it regarded the civil list only the reduction of which to some sort of estimate was my great object  no other of the crown funds did i meddle with because they had not the same relations this of the four and a half per cents does his grace imagine had escaped me or had escaped all the men of business who acted with me in those regulations i knew that such a fund existed and that pensions had been always granted on it before his grace was born this fund was full in my eye it was full in the eyes of those who worked with me it was left on principle on principle i did what was then done and on principle what was left undone was omitted i did not dare to rob the nation of all funds to reward merit if i pressed this point too close i acted contrary to the avowed principles on which i went gentlemen are very fond of quoting me but if any one thinks it worth his while to know the rules that guided me in my plan of reform he will read my printed speech on that subject at least what is contained from page   0 to page     in the second volume of the collection which a friend has given himself the trouble to make of my publications be this as it may these two bills though achieved with the greatest labor and management of every sort both within and without the house were only a part and but a small part of a very large system comprehending all the objects i stated in opening my proposition and indeed many more which i just hinted at in my speech to the electors of bristol when i was put out of that representation all these in some state or other of forwardness i have long had by me  but do i justify his majestys grace on these grounds i think them the least of my services the time gave them an occasional value what i have done in the way of political economy was far from confined to this body of measures i did not come into parliament to con my lesson i had earned my pension before i set my foot in st stephens chapel i was prepared and disciplined to this political warfare the first session i sat in parliament i found it necessary to analyze the whole commercial financial constitutional and foreign interests of great britain and it is empire a great deal was then done and more far more would have been done if more had been permitted by events then in the vigor of my manhood my constitution sunk under my labor had i then died and i seemed to myself very near death i had then earned for those who belonged to me more than the duke of bedfords ideas of service are of power to estimate but in truth these services i am called to account for are not those on which i value myself the most if i were to call for a reward which i have never done it should be for those in which for fourteen years without intermission i showed the most industry and had the least success i mean in the affairs of india they are those on which i value myself the most most for the importance most for the labor most for the judgment most for constancy and perseverance in the pursuit others may value them most for the intention in that surely they are not mistaken  does his grace think that they who advised the crown to make my retreat easy considered me only as an oeconomist that well understood however is a good deal if i had not deemed it of some value i should not have made political economy an object of my humble studies from my very early youth to near the end of my service in parliament even before at least to any knowledge of mine it had employed the thoughts of speculative men in other parts of europe at that time it was still in it is infancy in england where in the last century it had it is origin great and learned men thought my studies were not wholly thrown away and deigned to communicate with me now and then on some particulars of their immortal works something of these studies may appear incidentally in some of the earliest things i published the house has been witness to their effect and has profited of them more or less for above eight and twenty years  to their estimate i leave the matter i was not like his grace of bedford swaddled and rocked and dandled into a legislator  nitor in adversum is the motto for a man like me i possessed not one of the qualities nor cultivated one of the arts that recommend men to the favor and protection of the great i was not made for a minion or a tool as little did i follow the trade of winning the hearts by imposing on the understandings of the people at every step of my progress in life for in every step was i traversed and opposed and at every turnpike i met i was obliged to show my passport and again and again to prove my sole title to the honor of being useful to my country by a proof that i was not wholly unacquainted with it is laws and the whole system of it is interests both abroad and at home otherwise no rank no toleration even for me i had no arts but manly arts on them i have stood and please god in spite of the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale to the last gasp will i stand  had his grace condescended to enquire concerning the person whom he has not thought it below him to reproach he might have found that in the whole course of my life i have never on any pretense of economy or on any other pretense so much as in a single instance stood between any man and his reward of service or his encouragement in useful talent and pursuit from the highest of those services and pursuits to the lowest on the contrary i have on an hundred occasions exerted myself with singular zeal to forward every mans even tolerable pretensions i have more than once had goodnatured reprehensions from my friends for carrying the matter to something bordering on abuse this line of conduct whatever it is merits might be was partly owing to natural disposition but i think full as much to reason and principle i looked on the consideration of public service or public ornament to be real and very justice and i ever held a scanty and penurious justice to partake of the nature of a wrong i held it to be in its consequences the worst economy in the world in saving money i soon can count up all the good i do but when by a cold penury i blast the abilities of a nation and stunt the growth of it is active energies the ill i may do is beyond all calculation whether it be too much or too little whatever i have done has been general and systematick i have never entered into those trifling vexations and oppressive details that have been falsely and most ridiculously laid to my charge  did i blame the pensions given to mr bar and mr dunning between the proposition and execution of my plan no surely no those pensions were within my principles i assert it those gentlemen deserved their pensions their titles  all they had and if more they had i should have been but pleased the more they were men of talents they were men of service i put the profession of the law out of the question in one of them it is a service that rewards itself but their public service though from their abilities unquestionably of more value than mine in it is quantity and in it is duration was not to be mentioned with it but i never could drive a hard bargain in my life concerning any matter whatever and least of all do i know how to haggle and huckster with merit pension for myself i obtained none nor did i solicit any yet i was loaded with hatred for every thing that was withheld and with obloquy for every thing that was given i was thus left to support the grants of a name ever dear to me and ever venerable to the world in favor of those who were no friends of mine or of his against the rude attacks of those who were at that time friends to the grantees and their own zealous partisans i have never heard the earl of lauderdale complain of these pensions he finds nothing wrong till he comes to me this is impartiality in the true modern revolutionary style  whatever i did at that time so far as it regarded order and economy is stable and eternal as all principles must be a particular order of things may be altered order itself cannot lose its value as to other particulars they are variable by time and by circumstances laws of regulation are not fundamental laws the public exigencies are the masters of all such laws they rule the laws and are not to be ruled by them they who exercise the legislative power at the time must judge  it may be new to his grace but i beg leave to tell him that mere parsimony is not economy it is separable in theory from it and in fact it may or it may not be a part of economy according to circumstances expense and great expense may be an essential part in true economy if parsimony were to be considered as one of the kinds of that virtue there is however another and an higher economy economy is a distributive virtue and consists not in saving but in selection parsimony requires no providence no sagacity no powers of combination no comparison no judgment mere instinct and that not an instinct of the noblest kind may produce this false economy in perfection the other economy has larger views it demands a discriminating judgment and a firm sagacious mind it shuts one door to impudent importunity only to open another and a wider to unpresuming merit if none but meritorious service or real talent were to be rewarded this nation has not wanted and this nation will not want the means of rewarding all the service it ever will receive and encouraging all the merit it ever will produce no state since the foundation of society has been impoverished by that species of profusion had the economy of selection and proportion been at all times observed we should not now have had an overgrown duke of bedford to oppress the industry of humble men and to limit by the standard of his own conceptions the justice the bounty or if he pleases the charity of the crown  his grace may think as meanly as he will of my deserts in the far greater part of my conduct in life it is free for him to do so there will always be some difference of opinion in the value of political services but there is one merit of mine which he of all men living ought to be the last to call in question i have supported with very great zeal and i am told with some degree of success those opinions or if his grace likes another expression better those old prejudices which buoy up the ponderous mass of his nobility wealth and titles i have omitted no exertion to prevent him and them from sinking to that level to which the meretricious french faction his grace at least coquets with omit no exertion to reduce both i have done all i could to discountenance their enquiries into the fortunes of those who hold large portions of wealth without any apparent merit of their own i have strained every nerve to keep the duke of bedford in that situation which alone makes him my superior your lordship has been a witness of the use he makes of that preeminence  but be it that this is virtue be it that there is virtue in this well selected rigor yet all virtues are not equally becoming to all men and at all times there are crimes undoubtedly there are crimes which in all seasons of our existence ought to put a generous antipathy in action crimes that provoke an indignant justice and call forth a warm and animated pursuit but all things that concern what i may call the preventive police of morality all things merely rigid harsh and censorial the antiquated moralists at whose feet i was brought up would not have thought these the fittest matter to form the favorite virtues of young men of rank what might have been well enough and have been received with a veneration mixed with awe and terror from an old severe crabbed cato would have wanted something of propriety in the young scipios the ornament of the roman nobility in the flower of their life but the times the morals the masters the scholars have all undergone a thorough revolution it is a vile illiberal school this new french academy of the sans culottes there is nothing in it that is fit for a gentleman to learn  whatever it is vogue may be i still flatter myself that the parents of the growing generation will be satisfied with what is to be taught to their children in westminster in eaton or in winchester i still indulge the hope that no grown gentleman or nobleman of our time will think of finishing at mr thelwalls lecture whatever may have been left incomplete at the old universities of his country i would give to lord grenville and mr pit for a motto what was said of a roman censor or praetor or what was he who in virtue of a senatus consultum shut up certain academies cludere ludum impudentiae jussit every honest father of a family in the kingdom will rejoice at the breaking up for the holidays and will pray that there may be a very long vacation in all such schools  the awful state of the time and not myself or my own justification is my true object in what i now write or in what i shall ever write or say it little signifies to the world what becomes of such things as me or even as the duke of bedford what i say about either of us is nothing more than a vehicle as you my lord will easily perceive to convey my sentiments on matters far more worthy of your attention it is when i stick to my apparent first subject that i ought to apologize not when i depart from it i therefore must beg your lordships pardon for again resuming it after this very short digression assuring you that i shall never altogether lose sight of such matter as persons abler than i am may turn to some profit  the duke of bedford conceives that he is obliged to call the attention of the house of peers to his majestys grant to me which he considers as excessive and out of all bounds  i know not how it has happened but it really seems that whilst his grace was meditating his wellconsidered censure upon me he fell into a sort of sleep homer nods and the duke of bedford may dream and as dreams even his golden dreams are apt to be illpieced and incongruously put together his grace preserved his idea of reproach to me but took the subject matter from the crowngrants to his own family this is the stuff of which his dreams are made in that way of putting things together his grace is perfectly in the right the grants to the house of russel were so enormous as not only to outrage economy but even to stagger credibility the duke of bedford is the leviathan among all the creatures of the crown he tumbles about his unwieldy bulk he plays and frolicks in the ocean of the royal bounty huge as he is and whilst he lies floating many a rood he is still a creature his ribs his fins his whalebone his blubber the very spiracles through which he spouts a torrent of brine against his origin and covers me all over with the spray  every thing of him and about him is from the throne is it for him to question the dispensation of the royal favor  i really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public merits of his grace by which he justifies the grants he holds and these services of mine on the favorable construction of which i have obtained what his grace so much disapproves in private life i have not at all the honor of acquaintance with the noble duke but i ought to presume and it costs me nothing to do so that he abundantly deserves the esteem and love of all who live with him but as to public service why truly it would not be more ridiculous for me to compare myself in rank in fortune in splendid descent in youth strength or figure with the duke of bedford than to make a parallel between his services and my attempts to be useful to my country it would not be gross adulation but uncivil irony to say that he has any public merit of his own to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed pensions were obtained my merits whatever they are are original and personal his are derivative it is his ancestor the original pensioner that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit which makes his grace so very delicate and exceptions about the merit of all other grantees of the crown had he permitted me to remain in quiet i should have said it is his estate that is enough it is his by law what have i to do with it or it is history he would naturally have said on his side it is this mans fortune  he is as good now as my ancestor was two hundred and fifty years ago i am a young man with very old pensions he is an old man with very young pensions  that is all  why will his grace by attacking me force me reluctantly to compare my little merit with that which obtained from the crown those prodigies of profuse donation by which he tramples on the mediocrity of humble and laborious individuals i would willingly leave him to the heralds college which the philosophy of the sans culottes prouder by far than all the garters and norroys and clarencieux and rouge dragons that ever pranced in a procession of what his friends call aristocrates and despots will abolish with contumely and scorn these historians recorders and blazoners of virtues and arms differ wholly from that other description of historians who never assign any act of politicians to a good mtive these gentle historians on the contrary dip their pens in nothing but the milk of human kindness they seek no further for merit than the preamble of a patent or the inscription on a tomb with them every man created a peer is first an hero ready made they judge of every mans capacity for office by the offices he has filled and the more offices the more ability every generalofficer with them is a marlborough every statesman a burleigh every judge a murray or a york they who alive were laughed at or pitied by all their acquaintance make as good a figure as the best of them in the pages of gwillim edmonson and collins  to these recorders so full of good nature to the great and prosperous i would willingly leave the first baron russel and earl of bedford and the merits of his grants but the aulnager the weigher the meter of grants will not suffer us to acquiesce in the judgment of the prince reigning at the time when they were made they are never good to those who earn them well then since the new grantees have war made on them by the old and that the word of the sovereign is not to be taken let us turn our eyes to history in which great men have always a pleasure in contemplating the heroic origin of their house  the first peer of the name the first purchaser of the grants was a mr russel a person of an ancient gentlemans family raised by being a minion of henry the eighth as there generally is some resemblance of character to create these relations the favorite was in all likelihood much such another as his master the first of those immoderate grants was not taken from the ancient demesne of the crown but from the recent confiscation of the ancient nobility of the land the lion having sucked the blood of his prey threw the offal carcass to the jackall in waiting having tasted once the food of confiscation the favorites became fierce and ravenous this worthy favourites first grant was from the lay nobility the second infinitely improving on the enormity of the first was from the plunder of the church in truth his grace is somewhat excusable for his dislike to a grant like mine not only in it is quantity but in it is kind so different from his own  mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign his from henry the eighth  mine had not it is fund in the murder of any innocent person of illustrious rank see the history of the melancholy catastrophe of the duke of buckingham temp hen    or in the pillage of any body of unoffending men his grants were from the aggregate and consolidated funds of judgments iniquitously legal and from possessions voluntarily surrendered by the lawful proprietors with the gibbet at their door  the merit of the grantee whom he derives from was that of being a prompt and greedy instrument of a levelling tyrant who oppressed all descriptions of his people but who fell with particular fury on every thing that was great and noble mine has been in endeavoring to screen every man in every class from oppression and particularly in defending the high and eminent who in the bad times of confiscating princes confiscating chief governors or confiscating demagogues are the most exposed to jealousy avarice and envy  the merit of the original grantee of his graces pensions was in giving his hand to the work and partaking the spoil with a prince who plundered a part of his national church of his time and country mine was in defending the whole of the national church of my own time and my own country and the whole of the national churches of all countries from the principles and the examples which lead to ecclesiastical pillage thence to a contempt of all prescriptive titles thence to the pillage of all property and thence to universal desolation  the merit of the origin of his graces fortune was in being a favorite and chief adviser to a prince who left no liberty to their native country my endeavor was to obtain liberty for the municipal country in which i was born and for all descriptions and denominations in it  mine was to support with unrelaxing vigilance every right every privilege every franchise in this my adopted my dearer and more comprehensive country and not only to preserve those rights in this chief seat of empire but in every nation in every land in every climate language and religion in the vast domain that still is under the protection and the larger that was once under the protection of  british crown  his founders merits were by arts in which he served his master and made his fortune to bring poverty wretchedness and depopulation on his country mine were under a benevolent prince in promoting the commerce manufactures and agriculture of his kingdom in which his majesty shows an eminent example who even in his amusements is a patriot and in hours of leisure an improver of his native soil  his founders merit was the merit of a gentleman raised by the arts of a court and the protection of a wolsey to the eminence of a great and potent lord his merit in that eminence was by instigating a tyrant to injustice to provoke a people to rebellion  my merit was to awaken the sober part of the country that they might put themselves on their guard against any one potent lord or any greater number of potent lords or any combination of great leading men of any sort if ever they should attempt to proceed in the same courses but in the reverse order that is by instigating a corrupted populace to rebellion and through that rebellion introducing a tyranny yet worse than the tyranny which his graces ancestor supported and of which he profited in the manner we behold in the despotism of henry the eighth  the political merit of the first pensioner of his graces house was that of being concerned as a counselor of state in advising and in his person executing the conditions of a dishonorable peace with france the surrendering the fortress of boulogne then our outguard on the continent by that surrender calais the key of france and the bridle in the mouth of that power was not many years afterward finally lost my merit has been in resisting the power and pride of france under any form of it is rule but in opposing it with the greatest zeal and earnestness when that rule appeared in the worst form it could assume the worst indeed which the prime cause and principle of all evil could possibly give it it was my endeavor by every means to excite a spirit in the house where i had the honor of a seat for carrying on with early vigor and decision the most clearly just and necessary war that this or any nation ever carried on in order to save my country from the iron yoke of it is power and from the more dreadful contagion of it is principles to preserve while they can be preserved pure and untainted the ancient inbred integrity piety good nature and good humor of the people of england from the dreadful pestilence which beginning in france threatens to lay waste the whole moral and in a great degree the whole physical world having done both in the focus of it is most intense malignity  the labors of his graces founder merited the curses not loud but deep of the commons of england on whom he and his master had effected a complete parliamentary reform by making them in their slavery and humiliation the true and adequate representatives of a debased degraded and undone people my merits were in having had an active though not always an ostentatious share in every one act without exception of undisputed constitutional utility in my time and in having supported on all occasions the authority the efficiency and the privileges of the commons of great britain i ended my services by a recorded and fully reasoned assertion on their own journals of their constitutional rights and a vindication of their constitutional conduct i labored in all things to merit their inward approbation and along with the assistants of the largest the greatest and best of my endeavors i received their free unbiassed public and solemn thanks  thus stands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants which compose the duke of bedfords fortune as balanced against mine in the name of common sense why should the duke of bedford think that none but of the house of russel are entitled to the favor of the crown why should he imagine that no king of england has been capable of judging of merit but king henry the eighth indeed he will pardon me he is a little mistaken all virtue did not end in the first earl of bedford all discernment did not lose it is vision when his creator closed his eyes let him remit his rigor on the disproportion between merit and reward in others and they will make no enquiry into the origin of his fortune they will regard with much more satisfaction as he will contemplate with infinitely more advantage whatever in his pedigree has been dulcified by an exposure to the influence of heaven in a long flow of generations from the hard acidulous metallic tincture of the spring it is little to be doubted that several of his forefathers in that long series have degenerated into honor and virtue let the duke of bedford i am sure he will reject with scorn and horror the counsels of the lecturers those wicked panders to avarice and ambition who would tempt him in the troubles of his country to seek another enormous fortune from the forfeitures of another nobility and the plunder of another church let him and i trust that yet he will employ all the energy of his youth and all the resources of his wealth to crush rebellious principles which have no foundation in morals and rebellious movements that have no provocation in tyranny  then will be forgot the rebellions which by a doubtful priority in crime his ancestor had provoked and extinguished on such a conduct in the noble duke many of his countrymen might and with some excuse might give way to the enthusiasm of their gratitude and in the dashing style of some of the old declaimers cry out that if the fates had found no other way in which they could give a at si non aliam venturo fata neroni etc duke of bedford and his opulence as props to a tottering world then the butchery of the duke of buckingham might be tolerated it might be regarded even with complacency whilst in the heir of confiscation they saw the sympathizing comforter of the martyrs who suffer under the cruel confiscation of this day whilst they beheld with admiration his zealous protection of the virtuous and loyal nobility of france and his manly support of his brethren the yet standing nobility and gentry of his native land then his graces merit would be pure and new and sharp as fresh from the mint of honor as he pleased he might reflect honor on his predecessors or throw it forward on those who were to succeed him he might be the propagator of the stock of honor or the root of it as he thought proper  had it pleased god to continue to me the hopes of succession i should have been according to my mediocrity and the mediocrity of the age i live in a sort of founder of a family i should have left a son who in all the points in which personal merit can be viewed in science in erudition in genius in taste in honor in generosity in humanity in every liberal sentiment and every liberal accomplishment would not have shown himself inferior to the duke of bedford or to any of those whom he traces in his line his grace very soon would have wanted all plausibility in his attack upon that provision which belonged more to mine than to me he would soon have supplied every deficiency and symmetrized every disproportion it would not have been for that successor to resort to any stagnant wasting reservoir of merit in me or in any ancestry he had in himself a salient living spring of generous and manly action every day he lived he would have repurchased the bounty of the crown and ten times more if ten times more he had received he was made a public creature and had no enjoyment whatever but in the performance of some duty at this exigent moment the loss of a finished man is not easily supplied  but a disposer whose power we are little able to resist and whose wisdom it behooves us not at all to dispute has ordained it in another manner and whatever my querulous weakness might suggest a far better the storm has gone over me and i lie like one of those old oaks which the late hurricane has scattered about me i am stripped of all my honors i am torn up by the roots and lie prostrate on the earth there and prostrate there i most unfeignedly recognize the divine justice and in some degree submit to it but whilst i humble myself before god i do not know that it is forbidden to repel the attacks of unjust and inconsiderate men the patience of job is proverbial after some of the convulsive struggles of our irritable nature he submitted himself and repented in dust and ashes but even so i do not find him blamed for reprehending and with a considerable degree of verbal asperity those illnatured neighbors of his who visited his dunghill to read moral political and oeconomical lectures on his misery i am alone i have none to meet my enemies in the gate indeed my lord i greatly deceive myself if in this hard season i would give a peck of refuse wheat for all that is called fame and honor in the world this is the appetite but of a few it is a luxury it is a privilege it is an indulgence for those who are at their ease but we are all of us made to shun disgrace as we are made to shrink from pain and poverty and disease it is an instinct and under the direction of reason instinct is always in the right i live in an inverted order they who ought to have succeeded me are gone before me they who should have been to me as posterity are in the place of ancestors i owe to the dearest relation which ever must subsist in memory that act of piety which he would have performed to me i owe it to him to show that he was not descended as the duke of bedford would have it from an unworthy parent  the crown has considered me after long service the crown has paid the duke of bedford by advance he has had a long credit for any service which he may perform hereafter he is secure and long may he be secure in his advance whether he performs any services or not but let him take care how he endangers the safety of that constitution which secures his own utility or his own insignificance or how he discourages those who take up even puny arms to defend an order of things which like the sun of heaven shines alike on the useful and the worthless his grants are engrafted on the public law of europe covered with the awful hoar of innumerable ages they are guarded by the sacred rules of prescription found in that full treasury of jurisprudence from which the jejuneness and penury of our municipal law has by degrees been enriched and strengthened this prescription i had my share a very full share in bringing to it is perfection sir george saviles act called the nullum tempus act  the duke of bedford will stand as long as prescriptive law endures as long as the great stable laws of property common to us with all civilized nations are kept in their integrity and without the smallest intermixture of the laws maxims principles or precedents of the grand revolution they are secure against all changes but one the whole revolutionary system institutes digest code novels text gloss comment are not only not the same but they are the very reverse and the reverse fundamentally of all the laws on which civil life has hitherto been upheld in all the governments of the world the learned professors of the rights of man regard prescription not as a title to bar all claim set up against old possession  but they look on prescription as itself a bar against the possessor and proprietor they hold an immemorial possession to be no more than a long continued and therefore an aggravated injustice  such are their ideas such their religion and such their law but as to our country and our race as long as the well compacted structure of our church and state the sanctuary the holy of holies of that ancient law defended by reverence defended by power a fortress at once and a temple templum in modum arcis tacitus of the temple of jerusalem  shall stand inviolate on the brow of the british sion  as long as the british monarchy not more limited than fenced by the orders of the state shall like the proud keep of windsor rising in the majesty of proportion and girt with the double belt of it is kindred and coeval towers as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land  so long the mounds and dykes of the low fat bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of france as long as our sovereign lord the king and his faithful subjects the lords and commons of this realm  the triple cord which no man can break the solemn sworn constitutional frankpledge of this nation the firm guarantees of each others being and each others rights the joint and several securities each in it is place and order for every kind and every quality of property and of dignity  as long as these endure so long the duke of bedford is safe and we are all safe together  the high from the blights of envy and the spoliations of rapacity the low from the iron hand of oppression and the insolent spurn of contempt amen and so be it and so it will be dum domus aeneae capitoli immobile saxum accolet imperiumque pater romanus habebit    but if the rude inroad of gallick tumult with it is sophistical rights of man to falsify the account and it is sword as a makeweight to throw into the scale shall be introduced into our city by a misguided populace set on by proud great men themselves blinded and intoxicated by a frantic ambition we shall all of us perish and be overwhelmed in a common ruin if a great storm blow on our coast it will cast the whales on the strand as well as the periwinkles his grace will not survive the poor grantee he despises no not for a twelvemonth if the great look for safety in the services they render to this gallick cause it is to be foolish even above the weight of privilege allowed to wealth if his grace be one of these whom they endeavor to proselytize he ought to be aware of the character of the sect whose doctrines he is invited to embrace with them insurrection is the most sacred of revolutionary duties to the state ingratitude to benefactors is the first of revolutionary virtues ingratitude is indeed their four cardinal virtues compacted and amalgamated into one and he will find it in every thing that has happened since the commencement of the philosophic revolution to this hour if he pleads the merit of having performed the duty of insurrection against the order he lives in god forbid he ever should the merit of others will be to perform the duty of insurrection against him if he pleads again god forbid he should and i do not suspect he will his ingratitude to the crown for it is creation of his family others will plead their right and duty to pay him in kind they will laugh indeed they will laugh at his parchment and his wax his deeds will be drawn out with the rest of the lumber of his evidence room and burnt to the tune of ca ira in the courts of bedford then equality house  am i to blame if i attempt to pay his graces hostile reproaches to me with a friendly admonition to himself can i be blamed for pointing out to him in what manner he is like to be affected if the sect of the cannibal philosophers of france should proselytize any considerable part of this people and by their joint proselytizing arms should conquer that government to which his grace does not seem to me to give all the support his own security demands surely it is proper that he and that others like him should know the true genius of this sect what their opinions are what they have done and to whom and what if a prognostic is to be formed from the dispositions and actions of men it is certain they will do hereafter he ought to know that they have sworn assistance the only engagement they ever will keep to all in this country who bear a resemblance to themselves and who think as such that the whole duty of man consists in destruction they are a misallied and disparaged branch of the house of nimrod they are the duke of bedfords natural hunters and he is their natural game because he is not very profoundly reflecting he sleeps in profound security they on the contrary are always vigilant active enterprizing and though far removed from any knowledge which makes men estimable or useful in all the instruments and resources of evil their leaders are not meanly instructed or insufficiently furnished in the french revolution every thing is new and from want of preparation to meet so unlooked for an evil every thing is dangerous never before this time was a set of literary men converted into a gang of robbers and assassins never before did a den of bravoes and banditti assume the garb and tone of an academy of philosophers  let me tell his grace that an union of such characters monstrous as it seems is not made for producing despicable enemies but if they are formidable as foes as friends they are dreadful indeed the men of property in france confiding in a force which seemed to be irresistible because it had never been tried neglected to prepare for a conflict with their enemies at their own weapons they were found in such a situation as the mexicans were when they were attacked by the dogs the cavalry the iron and the gunpowder of an handful of bearded men whom they did not know to exist in nature this is a comparison that some i think have made and it is just in france they had their enemies within their houses they were even in the bosoms of many of them but they had not sagacity to discern their savage character they seemed tame and even caressing they had nothing but douce humanite in their mouth they could not bear the punishment of the mildest laws on the greatest criminals the slightest severity of justice made their flesh creep the very idea that war existed in the world disturbed their repose military glory was no more with them than a splendid infamy hardly would they hear of self defense which they reduced within such bounds as to leave it no defense at all all this while they meditated the confiscations and massacres we have seen had any one told these unfortunate noblemen and gentlemen how and by whom the grand fabric of the french monarchy under which they flourished would be subverted they would not have pitied him as a visionary but would have turned from him as what they call a mauvais plaisant yet we have seen what has happened the persons who have suffered from the cannibal philosophy of france are so like the duke of bedford that nothing but his graces probably not speaking quite so good french could enable us to find out any difference a great many of them had as pompous titles as he and were of full as illustrious a race some few of them had fortunes as ample several of them without meaning the least disparagement to the duke of bedford were as wise and as virtuous and as valiant and as well educated and as complete in all the lineaments of men of honor as he is and to all this they had added the powerful outguard of a military profession which in it is nature renders men somewhat more cautious than those who have nothing to attend to but the lazy enjoyment of undisturbed possessions but security was their ruin they are dashed to pieces in the storm and our shores are covered with the wrecks if they had been aware that such a thing might happen such a thing never could have happened  i assure his grace that if i state to him the designs of his enemies in a manner which may appear to him ludicrous and impossible i tell him nothing that has not exactly happened point by point but twentyfour mile from our own shore i assure him that the frenchified faction more encouraged than others are warned by what has happened in france look at him and his landed possessions as an object at once of curiosity and rapacity he is made for them in every part of their double character as robbers to them he is a noble booty as speculatists he is a glorious subject for their experimental philosophy he affords matter for an extensive analysis in all the branches of their science geometrical physical civil and political these philosophers are fanatics independent of any interest which if it operated alone would make them much more tractable they are carried with such an headlong rage toward every desperate trial that they would sacrifice the whole human race to the slightest of their experiments i am better able to enter into the character of this description of men than the noble duke can be i have lived long and variously in the world without any considerable pretensions to literature in myself i have aspired to the love of letters i have lived for a great many years in habitudes with those who professed them i can form a tolerable estimate of what is likely to happen from a character chiefly dependent for fame and fortune on knowledge and talent as well in it is morbid and perverted state as in that which is sound and natural naturally men so formed and finished are the first gifts of providence to the world but when they have once thrown off the fear of god which was in all ages too often the case and the fear of man which is now the case and when in that state they come to understand one another and to act in corpse a more dreadful calamity cannot arise out of hell to scourge mankind nothing can be conceived more hard than the heart of a thoroughbred metaphysician it comes nearer to the cold malignity of a wicked spirit than to the frailty and passion of a man it is like that of the principle of evil himself incorporeal pure unmixed dephlegmated defecated evil it is no easy operation to eradicate humanity from the human breast what shakespeare calls the compunctious visitings of nature will sometimes knock at their hearts and protest against their murderous speculations but they have a means of compounding with their nature their humanity is not dissolved they only give it a long prorogation they are ready to declare that they do not think two thousand years too long a period for the good that they pursue it is remarkable that they never see any way to their projected good but by the road of some evil their imagination is not fatigued with the contemplation of human suffering through the wild waste of centuries added to centuries of misery and desolation their humanity is at their horizon  and like the horizon it always flies before them the geometricians and the chemists bring the one from the dry bones of their diagrams and the other from the soot of their furnaces dispositions that make them worse than indifferent about those feelings and habitudes which are the supports of the moral world ambition is come upon them suddenly they are intoxicated with it and it has rendered them fearless of the danger which may from thence arise to others or to themselves these philosophers consider men in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump or in a recipient of mephitick gas whatever his grace may think of himself they look upon him and every thing that belongs to him with no more regard than they do upon the whiskers of that little longtailed animal that has been long the game of the grave demure insidious springnailed velvetpawed greeneyed philosophers whether going upon two legs or upon four  his graces landed possessions are irresistibly inviting to an agrarian experiment they are a downright insult upon the rights of man they are more extensive than the territory of many of the grecian republics and they are without comparison more fertile than most of them there are now republics in italy in germany and in swisserland which do not possess any thing like so fair and ample a domain there is scope for seven philosophers to proceed in their analytical experiments upon haringtons seven different forms of republics in the acres of this one duke hitherto they have been wholly unproductive to speculation fitted for nothing but to fatten bullocks and to produce grain for beer still more to stupify the dull english understanding abbe sieyes has whole nests of pigeonholes full of constitutions ready made ticketed sorted and numbered suited to every season and every fancy some with the top of the pattern at the bottom and some with the bottom at the top some plain some flowered some distinguished for their simplicity others for their complexity some of blood color some of boue de paris some with directories others without a direction some with councils of elders and councils of youngsters some without any council at all some where the electors choose the representatives others where the representatives choose the electors some in long coats and some in short cloaks some with pantaloons some without breeches some with five shilling qualifications some totally unqualified so that no constitutionfancier may go unsuited from his shop provided he loves a pattern of pillage oppression arbitrary imprisonment confiscation exile revolutionary judgment and legalised premeditated murder in any shapes into which they can be put what a pity it is that the progress of experimental philosophy should be checked by his graces monopoly such are their sentiments i assure him such is their language when they dare to speak and such are their proceedings when they have the means to act  their geographers and geometricians have been some time out of practice it is some time since they have divided their own country into squares that figure has lost the charms of it is novelty they want new lands for new trials it is not only the geometricians of the republic that find him a good subject the chemists have bespoke him after the geometricians have done with him as the first set have an eye on his graces lands the chemists are not less taken with his buildings they consider mortar as a very antirevolutionary invention in it is present state but properly employed an admirable material for overturning all establishments they have found that the gunpowder of ruins is far the fittest for making other ruins and so ad infinitum they have calculated what quantity of matter convertible into nitre is to be found in bedford house in woburn abbey and in what his grace and his trustees have still suffered to stand of that foolish royalist inigo jones in covent garden churches play houses coffeehouses all alike are destined to be mingled and equalized and blended into one common rubbish and well sifted and lixiviated to chrystalize into true democratick explosive insurrectionary nitre their academy del cimento per antiphrasin with morveau and hassenfrats at it is head have computed that the brave sansculottes may make war on all the aristocracy of europe for a twelvemonth out of the rubbish of the duke of bedfords buildings there is nothing on which the leaders of the republic one and indivisible value themselves more than on the chemical operations by which through science they convert the pride of aristocracy to an instrument of it is own destruction  on the operations by which they reduce the magnificent ancient country seats of the nobility decorated with the feudal titles of duke marquis or earl into magazines of what they call revolutionary gunpowder they tell us that hitherto things had not yet been properly and in a revolutionary manner explored  the strong chateaus those feudal fortresses that were ordered to be demolished attracted next the attention of your committee nature there had secretly regained her rights and had produced saltpeter for the purpose as it should seem of facilitating the execution of your decree by preparing the means of destruction from these ruins which still frown on the liberties of the republic we have extracted the means of producing good and those piles which have hitherto glutted the pride of despots and covered the plots of la vendee will soon furnish wherewithal to tame the traitors and to overwhelm the disaffected  the rebellious cities also have afforded a large quantity of saltpeter commune affranchie that is the noble city of lions reduced in many parts to an heap of ruins and toulon will pay a second tribute to our artillery report  st february        while the morveaux and priestleys are proceeding with these experiments upon the duke of bedfords houses the seieyes and the rest of the analytical legislators and constitutionvenders are quite as busy in their trade of decomposing organization in forming his graces vassals into primary assemblies national guards first second and third requisitioners committees of research conductors of the traveling guillotine judges of revolutionary tribunals legislative hangmen supervisors of

little matter from their experimental philosophy if he pleads his grants from the crown he is ruined at the outset if he pleads he has received them from the pillage of superstitious corporations this indeed will stagger them a little because they are enemies to all corporations and to all religion however they will soon recover themselves and will tell his grace or his learned council that all such property belongs to the nation and that it would be more wise for him if he wishes to live the natural term of a citizen that is according to condorcets calculation six months on an average not to pass for an usurper upon the national property this is what the sergeants at law of the rights of man will say to the puny apprentices of the common law of england  is the genius of philosophy not yet known you may as well think the garden of the tuilleries was well protected with the cords of ribbon insultingly stretched by the national assembly to keep the sovereign canaille from intruding on the retirement of the poor king of the french as that such flimsy cobwebs will stand between the savages of the revolution and their natural prey deep philosophers are no triflers brave sans culottes are no formalists they will no more regard a marquis of tavistock than an abbot of tavistock the lord of wooburn will not be more respectable in their eyes than the prior of wooburn they will make no difference between the superior of a covent garden of nuns and of a covent garden of another description they will not care a rush whether his coat is long or short whether the color be purple or blue and buff they will not trouble their heads with what part of his head his hair is cut from and they will look with equal respect on a tonsure and a crop their only question will be that of their legendre or some other of their legislative butchers how he cuts up how he tallows in the cawl or on the kidneys  is it not a singular phoenomenon that whilst the sans culotte carcass butchers and the philosophers of the shambles are pricking their dotted lines upon his hide and like the print of the poor ox that we see in the shop windows at charing cross alive as he is and thinking no harm in the world he is divided into rumps and sirloins and briskets and into all sorts of pieces for roasting boiling and stewing that all the while they are measuring him his grace is measuring me is invidiously comparing the bounty of the crown with the deserts of the defender of his order and in the same moment fawning on those who have the knife half out of the sheath  poor innocent  pleased to the last he crops the flowery food and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood no man lives too long who lives to do with spirit and suffer with resignation what providence pleases to command or inflict but indeed they are sharp incommodities which beset old age it was but the other day that on putting in order some things which had been brought here on my taking leave of london for ever i looked over a number of fine portraits most of them of persons now dead but whose society in my better days made this a proud and happy place amongst these was the picture of lord keppel it was painted by an artist worthy of the subject the excellent friend of that excellent man from their earliest youth and a common friend of us both with whom we lived for many years without a moment of coldness of peevishness of jealousy or of jar to the day of our final separation  i ever looked on lord keppel as one of the greatest and best men of his age and i loved and cultivated him accordingly he was much in my heart and i believe i was in his to the very last beat it was after his trial at portsmouth that he gave me this picture with what zeal and anxious affection i attended him through that his agony of glory what part my son in the early flush and enthusiasm of his virtue and the pious passion with which he attached himself to all my connections with what prodigality we both squandered ourselves in courting almost every sort of enmity for his sake i believe he felt just as i should have felt such friendship on such an occasion i partook indeed of this honor with several of the first and best and ablest in the kingdom but i was behind hand with none of them and i am sure that if to the eternal disgrace of this nation and to the total annihilation of every trace of honor and virtue in it things had taken a different turn from what they did i should have attended him to the quarter deck with no less good will and more pride though with far other feelings than i partook of the general flow of national joy that attended the justice that was done to his virtue  pardon my lord the feeble garrulity of age which loves to diffuse itself in discourse of the departed great at my years we live in retrospect alone and wholly unfitted for the society of vigorous life we enjoy the best balm to all wounds the consolation of friendship in those only whom we have lost for ever feeling the loss of lord keppel at all times at no time did i feel it so much as on the first day when i was attacked in the house of lords  had he lived that reverend form would have risen in its place and with a mild parental reprehension to his nephew the duke of bedford he would have told him that the favor of that gracious prince who had honored his virtues with the government of the navy of great britain and with a seat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom was not undeservedly shown to the friend of the best portion of his life and his faithful companion and counselor under his rudest trials he would have told him that to whomever else these reproaches might be becoming they were not decorous in his near kindred he would have told him that when men in that rank lose decorum they lose every thing  on that day i had a loss in lord keppel but the public loss of him in this aweful crisis  i speak from much knowledge of the person he never would have listened to any compromise with the rabble rout of this sans culotterie of france his goodness of heart his reason his taste his public duty his principles his prejudices would have repelled him for ever from all connection with that horrid medley of madness vice impiety and crime  lord keppel had two countries one of descent and one of birth their interests and their glory are the same and his mind was capacious of both his family was noble and it was dutch that is he was of the oldest and purest nobility that europe can boast among a people renowned above all others for love of their native land though it was never shown in insult to any human being lord keppel was something high it was a wild stock of pride on which the tenderest of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues he valued ancient nobility and he was not disinclined to augment it with new honors he valued the old nobility and the new not as an excuse for inglorious sloth but as an incitement to virtuous activity he considered it as a sort of cure for selfishness and a narrow mind conceiving that a man born in an elevated place in himself was nothing but every thing in what went before and what was to come after him without much speculation but by the sure instinct of ingenuous feelings and by the dictates of plain unsophisticated natural understanding he felt that no great commonwealth could by any possibility long subsist without a body of some kind or other of nobility decorated with honor and fortified by privilege this nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a nation which otherwise with mr pain would soon be taught that no one generation can bind another he felt that no political fabric could be well made without some such order of things as might through a series of time afford a rational hope of securing unity coherence consistency and stability to the state he felt that nothing else can protect it against the levity of courts and the greater levity of the multitude that to talk of hereditary monarchy without any thing else of hereditary reverence in the commonwealth was a lowminded absurdity fit only for those detestable fools aspiring to be knaves who began to forge in      the false money of the french constitution  that it is one fatal objection to all new fancied and new fabricated republics among a people who once possessing such an advantage have wickedly and insolently rejected it that the prejudice of an old nobility is a thing that cannot be made it may be improved it may be corrected it may be replenished men may be taken from it or aggregated to it but the thing itself is matter of inveterate opinion and therefore cannot be matter of mere positive institution he felt that this nobility in fact does not exist in wrong of other orders of the state but by them and for them  i knew the man i speak of and if we can divine the future out of what we collect from the past no person living would look with more scorn and horror on the impious parricide committed on all their ancestry and on the desperate attainder passed on all their posterity by the orleans and the rochefoucaults and the fayettes and the viscomtes de noailles and the false perigords and the long et caetera of the perfidious sans culottes of the court who like demoniacks possessed with a spirit of fallen pride and inverted ambition abdicated their dignities disowned their families betrayed the most sacred of all trusts and by breaking to pieces a great link of society and all the cramps and holdings of the state brought eternal confusion and desolation on their country for the fate of the miscreant parricides themselves he would have had no pity compassion for the myriads of men of whom the world was not worthy who by their means have perished in prisons or on scaffolds or are pining in beggary and exile would leave no room in his or in any wellformed mind for any such sensation we are not made at once to pity the oppressor and the oppressed  looking to his batavian descent how could he bear to behold his kindred the descendants of the brave nobility of holland whose blood prodigally poured out had more than all the canals meers and inundations of their country protected their independence to behold them bowed in the basest servitude to the basest and vilest of the human race in servitude to those who in no respect were superior in dignity or could aspire to a better place than that of hangmen to the tyrants to whose sceptered pride they had opposed an elevation of soul that surmounted and overpowered the loftiness of castile the haughtiness of austria and the overbearing arrogance of france  could he with patience bear that the children of that nobility who would have deluged their country and given it to the sea rather than submit to louis xiv who was then in his meridian glory when his arms were conducted by the turennes by the luxembourgs by the boufflers when his councils were directed by the colberts and the louvois when his tribunals were filled by the lamoignons and the daguessaus  that these should be given up to the cruel sport of the pichegrus the jourdans the santerres under the rollands and brissots and gorsas and robespierres the reubels the carnots and talliens and dantons and the whole tribe of regicides robbers and revolutionary judges that from the rotten carcass of their own murdered country have poured out innumerable swarms of the lowest and at once the most destructive of the classes of animated nature which like columns of locusts have laid waste the fairest part of the world  would keppel have borne to see the ruin of the virtuous patricians that happy union of the noble and the burgher who with signal prudence and integrity had long governed the cities of the confederate republic the cherishing fathers of their country who denying commerce to themselves made it flourish in a manner unexampled under their protection could keppel have borne that a vile faction should totally destroy this harmonious construction in favor of a robbing democracy founded on the spurious rights of man  he was no great clerk but he was perfectly well versed in the interests of europe and he could not have heard with patience that the country of grotius the cradle of the law of nations and one of the richest repositories of all law should be taught a new code by the ignorant flippancy of thomas pain the presumptuous foppery of la fayette with his stolen rights of man in his hand the wild profligate intrigue and turbulency of marat and the impious sophistry of condorcet in his insolent addresses to the batavian republic  could keppel who idolized the house of nassau who was himself given to england along with the blessings of the british and dutch revolutions with revolutions of stability with revolutions which consolidated and married the liberties and the interests of the two nations for ever could he see the fountain of british liberty itself in servitude to france could he see with patience a prince of orange expelled as a sort of diminutive despot with every kind of contumely from the country which that family of deliverers had so often rescued from slavery and obliged to live in exile in another country which owes it is liberty to his house  would keppel have heard with patience that the conduct to be held on such occasions was to become short by the knees to the faction of the homicides to entreat them quietly to retire or if the fortune of war should drive them from their first wicked and unprovoked invasion that no security should be taken no arrangement made no barrier formed no alliance entered into for the security of that which under a foreign name is the most precious part of england what would he have said if it was even proposed that the austrian netherlands which ought to be a barrier to holland and the tie of an alliance to protect her against any species of rule that might be erected or even be restored in france should be formed into a republic under her influence and dependent upon her power  but above all what would he have said if he had heard it made a matter of accusation against me by his nephew the duke of bedford that i was the author of the war had i a mind to keep that high distinction to myself as from pride i might but from justice i dare not he would have snatched his share of it from my hand and held it with the grasp of a dying convulsion to his end  it would be a most arrogant presumption in me to assume to myself the glory of what belongs to his majesty and to his ministers and to his parliament and to the far greater majority of his faithful people but had i stood alone to counsel and that all were determined to be guided by my advice and to follow it implicitly  then i should have been the sole author of a war but it should have been a war on my ideas and my principles however let hi grace think as he may of my demerits with regard to the war with regicide he will find my guilt confined to that alone he never shall with the smallest color of reason accuse me o being the author of a peace with regicide but that is high matter and ought not to be mixed with any thing of so little moment as what may belong to me or even to the duke of bedford  i have the honor to be etc edmund burke
