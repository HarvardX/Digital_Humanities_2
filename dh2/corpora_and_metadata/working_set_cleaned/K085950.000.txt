memoirs of the life and writings of mr gray  est adhuc hominibus et cura et officium sunt qui defunctorum quoque amicos agant plinii epist mr gray w mason and b wilson vivi memo delinea engraved by james basire  published according to act of parliament march         the poems of mr gray  to which are prefixed memoirs of his life and writings by w mason ma  york printed by a ward and sold by j dodsley pall mall london and j todd stonegate york mdcclxxv  memoirs of the life and writings of mr gray section the first the lives of men of letters seldom abound with incidents and perhaps no life ever afforded fewer than that which i have undertaken to write but i am far from mentioning this by way of previous apology as is the trite custom of biographers the respect which i owe to my deceased friend to the public and let me add to myself prompts me to wave so impertinent a ceremonial a reader of sense and taste never expects to find in the memoirs of a philosopher or poet the same species of entertainment or information which he would receive from those of a statesman or general he expects however to be either informed or entertained nor would he be disappointed did the writer take care to dwell principally on such topics as characterize the man and distinguish that peculiar part which he acted in the varied drama of society but this rule selfevidently right as it may seem is seldom observed it was said with almost as much truth as wit of one of these writers that when he composed the life of lord verulam he forgot that he was a philosopher and therefore it was to be feared should he finish that of the duke of marlborough he would forget that he was a general i shall avoid a like fault i will promise my reader that he shall in the following pages seldom behold mr gray in any other light than that of a scholar and a poet and though i am more solicitous to show that he was a virtuous a friendly and an amiable man than either yet this solicitude becomes unnecessary from the very papers which he has bequeathed me and which i here arrange for the purpose since in these the qualities of his head and heart so constantly appear together and the fertility of his fancy so intimately unites with the sympathetic tenderness of his soul that were it in my intention i should find it impossible to disjoin them  his parents were reputable citizens of london his grandfather a considerable merchant but his father mr philip gray though he also followed business was of an indolent and reserved temper and therefore rather diminished than increased his paternal fortune he had many children of whom thomas the subject of these memoirs was the fifth born all of them except him died in their infancy and i have been told that he narrowly escaped suffocation owing to too great a fullness of blood which destroyed the rest and would certainly have been cut off as early had not his mother with a courage remarkable for one of her sex and withal so very tender a parent ventured to open a vein with her own hand which instantly removed the paroxysm  he was born in cornhill december the   th      was educated at eton school under the care of mr antrobus his mothers brother who was at that time one of the assistant masters from thence he removed to st peters college cambridge where he was admitted a pensioner in the year      while at school he contracted a friendship with mr horace walpole and mr richard west the former of these appears at present with too much distinction in the literary as well as fashionable world to make it necessary i should enlarge upon his subject but as the latter died before he could exert his uncommon abilities it seems requisite to premise somewhat concerning him especially as almost every anecdote which i have to produce concerning the juvenile part of mr grays life is included in his correspondence with this gentleman a correspondence which continued with very little interruption for the space of about eight years from the time of their leaving school to the death of the accomplished youth in question  his father was lord chancellor of ireland his grandfather by the mother the famous bishop burnet he removed from eton to oxford about the same time that mr gray left that place for cambridge each of them carried with him the reputation of an excellent classic scholar though i have been told that at the time mr wests genius was reckoned the more brilliant of the two a judgment which i conceive was not well founded for though mr wests part of that correspondence which i shall speedily give the reader i am well aware that i am here going to do a thing which the cautious and courtly dr sprat were he now alive would highly censure he had it seems a large collection of his friend mr cowleys letters a way of writing in which he peculiarly excelled as in these he always expressed the native tenderness and innocent gaiety of his heart yet the doctor was of opinion that nothing of this nature should be published and that the letters that pass between particular friends if they are written as they ought to be can scarce ever be fit to see the light what not when they express the native tenderness and innocent gaiety of a heart like mr cowleys no by no means for in such letters the souls of men appear undrest and in that negligent habit they may be fit to be seen by one or two in a chamber but not to go abroad in the street see life of cowley page    hurds edition  such readers as believe it incumbent on every wellbred soul never to appear but in full dress will think that dr sprat has reason on his side but i suspect that the generality will notwithstanding wish he had been less scrupulously delicate and lament that the letters in question are not now extant of one thing i am fully confident that had this been the case the judicious dr hurd would have found his critical labor much lessened when in pure charity to this amiable writer he lately employed himself in separating  his pleasing moral from his pointed wit   will undoubtedly show that he possessed very extraordinary talents yet on mr grays side there seems superadded to these such a manly precision of taste and maturity of judgment as would induce one to believe mr walpoles phrase not very hyperbolical who has often asserted to me that gray never was a boy  in april      mr west left christ church for the inner temple and mr gray removed from peterhouse to town the latter end of that year intending also to apply himself to the study of the law in the same society for which purpose his father had already either hired or bought him a set of chambers but on an invitation which mr walpole gave him to be his companion in his travels this intention was laid aside for the present and never after put in execution  according to the plan which i have formed for arranging these papers a part of the letters which i have already mentioned will here find their proper place they will give a much clearer idea both of mr gray and his friend at this early period than any narrative of mine they will include also several specimens of their juvenile compositions and at the same time mark the progress they had made in literature they will ascertain not only the scope and turn of their genius but of their temper in a word mr gray will become his own biographer both in this and the rest of the sections into which i divide this work by which means and by the assistance of a few notes which i shall occasionally add it may be hoped that nothing will be omitted which may tend to give a regular and clear delineation of his life and character  but as this is the earliest part of their correspondence and includes only the time which passed between mr grays admission into the university and his going abroad it may be reasonably expected that the manner rather than the matter of these letters must constitute their principal merit they will therefore be chiefly acceptable to such ingenuous youths who being about the same age have a relish for the same studies and bosoms susceptible of the same warmth of friendship to these i address them in the pleasing hope that they may prompt them to emulate their elegant simplicity and of course to study with more care the classic models from which it was derived if they do this i shall not be much concerned if graver readers think them unimportant or even trifling  letter i mr west to mr gray you use me very cruelly you have sent me but one letter since i have been at oxford and that too agreeable not to make me sensible how great my loss is in not having more next to seeing you is the pleasure of seeing your handwriting next to hearing you is the pleasure of hearing from you really and sincerely i wonder at you that you thought it not worth while to answer my last letter i hope this will have better success in behalf of your quondam schoolfellow in behalf of one who has walked hand in hand with you like the two children in the wood through many a flowery path and shelly grot where learning lulled us in her private this expression prettily distinguishes their studies when out of the public school which would naturally at their age be vague and desultory maze the very thought you see tips my pen with poetry and brings eton to my view consider me very seriously here in a strange country inhabited by things that call themselves doctors and masters of arts a country flowing with syllogisms and ale where horace and virgil are equally unknown consider me i say in this melancholy light and then think if something be not due to  yours christ church nov         ps i desire you will send me soon and truly and positively alluding to his grandfathers history a history of your own time     letter ii mr gray to mr west permit me again to write to you though i have so long neglected my duty and forgive my brevity when i tell you it is occasioned wholly by the hurry i am in to get to a place where i expect to meet with no other pleasure than the sight of you for i am preparing for london in a few days at furthest i do not wonder in the least at your frequent blaming my indolence it ought rather to be called ingratitude and i am obliged to your goodness for softening so harsh an appellation when we meet it will however be my greatest of pleasures to know what you do what you read and how you spend your time etc etc and to tell you what i do not read and how i do not etc for almost all the employment of my hours may be best explained by negatives take my word and experience upon it doing nothing is a most amusing business and yet neither something nor nothing gives me any pleasure when you have seen one of my days you have seen a whole year of my life they go round and round like the blind horse in the mill only he has the satisfaction of fancying he makes a progress and gets some ground my eyes are open enough to see the same dull prospect and to know that having made fourandtwenty steps more i shall be just where i was i may better than most people say my life is but a span were i not afraid lest you should not believe that a person so shortlived could write even so long a letter as this in short i believe i must not send you the history of my own time till i can send you that also of the reformation carrying on the allusion to the other history written by mr wests grandfather however as the most undeserving people in the world must sure have the vanity to wish somebody had a regard for them so i need not wonder at my own in being pleased that you care about me you need not doubt therefore of having a first row in the front box of my little heart and i believe you are not in danger of being crowded there it is asking you to an old play indeed but you will be candid enough to excuse the whole piece for the sake of a few tolerable lines  for this little while past i have been playing with statius we yesterday had a game at quoits together you will easily forgive me for having broke his head as you have a little pique to him i send you my translation this consisted of about   0 lines which were sent separately and as i believe it was mr grays first attempt in english verse it is a curiosity not to be entirely withheld from the reader therefore although it is not my intention to fill these memoirs with much either of his or his correspondents productions in this way yet as a few lines will show how much mr gray had imbibed of drydens spirited manner at this early period i insert at the end of the letter a specimen of the whole  which i did not engage in because i liked that part of the poem nor do i now send it to you because i think it deserves it but merely to show you how i mispend my days  third in the labors of the disc came on with sturdy step and slow hippomedon artful and strong he poised the wellknown weight by phlegyas warned and fired by mnestheus fate that to avoid and this to emulate his vigorous arm he tried before he flung braced all his nerves and every sinew strung then with a tempests whirl and wary eye pursued his cast and hurled the orb on high the orb on high tenacious of its course true to the mighty arm that gave it force far overleaps all bound and joys to see its ancient lord secure of victory the theatres green height and woody wall tremble ere it precipitates its fall the ponderous mass sinks in the cleaving ground while vales and woods and echoing hills rebound as when from aetnas smoking summit broke the eyeless cyclops heaved the craggy rock where ocean frets beneath the dashing oar and parting surges round the vessel roar twas there he aimed the meditated harm and scarce ulysses escaped his giant arm a tygers pride the victor bore away with native spots and artful labor gay a shining border round the margin rolled and calmed the terrors of his claws in gold cambridge may         letter iii mr west to mr gray i agree with you that you have broke statiuss head but it is in like manner as apollo broke hyacinths you have foiled him infinitely at his own weapon i must insist on seeing the rest of your translation and then i will examine it entire and compare it with the latin and be very wise and severe and put on an inflexible face such as becomes the character of a true son of aristarchus of hypercritical memory in the mean while and calmed the terrors of his claws in gold is exactly statius  summos auro mansueverat ungues i never knew before that the golden fangs on hammercloths were so old a fashion your hymeneal published in the cambridge collection of verses on the prince of waless marriage i have not thought it necessary to insert these hexameters as adulatory verses of this kind however well written deserve not to be transmitted to posterity and indeed are usually buried as they ought to be in the trash with which they are surrounded every person who feels himself a poet ought to be above prostituting his powers on such occasions and extreme youth as was the case with mr gray is the only thing that can apologize for having done it i was told was the best in the cambridge collection before i saw it and indeed it is no great compliment to tell you i thought it so when i had seen it but sincerely it pleased me best methinks the college bards have run into a strange taste on this occasion such soft unmeaning stuff about venus and cupid and peleus and thetis and zephyrs and dryads was never read as for my poor little eclogue it has been condemned and beheaded by our westminster judges an exordium of about sixteen lines absolutely cut off and its other limbs quartered in a most barbarous manner i will send it you in my next as my true and lawful heir in exclusion of the pretender who has the impudence to appear under my name  as yet i have not looked into sir isaac public disputations i hate mathematics i reverence history morality and natural philosophy have the greatest charms in my eye but who can forget poetry they call it idleness but it is surely the most enchanting thing in the world ac dulce otium and poene omni negotio pulchrius  i am dear sir yours while i am r w christ church may          the following letter seems to require some little preface not so much because it expresses mr grays juvenile sentiments concerning the mode of our academical education as that these sentiments prevailed with him through life and that he often declared them with so little reserve as to create him many enemies it is certain that at the time when he was admitted and for some years after jacobitism and its concomitant hard drinking prevailed still at cambridge much to the prejudice not only of good manners but of good letters for if this spirit was then on the decline it was not extinguished till after the year      but we see as was natural enough in a young man he laid the blame rather on the mode of education than the mode of the times and to this error the uncommon proficiency he had made at eton in classical learning might contribute as he found himself in a situation where that species of merit held not the first rank however this be it was necessary not to omit this feature of his mind when employed in drawing a general likeness of it and what colors could be found so forcible as his own to express its true light and shadow i would further observe that whatever truth there might be in his satire at the time it was written it can by no means affect the present state of the university there is usually a much greater fluctuation of taste and manners in an academical than a national body occasioned to use a scholastic metaphor by that very quick succession of its component parts which often goes near to destroy its personal identity whatever therefore may be true of such a society at one time may be and generally is ten years after absolutely false  letter iv mr gray to mr west you must know that i do not take degrees and after this term shall have nothing more of college impertinencies to undergo which i trust will be some pleasure to you as it is a great one to me i have endured lectures daily and hourly since i came last supported by the hopes of being shortly at full liberty to give myself up to my friends and classical companions who poor souls though i see them fallen into great contempt with most people here yet i cannot help sticking to them and out of a spirit of obstinacy i think love them the better for it and indeed what can i do else must i plunge into metaphysics alas i cannot see in the dark nature has not furnished me with the optics of a cat must i pore upon mathematics alas i cannot see in too much light i am no eagle it is very possible that two and two make four but i would not give four farthings to demonstrate this ever so clearly and if these be the profits of life give me the amusements of it the people i behold all around me it seems know all this and more and yet i do not know one of them who inspires me with any ambition of being like him surely it was of this place now cambridge but formerly known by the name of babylon that the prophet spoke when he said the wild beasts of the desert shall dwell there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall build there and satyrs shall dance there their forts and towers shall be a den for ever a joy of wild asses there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow it shall be a court of dragons the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of rest you see here is a pretty collection of desolate animals which is verified in this town to a tittle and perhaps it may also allude to your habitation for you know all types may be taken by abundance of handles however i defy your owls to match mine  if the default of your spirits and nerves be nothing but the effect of the hyp i have no more to say we all must submit to that wayward queen i too in no small degree own her sway i feel her influence while i speak her power but if it be a real distemper pray take more care of your health if not for your own at least for our sakes and do not be so soon weary of this little world i do not know what this thought is very juvenile but perhaps he meant to ridicule the affected manner of mrs rowes letters of the dead to the living a book which was i believe published about this time refined friendships you may have contracted in the other but pray do not be in a hurry to see your acquaintance above among your terrestrial familiars however though i say it that should not say it there positively is not one that has a greater esteem for you than  yours most sincerely etc peterhouse dec       letter v mr west to mr gray i congratulate you on your being about to leave college i suspect that mr west mistook his correspondent who in saying he did not take degrees meant only to let his friend know that he should soon be released from lectures and disputations it is certain that mr gray continued at college near two years after the time he wrote the preceding letter and rejoice much you carry no degrees with you for i would not have had you dignified and i not for the world you would have insulted me so my eyes such as they are like yours are neither metaphysical nor mathematical i have nevertheless a great respect for your connoisseurs that way but am always contented to be their humble admirer your collection of desolate animals pleased me much but oxford i can assure you has her owls that match yours and the prophecy has certainly a squint that way well you are leaving this dismal land of bondage and which way are you turning your face your friends indeed may be happy in you but what will you do with your classic companions an inn of court is as horrid a place as a college and a moot case is as dear to gentle dullness as a syllogism but wherever you go let me beg you not to throw poetry like a nauseous weed away cherish its sweets in your bosom they will serve you now and then to correct the disgusting sober follies of the common law misce stultitiam consiliis brevem dulce est desipere in loco so said horace to virgil those two sons of anac in poetry and so say i to you in this degenerate land of pigmies mix with your grave designs a little pleasure each day of business has its hour of leisure in one of these hours i hope dear sir you will sometimes think of me write to me and know me yours  that is write freely to me and openly as i do to you and to give you a proof of it i have sent you an elegy this i omit for the reason given in a preceding note and for another also because it is not written in alternate but heroic rhyme which i think is not the species of english measure adapted to elegiac poetry of tibullus translated tibullus you must know is my favorite elegiac poet for his language is more elegant and his thoughts more natural than ovids ovid excells him only in wit of which no poet had more in my opinion the reason i choose so melancholy a kind of poesy is because my low spirits and constant ill health things in me not imaginary as you surmise but too real alas and i fear constitutional have tuned my heart to elegies of woe and this likewise is the reason why i am the most irregular thing alive at college for you may depend upon it i value my health above what they call discipline as for this poor unlicked thing of an elegy pray criticize it unmercifully for i send it with that intent indeed your late translation of statius might have deterred me but i know you are not more able to excel others than you are apt to forgive the want of excellence especially when it is found in the productions of  your most sincere friend christ church dec          letter vi mr walpole on my informing him that it was my intention to publish the principal part of mr grays correspondence with mr west very obligingly communicated to me the letters which he had also received from mr gray at the same period from this collection i have selected such as i thought would be most likely to please the generality of readers omitting though with regret many of the more sprightly and humourous sort because either from their personality or some other local circumstance they did not seem so well adapted to hit the public taste i shall say more upon this subject in a subsequent section when i give my idea of mr grays peculiar vein of humor  mr gray to mr walpole you can never weary me with the repetition of any thing that makes me sensible of your kindness since that has been the only idea of any social happiness that i have almost ever received and which begging your pardon for thinking so differently from you in such cases i would by no means have parted with for an exemption from all the uneasinesses mixed with it but it would be unjust to imagine my taste was any rule for yours for which reason my letters are shorter and less frequent than they would be had i any materials but myself to entertain you with love and brown sugar must be a poor regale for one of your gout and alas you know i am by trade a grocer i e a man who deals only in coarse and ordinary wares to these he compares the plain sincerity of his own friendship undisguised by flattery which had he chosen to carry on the allusion he might have termed the trade of a confectioner scandal if i had any is a merchandise you do not profess dealing in now and then indeed and to oblige a friend you may perhaps slip a little out of your pocket as a decayed gentlewoman would a piece of right mecklin or a little quantity of run tea but this only now and then not to make a practice of it monsters appertaining to this climate you have seen already both wet and dry so you perceive within how narrow bounds my pen is circumscribed and the whole contents of my share in our correspondence may be reduced under the two heads of  st you  dly i the first is indeed a subject to expatiate upon but you might laugh at me for talking about what i do not understand the second is so tiny so tiresome that you shall hear no more of it than that it is ever  yours peterhouse dec          letter vii mr west to mr gray i have been very ill and am still hardly recovered do you remember elegy  th book the  d of tibullus vos tenet etc and do you remember a letter of mr popes in sickness to mr steel this melancholy elegy and this melancholy letter i turned into a more melancholy epistle of my own during my sickness in the way of imitation and this i send to you and my friends at cambridge not to divert them for it cannot but merely to show them how sincere i was when sick i hope my sending it to them now may convince them i am no less sincere though perhaps more simple when well  ad amicos almost all tibulluss elegy is imitated in this little piece from whence his transition to mr popes letter is very artfully contrived and bespeaks a degree of judgment much beyond mr wests years  yes happy youths on camus sedgy side you feel each joy that friendship can divide each realm of science and of art explore and with the ancient blend the modern lore studious alone to learn whatever may tend to raise the genius or the heart to mend now pleased along the cloistered walk you rove and trace the verdant mazes of the grove where social often and often alone ye choose to catch the zephyr and to court the muse mean time at me while all devoid of art these lines give back the image of my heart at me the power that comes or soon or late or aims or seems to aim the dart of fate from you remote methinks alone i stand like some sad exile in a desert land around no friends their lenient care to join in mutual warmth and mix their heart with mine or real pains or those which fancy raise for ever blot the sunshine of my days to sickness still and still to grief a prey health turns from me her rosy face away just heaven what sin ere life begins to bloom devotes my head untimely to the tomb did ever this hand against a brothers life drug the dire bowl or point the murderous knife did ever this tongue the slanderers tale proclaim or madly violate my makers name did ever this heart betray a friend or foe or know a thought but all the world might know as yet just started from the lists of time my growing years have scarcely told their prime useless as yet through life i have idly run no pleasures tasted and few duties done quid fraudare juvat vitem crescentibus uvis et modo nata mala vellere poma manu so the original the paraphrase seems to me infinitely more beautiful there is a peculiar blemish in the second line arising from the synonimes mala and poma ah who ever autumns mellowing suns appear would pluck the promise of the vernal year or ere the grapes their purple hue betray tear the crude cluster from the mourning spray stern power of fate whose ebon scepter rules the stygian deserts and cimmerian pools forbear nor rashly smite my youthful heart a victim yet unworthy of thy dart ah stay till age shall blast my withering face shake in my head and falter in my pace then aim the shaft then meditate the blow here he quits tibullus the ten following verses have but a remote reference to mr popes letter and to the dead my willing shade shall go how weak is man to reasons judging eye born in this moment in the next we die part mortal clay and part ethereal fire too proud to creep too humble to aspire in vain our plans of happiness we raise pain is our lot and patience is our praise wealth lineage honors conquest or a throne are what the wise would fear to call their own health is at best a vain precarious thing and fairfacd youth is ever on the wing youth at the very best is but the betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age it is like the stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight but at the same time is undermining it at the root insecret popes works vol   page       st edit warburton  mr west by prolonging his paraphrase of this simile gives it additional beauty from that very circumstance but he ought to have introduced it by mr popes own thought youth is a betrayer his couplet preceding the simile conveys too general a reflection it is like the stream aside whose watery bed some blooming plant exalts his flowery head nursed by the wave the spreading branches rise shade all the ground and flourish to the skies the waves the while beneath in secret flow and undermine the hollow bank below wide and more wide the waters urge their way bare all the roots and on their fibers prey too late the plant bewails his foolish pride and sinks untimely in the whelming tide but why repine does life deserve my sigh few will lament my loss whenever i die i am not at all uneasy at the thought that many men whom i never had any esteem for are likely to enjoy this world after me vide ibid for those the wretches i despise or hate i neither envy nor regard their fate for me whenever allconquering death shall spread his wings around my unrepining head the morning after my exit the sun will rise as bright as ever the flowers smell as sweet the plants spring as green so far mr west copies his original but instead of the following part of the sentence people will laugh as heartily and marry as fast as they used to do he inserts a more solemn idea nor storms nor comets etc justly perceiving that the elegiac turn of his epistle would not admit so ludicrous a thought as was in its place in mr popes familiar letter so that we see young as he was he had obtained the art of judiciously selecting one of the first provinces of good taste i care not though this face be seen no more the world will pass as cheerful as before bright as before the day star will appear the fields as verdant and the skies as clear nor storms nor comets will my doom declare nor signs on earth nor portents in the air unknown and silent will depart my breath nor nature ever take notice of my death yet some there are ere spent my vital days within whose breasts my tomb i wish to raise loved in my life lamented in my end their praise would crown me as their precepts mend to them may these fond lines my name endear not from the poet but the friend sincere christ church july         letter viii mr gray to mr west after a months expectation of you and a fortnights despair at cambridge i am come to town and to better hopes of seeing you if what you sent me last be the product of your melancholy what may i not expect from your more cheerful hours for by this time the ill health that you complain of is i hope quite departed though if i were selfinterested i ought to wish for the continuance of any thing that could be the occasion of so much pleasure to me low spirits are my true and faithful companions they get up with me go to bed with me make journeys and returns as i do nay and pay visits and will even affect to be jocose and force a feeble laugh with me but most commonly we sit alone together and are the prettiest insipid company in the world however when you come i believe they must undergo the fate of all humble companions and be discarded would i could turn them to the same use that you have done and make an apollo of them if they could write such verses with me not hartshorn nor spirit of amber nor all that furnishes the closet of an apothecarys widow should persuade me to part with them but while i write to you i hear the bad news of lady walpoles death on saturday night last forgive me if the thought of what my poor horace must feel on that account obliges me to have done in reminding you that i am  yours etc london aug          letter ix mr gray to mr walpole i was hindered in my last and so could not give you all the trouble i would have done the description of a road which your coach wheels have so often honored it would be needless to give you suffice it that i arrived safe at burnham in buckinghamshire at my uncles who is a great hunter in imagination his dogs take up every chair in the house so i am forced to stand at this present writing and though the gout forbids him galloping after them in the field yet he continues still to regale his ears and nose with their comfortable noise and stink he holds me mighty cheap i perceive for walking when i should ride and reading when i should hunt my comfort amidst all this is that i have at the distance of half a mile through a green lane a forest the vulgar call it a common all my own at least as good as so for i spy no human thing in it but myself it is a little chaos of mountains and precipices mountains it is true that do not ascend much above the clouds nor are the declivities quite so amazing as dover cliff but just such hills as people who love their necks as well as i do may venture to climb and craggs that give the eye as much pleasure as if they were more dangerous both vale and hill are covered with most venerable beeches and other very reverend vegetables that like most other ancient people are always dreaming out their old stories to the winds and as they bow their hoary tops relate in murmuring sounds the dark decrees of fate while visions as poetic eyes avow cling to each leaf and swarm on every bough at the foot of one of these squats me i il penseroso and there grow to the trunk for a whole morning the timorous hare and sportive squirrel gambol around me like adam in paradise before he had an eve but i think he did not use to read virgil as i commonly do there in this situation i often converse with my horace aloud too that is talk to you but i do not remember that i ever heard you answer me i beg pardon for taking all the conversation to myself but it is entirely your own fault we have old mr southern at a gentlemans house a little way off who often comes to see us he is now seventyseven years old he lived nine years longer and died at the great age of eightysix mr gray always thought highly of his pathetic powers at the same time that he blamed his ill taste for mixing them so injudiciously with farce in order to produce that monstrous species of composition called tragicomedy and has almost wholly lost his memory but is as agreeable as an old man can be at least i persuade myself so when i look at him and think of isabella and oroonoko i shall be in town in about three weeks adieu  september       letter x mr gray to mr walpole at this time with his father at houghton mr gray writes from the same place he did before from his uncles house in buckinghamshire  i sympathize with you in the sufferings which you foresee are coming upon you we are both at present i imagine in no very agreeable situation for my part i am under the misfortune of having nothing to do but it is a misfortune which thank my stars i can pretty well bear you are in a confusion of wine and roaring and hunting and tobacco and heaven be praised you too can pretty well bear it while our evils are no more i believe we shall not much repine i imagine however you will rather choose to converse with the living dead that adorn the walls of your apartments than with the dead living that deck the middles of them and prefer a picture of still life to the realities of a noisy one and as i guess will imitate what you prefer and for an hour or two at noon will stick yourself up as formal as if you had been fixed in your frame for these hundred years with a pink or rose in one hand and a great seal ring on the other your name i assure you has been propagated in these countries by a convert of yours one  he has brought over his whole family to you they were before pretty good whigs but now they are absolute walpolians we have hardly any body in the parish but knows exactly the dimensions of the hall and saloon at houghton and begin to believe that the a favorite object of tory satire at the time lanthorn is not so great a consumer of the fat of the land as disaffected persons have said

after at cambridge  i am etc burnham sept       letter xi mr west to mr gray receiving no answer to my last letter which i writ above a month ago i must own i am a little uneasy the slight shadow of you which i had in town has only served to endear you to me the more the moments i past with you made a strong impression upon me i singled you out for a friend and i would have you know me to be yours if you deem me worthy  alas gray you cannot imagine how miserably my time passes away my health and nerves and spirits are thank my stars the very worst i think in oxford fourandtwenty hours of pure unalloyd health together are as unknown to me as the  00000 characters in the chinese vocabulary one of my complaints has of late been so overcivil as to visit me regularly once a month  jam

in latin but i feel i dare not enter the lists with you  cupidum pater optime vires deficiunt seriously you write in that language with a grace and an augustan urbanity that amazes me your greek too

but take my word for it you will never spend so agreeable a day here as you describe alas the sun with us only rises to show us the way to westminster hall nor must i forget thanking you for your little alcaic fragment the optic naiads are infinitely obliged to you  i was last week at richmond lodge with mr walpole for two days and dined with sir robert walpole cardinal fleury as far as my short sight can go the character of his great art and penetration is very just he is indeed nulli penetrabilis astro i go tomorrow to epsom where i shall be for about a month excuse me i am in haste mr west seems to have been indeed in haste when he writ this letter else surely his fine taste would have led him to have been more profuse in his praise of the alcaic fragment he might i think have said without paying too extravagant a compliment to mr grays genius that no poet of the augustan age ever produced four more perfect lines or what would sooner impose upon the best critic as being a genuine ancient composition  but believe me always etc  august          letter xvi mr gray to mr walpole my dear sir i should say mr walpole was just named to that post which he exchanged soon after for that of usher of the exchequer mr inspector general of the exports and imports but that appellation would make but an odd figure in conjunction with the three familiar monosyllables above written for non been convenient nec in una sede morantur majestas and amor which is being interpreted love does not live at the customhouse however by what style title or denomination soever you choose to be dignified or distinguished hereafter these three words will stick by you like a burr and you can no more get quit of these and your christian name than st anthony could of his pig my motions at present which you are pleased to ask after are much like those of a pendulum or dr long the master of pembroke hall at this time read lectures in experimental philosophy dr longically speaking

that it now rains exceedingly this has refreshed the all that follows is a humorously hyperbolic description of the quadrangle of peterhouse prospect as the way for the most part lies between green fields on either hand terminated with buildings at some distance castles i presume and of great antiquity the roads are very good being as i suspect the works of julius caesars army for they still preserve in many places the appearance of a pavement in pretty good repair and if they were not so near home might perhaps be as much admired as the via appia there are at present several rivulets to be crossed and which serve to enliven the view all around the country is exceeding fruitful in ravens and such black cattle but not to tire you with my travels i abruptly conclude  yours etc august       letter xvii mr gray to mr west i am coming away all so fast and leaving behind me without the least remorse all the beauties of sturbridge fair its white bears may roar its apes may wring their hands and crocodiles cry their eyes out all is one for that i shall not once visit them nor so much as take my leave the university has published a severe edict against schismatical congregations and created half a dozen new little procterlings to see its orders executed being under mighty apprehensions lest orator henley henley and his gilt tub should come to the fair and seduce their young ones but their pains are to small purpose for lo after all he is not coming  i am at this instant in the very agonies of leaving college and would not wish the worst of my enemies a worse situation if you knew the dust the old boxes the bedsteads and tutors that are about my ears you would look upon this letter as a great effort of my resolution and unconcernedness in the midst of evils i fill up my paper with a loose sort of version of that scene in pastor fido that begins care selve beati this latin version is extremely elegiac but as it is only a version i do not insert it mr gray did not begin to learn italian till about a year and a half before he translated this scene and i find amongst his papers an english translation of part of the  th canto of tassos gerusalemma liberata done previously to this which has great merit in a letter to mr west dated march      he says i learn italian like any dragon and in two months am got through the   th book of tasso whom i hold in great admiration i want you to learn too that i may know your opinion of him nothing can be easier than that language to any one who knows latin and french already and there are few so copious and expressive in the same letter he tells him that his college has set him a versifying on a public occasion viz those verses which are called tripos on the theme of luna est habitabilis the poem i believe is to be found in the musae etonenses i would further observe on this occasion that though mr gray had lately read and translated statius yet when he attempted composition his judgment immediately directed him to the best model of versification accordingly his hexameters are as far as modern ones can be after the manner of virgil they move in the succession of his pauses and close with his elisions   sept       letter xviii mr west to mr gray i thank you again and again for your two last most agreeable letters they could not have come more apropos i was without any books to divert me and they supplied the want of every thing i made them my classics in the country they were my horace and tibullus  non ita loquor assentandi causa ut probe nosti si me noris verum quia sic mea est sententia i am but just come to town and to show you my esteem of your favors i venture to send you by the penny post to your fathers what you will find on the next page i hope it will reach you soon after your arrival your boxes out of the wagon yourself out of the coach and tutors out of your memory  adieu we shall see one another i hope tomorrow  elegia quod mihi tam gratae misisti

town continued at his fathers house in cornhill till the march following in which interval mr walpole being disinclined to enter so early into the business of parliament prevailed on sir robert walpole to permit him to go abroad and on mr gray as was said before to be the companion of his travels mr west spent the greatest part of the winter with his mother and sister at epsom during which time a letter or two more passed between the two friends but these i think it unnecessary to insert as i have already given sufficient specimens of the blossoms of their genius the reader of taste and candor will i trust consider them only as such yet will be led to think that as the one produced afterward fruits worthy of paradise the other had he lived longer would also have produced them  end of the first section section the second as i allot this section entirely to that part of mr grays life which he spent in traveling through france and italy my province will be chiefly that of an editor and my only care to select from a large collection of letters written to his parents and to his friend mr west those parts which i imagine will be most likely either to inform or amuse the reader the multiplicity of accounts published both before and after the time when these letters were written of those very places which mr gray describes will necessarily take from them much of their novelty yet the elegant ease of his epistolary style has a charm in it for all readers of true taste that will make every apology of this sort needless they will perceive that as these letters were written without even the most distant view of publication they are essentially different in their manner of description from any other that have either preceded or followed them add to this that they are interspersed occasionally with some exquisitely finished pieces of latin poetry which he composed on the spot for the entertainment of his friend but not to anticipate any part of the readers pleasure i shall only further say to forewarn him of a disappointment that this correspondence is defective toward the end and includes no description either of venice or its territory the last places which mr gray visited this defect was occasioned by an unfortunate disagreement between him and mr walpole arising from the difference of their tempers the former being from his earliest years curious pensive and philosophical the latter gay lively and consequently inconsiderate in justice to the memory of so respectable a friend mr walpole enjoins me to charge him with the chief blame in their quarrel confessing that more attention complaisance and deference to a warm friendship and superior judgment and prudence might have prevented a rupture that gave much uneasiness to them both and a lasting concern to the survivor though in the year      a reconciliation was effected between them by a lady who wished well to both parties this therefore occasioned their separation at reggio mr gray went before him to venice and staying there only till he could find means of returning to england he made the best of his way home repassing the alps and following almost the same route through france by which he had before gone to italy  letter i mr gray to his mother amiens april   ns      as we made but a very short journey today and came to our inn early i sit down to give you some account of our expedition on the   th according to the style here we left dover at twelve at noon and with a pretty brisk gale which pleased every body mighty well except myself who was extremely sick the whole time we reached calais by five the weather changed and it began to snow hard the minute we came into the harbor where we took the boat and soon landed calais is an exceeding old but very pretty town and we hardly saw any thing there that was not so new and so different from england that it surprised us agreeably we went the next morning to the great church and were at high mass it being easter monday we saw also the convent of the capuchins and the nuns of st dominic with these last we held much conversation especially with an english nun a mrs davis of whose work i sent you by the return of the packet a lettercase to remember her by in the afternoon we took a postchaise it still snowing very hard for boulogne which was only eighteen miles further this chaise is a strange sort of conveyance of much greater use than beauty resembling an illshaped chariot only with the door opening before instead of the side three horses draw it one between the shafts and the other two on each side on one of which the postillion rides and drives too this was before the introduction of postchaises here else it would not have appeared a circumstance worthy notice this vehicle will upon occasion go fourscore miles a day but mr walpole being in no hurry chooses to make easy journeys of it and they are easy ones indeed for the motion is much like that of a sedan we go about six miles an hour and commonly change horses at the end of it it is true they are no very graceful steeds but they go well and through roads which they say are bad for france but to me they seem gravel walks and bowlinggreens in short it would be the finest traveling in the world were it not for the inns which are mostly terrible places indeed but to describe our progress somewhat more regularly we came into boulogne when it was almost dark and went out pretty early on tuesday morning so that all i can say about it is that it is a large old fortified town with more english in it than french on tuesday we were to go to abbeville seventeen leagues or fiftyone short english miles but by the way we dined at montreuil much to our hearts content on stinking mutton cutlets addle eggs and ditch water madame the hostess made her appearance in long lappets of bone lace and a sack of linseywoolsey we supped and lodged pretty well at abbeville and had time to see a little of it before we came out this morning there are seventeen convents in it out of which we saw the chapels of the minims and the carmelite nuns we are now come further thirty miles to amiens the chief city of the province of picardy we have seen the cathedral which is just what that of canterbury must have been before the reformation it is about the same size a huge gothic building beset on the outside with thousands of small statues and within adorned with beautiful painted windows and a vast number of chapels dressed out in all their finery of altarpieces embroidery gilding and marble over the high altar is preserved in a very large wrought shrine of massy gold the relics of st firmin their patron saint we went also to the chapels of the jesuits and ursuline nuns the latter of which is very richly adorned tomorrow we shall lie at clermont and next day reach paris the country we have passed through hitherto has been flat open but agreeably diversified with villages fields wellcultivated and little rivers on every hillock is a windmill a crucifix or a virgin mary dressed in flowers and a sarcenet robe one sees many people or carriages on the road now and then indeed you meet a strolling friar a countryman with his great muff or a woman riding astride on a little ass with short petticoats and a great headdress of blue wool    letter ii mr gray to mr west paris april         enfin donc me voici a paris mr walpole is gone out to supper at lord conways and here i remain alone though invited too do not think i make a merit of writing to you preferably to a good supper for these three days we have been here have actually given me an aversion to eating in general if hunger be the best sauce to meat the french are certainly the worst cooks in the world for what tables we have seen have been so delicately served and so profusely that after rising from one of them one imagines it impossible ever to eat again and now if i tell you all i have in my head you will believe me mad mais nimporte courage allons for if i wait till my head grow clear and settle a little you may stay long enough for a letter six days have we been coming hither which other people do in two they have not been disagreeable ones through a fine open country admirable roads and in an easy conveyance the inns not absolutely intolerable and images quite unusual presenting themselves on all hands at amiens we saw the fine cathedral and eat pate des perdrix passed through the park of chantilly by the duke of bourbons palace which we only beheld as we passed broke down at lusarch stopped at st denis saw all the beautiful monuments of the kings of france and the vast treasures of the abbey rubies and emeralds as big as small eggs crucifixes and vows crowns and reliquaries of inestimable value but of all their curiosities the thing the most to our tastes and which they indeed do the justice to esteem the glory of their collection was a vase of an entire onyx measuring at least five inches over three deep and of great thickness it is at least two thousand years old the beauty of the stone and sculpture upon it representing the mysteries of bacchus beyond expression admirable we have dreamed of it ever since the jolly old benedictine that showed us the treasures had in his youth been ten years a soldier he laughed at all the relics was very full of stories and mighty obliging on saturday evening we got to paris and were driving through the streets a long while before we knew where we were the minute we came voila milors holdernesse conway and his brother all stayed supper and till two oclock in the morning for here nobody ever sleeps it is not the way next day go to dine at my lord holdernesses there was the abbe prevot author of the cleveland and several other pieces much esteemed the rest were english at night we went to the pandore a spectacle literally for it is nothing but a beautiful piece of machinery of three scenes the first represents the chaos and by degrees the separation of the elements the second the temple of jupiter and the giving of the box to pandora the third the opening of the box and all the mischiefs that ensued an absurd design but executed in the highest perfection and that in one of the finest theaters in the world it is the grande sale des machines in the palais des tuileries next day dined at lord waldegraves then to the opera imagine to yourself for the drama four acts entirely unconnected with each other each founded on some little history skilfully taken out of an ancient author e g ovids metamorphoses etc and with great address converted into a french piece of gallantry for instance that which i saw called the ballet de la paix had its first act built upon the story of nereus homer having said he was the handsomest man of his time the poet imagining such a one could not want a mistress has given him one these two come in and sing sentiment in lamentable strains neither air nor recitative only to ones great joy they are every now and then interrupted by a dance or to ones great sorrow by a chorus that borders the stage from one end to the other and screams past all power of simile to represent the second act was baucis and philemon baucis is a beautiful young shepherdess and philemon her swain jupiter falls in love with her but nothing will prevail upon her so it is all mighty well and the chorus sing and dance the praises of constancy the two other acts were about iphis and ianthe and the judgment of paris imagine i say all this transacted by cracked voices trilling divisions upon two notes and a half accompanied by an orchestra of humstrums and a whole house more attentive than if farinelli sung and you will almost have formed a just notion of the thing our authors sentiments here seem to correspond entirely with those which j j rousseau afterward published in his famous lettre sur la music francoise in a french letter also which mr gray writ to his friend soon after this he calls their music des miaulemens and des heurlemens effroyables meles avec un tintamarre du diable voila la music francoise en abrege our astonishment at their absurdity you can never conceive we had enough to do to express it by screaming an hour louder than the whole dramatis personae we have also seen twice the comedy francoise first the mahomet second a tragedy that has had a great run of late and the thing itself does not want its beauties but the actors are beyond measure delightful mademoiselle goussin mr voltaires zara has with a charming though little person the most pathetic tone of voice the finest expression in her face and most proper action imaginable there is also a dufrene who did the chief character a handsome man and a prodigious fine actor the second we saw was the philosophe marie and here they performed as well in comedy there is a mademoiselle quinault somewhat in mrs clives way and a monsieur grandval in the nature of wilks who is the genteelest thing in the world there are several more would be much admired in england and many whom we have not seen much celebrated here great part of our time is spent in seeing churches and palaces full of fine pictures etc the quarter of which is not yet exhausted for my part i could entertain myself this month merely with the common streets and the people in them    letter iii mr gray to mr west paris may         after the little particulars aforesaid i should have proceeded to a journal of our transactions for this week past should have carried you post from hence to versailles hurried you through the gardens to trianon back again to paris so away to chantilly but the fatigue is perhaps more than you can bear and moreover i think i have reason to stomach your last piece of gravity supposing you were in your soberest mood i am sorry you should think me capable of ever being so dissipe so evapore as not to be in a condition of relishing any thing you could say to me and now if you have a mind to make your peace with me arouse ye from your megrims and your melancholies and for exercise is good for you throw away your nightcap call for your jackboots and set out with me last saturday evening for versailles  and so at eight oclock passing through a road speckled with vines and villas and hares and partridges we arrive at the great avenue flanked on either hand with a double row of trees about half a mile long and with the palace itself to terminate the view facing which on each side of you is placed a semicircle of very handsome buildings which form the stables these we will not enter into because you know we are no jockies well and is this the great front of versailles what a huge heap of littleness it is composed as it were of three courts all open to the eye at once and gradually diminishing till you come to the royal apartments which on this side present but half a dozen windows and a balcony this last is all that can be called a front for the rest is only great wings the hue of all this mass is black dirty red and yellow the first proceeding from stone changed by age the second from a mixture of brick and the last from a profusion of tarnished gilding you cannot see a more disagreeable toutensemble and to finish the matter it is all stuck over in many places with small busts of a tawny hue between every window we pass through this to go into the garden and here the case is indeed altered nothing can be vaster and more magnificent than the back front before it a very spacious terrace spreads itself adorned with two large basins these are bordered and lined as most of the others with white marble with handsome statues of bronze reclined on their edges from hence you descend a huge flight of steps into a semicircle formed by woods that are cut all round into niches which are filled with beautiful copies of all the famous antique statues in white marble just in the midst is the basin of latona she and her children are standing on the top of a rock in the middle on the sides of which are the peasants some half some totally changed into frogs all which throw out water at her in great plenty from this place runs on the great alley which brings you into a complete round where is the basin of apollo the biggest in the gardens he is rising in his car out of the water surrounded by nymphs and tritons all in bronze and finely executed and these as they play raise a perfect storm about him beyond this is the great canal a prodigious long piece of water that terminates the whole all this you have at one coup doeil in entering the garden which is truly great i cannot say as much of the general taste of the place every thing you behold savours too much of art all is forced all is constrained about you statues and vases sowed every where without distinction sugarloaves and mincedpies of yew scrawlwork of box and little squirting jetsdeau besides a great sameness in the walks cannot help striking one at first sight not to mention the silliest of labyrinths and all aesops fables in water since these were designed in usum delphini only here then we walk by moonlight and hear the ladies and the nightingales sing next morning being whitsunday make ready to go to the installation of nine knights du saint esprit cambis is one high mass celebrated with music great crowd much incense king queen dauphin mesdames cardinals and court knights arrayed by his majesty reverences before the altar not bows but curtsies stiff hams much tittering among the ladies trumpets kettledrums and fifes my dear west i am vastly delighted with trianon all of us with chantilly if you would know why you must have patience for i can hold my pen no longer except to tell you that i saw britannicus last night all the characters particularly agrippina and nero done to perfection tomorrow phaedra and hippolitus we are making you a little bundle of petites pieces there is nothing in them but they are acting at present there are too crebillons letters and amusemens sur le langage des betes said to be of one bougeant a jesuit they are both esteemed and lately come out this day sennight we go to rheims   letter iv mr gray to his mother rheims june    ns      we have now been settled almost three weeks in this city which is more considerable upon account of its size and antiquity than from the number of its inhabitants or any advantages of commerce there is little in it worth a strangers curiosity besides the cathedral church which is a vast gothic building of a surprising beauty and lightness all covered over with a profusion of little statues and other ornaments it is here the kings of france are crowned by the archbishop of rheims who is the first peer and the primate of the kingdom the holy vessel made use of on that occasion which contains the oil is kept in the church of st nicasius hard by and is believed to have been brought by an angel from heaven at the coronation of clovis the first christian king the streets in general have but a melancholy aspect the houses all old the public walks run along the side of a great moat under the ramparts where one hears a continual croaking of frogs the country round about is one great plain covered with vines which at this time of the year afford no very pleasing prospect as being not above a foot high what pleasures the place denies to the sight it makes up to the palate since you have nothing to drink but the best champaigne in the world and all sort of provisions equally good as to other pleasures there is not that freedom of conversation among the people of fashion here that one sees in other parts of france for though they are not very numerous in this place and consequently must live a good deal together yet they never come to any great familiarity with one another as my lord conway had spent a good part of his time among them his brother and we with him were soon introduced into all their assemblies as soon as you enter the lady of the house presents each of you a card and offers you a party at quadrille you sit down and play forty deals without intermission excepting one quarter of an hour when every body rises to eat of what they call the gouter which supplies the place of our tea and is a service of wine fruits cream sweetmeats crawfish and cheese people take what they like and sit down again to play after that they make little parties to go to the walks together and then all the company retire to their separate habitations very seldom any suppers or dinners are given and this is the manner they live among one another not so much out of any aversion they have to pleasure as out of a sort of formality they have contracted by not being much frequented by people who have lived at paris it is sure they do not hate gaiety any more than the rest of their country people and can enter into diversions that are once proposed with a good grace enough for instance the other evening we happened to be got together in a company of eighteen people men and women of the best fashion here at a garden in the town to walk when one of the ladies bethought herself of asking why should not we sup here immediately the cloth was laid by the side of a fountain under the trees and a very elegant supper served up after which another said come let us sing and directly began herself from singing we insensibly fell to dancing and singing in a round when somebody mentioned the violins and immediately a company of them was ordered minuets were begun in the open air and then came countrydances which held till four oclock next morning at which hour the gayest lady there proposed that such as were weary should get into their coaches and the rest of them should dance before them with the music in the van and in this manner we paraded through all the principal streets of the city and waked every body in it mr walpole had a mind to make a custom of the thing and would have given a ball in the same manner next week but the women did not come into it so i believe it will drop and they will return to their dull cards and usual formalities we are not to stay above a month longer here and shall then go to dijon the chief city of burgundy a very splendid and a very gay town at least such is the present design   letter v mr gray to his father dijon friday sept    ns      we have made three short days journey of it from rheims hither where we arrived the night before last the road we have passed through has been extremely agreeable it runs through the most fertile part of champaigne by the side of the river marne with a chain of hills on each hand at some distance entirely covered with woods and vineyards and every now and then the ruins of some old castle on their tops we lay at st dizier the first night and at langres the second and got hither the next evening time enough to have a full view of this city in entering it it lies in a very extensive plain covered with vines and corn and consequently is plentifully supplied with both i need not tell you that it is the chief city of burgundy nor that it is of great antiquity considering which one should imagine it ought to be larger than one finds it however what it wants in extent is made up in beauty and cleanliness and in rich convents and churches most of which we have seen the palace of the states is a magnificent new building where the duke of bourbon is lodged when he comes every three years to hold that assembly as governor of the province a quarter of a mile out of the town is a famous abbey of carthusians which we are just returned from seeing in their chapel are the tombs of the ancient dukes of burgundy that were so powerful till at the death of charles the bold the last of them this part of his dominions was united by lewis xi to the crown of france tomorrow we are to pay a visit to the abbot of the cistercians who lives a few leagues off and who uses to receive all strangers with great civility his abbey is one of the richest in the kingdom he keeps open house always and lives with great magnificence we have seen enough of this town already to make us regret the time we spent at rheims it is full of people of condition who seem to form a much more agreeable society than we found in champaigne but as we shall stay here but two or three days longer it is not worth while to be introduced into their houses on monday or tuesday we are to set out for lions which is two days journey distant and from thence you shall hear again from me   letter vi mr gray to mr west lions sept    ns      scavez vous bien mon cher ami que je vous hais que je vous deteste voila des terms un peu fortes and that will save me upon a just computation a page of paper and six drops of ink which if i confined myself to reproaches of a more moderate nature i should be obliged to employ in using you according to your deserts what to let any body reside three months at rheims and write but once to them please to consult tully de amicit page   line    and you will find it said in express terms ad amicum inter remos relegatum mense uno quinquies scriptum esto nothing more plain or less liable to false interpretations now because i suppose it will give you pain to know we are in being i take this opportunity to tell you that we are at the ancient and celebrated lugdunum a city situated upon the confluence of the rhone and saone arar i should say two people who though of tempers extremely unlike think fit to join hands here and make a little party to travel to the mediterranean in company the lady comes gliding along through the fruitful plains of burgundy incredibili lenitate ita ut oculis in utram partem fluit judicari non possit the gentleman runs all rough and roaring down from the mountains of switzerland to meet her and with all her soft airs she likes him never the worse she goes through the middle of the city in state and he passes incog without the walls but waits for her a little below the houses here are so high and the streets so narrow as would be sufficient to render lions the dismallest place in the world but the number of people and the face of commerce diffused about it are at least as sufficient to make it the liveliest between these two sufficiencies you will be in doubt what to think of it so we shall leave the city and proceed to its environs which are beautiful beyond expression it is surrounded with mountains and those mountains all bedroped and bespeckled with houses gardens and plantations of the rich bourgeois who have from thence a prospect of the city in the vale below on one hand on the other the rich plains of the lyonnois with the rivers winding among them and the alps with the mountains of dauphine to bound the view all yesterday morning we were busied in climbing up mount fourviere where the ancient city stood perched at such a height that nothing but the hopes of gain could certainly ever persuade their neighbors to pay them a visit here are the ruins of the emperors palaces that resided here that is to say augustus and severus they consist in nothing but great masses of old wall that have only their quality to make them respected in a vineyard of the minims are remains of a theater the fathers whom they belong to hold them in no esteem at all and would have showed us their sacristy and chapel instead of them the ursuline nuns have in their garden some roman baths but we having the misfortune to be men and heretics they did not think proper to admit us hard by are eight arches of a most magnificent aqueduct said to be erected by antony when his legions were quartered here there are many other parts of it dispersed up and down the country for it brought the water from a river many leagues off in la forez here are remains too of agrippas seven great roads which met at lions in some places they lie twelve feet deep in the ground in short a thousand matters that you shall not know till you give me a description of the pais de tombridge and the effect its waters have upon you   letter vii mr west to mr gray temple sept         if wishes could turn to realities i would fling down my law books and sup with you tonight but alas here am i doomed to fix while you are fluttering from city to city and enjoying all the pleasures which a gay climate can afford it is out of the power of my heart to envy you your good fortune yet i cannot help indulging a few natural desires as for example to take a walk with you on the banks of the rhone and to be climbing up mount fourviere jam mens praetrepidans avet vagari jam laeti studio pedes vigescunt however so long as i am not deprived of your correspondence so long shall i always find some pleasure in being at home and setting all vain curiosity aside when the fit is over and my reason begins to come to herself i have several other powerful motives which might easily cure me of my restless inclinations amongst these my mothers ill state of health is not the least which was the reason of our going to tunbridge so that you cannot expect much description or amusement from thence nor indeed is there much room for either for all diversions there may be reduced to two articles gaming and going to church they were pleased to publish certain tunbrigiana this season but such ana i believe there were never so many vile little verses put together before so much for tunbridge london affords me as little to say what so huge a town as london yes consider only how i live in that town i never go into the gay world or high world and consequently receive nothing from thence to brighten my imagination the busy world i leave to the busy and am resolved never to talk politics till i can act at the same time to tell old stories or prate of old books seems a little musty and toujours chapon bouilli will not do however for want of better fare take another little mouthful of my poetry o meae jucunda comes quietis quae fere aegrotum solita es levare pectus et sensim ah nimis ingruentes fallere curas quid canes quanto lyra dic furore gesties quando hac reducem sodalem glauciam he gives mr gray the name of glaucias frequently in his latin verse as mr gray calls him favonius gaudere simul videbis meque sub umbra    letter viii mr gray to his mother lions oct    ns      it is now almost five weeks since i left dijon one of the gayest and most agreeable little cities of france for lions its reverse in all these particulars it is the second in the kingdom in bigness and rank the streets excessively narrow and nasty the houses immensely high and large that for instance where we are lodged has twentyfive rooms on a floor and that for five stories it swarms with inhabitants like paris itself but chiefly a mercantile people too much given up to commerce to think of their own much less of a strangers diversions we have no acquaintance in the town but such english as happen to be passing through here in their way to italy and the south which at present happen to be near thirty in number it is a fortnight since we set out from hence upon a little excursion to geneva we took the longest road which lies through savoy on purpose to see a famous monastery called the grand chartreuse and had no reason to think our time lost after having traveled seven days very slow for we did not change horses it being impossible for a chaise to go post in these roads we arrived at a little village among the mountains of savoy called echelles from thence we proceeded on horses who are used to the way to the mountain of the chartreuse it is six miles to the top the road runs winding up it commonly not six feet broad on one hand is the rock with woods of pinetrees hanging over head on the other a monstrous precipice almost perpendicular at the bottom of which rolls a torrent that sometimes tumbling among the fragments of stone that have fallen from on high and sometimes precipitating itself down vast descents with a noise like thunder which is still made greater by the echo from the mountains on each side concurs to form one of the most solemn the most romantic and the most astonishing scenes i ever beheld add to this the strange views made by the craggs and cliffs on the other hand the cascades that in many places throw themselves from the very summit down into the vale and the river below and many other particulars impossible to describe you will conclude we had no occasion to repent our pains this place st bruno chose to retire to and upon its very top founded the aforesaid convent which is the superior of the whole order when we came there the two fathers who are commissioned to entertain strangers for the rest must neither speak one to another nor to any one else received us very kindly and set before us a repast of dried fish eggs butter and fruits all excellent in their kind and extremely neat they pressed us to spend the night there and to stay some days with them but this we could not do so they led us about their house which is you must think like a little city for there are  00 fathers besides  00 servants that make their clothes grind their corn press their wine and do every thing among themselves the whole is quite orderly and simple nothing of finery but the wonderful decency and the strange situation more than supply the place of it in the evening we descended by the same way passing through many clouds that were then forming themselves on the mountains side next day we continued our journey by chamberry which though the chief city of the duchy and residence of the king of sardinia when he comes into this part of his dominions makes but a very mean and insignificant appearance we lay at aix once famous for its hot baths and the next night at annecy the day after by noon we got to geneva i have not time to say any thing about it nor of our solitary journey back again    letter ix mr gray to his father lions oct    ns      in my last i gave you the particulars of our little journey to geneva i have only to add that we stayed about a week in order to see mr conway settled there i do not wonder so many english choose it for their residence the city is very small neat prettily built and extremely populous the rhone runs through the middle of it and it is surrounded with new fortifications that give it a military compact air which joined to the happy lively countenances of the inhabitants and an exact discipline always as strictly observed as in time of war makes the little republic appear a match for a much greater power though perhaps geneva and all that belongs to it are not of equal extent with windsor and its two parks to one that has passed through savoy as we did nothing can be more striking than the contrast as soon as he approaches the town near the gates of geneva runs the torrent arve which separates it from the king of sardinias dominions on the other side of it lies a country naturally indeed fine and fertile but you meet with nothing in it but meager ragged barefooted peasants with their children in extreme misery and nastiness and even of these no great numbers you no sooner have crossed the stream i have mentioned but poverty is no more not a beggar hardly a discontented face to be seen numerous and welldressed people swarming on the ramparts drums beating soldiers wellcloathed and armed exercising and folks with business in their looks hurrying to and fro all contribute to make any person who is not blind sensible what a difference there is between the two governments that are the causes of one view and the other the beautiful lake at one end of which the town is situated its extent the several states that border upon it and all its pleasures are too well known for me to mention them we sailed upon it as far as the dominions of geneva extend that is about two leagues and a half on each side and landed at several of the little houses of pleasure that the inhabitants have built all about it who received us with much politeness the same night we eat part of a trout taken in the lake that weighed thirtyseven pounds as great a monster as it appeared to us it was esteemed there nothing extraordinary and they assured us it was not uncommon to catch them of fifty pounds they are dressed here and sent post to paris upon some great occasions nay even to madrid as we were told the road we returned through was not the same we came by we crossed the rhone at seyssel and passed for three days among the mountains of bugey without meeting with any thing new at last we came out into the plains of la bresse and so to lions again sir robert has written to mr walpole to desire he would go to italy which he has resolved to do so that all the scheme of spending the winter in the south of france is laid aside and we are to pass it in a much finer country you may imagine i am not sorry to have this opportunity of seeing the place in the world that best deserves it besides as the pope who is eightyeight and has been lately at the point of death cannot probably last a great while perhaps we may have the fortune to be present at the election of a new one when rome will be in all its glory friday next we certainly begin our journey in two days we shall come to the foot of the alps and six more we shall be in passing them even here the winter is begun what then must it be among those vast snowy mountains where it is hardly ever summer we are however as well armed as possible against the cold with muffs hoods and masks of bever furboots and bear skins when we arrive at turin we shall rest after the fatigues of the journey    letter x mr gray to his mother turin nov   ns      i am this night arrived here and have just set down to rest me after eight days tiresome journey for the three first we had the same road we before past through to go to geneva the fourth we turned out of it and for that day and the next traveled rather among than upon the alps the way commonly running through a deep valley by the side of the river arc which works itself a passage with great difficulty and a mighty noise among vast quantities of rocks that have rolled down from the mountain tops the winter was so far advanced as in great measure to spoil the beauty of the prospect however there was still somewhat fine remaining amidst the savageness and horror of the place the sixth we began to go up several of these mountains and as we were passing one met with an odd accident enough mr walpole had a little fat black spaniel that he was very fond of which he sometimes used to set down and let it run by the chaise side we were at that time in a very rough road not two yards broad at most on one side was a great wood of pines and on the other a vast precipice it was noonday and the sun shone bright when all of a sudden from the woodside which was as steep upwards as the other part was downwards out rushed a great wolf came close to the head of the horses seized the dog by the throat and rushed up the hill again with him in his mouth this was done in less than a quarter of a minute we all saw it and yet the servants had not time to draw their pistols or do any thing to save the dog this odd incident might have afforded mr gray a subject for an ode which would have been a good companion to that on the death of a favorite cat  if he had not been there and the creature had thought fit to lay hold of one of the horses chaise and we and all must inevitably have tumbled above fifty fathoms perpendicular down the precipice the seventh we came to lanebourg the last town in savoy it lies at the foot of the famous mount cenis which is so situated as to allow no room for any way but over the very top of it here the chaise was forced to be pulled to pieces and the baggage and that to be carried by mules we ourselves were wrapped up in our furs and seated upon a sort of matted chair without legs which is carried upon poles in the manner of a bier and so begun to ascend by the help of eight men it was six miles to the top where a plain opens itself about as many more in breadth covered perpetually with very deep snow and in the midst of that a great lake of unfathomable depth from whence a river takes its rise and tumbles over monstrous rocks quite down the other side of the mountain the descent is six miles more but infinitely more steep than the going up and here the men perfectly fly down with you stepping from stone to stone with incredible swiftness in places where none but they could go three paces without falling the immensity of the precipices the roaring of the river and torrents that run into it the huge craggs covered with ice and snow and the clouds below you and about you are objects it is impossible to conceive without seeing them and though we had heard many strange descriptions of the scene none of them at all came up to it we were but five hours in performing the whole from which you may judge of the rapidity of the mens motion we are now got into piedmont and stopped a little while at la ferriere a small village about three quarters of the way down but still among the clouds where we began to hear a new language spoken round about us at last we got quite down went through the pas de suse a narrow road among the alps defended by two fortresses and lay at bossolens next evening through a fine avenue of nine miles in length as straight as a line we arrived at this city which as you know is the capital of the principality and the residence of the king of sardinia that part of the letter here omitted contained only a description of the city which as mr gray has given it to mr west in the following letter and that in a more lively manner i thought it unnecessary to insert a liberty i have taken in other parts of this correspondence in order to avoid repetitions we shall stay here i believe a fortnight and proceed for genoa which is three or four days journey to go post  i am etc   letter xi mr gray to mr west turin nov    ns      after eight days journey through greenland we arrived at turin you approach it by a handsome avenue of nine miles long and quite strait the entrance is guarded by certain vigilant dragons called douaniers who mumbled us for some time the city is not large as being a place of strength and consequently confined within its fortifications it has many beauties and some faults among the first are streets all laid out by the line regular uniform buildings fine walks that surround the whole and in general a good lively clean appearance but the houses are of brick plaistered which is apt to want repairing the windows of oiled paper which is apt to be torn and every thing very slight which is apt to tumble down there is an excellent opera but it is only in the carnival balls every night but only in the carnival masquerades too but only in the carnival this carnival lasts only from christmas to lent one half of the remaining part of the year is past in remembering the last the other in expecting the future carnival we cannot well subsist upon such slender diet no more than upon an execrable italian comedy and a puppetshow called rappresentazione dun anima dannata which i think are all the present diversions of the place except the marquise de cavaillacs conversazione where one goes to see people play at ombre and taroc a game with    cards all painted with suns and moons and devils and monks mr walpole has been at court the family are at present at a country palace called la venerie the palace here in town is the very quintessence of gilding and lookingglass inlaid floors carved pannels and painting wherever they could stick a brush i own i have not as yet any where met with those grand and simple works of art that are to amaze one and whose sight one is to be the better for but those of nature have astonished me beyond expression in our little journey up to the grande chartreuse i do not remember to have gone ten paces without an exclamation that there was no restraining not a precipice not a torrent not a cliff but is pregnant with religion and poetry there are certain scenes that would awe an atheist into belief without the help of other argument one need not have a very fantastic imagination to see spirits there at noonday you have death perpetually before your eyes only so far removed as to compose the mind without frighting it i am well persuaded st bruno was a man of no common genius to choose such a situation for his retirement and perhaps should have been a disciple of his had i been born in his time you may believe abelard and heloise were not forgot upon this occasion if i do not mistake i saw you too every now and then at a distance among the trees il me semble que jai vu ce chien de visage la quelque part you seemed to call to me from the other side of the precipice but the noise of the river below was so great that i really could not distinguish what you said it seemed to have a cadence like verse in your next you will be so good to let me know what it was the week we have since passed among the alps has not equalled the single day upon that mountain because the winter was rather too far advanced and the weather a little foggy however it did not want its beauties the savage rudeness of the view is inconceivable without seeing it i reckoned in one day thirteen cascades the least of which was i dare say one hundred feet in height i had livy in the chaise with me and beheld his nives coelo prope immistae tecta informia imposita rupibus pecora jumentaque torrida frigore homines intonsi and inculti animalia inanimaque omnia rigentia gelu omnia confragosa praeruptaque the creatures that inhabit them are in all respects below humanity and most of them especially women have the tumidum guttur which they call goscia mont cenis i confess carries the permission mountains have of being frightful rather too far and its horrors were accompanied with too much danger to give one time to reflect upon their beauties there is a family of the alpine monsters i have mentioned upon its very top that in the middle of winter calmly lay in their stock of provisions and firing and so are buried in their hut for a month or two under the snow when we were down it and got a little way into piedmont we began to find apricos quosdam colles rivosque prope sylvas et jam humano cultu digniora loca i read silius italicus too for the first time and wished for you according to custom we set out for genoa in two days time   letter xii mr gray to mr west genoa nov         horridos tractus boreaeque linquens regna taurini fera molliorem advehor brumam genuaeque amantes litora soles  at least if they do not they have a very ill taste for i never beheld any thing more amiable only figure to yourself a vast semicircular basin full of fine blue sea and vessels of all sorts and sizes some sailing out some coming in and others at anchor and all round it palaces and churches peeping over one anothers heads gardens and marble terrases full of orange and cypress trees fountains and trellisworks covered with vines which all together compose the grandest of theaters this is the first coup doeil and is almost all i am yet able to give you an account of for we arrived late last night today was luckily a great festival and in the morning we resorted to the church of the madonna delle vigne to put up our little orisons i believe i forgot to tell you that we have been sometime converts to the holy catholic church we found our lady richly dressed out with a crown of diamonds on her own head another upon the childs and a constellation of wax lights burning before them shortly after came the doge in his robes of crimson damask and a cap of the same followed by the senate in black upon his approach began a fine concert of music and among the rest two eunuchs voices that were a perfect feast to ears that had heard nothing but french operas for a year we listened to this and breathed nothing but incense for two hours the doge is a very tall lean stately old figure called costantino balbi and the senate seem to have been made upon the same model they said their prayers and heard an absurd white friar preach with equal devotion after this we went to the annonciata a church built by the family lomellini and belonging to it which is indeed a most stately structure the inside wholly marble of various kinds except where gold and painting take its place from hence to the palazzo doria i should make you sick of marble if i told you how it was lavished here upon the porticoes the balustrades and terrases the lowest of which extends quite to the sea the inside is by no means answerable to the outward magnificence the furniture seems to be as old as the founder of the family there great imbossed silver tables tell you in basrelief his victories at sea how he entertained the emperor charles and how he refused the sovereignty of the commonwealth when it was offered him the rest is oldfashioned velvet chairs and gothic tapestry the rest of the day has been spent much to our hearts content in cursing french music and architecture and in singing the praises of italy we find this place so very fine that we are in fear of finding nothing finer we are fallen in love with the mediterranean sea and hold your lakes and your rivers in vast contempt this is  the happy country where huge lemons grow as waller says and i am sorry to think of leaving it in a week for parma although it be the happy country where huge cheeses grow   letter xiii mr gray to his mother bologna dec   ns      our journey hither has taken up much less time than i expected we left genoa a charming place and one that deserved a longer stay the week before last crossed the mountains and lay that night at tortona the next at st giovanni and the morning after came to piacenza that city though the capital of a duchy made so frippery an appearance that instead of spending some days there as had been intended we only dined and went on to parma stayed there all the following day which was passed in visiting the famous works of corregio in the dome and other churches the fine gallery of pictures that once belonged to the dukes of parma is no more here the king of naples has carried it all thither and the city had not merit enough to detain us any longer so we proceeded through reggio to modena this though the residence of its duke is an illbuilt melancholy place all of brick as are most of the towns in this part of lombardy he himself lives in a private manner with very little appearance of a court about him he has one of the noblest collections of paintings in the world which entertained us extremely well the rest of that day and a part of the next and in the afternoon we came to bologna so now you may wish us joy of being in the dominions of his holiness this is a populous city and of great extent all the streets have porticoes on both sides such as surround a part of covent garden a great relief in summertime in such a climate and from one of the principal gates to a church of the virgin where is a wonderworking picture at three miles distance runs a corridore of the same sort lately finished and indeed a most extraordinary performance the churches here are more remarkable for their paintings than architecture being mostly old structures of brick but the palaces are numerous and fine enough to supply us with somewhat worth seeing from morning till night the country of lombardy hitherto is one of the most beautiful imaginable the roads broad and exactly straight and on either hand vast plantations of trees chiefly mulberries and olives and not a tree without a vine twining about it and spreading among its branches this scene indeed which must be the most lovely in the world during the proper season is at present all deformed by the winter which here is rigorous enough for the time it lasts but one still sees the skeleton of a charming place and reaps the benefit of its product for the fruits and provisions are admirable in short you find every thing that luxury can desire in perfection we have now been here a week and shall stay some little time longer we are at the foot of the apennine mountains it will take up three days to cross them and then we shall come to florence where we shall pass the christmas till then we must remain in a state of ignorance as to what is doing in england for our letters are to meet us there if i do not find four or five from you alone i shall wonder   letter xiv mr gray to his mother florence dec    ns      we spent twelve days at bologna chiefly as most travelers do in seeing sights for as we knew no mortal there and as it is no easy matter to get admission into any italian house without very particular recommendations we could see no company but in public places and there are none in that city but the churches we saw therefore churches palaces and pictures from morning to night and the   th of this month set out for florence and began to cross the apennine mountains we traveled among and upon them all that day and as it was but indifferent weather were commonly in the middle of thick clouds that utterly deprived us of a sight of their beauties for this vast chain of hills has its beauties and all the valleys are cultivated even the mountains themselves are many of them so within a little of their very tops they are not so horrid as the alps though pretty near as high and the whole road is admirably well kept and paved throughout which is a length of fourscore miles and more we left the popes dominions and lay that night in those of the grand duke at fiorenzuola a paltry little town at the foot of mount giogo which is the highest of them all next morning we went up it the posthouse is upon its very top and usually involved in clouds or halfburied in the snow indeed there was none of the last at the time we were there but it was still a dismal habitation the descent is most excessively steep and the turnings very short and frequent however we performed it without any danger and in coming down could dimly discover florence and the beautiful plain about it through the mists but enough to convince us it must be one of the noblest prospects upon earth in summer that afternoon we got thither and mr mann now sir horace mann and envoy extraordinary at the same court  the resident had sent his servant to meet us at the gates and conduct us to his house he is the best and most obliging person in the world the next night we were introduced at the prince of craons assembly he has the chief power here in the grand dukes absence the princess and he were extremely civil to the name of walpole so we were asked to stay supper which is as much as to say you may come and sup here whenever you please for after the first invitation this is always understood we have also been at the countess suarezs a favorite of the late duke and one that gives the first movement to every thing gay that is going forward here the news is every day expected from vienna of the great dutchesss delivery if it be a boy here will be all sorts of balls masquerades operas and illuminations if not we must wait for the carnival when all those things come of course in the mean time it is impossible to want entertainment the famous gallery alone is an amusement for months we commonly pass two or three hours every morning in it and one has perfect leisure to consider all its beauties you know it contains many hundred antique statues such as the whole world cannot match besides the vast collection of paintings medals and precious stones such as no other prince was ever master of in short all that the rich and powerful house of medicis has in so many years got together he catalogued and made occasional short remarks on the pictures etc which he saw here as well as at other places many of which are in my possession but it would have swelled this work too much if i had inserted them and besides this city abounds with so many palaces and churches that you can hardly place yourself any where without having some fine one in view or at least some statue or fountain magnificently adorned these undoubtedly are far more numerous than genoa can pretend to yet in its general appearance i cannot think that florence equals it in beauty mr walpole is just come from being presented to the electress palatine dowager she is a sister of the late great dukes a stately old lady that never goes out but to church and then she has guards and eight horses to her coach she received him with much ceremony standing under a huge black canopy and after a few minutes talking she assured him of her good will and dismissed him she never sees any body but thus in form and so she passes her life persons of very high rank and withal very good sense will only feel the pathos of this exclamation poor woman    letter xv mr gray to mr west florence jan       0 i think i have not yet told you how we left that charming place genoa how we crossed a mountain all of green marble called buchetto how we came to tortona and waded through the mud to come to castle st giovanni and there eat mustard and sugar with a dish of crows gizzards secondly how we passed the famous plains qua trebie glaucas salices intersecat unda arvaque romany nobilitata malis visus adhuc amnis veteri de clade rubere et suspirantes ducere maestus aquas maurorumque ala and nigrae increbrescere turmae et pulsa ausonidum ripa sonare fuga nor thirdly how we passed through piacenza parma modena entered the territories of the pope stayed twelve days at bologna crossed the apennines and afterward arrived at florence none of these things have i told you nor do i intend to tell you till you ask me some questions concerning them no not even of florence itself except that it is as fine as possible and has every thing in it that can bless the eyes but before i enter into particulars you must make your peace both with me and the venus de medicis who let me tell you is highly and justly offended at you for not inquiring long before this concerning her symmetry and proportions    letter xvi mr west to mr gray

mr gray to his mother florence march       0 the pope clement the twelfth is at last dead and we are to set out for rome on monday next the conclave is still sitting there and likely to continue so some time longer as the two french cardinals are but just arrived and the german ones are still expected it agrees mighty ill with those that remain enclosed ottoboni is already dead of an apoplexy altieri and several others are said to be dying or very bad yet it is not expected to break up till after easter we shall lie at sienna the first night spend a day there and in two more get to rome one begins to see in this country the first promises of an italian spring clear unclouded skies and warm suns such as are not often felt in england yet for your sake i hope at present you have your proportion of them and that all your frosts and snows and shortbreaths are by this time utterly vanished i have nothing new or particular to inform you of and if you see things at home go on much in their old course you must not imagine them more various abroad the diversions of a florentine lent are composed of a sermon in the morning full of hell and the devil a dinner at noon full of fish and meager diet and in the evening what is called a conversazione a sort of assembly at the principal peoples houses full of i cannot tell what besides this there is twice a week a very grand concert    letter xviii mr gray to his mother rome april   ns    0 this is the third day since we came to rome but the first hour i have had to write to you in the journey from florence cost us four days one of which was spent at sienna an agreeable clean old city of no great magnificence or extent but in a fine situation and good air what it has most considerable is its cathedral a huge pile of marble black and white laid alternately and labored with a gothic niceness and delicacy in the oldfashioned way within too are some paintings and sculpture of considerable hands the sight of this and some collections that were showed us in private houses were a sufficient employment for the little time we were to pass there and the next morning we set forward on our journey through a country very oddly composed for some miles you have a continual scene of little mountains cultivated from top to bottom with rows of olive trees or else elms each of which has its vine twining about it and mixing with the branches and corn sown between all the ranks this diversified with numerous small houses and convents makes the most agreeable prospect in the world but all of a sudden it alters to black barren hills as far as the eye can reach that seem never to have been capable of culture and are as ugly as useless such is the country for some time before one comes to mount radicofani a terrible black hill on the top of which we were to lodge that night it is very high and difficult of ascent and at the foot of it we were much embarrassed by the fall of one of the poor horses that drew us this accident obliged another chaise which was coming down to stop also and out of it peeped a figure in a red cloak with a handkerchief tied round its head which by its voice and mien seemed a fat old woman but upon its getting out appeared to be senesino who was returning from naples to sienna the place of his birth and residence on the highest part of the mountain is an old fortress and near it a house built by one of the grand dukes for a huntingseat but now converted into an inn it is the shell of a large fabric but such an inside such chambers and accommodations that your cellar is a palace in comparison and your cat sups and lies much better than we did for it being a saints eve there were nothing but eggs we devoured our meager fare and after stopping up the windows with the quilts were obliged to lie upon the straw beds in our clothes such are the conveniences in a road that is as it were the great thoroughfare of all the world just on the other side of this mountain at pontecentino one enters the patrimony of the church a most delicious country but thinly inhabited that night brought us to viterbo a city of a more lively appearance than any we had lately met with the houses have glass windows which is not very usual here and most of the streets are terminated by a handsome fountain here we had the pleasure of breaking our fast on the leg of an old hare and some broiled crows next morning in descending mount viterbo we first discovered though at near thirty miles distance the cupola of st peters and a little after began to enter on an old roman pavement with now and then a ruined tower or a sepulcher on each hand we now had a clear view of the city though not to the best advantage as coming along a plain quite upon a level with it however it appeared very vast and surrounded with magnificent villas and gardens we soon after crossed the tiber a river that ancient rome made more considerable than any merit of its own could have done however it is not contemptibly small but a good handsome stream very deep yet somewhat of a muddy complexion the first entrance of rome is prodigiously striking it is by a noble gate designed by michel angelo and adorned with statues this brings you into a large square in the midst of which is a vast obelisk of granite and in front you have at one view two churches of a handsome architecture and so much alike that they are called the twins with three streets the middlemost of which is one of the longest in rome as high as my expectation was raised i confess the magnificence of this city infinitely surpasses it you cannot pass along a street but you have views of some palace or church or square or fountain the most picturesque and noble one can imagine we have not yet set about considering its beauties ancient and modern with attention but have already taken a slight transient view of some of the most remarkable st peters i saw the day after we arrived and was struck dumb with wonder i there saw the cardinal dauvergne one of the french ones who upon coming off his journey immediately repaired hither to offer up his vows at the high altar and went directly into the conclave the doors of which we saw opened to him and all the other immured cardinals came thither to receive him upon his entrance they were closed again directly it is supposed they will not come to an agreement about a pope till after easter though the confinement is very disagreeable i have hardly philosophy enough to see the infinity of fine things that are here daily in the power of any body that has money without regretting the want of it but custom has the power of making things easy to one i have not yet seen his majesty of great britain etc though i have the two boys in the gardens of the villa borgese where they go ashooting almost every day it was at a distance indeed for we did not choose to meet them as you may imagine this letter like all those the english send or receive will pass through the hands of that family before it comes to those it was intended for they do it more honor than it deserves and all they will learn from thence will be that i desire you to give my duty to my father and wherever else it is due and that i am etc   letter xix mr gray to his mother rome april       0 good friday today i am just come from paying my adoration at st peters to three extraordinary relics which are exposed to public view only on these two days in the whole year at which time all the confraternities in the city come in procession to see them it was something extremely novel to see that vast church and the most magnificent in the world undoubtedly illuminated for it was night by thousands of little crystal lamps disposed in the figure of a huge cross at the high altar and seeming to hang alone in the air all the light proceeded from this and had the most singular effect imaginable as one entered the great door soon after came one after another i believe thirty processions all dressed in linen frocks and girt with a cord their heads covered with a cowl all over only two holes to see through left some of them were all black others red others white others partycolored these were continually coming and going with their tapers and crucifixes before them and to each company as they arrived and knelt before the great altar were shown from a balcony at a great height the three wonders which are you must know the head of the spear that wounded christ st veronicas handkerchief with the miraculous impression of his face upon it and a piece of the true cross on the sight of which the people thump their breasts and kiss the pavement with vast devotion the tragical part of the ceremony is half a dozen wretched creatures who with their faces covered but naked to the waist are in a sidechapel disciplining themselves with scourges full of iron prickles but really in earnest as our eyes can testify which saw their backs and arms so raw we should have taken it for a red satin doublet torn and showing the skin through had we not been convinced of the contrary by the blood which was plentifully sprinkled about them it is late i give you joy of porto bello and many other things which i hope are all true    letter xx mr gray to mr west tivoli may  0    0 this day being in the palace of his highness the duke of modena he laid his most serene commands upon me to write to mr west and said he thought it for his glory that i should draw up an inventory of all his most serene possessions for the said wests perusal  imprimis a house being in circumference a quarter of a mile two feet and an inch the said house containing the following particulars to wit a great room item another great room item a bigger room item another room item a vast room item a sixth of the same a seventh ditto an eighth as before a ninth as abovesaid a tenth see no   item ten more such besides twenty besides which not to be too particular we shall pass over the said rooms contain nine chairs two tables five stools and a cricket from whence we shall proceed to the garden containing two millions of superfine laurel hedges a clump of cypress trees and half the river teverone that pisses into two thousand several chamberpots finis  dame nature desired me to put in a list of her little goods and chattels and as they were small to be very minute about them she has built here three or four little mountains and laid them out in an irregular semicircle from certain others behind at a greater distance she has drawn a canal into which she has put a little river of here is called anio she has cut a huge cleft between the two innermost of her four hills and there she has left it to its own disposal which she has no sooner done but like a heedless chit it tumbles headlong down a declivity fifty feet perpendicular breaks itself all to shatters and is converted into a shower of rain where the sun forms many a bow red green blue and yellow to get out of our metaphors without any further trouble it is the most noble sight in the world the weight of that quantity of waters and the force they fall with have worn the rocks they throw themselves among into a thousand irregular craggs and to a vast depth in this channel it goes boiling along with a mighty noise till it comes to another steep where you see it a second time come roaring down but first you must walk two miles farther a greater height than before but not with that quantity of waters for by this time it has divided itself being crossed and opposed by the rocks into four several streams each of which in emulation of the great one will tumble down too and it does tumble down but not from an equally elevated place so that you have at one view all these cascades intermixed with groves of olive and little woods the mountains rising behind them and on the top of one that which forms the extremity of one of the halfcircles horns is seated the town itself at the very extremity of that extremity on the brink of the precipice stands the sybils temple the remains of a little rotunda surrounded with its portico above half of whose beautiful corinthian pillars are still standing and entire all this on one hand on the other the open campagna of rome here and there a little castle on a hillock and the city itself on the very brink of the horizon indistinctly seen being    miles off except the dome of st peters which if you look out of your window wherever you are i suppose you can see i did not tell you that a little below the first fall on the side of the rock and hanging over that torrent are little ruins which they show you for horaces house a curious situation to observe the  praeceps anio and tiburni lucus and uda  mobilibus pomaria rivis maecenas did not care for such a noise it seems and built him a house which they also carry one to see so situated that it sees nothing at all of the matter and for any thing he knew there might be no such river in the world horace had another house on the other side of the teverone opposite to maecenass and they told us there was a bridge of communication by which andava il detto signor per trastullarsi coll istesso orazio in coming hither we crossed the aquae albulae a vile little brook that stinks like a fury and they say it has stunk so these thousand years i forgot the piscina of quintilius varus where he used to keep certain little fishes this is very entire and there is a piece of the aqueduct that supplied it too in the garden below is old rome built in little just as it was they say there are seven temples in it and no houses at all they say there were none  may     we have had the pleasure of going twelve miles out of our way to palestrina it has rained all day as if heaven and us were coming together see my honesty i do not mention a syllable of the temple of fortune because i really did not see it which i think is pretty well for an old traveller so we returned along the via praenestina saw the lacus gabinus and regillus where you know castor and pollux appeared upon a certain occasion and many a good old tomb we left on each hand and many an aqueduct  dumb are whose fountains and their channels dry  there are indeed two whole modern ones works of popes that run about thirty miles apiece in length one of them conveys still the famous aqua virgo to rome and adds vast beauty to the prospect so we came to rome again where waited for us a splendidissimo regalo of letters in one of which came you with your huge characters and wide intervals staring i would have you to know i expect you should take a handsome crowquill when you write to me and not leave room for a pins point in four sides of a sheet royal do you but find matter i will find spectacles  i have more time than i thought and i will employ it in telling you about a ball that we were at the other evening figure to yourself a roman villa all its little apartments thrown open and lighted up to the best advantage at the upper end of the gallery a fine concert in which la diamantina a famous virtuosa played on the violin divinely and sung angelically giovannino and pasqualini great names in musical story also performed miraculously on each side were ranged all the secular grand monde of rome the ambassadors princesses and all that among the rest il serenissimo pretendente as the mantova gazette calls him displayed his rueful length of person with his two young ones and all his ministry around him poi nacque un grazioso ballo where the world danced and i sat in a corner regaling myself with iced fruits

appian is somewhat tiresome however whimsical this humor may appear to some readers i chose to insert it as it gives me an opportunity of remarking that mr gray was extremely skilled in the customs of the ancient romans and has catalogued in his common place book their various eatables wines perfumes clothes medicines etc with great precision referring under every article to passages in the poets and historians where their names are mentioned we dined at pompeys he indeed was gone for a few days to his tusculan but by the care of his villicus we made an admirable meal we had the dugs of a pregnant sow a peacock a dish of thrushes a noble scarus just fresh from the tyrrhene and some conchylia of the lake with garum sauce for my part i never eat better at luculluss table we drank half a dozen cyathi apiece of ancient alban to pholoes health and after bathing and playing an hour at ball we mounted our essedum again and proceeded up the mount to the temple the priests there entertained us with an account of a wonderful shower of birds eggs that had fallen two days before which had no sooner touched the ground but they were converted into gudgeons as also that the night past a dreadful voice had been heard out of the adytum which spoke greek during a full half hour but no body understood it but quitting my romanities to your great joy and mine let me tell you in plain english that we come from albano the present town lies within the enclosure of pompeys villa in ruins the appian way runs through it by the side of which a little farther is a large old tomb with five pyramids upon it which the learned suppose to be the buryingplace of the family because they do not know whose it can be else but the vulgar assure you it is the sepulcher of the curiatii and by that name such is their power it goes one drives to castle gondolfo a house of the popes situated on the top of one of the collinette that forms a brim to the basin commonly called the alban lake it is seven miles round and directly oppositeto you on the other side rises the mons albanus much taller than the rest along whose side are still discoverable not to common eyes certain little ruins of the old alba longa they had need be very little as having been nothing but ruins ever since the days of tullus hostilius on its top is a house of the constable collonas where stood the temple of jupiter latialis at the foot of the hill gondolfo are the famous outlets of the lake built with hewn stone a mile and a half under ground livy you know amply informs us of the foolish occasion of this expense and gives me this opportunity of displaying all my erudition that i may appear considerable in your eyes this is the prospect from one window of the palace from another you have the whole campagna the city antium and the tyrrene sea twelve miles distant so distinguishable that you may see the vessels sailing upon it all this is charming mr walpole says our memory sees more than our eyes in this country which is extremely true since for realities windsor or richmond hill is infinitely preferable to albano or frescati i am now at home and going to the window to tell you it is the most beautiful of italian nights which in truth are but just begun so backward has the spring been here and every where else they say there is a moon there are stars for you do not you hear the fountain do not you smell the orange flowers that building yonder is the convent of s isidore and that eminence with the cypress trees and pines upon it the top of m quirinal this is all true and yet my prospect is not two hundred yards in length we send you some roman inscriptions to entertain you the first two are modern transcribed from the vatican library by mr walpole pontifices olim quem fundavere

the finest country in the world and every spot of it on some account or other famous for these three thousand years past mr gray writ a minute description of every thing he saw in this tour from rome to naples as also of the environs of rome florence etc but as these papers are apparently only memorandums for his own use i do not think it necessary to print them although they abound with many uncommon remarks and pertinent classical quotations the reader will please to observe throughout this section that it is not my intention to give him mr grays travels but only extracts from the letters which he writ during his travels  the season has hitherto been just as warm as one would wish it no unwholesome airs or violent heats yet heard of the people call it a backward year and are in pain about their corn wine and oil but we who are neither corn wine nor oil find it very agreeable our road was through velletri cisterna terracina capua and aversa and so to naples the minute one leaves his holinesss dominions the face of things begins to change from wide uncultivated plains to olive groves and welltilled fields of corn intermixed with ranks of elms every one of which has its vine twining about it and hanging in festoons between the rows from one tree to another the great old figtrees the oranges in full bloom and myrtles in every hedge make one of the delightfullest scenes you can conceive besides that the roads are wide wellkept and full of passengers a sight i have not beheld this long time my wonder still increased upon entering the city which i think for number of people outdoes both paris and london the streets are one continued market and thronged with populace so much that a coach can hardly pass the common sort are a jolly lively kind of animals more industrious than italians usually are they work till evening then they take their lute or guitar for they all play and walk about the city or upon the seashore with it to enjoy the fresco one sees their little brown children jumping about starknaked and the bigger ones dancing with castanets while others play on the cymbal to them your maps will show you the situation of naples it is on the most lovely bay in the world and one of the calmest seas it has many other beauties besides those of nature we have spent two days in visiting the remarkable places in the country round it such as the bay of baiae and its remains of antiquity the lake avernus and the solfatara charons grotto etc we have been in the sybils cave and many other strange holes underground i only name them because you may consult sandys travels but the strangest hole i ever was in has been today at a place called portici where his sicilian majesty has a countryseat about a year ago as they were digging they discovered some parts of ancient buildings above thirty feet deep in the ground curiosity led them on and they have been digging ever since the passage they have made with all its turnings and windings is now more than a mile long as you walk you see parts of an amphitheatre many houses adorned with marble columns and incrusted with the same the front of a temple several arched vaults of rooms painted in fresco some pieces of painting have been taken out from hence finer than any thing of the kind before discovered and with these the king has adorned his palace also a number of statues medals and gems and more are dug out every day this is known to be a roman town it should seem by the omission of its name that it was not then discovered to be herculaneum  that in the emperor tituss time was overwhelmed by a furious eruption of mount vesuvius which is hard by the wood and beams remain so perfect that you may see the grain but burnt to a coal and dropping into dust upon the least touch we were today at the foot of that mountain which at present only smokes a little where we saw the materials that fed the stream of fire which about four years since ran down its side we have but a few days longer to stay here too little in conscience for such a place    letter xxiii mr gray to his father florence july       0 at my return to this city the day before yesterday i had the pleasure of finding yours dated june the  th the period of our voyages at least toward the south is come as you wish we have been at naples spent nine or ten days there and returned to rome where finding no likelihood of a pope yet these three months and quite wearied with the formal assemblies and little society of that great city mr walpole determined to return hither to spend the summer where he imagines he shall pass his time more agreeably than in the tedious expectation of what when it happens will only be a great show for my own part i give up the thoughts of all that with but little regret but the city itself i do not part with so easily which alone has amusements for whole years however i have passed through all that most people do both ancient and modern what that is you may see better than i can tell you in a thousand books the conclave we left in greater uncertainty than ever the more than ordinary liberty they enjoy there and the unusual coolness of the season makes the confinement less disagreeable to them than common and consequently maintains them in their irresolution there have been very high words one or two it is said have come even to blows two more are dead within this last month cenci and portia the latter died distracted and we left another altieri at the extremity yet nobody dreams of an election till the latter end of september all this gives great scandal to all good catholics and every body talks very freely on the subject the pretender whom you desire an account of i have had frequent opportunities of seeing at church at the corso and other places but more particularly and that for a whole night at a great ball given by count patrizii to the prince and princess craon who were come to rome at that time that he might receive from the hands of the emperors minister there the order of the golden fleece at which he and his two sons were present they are good fine boys especially the younger who has the more spirit of the two and both danced incessantly all night long for him he is a thin illmade man extremely tall and awkward of a most unpromising countenance a good deal resembling king james the second and has extremely the air and look of an idiot particularly when he laughs or prays the first he does not often the latter continually he lives private enough with his little court about him consisting of lord dunbar who manages every thing and two or three of the preston scotch lords who would be very glad to make their peace at home  we happened to be at naples on corpus christi day the greatest feast in the year so had an opportunity of seeing their sicilian majestys to advantage the king walked in the grand procession and the queen being big with child sat in a balcony he followed the host to the church of st clara where high mass was celebrated to a glorious concert of music they are as ugly a little pair as one can see she a pale girl marked with the smallpox and he a brown boy with a thin face a huge nose and as ungain as possible  we are settled here with mr mann in a charming apartment the river arno runs under our windows which we can fish out of the sky is so serene and the air so temperate that one continues in the open air all night long in a slight nightgown without any danger and the marble bridge is the resort of every body where they hear music eat iced fruits and sup by moonlight though as yet the season being extremely backward every where these amusements are not begun you see we are now coming northward again though in no great haste the venetian and milanese territories and either germany or the south of france according to the turn the war may take are all that remain for us that we have not yet seen as to loretto and that part of italy we have given over all thoughts of it   letter xxiv mr west to mr gray bondstreet june      0 i lived at the temple till i was sick of it i have just left it and find myself as much a lawyer as i was when i was in it it is certain at least i may study the law here as well as i could there my being in chambers did not signify to me a pinch of snuff they tell me my father was a lawyer and as you know eminent in the profession and such a circumstance must be of advantage to me my uncle too makes some figure in westminster hall and there is another advantage then my grandfathers name would get me many friends is it not strange that a young fellow that might enter the world with so many advantages will not know his own interest etc etc  what shall i say in answer to all this for money i neither dote upon it nor despise it it is a necessary stuff enough for ambition i do not want that neither but it is not to sit upon a bench in short is it not a disagreeable thing to force ones inclination especially when ones young not to mention that one ought to have the strength of a hercules to go through our common law which i am afraid i have not well but then say they if one profession does not suit you you may choose another more to your inclination now i protest i do not yet know my own inclination and i believe if that was to be my direction i should never fix at all there is no going by a weathercock  i could say much more upon this subject but there is no talking teteatete cross the alps o the folly of young men that never know their own interest they never grow wise till they are ruined and then nobody pities them nor helps them dear gray consider me in the condition of one that has lived these two years without any person that he can speak freely to i know it is very seldom that people trouble themselves with the sentiments of those they converse with so they can chat about trifles they never care whether your heart aches or no are you one of these i think not but what right have i to ask you this question have we known one another enough that i should expect or demand sincerity from you yes gray i hope we have and i have not quite such a mean opinion of myself as to think i do not deserve it  but signor is it not time for me to ask something about your further intentions abroad where do you propose going next an in apuliam nam illo si adveneris tanquam ulysses cognosces tuorum neminem vale so cicero prophesies in the end of one of his letters this letter written apparently in much agitation of mind which mr west endeavors to conceal by an unusual carelessness of manner is chiefly inserted to introduce the answer to it which appears to me to be replete with delicate feeling manly sense and epistolary ease if the reader should think as highly of it as i do let me remind him that the writer was not now quite four and twenty years old  and there i end  yours etc   letter xxv mr gray to mr west florence july       0 you do yourself and me justice in imagining that you merit and that i am capable of sincerity i have not a thought or even a weakness i desire to conceal from you and consequently on my side deserve to be treated with the same openness of heart my vanity perhaps might make me more reserved toward you if you were one of the heroic race superior to all human failings but as mutual wants are the ties of general society so are mutual weaknesses of private friendships supposing them mixed with some proportion of good qualities for where one may not sometimes blame one does not much care ever to praise all this has the air of an introduction designed to soften a very harsh reproof that is to follow but it is no such matter i only meant to ask why did you change your lodging was the air bad or the situation melancholy if so you are quite in the right only is it not putting yourself a little out of the way of a people with whom it seems necessary to keep up some sort of intercourse and conversation though but little for your pleasure or entertainment yet there are i believe such among them as might give you both at least for your information in that study which when i left you you thought of applying to for that there is a certain study necessary to be followed if we mean to be of any use in the world i take for granted disagreeable enough as most necessities are but i am afraid unavoidable into how many branches these studies are divided in england every body knows and between that which you and i had pitched upon and the other two it was impossible to balance long examples show one that it is not absolutely necessary to be a blockhead to succeed in this profession the labor is long and the elements dry and unentertaining nor was ever any body especially those that afterward made a figure in it amused or even not disgusted in the beginning yet upon a further acquaintance there is surely matter for curiosity and reflection it is strange if among all that huge mass of words there be not somewhat intermixed for thought laws have been the result of long deliberation and that not of dull men but the contrary and have so close a connection with history nay with philosophy itself that they must partake a little of what they are related to so nearly besides tell me have you ever made the attempt was not you frighted merely with the distant prospect had the gothic character and bulkiness of those volumes a tenth part of which perhaps it will be no further necessary to consult than as one does a dictionary no ill effect upon your eye are you sure if coke had been printed by elzevir and bound in twenty neat pocket volumes instead of one folio you should never have taken him up for an hour as you would a tully or drank your tea over him i know how great an obstacle ill spirits are to resolution do you really think if you rid ten miles every morning in a weeks time you should not entertain much stronger hopes of the chancellorship and think it a much more probable thing than you do at present the advantages you mention are not nothing our inclinations are more than we imagine in our own power reason and resolution determine them and support under many difficulties to me there hardly appears to be any medium between a public life and a private one he who prefers the first must put himself in a way of being serviceable to the rest of mankind if he has a mind to be of any consequence among them nay he must not refuse being in a certain degree even dependent upon some men who already are so if he has the good fortune to light on such as will make no ill use of his humility there is no shame in this if not his ambition ought to give place to a reasonable pride and he should apply to the cultivation of his own mind those abilities which he has not been permitted to use for others service such a private happiness supposing a small competence of fortune is almost always in ones power and the proper enjoyment of age as the other is the employment of youth you are yet young have some advantages and opportunities and an undoubted capacity which you have never yet put to the trial set apart a few hours see how the first year will agree with you at the end of it you are still the master if you change your mind you will only have got the knowledge of a little somewhat that can do no hurt or give you cause of repentance if your inclination be not fixed upon any thing else it is a symptom that you are not absolutely determined against this and warns you not to mistake mere indolence for inability i am sensible there is nothing stronger against what i would persuade you to than my own practice which may make you imagine i think not as i speak alas it is not so but i do not act what i think and i had rather be the object of your pity than that you should be that of mine and be assured the advantage i may receive from it does not diminish my concern in hearing you want somebody to converse with freely whose advice might be of more weight and always at hand we have some time since come to the southern period of our voyages we spent about nine days at naples it is the largest and most populous city as its environs are the most deliciously fertile country of all italy we sailed in the bay of baiae sweated in the solfatara and died in the grotto del cane as all strangers do saw the corpus christi procession and the king and the queen and the city underground which is a wonder i reserve to tell you of another time and so returned to rome for another fortnight left it left rome and came hither for the summer you have seen the reader will find this in dodsleys miscellany and also amongst mr walpoles fugitive pieces an epistle to mr ashton that seems to me full of spirit and thought and a good deal of poetic fire i would know your opinion now i talk of verses mr walpole and i have frequently wondered you should never mention a certain imitation of spencer published last year by a gilbert west esquire this poem on the abuse of traveling is also in dodsleys miscellany namesake of yours with which we are all enraptured and enmarvailed   letter xxvi mr gray to his mother florence aug    ns    0 it is some time since i have had the pleasure of writing to you having been upon a little excursion cross the mountains to bologna we set out from hence at sunset passed the apennines by moonlight traveling incessantly till we came to bologna at four in the afternoon next day there we spent a week agreeably enough and returned as we came the day before yesterday arrived the news of a pope and i have the mortification of being within four days journey of rome and not seeing his coronation the heats being violent and the infectious air now at its height we had an instance the other day that it is not only fancy two country fellows strong men and used to the country about rome having occasion to come from thence hither and traveling on foot as common with them one died suddenly on the road the other got hither but extremely weak and in a manner stupid he was carried to the hospital but died in two days so between fear and laziness we remain here and must be satisfied with the accounts other people give us of the matter the new pope is called benedict xiv being created cardinal by benedict xiii the last pope but one his name is lambertini a noble bolognese and archbishop of that city when i was first there i remember to have seen him two or three times he is a short fat man about sixtyfive years of age of a hearty merry countenance and likely to live some years he bears a good character for generosity affability and other virtues and they say wants neither knowledge nor capacity the worst side of him is that he has a nephew or two besides a certain young favorite called melara who is said to have had for some time the arbitrary disposal of his purse and family he is reported to have made a little speech to the cardinals in the conclave while they were undetermined about an election as follows most eminent lords here are three bolognese of different characters but all equally proper for the popedom if it be your pleasures to pitch upon a saint there is cardinal gotti if upon a politician there is aldrovandi if upon a booby here am i the italian is much more expressive and indeed not to be translated wherefore if you meet with any body that understands it you may show them what he said in the language he spoke it eminssimi sigri ci siamo tree diversi si ma tutti idonei al papato se vi piace un santo c e lgotti se volete una testa scaltra e politica c e laldrovande se un coglione eccomi cardinal coscia is restored to his liberty and it is said will be to all his benefices corsini the late popes nephew as he has had no hand in this election it is hoped will be called to account for all his villainous practices the pretender they say has resigned all his pretensions to his eldest boy and will accept of the grand chancellorship which is thirty thousand crowns a year the pension he has at present is only twenty thousand i do not affirm the truth of this last article because if he does it is necessary he should take the ecclesiastical habit and it will sound mighty odd to be called his majesty the chancellor  so ends my gazette   letter xxvii mr gray to mr west florence sept    ns    0 what i send you now as long as it is is but a piece of a poem it has the advantage of all fragments to need neither introduction nor conclusion besides if you do not like it it is but imagining that which went before and came after to be infinitely better look in sandys travels for the history of monte barbaro and monte nuovo to save the reader trouble i here insert the passage referred to  west of ciceros villa stands the eminent gaurus a stony and desolate mountain in which there are diverse obscure caverns choked almost with earth where many have consumed much fruitless industry in searching for treasure the famous lucrine lake extended formerly from avernus to the aforesaid gaurus but is now no other than a little sedgy plash choked up by the horrible and astonishing eruption of the new mountain whereof as often as i think i am easy to credit whatsoever is wonderful for who here knows not or who elsewhere will believe that a mountain should arise partly out of a lake and partly out of the sea in one day and a night unto such a height as to contend in altitude with the high mountains adjoining in the year of our lord      on the   th of september when for certain days foregoing the country hereabout was so vexed with perpetual earthquakes as no one house was left so entire as not to expect an immediate ruin after that the sea had retired two hundred paces from the shore leaving abundance of fish and springs of fresh water rising in the bottom this mountain visibly ascended about the second hour of the night with an hideous roaring horribly vomiting stones and such store of cinders as overwhelmed all the building thereabout and the salubrious baths of tripergula for so many ages celebrated consumed the vines to ashes killing birds and beasts the fearful inhabitants of puzzol flying through the dark with their wives and children naked defiled crying out and detesting their calamities manifold mischiefs have they suffered by the barbarous yet none like this which nature inflicted  this new mountain when newly raised had a number of issues at some of them smoking and sometimes flaming at others disgorging rivulets of hot waters keeping within a terrible rumbling and many miserably perished that ventured to descend into the hollowness above but that hollow on the top is at present an orchard and the mountain throughout is bereft of his terrors sandys

inserted in letter xxi set out from rome in a letter of recommendation to you but possibly fell into the enemies hands for i never heard of its arrival it is a little impertinent to inquire after its welfare but you that are a father will excuse a parents foolish fondness last post i received a very diminutive letter it made excuses for its unentertainingness very little to the purpose since it assured me very strongly of your esteem which is to me the thing all the rest appear but as the petits agremens the garnishing of the dish p bougeant in his langage des betes fancies that your birds who continually repeat the same note say only in plain terms je vous aim ma chere ma chere je vous aim and that those of greater genius indeed with various trills run divisions upon the subject but that the fond from whence it all proceeds is toujours je vous aim now you may as you find yourself dull or in humor either take me for a chaffinch or nightingale sing your plain song or show your skill in music but in the bottom let there be toujours toujours de lamitie  as to what you call my serious letter be assured that your future state is to me entirely indifferent do not be angry but hear me i mean with respect to myself for whether you be at the top of fame or entirely unknown to mankind at the council table or at dicks coffeehouse sick and simple or well and wife whatever alteration mere accident works in you supposing it utterly impossible for it to make any change in your sincerity and honesty since these are conditions sine qua non i do not see any likelihood of my not being yours ever   letter xxviii mr gray to his father florence oct      0 the beginning of next spring is the time determined for our return at furthest possibly it may be before that time how the interim will be employed or what route we shall take is not so certain if we remain friends with france upon leaving this country we shall cross over to venice and so return through the cities north of the po to genoa from thence take a felucca to marseilles and come back through paris if the contrary fall out which seems not unlikely we must make the milanese and those parts of italy in our way to venice from thence pass through the tirol into germany and come home by the low countries as for florence it has been gayer than ordinary for this last month being one round of balls and entertainments occasioned by the arrival of a great milanese lady for the only thing the italians shine in is their reception of strangers at such times every thing is magnificence the more remarkable as in their ordinary course of life they are parsimonious even to a degree of nastiness i saw in one of the vastest palaces in rome that of prince pamfilio the apartment which he himself inhabited a bed that most servants in england would disdain to lie in and furniture much like that of a soph at cambridge for convenience and neatness this man is worth  0000 l sterling a year as for eating there are not two cardinals in rome that allow more than six paoli which is three shillings a day for the expense of their table and you may imagine they are still less extravagant here than there but when they receive a visit from any friend their houses and persons are set out to the greatest advantage and appear in all their splendor it is indeed from a motive of vanity and with the hopes of having it repaid them with interest whenever they have occasion to return the visit i call visits going from one city of italy to another for it is not so among acquaintance of the same place on common occasions the new pope has retrenched the charges of his own table to a sequin  0 s a meal the applause which all he says and does meets with is enough to encourage him really to deserve fame they say he is an able and honest man he is reckoned a wit too the other day when the senator of rome came to wait upon him at the first compliments he made him the pope pulled off his cap his master of the ceremonies who stood by his side touched him softly as to warn him that such a condescension was too great in him and out of all manner of rule upon which he turned to him and said oh i cry you mercy good master it is true i am but a novice of a pope i have not yet so much as learned ill manners    letter xxix mr gray to his father florence between the date of this and the foregoing letter the reader will perceive an interval of full three months as mr gray saw no new places during this period his letters were chiefly of news and common occurrences and are therefore omitted jan         we still continue constant at florence at present one of the dullest cities in italy though it is the middle of the carnival there are no public diversions nor is masquerading permitted as yet the emperors obsequies are to be celebrated publicly the   th of this month and after that it is imagined every thing will go on in its usual course in the mean time to employ the minds of the populace the government has thought fit to bring into the city in a solemn manner and at a great expense a famous statue of the virgin called the madonna dellimpruneta from the place of her residence which is upon a mountain seven miles off it never has been practiced but at times of public calamity and was done at present to avert the ill effects of a late great inundation which it was feared might cause some epidemical distemper it was introduced a fortnight ago in procession attended by the council of regency the senate the nobility and all the religious orders on foot and bareheaded and so carried to the great church where it was frequented by an infinite concourse of people from all the country round among the rest i paid my devotions almost every day and saw numbers of people possessed with the devil who were brought to be exorcised it was indeed in the evening and the churchdoors were always shut before the ceremonies were finished so that i could not be eyewitness of the event but that they were all cured is certain for one never heard any more of them the next morning i am tonight just returned from seeing our lady make her exit with the same solemnities she entered the show had a finer effect than before for it was dark and every body even those of the mob that could afford it bore a whitewax flambeau i believe there were at least five thousand of them and the march was near three hours in passing before the window the subject of all this devotion is supposed to be a large tile with a rude figure in basrelief upon it i say supposed because since the time it was found for it was found in the earth in ploughing only two people have seen it the one was by goodluck a saint the other was struck blind for his presumption ever since she has been covered with seven veils nevertheless those who approach her tabernacle cast their eyes down for fear they should spy her through all her veils such is the history as i had it from the lady of the house where i stood to see her pass with many other circumstances all which she firmly believes and ten thousand beside  we shall go to venice in about six weeks or sooner a number of german troops are upon their march into this state in case the king of naples thinks proper to attack it it is certain he has asked the popes leave for his troops to pass through his country the tuscans in general are much discontented and foolish enough to wish for a spanish government or any rather than this    letter xxx mr gray to mr west florence april         i know not what degree of satisfaction it will give you to be told that we shall set out from hence the   th of this month and not stop above a fortnight at any place in our way this i feel that you are the principal pleasure i have to hope for in my own country try at least to make me imagine myself not indifferent to you for i must own i have the vanity of desiring to be esteemed by somebody and would choose that somebody should be one whom i esteem as much as i do you as i am recommending myself to your love methinks i ought to send you my picture for i am no more what i was some circumstances excepted which i hope i need not particularize to you you must add then to your former idea two years of age a reasonable quantity of dullness a great deal of silence and something that rather resembles than is thinking a confused notion of many strange and fine things that have swum before my eyes for some time a want of love for general society indeed an inability to it on the good side you may add a sensibility for what others feel and indulgence for their faults or weaknesses a love of truth and detestation of every thing else then you are to deduct a little impertinence a little laughter a great deal of pride and some spirits these are all the alterations i know of you perhaps may find more think not that i have been obliged for this reformation of manners to reason or reflection but to a severer schoolmistress experience one has little merit in learning her lessons for one cannot well help it but they are more useful than others and imprint themselves in the very heart i find i have been haranguing in the style of the son of sirach so shall finish here and tell you that our route is settled as follows first to bologna for a few days to hear the viscontina sing next to reggio where is a fair now you must know a fair here is not a place where one eats gingerbread or rides upon hobbyhorses here are no musical clocks nor tall leicestershire women one has nothing but masquing gaming and singing if you love operas there will be the most splendid in italy four tiptop voices a new theater the duke and duchess in all their pomps and vanities does not this sound magnificent yet is the city of reggio but one step above old brentford well next to venice by the   th of may there to see the old doge wed the adriatic whore then to verona so to milan so to marseilles so to lions so to paris so to west etc in saecula saeculorum amen  eleven months at different times have i passed at florence and yet god help me know not either people or language yet the place and the charming prospects demand a poetical farewell and here it is  oh faesulae amaena frigoribus juga nec nimium spirantibus auris alma quibus tusci pallas decus apennini esse dedit glaucaque sua canescere sylva non ego vos posthac arni de valle videbo porticibus circum and candenti cincta corona villarum long nitido confurgere dorso antiquamve aedem and veteres praeferre cupressus mirabor tectisque super pendentia tecta   i will send you too a pretty little sonnet of a sigr abbate buondelmonte with my imitation of it spesso amor sotto la forma damista ride e sasconde poi si mischia e si confonde con lo sdegno e col rancor in pietade ei si trasforma par trastullo e par dispetto ma nel suo diverso aspetto sempregli e listesso amor lusit amicitiae interdum velatus amictu et been composita vest fefellit amor mox irae assumsit cultus faciemque minantem inque odium versus versus and in lacrymas ludentem fuge nec lacrymanti aut creed furenti idem est dissimili semper in ore deus   here comes a letter from you  i must defer giving my opinion of some part of a tragedy under that title which mr west had begun but i do not find amongst mr grays papers either the sketch itself or mr grays free critique upon it which he here mentions pausanias till i can see the whole and only have said what i did in obedience to your commands i have spoken with such freedom on this head that it seems but just you should have your revenge and therefore i send you the beginning not of an epic poem but of the beginning of the first book of a didactic poem de principiis cogitandi the fragment which he now sent contained the first    lines the reader will find a further account of his design and all that he finished of the poem in a subsequent section a metaphysic one poems and metaphysics say you with your spectacles on are inconsistent things a metaphysical poem is a contradiction in terms it is true but i will go on it is latin too to increase the absurdity it will i suppose put you in mind of the man who wrote a treatise of canon law in hexameters pray help me to the description of a mixed mode and a little episode about space   mr walpole and mr gray set out from florence at the time specified in the foregoing letter when mr gray left venice which he did the middle of july following he returned home through padua verona milan turin and lions from all which places he writ either to his father or mother with great punctuality but merely to inform them of his health and safety about which as might be expected they were now very anxious as he traveled with only a laquais du voyage these letters do not even mention that he went out of his way to make a second visit to the grande chartreuse he was at turin the   th of august and began to cross the alps the next day on the   th he reached lions therefore it must have been between these two dates that he made this visit and there wrote in the album of the fathers the following alcaic we saw in the  th and   th letters how much mr gray was struck with the awful scenery which surrounds the chartreuse at a time his mind must have been in a far more tranquil state than when he wrote this excellent ode it is marked i think with all the finest touches of his melancholy muse and flows with such an originality of expression that one can hardly lament he did not honor his own language by making it the vehicle of this noble imagery and pathetic sentiment ode with which i conclude this section  ode oh tu severi religio loci quocunque gaudes nomine non leve nativa nam certe fluenta numen habet veteresque sylvas praesentiorem and conspicimus deum per invias rupes fera per juga clivosque praeruptos sonantes inter aquas nemorumque noctem quam si repostus sub trabe citrea fulgeret auro and phidiaca manu salve vocanti rite fesso et da placidam juveni quietem quod si invidendis sedibus and frui fortuna sacra lege silentii vetat volentem me resorbens in medios violenta fluctus saltem remoto des pater angulo horas senectae ducere liberas tutumque vulgari tumultu surripias hominumque curis end of the second section section the third when mr gray returned from abroad he found his fathers constitution almost entirely worn out by the very severe attacks of the gout to which he had been for many years subject and indeed the next return of that distemper was fatal to him he came to town about the  st of september      his father died the  th of november following at the age of sixtyfive this happened about two months after his son reached london  it has been before observed that mr philip gray was of a reserved and indolent temper he was also morose unsocial and obstinate defects which if not inherent in his disposition might probably arise from his bodily complaints his indolence had led him to neglect the business of his business was that which at the time was called a moneyscrivener and it may not be amiss to mention for the singularity of the thing that miltons father was of the same profession but he also had music in his soul and was esteemed a considerable master in that science some of his compositions are extant in old wilbys set of airs and in ravenscrofts psalms the great poet alludes finely both to the musical genius and the trade of his father in those beautiful hexameters ad patrem which are inserted amongst his latin poems his profession his obstinacy to build a country house at wanstead without acquainting either his wife or son with the design to which he knew they would be very averse till it was executed this building which he undertook late in life was attended with very considerable expense which might almost be called so much money thrown away since after his death the house was obliged to be sold for two thousand pounds less than its original cost mr gray therefore at this time found his patrimony so small that it would by no means enable him to prosecute the study of the law without his becoming burdensome to his mother and aunt these two sisters had for many years carried on they kept a kind of india warehouse on cornhill under the joint names of gray and antrobus a trade separate from that of mrs grays husband by which having acquired what would support them decently for the rest of their lives they left off business soon after his death and retired to stoke near windsor to the house of their other sister mrs rogers lately become the widow of a clergyman of that name both of them wished mr gray to follow the profession for which he had been originally intended and would undoubtedly have contributed all in their power to enable him to do it with ease and convenience he on his part though he had taken his resolution of declining it was too delicate to hurt two persons for whom he had so tender an affection by peremptorily declaring his real intentions and therefore changed or pretended to change the line of that study and accordingly the latter end of the subsequent year went to cambridge to take his bachelors degree in civil law  but the narrowness of his circumstances was not the only thing that distressed him at this period he had as we have seen lost the friendship of mr walpole abroad he had also lost much time in his travels a loss which application could not easily retrieve when so severe and laborious a study as that of the common law was to be the object of it and he well knew that whatever improvement he might have made in this interval either in taste or science such improvement would stand him in little stead with regard to his present situation and exigencies this was not all his other friend mr west he found on his return oppressed by sickness and a load of family misfortunes which were i fully acquainted with them it would not be my inclination here to dwell upon these the sympathizing heart of mr gray made his own he did all in his power for he was now with him in london to soothe the sorrows of his friend and to try to alleviate them by every office of the purest and most perfect affection but his cares were vain the distresses of mr wests mind had already too far affected a body from the first weak and delicate his health declined daily and therefore he left town in march      and for the benefit of the air went to david mitchells esquire at popes near hatfield hertfordshire at whose house he died the  st of june following  it is from this place and from the former date that this third series of letters commences  letter i this letter is inserted as introductory only to the answer which follows  mr west to mr gray i write to make you write for i have not much to tell you i have recovered no spirits as yet but as i am not displeased with my company i sit purring by the fireside in my armchair with no small satisfaction i read too sometimes and have begun tacitus but have not yet read enough to judge of him only his pannonian sedition in the first book of his annals which is just as far as i have got seemed to me a little tedious i have no more to say but to desire you will write letters of a handsome length and always answer me within a reasonable space of time which i leave to your discretion  popes march         ps the new dunciad quen pensez vous     letter ii mr gray to mr west i trust to the country and that easy indolence you say you enjoy there to restore you your health and spirits and doubt not but when the sun grows warm enough to tempt you from your fireside you will like all other things be the better for his influence he is my old friend and an excellent nurse i assure you had it not been for him life had often been to me intolerable pray do not imagine that tacitus of all authors in the world can be tedious an annalist you know is by no means master of his subject and i think one may venture to say that if those pannonian affairs are tedious in his hands in anothers they would have been insupportable however fear not they will soon be over and he will make ample amends a man who could join the brilliant of wit and concise sententiousness peculiar to that age with the truth and gravity of better times and the deep reflection and good sense of the best moderns cannot choose but have something to strike you yet what i admire in him above all this is his detestation of tyranny and the high spirit of liberty that every now and then breaks out as it were whether he would or no i remember a sentence in his agricola that concise as it is i always admired for saying much in a little compass he speaks of domitian who upon seeing the last will of that general where he had made him coheir with his wife and daughter satis constabat laetatum eum velut honor judicioque tam caeca and corrupta mens assiduis adulationibus erat ut nesciret a bono patre non scribi haeredem nisi malum principem  as to the dunciad it is greatly admired the genii of operas and schools with their attendants the pleas of the virtuosos and florists and the yawn of dullness in the end are as fine as any thing he has written the metaphysicians part is to me the worst and here and there a few illexpressed lines and some hardly intelligible  i take the liberty of sending you a long speech of agrippina much too long but i could be glad you would retrench it aceronia you may remember had been giving quiet counsels i fancy if it ever be finished it will be in the nature of not lees bedlam tragedy which had twentyfive acts and some odd scenes   the speech herewith sent to mr west was the concluding one of the first scene of a tragedy which i believe was begun the preceding winter the britannicus of m racine i know was one of mr grays most favorite plays and the admirable manner in which i have heard him say that he saw it represented at paris seems to have led him to choose the death of agrippina for this his first and only effort in the drama the execution of it also as far as it goes is so very much in racines taste that i suspect if that great poet had been born an englishman he would have written precisely in the same style and manner however as there is at present in this nation a general prejudice against declamatory plays i agree with a learned friend who perused the manuscript that this fragment will be little relished by the many yet the admirable strokes of nature and character with which it abounds and the majesty of its diction prevent me from withholding from the few who i expect will relish it so great a curiosity to call it nothing more as part of a tragedy written by mr gray these persons well know that till style and sentiment be a little more regarded mere action and passion will never secure reputation to the author whatever they may do to the actor it is the business of the one to strut and fret his hour upon the stage and if he frets and struts enough he is sure to find his reward in the plaudit of an upper gallery but the other ought to have some regard to the cooler judgment of the closet for i will be bold to say that if shakespeare himself had not written a multitude of passages which please there as much as they do on the stage his reputation would not stand so universally high as it does at present many of these passages to the shame of our theatrical taste are omitted constantly in the representation but i say not this from conviction that the mode of writing which mr gray pursued is the best for dramatic purposes i think myself what i have asserted elsewhere see letters prefixed to elfrida particularly letter ii  that a medium between the french and english taste would be preferable to either and yet this medium if hit with the greatest nicety would fail of success on our theater and that for a very obvious reason actors i speak of the troop collectively must all learn to speak as well as act in order to do justice to such a drama  but let me hasten to give the reader what little insight i can into mr grays plan as i find and select it from two detached papers the title and dramatis personae are as follow agrippina a tragedy  dramatis personae agrippina the empress mother nero the emperor poppaea believed to be in love with otho otho a young man of quality in love with poppaea seneca the emperors preceptor anicetus captain of the guards demetrius the cynic friend to seneca aceronia confidant to agrippina scene the emperors villa at baiae  the argument drawn out by him in these two papers under the idea of a plot and underplot i shall here unite as it will tend to show that the action itself was possessed of sufficient unity  the drama opens with the indignation of agrippina at receiving her sons orders from anicetus to remove from baiae and to have her guard taken from her at this time otho having conveyed poppaea from the house of her husband rufus crispinus brings her to baiae where he means to conceal her among the crowd or if his fraud is discovered to have recourse to the emperors authority but knowing the lawless temper of nero he determines not to have recourse to that expedient but on the utmost necessity in the meantime he commits her to the care of anicetus whom he takes to be his friend and in whose age he thinks he may safely confide nero is not yet come to baiae but seneca whom he sends before him informs agrippina of the accusation concerning rubellius plancus and desires her to clear herself which she does briefly but demands to see her son who on his arrival acquits her of all suspicion and restores her to her honors in the meanwhile anicetus to whose care poppaea had been entrusted by otho contrives the following plot to ruin agrippina he betrays his trust to otho and brings nero as it were by chance to the sight of the beautiful poppaea the emperor is immediately struck with her charms and she by a feigned resistance increases his passion though in reality she is from the first dazzled with the prospect of empire and forgets otho she therefore joins with anicetus in his design of ruining agrippina soon perceiving that it will be for her interest otho hearing that the emperor had seen poppaea is much enraged but not knowing that this interview was obtained through the treachery of anicetus is readily persuaded by him to see agrippina in secret and acquaint her with his fears that her son nero would marry poppaea agrippina to support her own power and to wean the emperor from the love of poppaea gives otho encouragement and promises to support him anicetus secretly introduces nero to hear their discourse who resolves immediately on his mothers death and by anicetuss means to destroy her by drowning a solemn feast in honor of their reconciliation is to be made after which she being to go by sea to bauli the ship is so contrived as to sink or crush her she escapes by accident and returns to baiae in this interval otho has an interview with poppaea and being duped a second time by anicetus and her determines to fly with her into greece by means of a vessel which is to be furnished by anicetus but he pretending to remove poppaea on board in the night conveys her to neros apartment she there encourages and determines nero to banish otho and finish the horrid deed he had attempted on his mother anicetus undertakes to execute his resolves and under pretense of a plot upon the emperors life is sent with a guard to murder agrippina who is still at baiae in imminent fear and irresolute how to conduct herself the account of her death and the emperors horror and fruitless remorse finishes the drama  i refer the reader to the   th and   th books of the annals of tacitus for the facts on which this story is founded by turning to that author he will easily see how far the poet thought it necessary to deviate from the truth of history i shall only further observe that as such a fable could not possibly admit of any good character it is terror only and not pity that could be excited by this tragedy had it been completed yet it was surely capable of exciting this passion in a supreme degree if what the critics tell us be true that crimes which illustrious persons commit affect us from the very circumstance of their rank because we unite with that our fears for the public weal  act i scene i agrippina aceronia agrippina it is well begone your errand is performed speaks as to anicetus entering the message needs no comment tell your master his mother shall obey him say you saw her yielding due reverence to his high command alone unguarded and without a lictor as fits the daughter of germanicus say she retired to antium there to tend her household cares a womans best employment what if you add how she turned pale and trembled you think you spied a tear stand in her eye and would have dropped but that her pride restrained it go you can paint it well twill profit you and please the stripling yet twould dash his joy to hear the spirit of britannicus yet walks on earth at least there are who know without a spell to raise and bid it fire a thousand haughty hearts unused to shake when a boy frowns nor to be lured with smiles to taste of hollow kindness or partake his hospitable board they are aware of the unpledgd bowl they love not aconite  aceronia he is gone and much i hope these walls alone and the mute air are privy to your passion forgive your servants fears who sees the danger which fierce resentment cannot fail to raise in haughty youth and irritated power  agrippina and do thou talk to me to me of danger of haughty youth and irritated power to her that gave it being her that armed this painted jove and taught his novice hand to aim the forked bolt while he stood trembling scared at the sound and dazzled with its brightness it is like thou have forgot when yet a stranger to adoration to the grateful steam of flatterys incense and obsequious vows from voluntary realms a puny boy decked with no other luster than the blood of agrippinas race he lived unknown to fame or fortune happily eyed at distance some edileship ambitious of the power to judge of weights and measures scarcely d ard on expectations strongest wing to soar high as the consulate that empty shade of longforgotten liberty when i oped his young eye to bear the blaze of greatness showed him where empire towerd and bad him strike the noble quarry gods then was the time to shrink from danger fear might then have worn the mask of prudence but a heart like mine a heart that glows with the pure julian fire if bright ambition from her craggy seat display the radiant prize will mount undaunted gain the rough heights and grasp the dangerous honor  aceronia through various life i have pursued your steps have seen your soul and wondered at its daring hence rise my fears nor am i yet to learn how vast the debt of gratitude which nero to such a mother owes the world you gave him suffices not to pay the obligation i well remember too for i was present when in a secret and dead hour of night due sacrifice performed with barbarous rites of muttered charms and solemn invocation you bad the magi call the dreadful powers that read futurity to know the fate impending over your son their answer was if the son reign the mother perishes perish you cried the mother reign the son he reigns the rest is heavens who often has bad even when its will seemed wrote in lines of blood the unthought event disclose a whiter meaning think too how often in weak and sickly minds the sweets of kindness lavishly indulged rankle to gall and benefits too great to be repaid sit heavy on the soul as unrequited wrongs the willing homage of prostrate rome the senates joint applause the riches of the earth the train of pleasures that wait on youth and arbitrary sway these were your gift and with them you bestowed the very power he has to be ungrateful  agrippina thus ever grave and undisturbed reflection pours its cool dictates in the madding ear of rage and thinks to quench the fire it feels not say thou i must be cautious must be silent and tremble at the phantom i have raised carry to him thy timid counsels he perchance may heed em tell him too that one who had such liberal power to give may still with equal power resume that gift and raise a tempest that shall shake her own creation to its original atoms  tell me say this mighty emperor this dreaded hero has he beheld the glittering front of war knows his soft ear the trumpets thrilling voice and outcry of the battle have his limbs sweat under iron harness is he not the silken son of dalliance nursed in ease and pleasures flowery lap  rubellius lives and sylla has his friends though schooled by fear to bow the supple knee and court the times with shows of fair obeisance and a call like mine might serve belike to wake pretensions drowsier than theirs who boast the genuine blood of our imperial house  aceronia did i not wish to check this dangerous passion i might remind my mistress that her nod can rouse eight hardy legions wont to stem with stubborn nerves the tide and face the rigor of bleak germanias snows four not less brave that in armenia quell the parthian force under the warlike corbulo by you marked for their leader these by ties confirmed of old respect and gratitude are yours surely the masians too and those of egypt have not forgot your sire the eye of rome and the praetorian camp have long revered with customd awe the daughter sister wife and mother of their caesars  agrippina ha by juno it bears a noble semblance on this base my great revenge shall rise or say we sound the trump of liberty there will not want even in the servile senate ears to own her spiritstirring voice soranus there and cassius vetus too and thrasea minds of the antique cast rough stubborn souls that struggle with the yoke how shall the spark unquenchable that glows within their breasts blaze into freedom when the idle herd slaves from the womb created but to stare and bellow in the circus yet will start and shake em at the name of liberty stung by a senseless word a vain tradition as there were magic in it wrinkled beldams teach it their grandchildren as somewhat rare that anciently appeared but when extends beyond their chronicle  oh it is a cause to arm the hand of childhood and rebrace the slackened sinews of timewearied age yes we may meet ungrateful boy we may again the buried genius of old rome shall from the dust uprear his reverend head roused by the shout of millions there before his high tribunal thou and i appear let majesty sit on thy awful brow and lighten from thy eye around thee call the gilded swarm that wantons in the sunshine of thy full favor seneca be there in gorgeous phrase of labored eloquence to dress thy plea and burrhus strengthen it with his plain soldiers oath and honest seeming against thee liberty and agrippina the world the prize and fair befall the victors but soft why do i waste the fruitless hours in threats unexecuted haste thee fly these hated walls that seem to mock my shame and cast me forth in duty to their lord  aceronia it is time we go the sun is high advanced and ere midday nero will come to baiae  agrippina my thought aches at him not the basilisk more deadly to the sight than is to me the cool injurious eye of frozen kindness i will not meet its poison let him feel before he sees me  aceronia why then stays my sovereign where he so soon may   agrippina yes i will be gone but not to antium  all shall be confessed whatever the frivolous tongue of giddy fame has spread among the crowd things that but whispered have arched the hearers brow and riveted his eyes in fearful ecstasy no matter what sot be strange and dreadful

death ye unavailing horrors fruitless crimes if from the realms of night my voice ye hear in lieu of penitence and vain remorse accept my vengeance though by me ye bled he was the cause my love my fears for him dried the soft springs of pity in my heart and froze them up with deadly cruelty yet if your injured shades demand my fate if murder cries for murder blood for blood let me not fall alone but crush his pride and sink the traitor in his mothers ruin exeunt scene ii otho poppaea otho thus far we are safe thanks to the rosy queen of amorous thefts and had her wanton son lent us his wings we could not have beguiled with more elusive speed the dazzled sight of wakeful jealousy be gay securely dispell my fair with smiles the timorous cloud that hangs on thy clear brow so helen looked so her white neck reclined so was she borne by the young trojan to his gilded bark with fond reluctance yielding modesty and often reverted eye as if she knew not whether she feared or wished to be pursued  letter iii mr west to mr gray popes april        i own in general i think agrippinas speech too long the editor has obviated this objection not by retrenching but by putting part of it into the mouth of aceronia and by breaking it in a few other places originally it was one continued speech from the line thus ever grave and undisturbed reflection to the end of the scene which was undoubtedly too long for the lungs of any actress  but how to retrench it i know not but i have something else to say and that is in relation to the style which appears to me too antiquated racine was of another opinion he no where gives you the phrases of ronsard his language is the language of the times and that of the purest sort so that his french is reckoned a standard i will not decide what style is fit for our english stage but i should rather choose one that bordered upon cato than upon shakespeare one may imitate if one can shakespeares manner his surprising strokes of true nature his expressive force in painting characters and all his other beauties preserving at the same time our own language were shakespeare alive now he would write a different style from what he did these are my sentiments upon these matters perhaps i am wrong for i am neither a tarpa nor am i quite an aristarchus you see i write freely both of you and shakespeare but it is as good as writing not freely where you know it is acceptable  i have been tormented within this week with a most violent cough for when once it sets up its note it will go on cough after cough shaking and tearing me for half an hour together and then it leaves me in a great sweat as much fatigued as if i had been laboring at the plough all this description of my cough in prose is only to introduce another description of it in verse perhaps not worth your perusal but it is very short and besides has this remarkable in it that it was the production of four oclock in the morning while i lay in my bed tossing and coughing and all unable to sleep  ante omnes morbos importunissima tussis qua durare datur traxitque sub ilia vires dura etenim versans imo sub pectore regna perpetuo exercet teneras luctamine costas oraque distorquet vocemque immutat anhelam nec cessare locus sed saevo concita motu molle domat latus and corpus labor omne fatigat unde molesta dies noctemque insomnia turbant nec tua si mecum comes hic jucundus adesses verba juvare queant aut hunc lenire dolorem sufficiant tua vox dulcis nec vultus amatus   do not mistake me i do not condemn tacitus i was then inclined to find him tedious the german sedition sufficiently made up for it and the speech of germanicus by which he reclaims his soldiers is quite masterly your new dunciad i have no conception of i shall be too late for our dinner if i write any more  yours   letter iv mr gray to mr west london april thursday you are the first who ever made a muse of a cough to me it seems a much more easy task to versify in ones sleep that indeed you were of old famous for i suppose at eaton school  than for want of it not the wakeful nightingale when she had a cough ever sung so sweetly i give you thanks for your warble and wish you could sing yourself to rest these wicked remains of your illness will sure give way to warm weather and gentle exercise which i hope you will not omit as the season advances whatever low spirits and indolence the effect of them may advise to the contrary i pray you add five steps to your walk daily for my sake by the help of which in a months time i propose to set you on horseback  i talked of the dunciad as concluding you had seen it if you have not do you choose i should get and send it to you i have myself upon your recommendation been reading joseph andrews the incidents are ill laid and without invention but the characters have a great deal of nature which always pleases even in her lowest shapes parson adams is perfectly well so is mrs slipslop and the story of wilson and throughout he shows himself well read in stagecoaches country squires inns and inns of court his reflections upon high people and low people and misses and masters are very good however the exaltedness of some minds or rather as i shrewdly suspect their insipidity and want of feeling or observation may make them insensible to these light things i mean such as characterize and paint nature yet surely they are as weighty and much more useful than your grave discourses upon the mind he seems here to glance at hutchinson the disciple of shaftsbury of whom he had little better opinion than of his master  the passions and what not now as the paradisaical pleasures whimsically put  but what shall we say of the present taste of the french when a writer whom mr gray so justly esteemed as m marivaux is now held in such contempt that marivauder is a fashionable phrase amongst them and signifies neither more nor less than our own fashionable phrase of prosing as to crebillon twas his egaremens du coeur and desprit that our author chiefly esteemed he had not i believe at this time published his more licentious pieces of the mahometans consist in playing upon the flute and lying with houris be mine to read eternal new romances of marivaux and crebillon  you are very good in giving yourself the trouble to read and find fault with my long harangues your freedom as you call it has so little need of apologies that i should scarce excuse your treating me any otherwise which whatever compliment it might be to my vanity would be making a very ill one to my understanding as to matter of style i have this to say the language of the age nothing can be more just than this observation and nothing more likely to preserve our poetry from falling into insipidity than pursuing the rules here laid down for supporting the diction of it particularly with respect to the drama is never the language of poetry except among the french whose verse where the thought or image does not support it differs in nothing from prose our poetry on the contrary has a language peculiar to itself to which almost every one that has written has added something by enriching it with foreign idioms and derivatives nay sometimes words of their own composition or invention shakespeare and milton have been great creators this way and no one more licentious than pope or dryden who perpetually borrow expressions from the former let me give you some instances from dryden whom every body reckons a great master of our poetical tongue  full of museful mopeings  unlike the trim of love  a pleasant beverage  a roundelay of love  stood silent in his mood  with knots and knares deformed  his ireful mood  in proud array  his boon was granted  and disarray and shameful rout  wayward but wise  furbished for the field  the foiled dodderd oaks  disherited  smouldring flames  retchless of laws  crones old and ugly  the beldam at his side  the grandamhag  villanize his fathers fame  but they are infinite and our language not being a settled thing like the french has an undoubted right to words of an hundred years old provided antiquity have not rendered them unintelligible in truth shakespeares language is one of his principal beauties and he has no less advantage over your addisons and rows in this than in those other great excellencies you mention every word in him is a picture pray put me the following lines into the tongue of our modern dramatics but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass i that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtailed of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinished sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up  and what follows to me they appear untranslatable and if this be the case our language is greatly degenerated however the affectation of imitating shakespeare may doubtless be carried too far and is no sort of excuse for sentiments illsuited or speeches illtimed which i believe is a little the case with me i guess the most faulty expressions may be these  silken son of dalliance  drowsier pretensions  wrinkled beldams  arched the hearers brow and riveted his eyes in fearful ecstasy these are easily altered or omitted and indeed if the thoughts be wrong or superfluous there is nothing easier than to leave out the whole the first ten or twelve lines are i believe the best the lines which he means here are from  thus ever grave and undisturbed reflection  to rubellius lives for the part of the scene which he sent in his former letter began there  and as for the rest i was betrayed into a good deal of it by tacitus only what he has said in five words i imagine i have said in fifty lines such is the misfortune of imitating the inimitable now if you are of my opinion una litura may do the business better than a dozen and you need not fear unravelling my web i am a sort of spider and have little else to do but spin it over again or creep to some other place and spin there alas for one who has nothing to do but amuse himself i believe my amusements are as little amusing as most folks but no matter it makes the hours pass and is better than   adieu  letter v mr west to mr gray to begin with the conclusion of your letter which is greek i desire that you will quarrel no more with your manner of passing your time in my opinion it is irreproachable especially as it produces such excellent fruit and if i like a saucy bird must be pecking at it you ought to consider that it is because i like it no una litura i beg you no unravelling of your web dear sir only pursue it a little further and then one shall be able to judge of it a little better you know the crisis of a play is in the first act its damnation or salvation wholly rests there but till that first act is over every body suspends his vote so how do you think i can form as yet any just idea of the speeches in regard to their length or shortness the connection and symmetry of such little parts with one another must naturally escape me as not having the plan of the whole in my head neither can i decide about the thoughts whether they are wrong or superfluous they may have some future tendency which i perceive not the style only was free to me and there i find we are pretty much of the same sentiment for you say the affectation of imitating shakespeare may doubtless be carried too far i say as much and no more for old words we know are old gold provided they are well chosen whatever ennius was i do not consider shakespeare as a dunghill in the least on the contrary he is a mine of ancient ore where all our great modern poets have found their advantage i do not know how it is but his old expressions shakespeares energy does not arise so much from these old expressions most of which were not old in his time but from his artificial management of them this artifice in the great poet is developed with much exactness by dr hurd in his excellent note on this passage in horaces ep ad pisones dixeris egregie notum si callida verbum reddiderit junctura novum see hurds horace vol   st ed   th p    have more energy in them than ours and are even more adapted to poetry certainly where they are judiciously and sparingly inserted they add a certain grace to the composition in the same manner as poussin gave a beauty to his pictures by his knowledge in the ancient proportions but should he or any other painter carry the imitation too far and neglect that best of models nature i am afraid it would prove a very flat performance to finish this long criticism i have this further notion about old words revived is not this a pretty way of finishing i think them of excellent use in tales they add a certain drollery to the comic and a romantic gravity to the serious which are both charming in their kind and this way of charming dryden understood very well one need only read milton to acknowledge the dignity they give the epic but now comes my opinion that they ought to be used in tragedy more sparingly than in most kinds of poetry tragedy is designed for public representation and what is designed for that should be certainly most intelligible i believe half the audience that come to shakespeares plays do not understand the half of what they hear  but finissons enfin  yet one word more  you think the ten or twelve first lines the best now i am for the fourteen last he means the conclusion of the first scene  but here and throughout his criticism on old words he is not so consistent as his correspondent for he here insists that all antientry should be struck out and in a former passage he admits it may be used sparingly  add that they contain not one word of antientry  i rejoice you found amusement in joseph andrews but then i think your conceptions of paradise a little upon the bergerac les lettres du seraphim r a madame la cherubinesse de q what a piece of extravagance would there be  and now you must know that my body continues weak and enervate and for my animal spirits they are in perpetual fluctuation some whole days i have no relish no attention for any thing at other times i revive and am capable of writing a long letter as you see and though i do not write speeches yet i translate them when you understand what speech you will own that it is a bold and perhaps a dull attempt in three words it is prose it is from tacitus it is of germanicus peruse perpend pronounce this speech i omit to print as i have generally avoided to publish mere translations either of mr gray or his friend    letter vi mr gray to mr west london april      i should not have failed to answer your letter immediately but i went out of town for a little while which hindered me its length besides the pleasure naturally accompanying a long letter from you affords me a new one when i think it is a symptom of the recovery of your health and flatter myself that your bodily strength returns in proportion pray do not forget to mention the progress you make continually as to agrippina i begin to be of your opinion and find myself as women are of their children less enamoured of my productions the older they grow he never after awakened her and i believe this was occasioned by the strictures which his friend had made on his dramatic style which though he did not think them well founded as they certainly were not had an effect which mr west we may believe did not intend them to have i remember some years after i was also the innocent cause of his delaying to finish his fine ode on the progress of poetry i told him on reading the part he showed me that though i admired it greatly and thought that it breathed the very spirit of pindar yet i suspected it would by no means hit the public taste finding afterward that he did not proceed in finishing it i often expostulated with him on the subject but he always replied no you have thrown cold water upon it i mention this little anecdote to show how much the opinion of a friend even when it did not convince his judgment affected his inclination she is laid up to sleep till next summer so bid her good night i think you have translated tacitus very justly that is freely and accommodated his thoughts to the turn and genius of our language which though i commend your judgment is no commendation of the english tongue which is too diffuse and daily grows more and more enervate one shall never be more sensible of this than in turning an author like tacitus i have been trying it in some parts of thucydides who has a little resemblance of him in his conciseness and endeavored to do it closely but found it produced mere nonsense if you have any inclination to see what figure tacitus makes in italian i have a tuscan translation of davanzati much esteemed in italy and will send you the same speech you sent me that is if you care for it in the meantime accept of a translation of the  st elegy of the  d book in english rhyme omitted for the reason given in the last note but one propertius    letter vii mr west to mr gray popes may        without any preface i come to your verses which i read over and over with excessive pleasure and which are at least as good as propertius i am only sorry you follow the blunders of broukhusius all whose insertions are nonsense i have some objections to your antiquated words and am also an enemy to alexandrines at least i do not like them in elegy but after all i admire your translation so extremely that i cannot help repeating i long to show you some little errors you are fallen into by following broukhusius i have omitted here a paragraph or two in which different lines of the elegy were quoted because i had previously omitted the translation of it   were i with you now and propertius with your verses lay upon the table between us i could discuss this point in a moment but there is nothing so tiresome as spinning out a criticism in a letter doubts arise and explanations follow till there swells out at least a volume of undigested observations and all because you are not with him whom you want to convince read only the letters between pope and cromwell in proof of this they dispute without end are you aware now that i have an interest all this while in banishing criticism from our correspondence indeed i have for i am going to write down a little ode if it deserves the name for your perusal which i am afraid will hardly stand that test nevertheless i leave you at your full liberty so here it follows  ode dear gray that always in my heart possessest far the better part what mean these sudden blasts that rise and drive the zephyrs from the skies o join with mine thy tuneful lay and invocate the tardy may come fairest nymph resume thy reign bring all the graces in thy train with balmy breath and flowery tread rise from thy soft ambrosial bed where in elysian slumber bound embowring myrtles veil thee round awake in all thy glories dressed recall the zephyrs from the west restore the sun revive the skies at mine and natures call arise great natures self upbraids thy stay and misses her accustomed may see all her works demand thy aid the labors of pomona fade a plaint is heard from every tree each budding flowret calls for thee the birds forget to love and sing with storms alone the forests ring come then with pleasure at thy side diffuse thy vernal spirit wide create wherever thou turnst thy eye peace plenty love and harmony till every being share its part and heaven and earth be glad at heart  letter viii mr gray to mr west london may        i rejoice to see you putting up your prayers to the may she cannot choose but come at such a call it is as light and genteel as herself you bid me find fault i am afraid i cannot however i will try the first stanza if what you say to me in it did not make me think it the best i should call the worst of the five except the fourth line the two next are very picturesque miltonic and musical her bed is so soft and so snug that i long to lie with her but those two lines great nature are my favorites the exclamation of the flowers is a little step too far the last stanza is full as good as the second and third the last line bold but i think not too bold now as to myself and my translation pray do not call names i never saw broukhusius in my life it is scaliger who attempted to range propertius in order who was and still is in sad condition here some criticism on the elegy is omitted for a former reason  you see by what i sent you that i converse as usual with none but the dead they are my old friends and almost make me long to be with them you will not wonder therefore that i who live only in times past am able to tell you no news of the present i have finished the peloponnesian war much to my honor and a tight conflict it was i promise you i have drank and sung with anacreon for the last fortnight and am now feeding sheep with theocritus besides to quit my figure because it is foolish i have run over plinys epistles and martial  not to mention petrarch who by the way is sometimes very tender and natural i must needs tell you three lines in anacreon where the expression seems to me inimitable he is describing hair as he would have it painted      guess too where this is about a dimple sigilla in mento impressa amoris digitulo vestigio demonstrant mollitudinem    letter ix mr west to mr gray popes may         your fragment is in aulus gellius and both it and your greek delicious but why are you thus melancholy i am so sorry for it that you see i cannot forbear writing again the very first opportunity though i have little to say except to expostulate with you about it i find you converse much with the dead and i do not blame you for that i converse with them too though not indeed with the greek but i must condemn you for your longing to be with them what are there no joys among the living i could almost cry out with catullus alphene immemor atque unanimis false sodalibus but to turn an accusation thus upon another is ungenerous so i will take my leave of you for the present with a vale et vive paulisper cum vivis   letter x mr gray to mr west london may         mine you are to know is a white melancholy or rather leucocholy for the most part which though it seldom laughs or dances nor ever amounts to what one calls joy or pleasure yet is a good easy sort of a state and ca ne laisse que de samuser the only fault of it is insipidity which is apt now and then to give a sort of ennui which makes one form certain little wishes that signify nothing but there is another sort black indeed which i have now and then felt that has somewhat in it like tertullians rule of faith credo quia impossible est for it believes nay is sure of every thing that is unlikely so it be but frightful and on the other hand excludes and shuts its eyes to the most possible hopes and every thing that is pleasurable from this the lord deliver us for none but he and sunshiny weather can do it in hopes of enjoying this kind of weather i am going into the country for a few weeks but shall be never the nearer any society so if you have any charity you will continue to write my life is like harry the fourths supper of hens poulets a la broche poulets en ragout poulets en hachis poulets en fricasees reading here reading there nothing but books with different sauces do not let me lose my desert then for though that be reading too yet it has a very different flavor the may seems to be come since your invitation and i propose to bask in her beams and dress me in her roses et caput in verna semper habere rosa   i shall see mr  and his wife nay and his child too for he has got a boy is it not odd to consider ones cotemporaries in the grave light of husband and father there is my lords  and  they are statesmen do not you remember them dirty boys playing at cricket as for me i am never a bit the older nor the bigger nor the wiser than i was then no not for having been beyond sea pray how are you  i send you an inscription for a wood joining to a park of mine it is on the confines of mount cithoeron on the left hand as you go to thebes you know i am no friend to hunters and hate to be disturbed by their noise     in the   th letter of the first section mr gray says of his friends translation of an epigram of posidippus graecam illam  mirifice sapit the learned reader i imagine will readily give this tetrastic the same character    here follows also the beginning of an heroic epistle but you must give me leave to tell my own story first because historians differ massinissa was the son of gala king of the massyli and when very young at the head of his fathers army gave a most signal overthrow to syphax king of the masaesylians then an ally of the romans soon after asdrubal son of gisgo the carthaginian general gave the beautiful sophonisba his daughter in marriage to the young prince but this marriage was not consummated on account of massinissas being obliged to hasten into spain there to command his fathers troops who were auxiliaries of the carthaginians their affairs at this time began to be in a bad condition and they thought it might be greatly for their interest if they could bring over syphax to themselves this in time they actually effected and to strengthen their new alliance commanded asdrubal to give his daughter to syphax it is probable their ingratitude to massinissa arose from the great change of affairs which had happened among the massylians during his absence for his father and uncle were dead and a distant relation of the royal family had usurped the throne sophonisba was accordingly married to syphax and massinissa enraged at the affront became a friend to the romans they drove the carthaginians before them out of spain and carried the war into africa defeated syphax and took him prisoner upon which cirtha his capital opened her gates to laelius and massinissa the rest of the affair the marriage and the sending of poison every body knows this is partly taken from livy and partly from appian  sophonisba massinissae epistola egregium accipio promissi munus amoris inque manu mortem jam fruitura fero atque utinam citius mandasses luce vel una transieram stygios non inhonesta lacus victoris nec passa toros nova nupta mariti nec fueram fastus roma superba tuos scilicet haec partem tibi massinissa triumphi detractam haec pompae jura minora

conscia forma suum pompae finis erat there is so much of nature in the sentiment as well as poetry in the description of this triumphal entry of young massinissa that it seems much to be regretted the author did not finish this poem but i believe he never proceeded further with it i had therefore my doubts concerning the printing of so small a part but as i thought it the best because the only original specimen of mr grays ovidian verse the rest of his hexameters and pentameters being only translations either from english or italian i was willing to give it to the reader  tota vix nocte quievi sin premat invitae lumina victa sopor somnus habet pompas eademque recursat imago atque iterum hesterno munere victor ades  immediately after writing the preceding letter mr gray went upon a visit to his relations at stoke where he writ that beautiful little ode which stands first in his collection of poems he sent it as soon as written to his beloved friend but he was dead this singular anecdote is founded on a marginal note in his commonplace book where that ode is transcribed and the following memorandum annexed written at stoke the beginning of june      and sent to mr west not knowing he was then dead before it reached hertfordshire he died he was buried at hatfield the house called popes being in that parish on a gravestone in the chancel is the following plain inscription here lies the body of richard west esquire only son to the right honorable richard west esquire late lord chancellor of ireland who died the  st of june      in the   th year of his age only twenty days after he had written the letter to mr gray which concluded with vale and vive paulisper cum vivis so little was the amiable youth then aware of the short time that he himself would be numbered amongst the living but this is almost constantly the case with such persons as die of that most remediless yet most flattering of all distempers a consumption shall humanity be thankful or sorry that it is so thankful surely for as this malady generally attacks the young and the innocent it seems the merciful intention of heaven that to these death should come unperceived and as it were by stealth divested of one of his sharpest stings the lingering expectation of their dissolution as to mr gray we may assure ourselves that he felt much more than his dying friend when the letter which enclosed the ode was returned unopened there seems to be a kind of presentiment in that pathetic piece which readers of taste will feel when they learn this anecdote and which will make them read it with redoubled pleasure it will also throw a melancholy grace to borrow one of his own expressions on the ode on a distant prospect of eton and on that to adversity both of them written the august following for as both these poems abound with pathos those who have feeling hearts will feel this excellence the more strongly when they know the cause from whence it arose and the unfeeling will perhaps learn to respect what they cannot taste when they are prevented from imputing to a splenetic melancholy what in fact sprung from the most benevolent of all sensations i am inclined to believe that the elegy in a country churchyard was begun if not concluded at this time also though i am aware that as it stands at present the conclusion is of a later date how that was originally i shall show in my notes on the poem but the first impulse of his sorrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a very tender sonnet in english on the petrarchian model and also to a sublime apostrophe in hexameters written in the genuine strain of classical majesty with which he intended to begin one of his books de principiis cogitandi this i shall shortly give the reader but the sonnet being completed i reserve for publication amongst the rest of his poems  it may seem somewhat extraordinary that mr gray never attempted any thing in english verse except the beginning of agrippina and a few translations before the first ode lately mentioned shall we attribute this to his having been educated at eton or to what other cause certain it is that when i first knew him he seemed to set a greater value on his latin poetry than on that which he had composed in his native language and had almost the same foible then which i have since known him laugh at in petrarch when we read that most entertaining of all books entitled memories pour la vie de francois petrarque tires de ses oeuvres etc i am apt to think that the little popularity which m de polignacs antilucretius acquired after it had been so long and so eagerly expected by the learned induced mr gray to lay aside his didactic plan however this may be he writ no latin verse after this period except perhaps some part of the   st book of the poem just mentioned this therefore seems the proper place to introduce that fragment which being the most considerable in itself of all his latin compositions and perhaps the most labored of any of his poems it were to be wished that i could give the reader more insight into his design than the few scattered papers which he has left enable me to do it is clear however from the exordium itself that he meant to make the same use of mr lockes essay on the human understanding which lucretius did of the dogmas of epicurus and the first six lines plainly intimate that his general design was to be comprised in four books  the  st on the origin of our ideas unde animus scire incipiat    the  d on the distribution of these ideas in the memory  quibus inchoet orsa principiis seriem rerum tenuemque catenam mnemosyne    the  d on the province of reason and its gradual improvement  ratio unde rudi sub pectore tardum augeat imperium    the  th on the cause and effects of the passions  and primum mortalibus aegris ira dolor metus and curae nascantur inanes   but he has not drawn out any of the arguments of these books except a part of the first and that only so far as he executed of it

nec dedignare canentem o decus angliacae certe o lux altera gentis si qua primus iter monstras vestigia conor signare incerta tremulaque insistere planta it has been already observed in the note on letter    p    that mr grays hexameters besides having the variety of virgils pauses closed also with his elisions for virgil as an attentive reader will immediately perceive generally introduces one elision and not unfrequently more into those lines which terminate the sense this gives to his versification its last and most exquisite grace and leaves the ear fully satisfied mr gray could not fail to observe and of course to aim at this happy effect of elisions in a concluding line of which the present poem in particular affords indubitable and abundant proofs  quin potius duc ipse potes namque

juvenile part of mr grays life and nearly alas to half of its duration those which remain though less diversified by incidents will notwithstanding i flatter myself be equally instructive and amusing as several of his most intimate friends have very kindly furnished me with their collections of his letters which added to those i have myself preserved will enable me to select from them many excellent specimens of his more mature judgment correct taste and extensive learning blended at the same time with many amiable instances of his sensibility they will also specify the few remaining anecdotes which occurred in a life so retired and sedentary as his for the reader must be here informed that from the winter of the year      to the day of his death his principal residence was at cambridge he indeed during the lives of his mother and aunts spent his summer vacations at stoke and after they died in making little tours on visits to his friends in different parts of the country but he was seldom absent from college any considerable time except between the years      and      when on the opening of the british musaeum he took lodgings in southampton row in order to have recourse to the harleian and other manuscripts there deposited from which he made several curious extracts these amounting in all to a tolerablysized folio are at present in mr walpoles hands he has already printed the speech of sir thomas wyat from them in the second number of his miscellaneous antiquities the public must impute it to their own want of curiosity if more of them do not appear in print   it may seem strange that a person who had conceived so early a dislike to cambridge and who as we shall see presently now returned to it with this prejudice rather augmented should when he was free to choose make that very place his principal abode for near thirty years but this i think may be easily accounted for from his love of books ever his ruling passion and the straitness of his circumstances which prevented the gratification of it for to a man who could not conveniently purchase even a small library what situation so eligible as that which affords free access to a number of large ones this reason also accounts for another singular fact we have seen that during his residence at stoke in the spring and summer of this same year      he writ a considerable part of his more finished poems hence one would be naturally led to conclude that on his return to cambridge when the ceremony of taking his degree was over the quiet of the place would have prompted him to continue the cultivation of his poetical talents and that immediately as the muse seems in this year to have peculiarly inspired him but this was not the case reading he has often told me was much more agreeable to him than writing he therefore now laid aside composition almost entirely and applied himself with intense assiduity to the study of the best greek authors insomuch that in the space of about six years there were hardly any writers of note in that language which he had not only read but digested remarking by the mode of commonplace their contents their difficult and corrupt passages and all this with the accuracy of a critic added to the diligence of a student  before i insert the next series of letters i must take the liberty to mention that it was not till about the year      that i had the happiness of being introduced to the acquaintance of mr gray some very juvenile imitations of miltons juvenile poems which i had written a year or two before and of which the monody on mr popes death was the principal the other two were in imitation of lallegro and il penseroso and entitled il bellicoso and il pacifico the latter of these i was persuaded to revise and publish in the cambridge collection of verses on the peace of aixlachapelle      the former has since got into a miscellany printed by g perch from the indiscretion i suppose of some acquaintance who had a copy of it  he then at the request of one of my friends was so obliging as to revise the same year on account of a dispute which had happened between the master and fellows of pembroke hall i had the honor of being nominated by the fellows to fill one of the vacant fellowships though nominated in      i was not elected fellow till february      the master having refused his assent claiming a negative the affair was therefore not compromised till after an ineffectual litigation of two years  i was at this time scholar of st johns college and bachelor of arts personally unknown to the gentlemen who favored me so highly therefore that they gave me this mark of distinction and preference was greatly owing to mr gray who was well acquainted with several of that society and to dr heberden whose known partiality to every even the smallest degree of merit led him warmly to second his recommendation the reader i hope will excuse this short piece of egotism as it is written to express my gratitude as well to the living as the dead to declare the sense i shall ever retain of the honor which the fellows of pembroke hall then did me and to particularize the time of an incident which brought me into the neighborhood of mr grays college and served to give that cement to our future intimacy which is usually rendered stronger by proximity of place  the letters which i select for this section are from the date of the year      to that of      when mr gray was made professor of modern history this as it is a considerable interval of time will perhaps require me the more frequently to resume my narrative especially as i cannot now produce one continued chain of correspondence  letter i mr gray to of oldpark near durham with this gentleman mr gray contracted an acquaintance very early and though they were not educated together at eton yet afterward at cambridge when the doctor was fellow of pembrokehall they became intimate friends and continued so to the time of mr grays death dr wharton cambridge dec         i ought to have returned you my thanks a long time ago for the pleasure i should say prodigy of your letter for such a thing has not happened above twice within this last age to mortal man and no one here can conceive what it may portend you have heard i suppose how i have been employed a part of the time how by my own indefatigable application for these ten years past and by the care and vigilance of that worthy magistrate the man in blue a servant of the vicechancellors for the time being usually known by the name of blue coat whose business it is to attend acts for degrees etc  who i assure you has not spared his labor nor could have done more for his own son i am got half way to the top of jurisprudence i e bachelor of civil law  and bid as fair as another body to open a case of impotency with all decency and circumspection you see my ambition i do not doubt but some thirty years hence i shall convince the world and you that i am a very pretty young fellow and may come to shine in a profession perhaps the noblest of all except manmidwifery as for you if your distemper and you can but agree about going to london i may reasonably expect in a much shorter time to see you in your threecornered villa doing the honors of a wellfurnished table with as much dignity as rich a mien and as capacious a belly as dr mead methinks i see dr  at the lower end of it lost in admiration of your goodly person and parts cramming down his envy for it will rise with the wing of a pheasant and drowning it in neat burgundy but not to tempt your asthma too much with such a prospect i should think you might be almost as happy and as great as this even in the country but you know best and i should be sorry to say any thing that might stop you in the career of glory far be it from me to hamper the wheels of your gilded chariot go on sir thomas and when you die for even physicians must die may the faculty in warwick lane erect your statue in the very niche of sir john cutlers  i was going to tell you how sorry i am for your illness but i hope it is too late now i can only say that i really was very sorry may you live a hundred christmasses and eat as many collars of brawn stuck with rosemary adieu etc   though i have said that mr gray on his return to cambridge laid aside poetry almost entirely yet i find amongst his papers a small fragment in verse which bears internal evidence that it was written about this very time the foregoing letter in which he employs so much of his usual vein of ridicule on the university seems to be no improper introduction to it i shall therefore insert it here without making any apology as i have given one on a similar occasion in the first section  it seems to have been intended as a hymn or address to ignorance and i presume had he proceeded with it would have contained much good satire upon false science and scholastic pedantry what he writ of it is purely introductory yet many of the lines are so strong and the general cast of the versification so musical that i believe it will give the generality of readers a higher opinion of his poetical talents than many of his lyrical productions have done i speak of the generality because it is a certain fact that their taste is founded upon the tensyllable couplets of dryden and pope and upon these only  hail horrors hail ye ever gloomy bowers ye gothic fanes and antiquated towers where rushy camus slowlywinding flood perpetual draws his humid train of mud glad i revisit thy neglected reign oh take me to thy peaceful shade again but chiefly thee whose influence breathed from high augments the native darkness of the sky ah ignorance soft salutary power prostrate with filial reverence i adore thrice has hyperion rolled his annual race since weeping i forsook thy fond embrace oh say successful do thou still oppose thy leaden aegis against our ancient foes still stretch tenacious of thy right divine the massy scepter over thy slumbering line and dews lethean through the land dispense to steep in slumbers each benighted sense if any spark of wits delusive ray break out and flash a momentary day with damp cold touch forbid it to aspire and huddle up in fogs the dangerous fire oh say  she hears me not but careless grown lethargic nods upon her ebon throne goddess awake arise alas my fears can powers immortal feel the force of years not thus of old with ensigns wide unfurled she rode triumphant over the vanquished world fierce nations owned her unresisted might and all was ignorance and all was night oh sacred age oh times for ever lost the schoolmans glory and the churchmans boast for ever gone  yet still to fancy new her rapid wings the transient scene pursue and bring the buried ages back to view high on her car behold the grandam ride like old sesostris with barbaric pride  a team of harnessed monarchs bend  letter ii mr gray to dr wharton peterhouse april         you write so feelingly to mr brown and represent your abandoned condition in terms so touching that what gratitude could not effect in several months compassion has brought about in a few days and broke that strong attachment or rather allegiance which i and all here owe to our sovereign lady and mistress the president of presidents and head of heads if i may be permitted to pronounce her name that ineffable octogrammaton the power of laziness you must know she had been pleased to appoint me in preference to so many old servants of here is who had spent their whole lives in qualifying themselves for the office grand picker of straws and pushpin player to her supinity for that is her title the first is much in the nature of lord president of the council and the other like the groomporter only without the profit but as they are both things of very great honor in this country i considered with myself the load of envy attending such great charges and besides between you and me i found myself unable to support the fatigue of keeping up the appearance that persons of such dignity must do so i thought proper to decline it and excused myself as well as i could however as you see such an affair must take up a good deal of time and it has always been the policy of this court to proceed slowly like the imperial and that of spain in the dispatch of business you will on this account the easier forgive me if i have not answered your letter before  you desire to know it seems what character the poem of your young friend bears here pleasures of the imagination from the posthumous publication of dr akinsides poems it should seem that the author had very much the same opinion afterward of his own work which mr gray here expresses since he undertook a reform of it which must have given him had he concluded it as much trouble as if he had written it entirely new  i wonder that you ask the opinion of a nation where those who pretend to judge do not judge at all and the rest the wiser part wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them that is dicks and the rainbow coffeehouses your readier way would be to ask the ladies that keep the bars in those two theaters of criticism however to show you that i am a judge as well as my countrymen i will tell you though i have rather turned it over than read it but no matter no more have they that it seems to me above the middling and now and then for a little while rises even to the best particularly in description it is often obscure and even unintelligible and too much infected with the hutchinson jargon in short its great fault is that it was published at least nine years too early and so methinks in a few words a la mode du temple i have very pertly dispatched what perhaps may for several years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of myself  you are much in the right to have a taste for socrates he was a divine man i must tell you by way of news of the place that the other day a certain new professor made an apology for him an hour long in the schools and all the world brought in socrates guilty except the people of his own college  the muse is gone and left me in far worse company if she returns you will hear of her as to her child he here means his poem de principiis cogitandi see the last section since you are so good as to enquire after it it is but a puling chit yet not a bit grown to speak of i believe poor thing it has got the worms that will carry it off at last mr trollope and i are in a course of tarwater he for his present and i for my future distempers if you think it will kill me send away a man and horse directly for i drink like a fish  yours etc   letter iii mr gray to dr wharton cambridge dec         i would make you an excuse as indeed i ought if they were a sort of thing i ever gave any credit to myself in these cases but i know they are never true nothing so silly as indolence when it hopes to disguise itself every one knows it by its saunter as they do his majesty god bless him at a masquerade by the firmness of his tread and the elevation of his chin however somewhat i had to say that has a little shadow of reason in it i have been in town i suppose you know flaunting about at all kind of public places with two friends lately returned from abroad the world itself has some attractions in it to a solitary of six years standing and agreeable wellmeaning people of sense thank heaven there are so few of them are my peculiar magnet it is no wonder then if i felt some reluctance at parting with them so soon or if my spirits when i returned back to my cell should sink for a time not indeed to storm and tempest but a good deal below changeable besides seneca says and my pitch of philosophy does not pretend to be much above seneca nunquam mores quos extuli refero aliquid ex eo quod composui turbatur aliquid ex his quae fugavi redit and it will happen to such as us mere imps of science well it may when wisdom herself is forced often in sweet retired solitude to plume her feathers and let grow her wings that in the various bustle of resort were all too ruffled and sometimes impaired   it is a foolish thing that without money one cannot either live as one pleases or where and with whom one pleases swift somewhere says that money is liberty and i fear money is friendship too and society and almost every external blessing it is a great though an illnatured comfort to see most of those who have it in plenty without pleasure without liberty and without friends  i am not altogether of your opinion as to your historical consolation in time of trouble a calm melancholy it may produce a stiller sort of despair and that only in some circumstances and on some constitutions but i doubt no real comfort or content can ever arise in the human mind but from hope  i take it very ill you should have been in the twentieth year of the war thucydides l vii  and yet say nothing of the retreat before syracuse is it or is it not the finest thing you ever read in your life and how does xenophon or plutarch agree with you for my part i read aristotle his poetics politics and morals though i do not well know which is which in the first place he is the hardest author by far i ever meddled with then he has a dry conciseness that makes one imagine one is perusing a table of contents rather than a book it tastes for all the world like chopped hay or rather like chopped logic for he has a violent affection to that art being in some sort his own invention so that he often loses himself in little trifling distinctions and verbal niceties and what is worse leaves you to extricate him as well as you can thirdly he has suffered vastly from the transcribblers as all authors of great brevity necessarily must fourthly and lastly he has abundance of fine uncommon things which make him well worth the pains he gives one you see what you are to expect from him   letter iv mr gray to mr walpole cambridge      i had been absent from this place a few days and at my return found cibbers book entitled observations on ciceros character or some such thing for i have not the book by me and it has been long since forgot upon my table i return you my thanks for it and have already run over a considerable part for who could resist mrs letitia pilkingtons recommendation by the way is there any such gentlewoman this lady made herself more known some time after the date of this letter  or has somebody put on the style of a scribbling womans panegyric to deceive and laugh at colley he seems to me full as pert and as dull as usual there are whole pages of commonplace stuff that for stupidity might have been wrote by dr waterland or any other grave divine did not the flirting saucy phrase give them at a distance an air of youth and gaiety it is very true he is often in the right with regard to tullys weaknesses but was there any one that did not see them those i imagine that would find a man after gods own heart are no more likely to trust the doctors recommendation than the players and as to reason and truth would they know their own faces do you think if they looked in the glass and saw themselves so bedizened in tattered fringe and tarnished lace in french jewels and dirty furbelows the frippery of a strollers wardrobe  literature to take it in its most comprehensive sense and include every thing that requires invention or judgment or barely application and industry seems indeed drawing apace to its dissolution and remarkably since the beginning of the war i remember to have read mr spences pretty book though as he then had not been at rome for the last time it must have increased greatly since that in bulk if you ask me what i read i protest i do not recollect one syllable but only in general that they were the best bred sort of men in the world just the kind of frinds one would wish to meet in a fine summers evening if one wished to meet any at all the heads and tails of the dialogues published separate in   mo would make the sweetest reading in natiur for young gentlemen of family and fortune that are learning to dance this ridicule on the platonic way of dialogue as it was aimed to be though nothing less resembles it is in my opinion admirable lord shaftsbury was the first who brought it into vogue and mr spence if we except a few scotch writers the last who practiced it as it has now been laid aside some years we may hope for the sake of true taste that this frippery mode of composition will never come into fashion again especially since dr hurd has pointed out by example as well as precept wherein the true beauty of dialoguewriting consists  i rejoice to hear there is such a crowd of dramatical performances coming upon the stage agrippina can stay very well she thanks you and be damned at leisure i hope in god you have not mentioned or showed to any body that scene for trusting in its badness i forgot to caution you concerning it but i heard the other day that i was writing a play and was told the name of it which nobody here could know i am sure the employment you propose to me much better suits my inclination but i much fear our joint stock would hardly compose a small volume what i have is less considerable than you would imagine and of that little we should not be willing to publish all  what is here omitted was a short catalogue of mr wests poetry then in mr grays hands the reader has seen as much of it in the three foregoing sections as i am persuaded his friend would have published had he prosecuted the task which mr walpole recommended to him that of printing his own and mr wests poems in the same volume and which we also perceive from this letter he was not averse from doing this therefore seems to vindicate the editors plan in arranging these papers as he is enabled by it not only to show what mr west would have been but what mr gray was i mean not as a poet for that the world knew before but as an universal scholar and what is still of more consequence as an excellent moral man   this is all i can any where find you i imagine may have a good deal more i should not care how unwise the ordinary run of readers might think my affection for him provided those few that ever loved any body or judged of any thing rightly might from such little remains be moved to consider what he would have been and to wish that heaven had granted him a longer life and a mind more at ease  i send you a few lines though latin which you do not like for the sake of the subject the admirable apostrophe to mr west see page      it makes part of a large design and is the beginning of the fourth book which was intended to treat of the passions excuse the three first verses you know vanity with the romans is a poetical license   letter v mr gray to mr walpole cambridge      i have abundance of thanks to return you for the entertainment mr spences book has given me which i have almost run over already and i much fear see what it is to make a figure the breadth of the margin and the neatness of the prints which are better done than one could expect have prevailed upon me to like it far better than i did in manuscript for i think it is not the very genteel deportment of polymetis nor the lively wit of mysagetes that have at all corrupted me  there is one fundamental fault from whence most of the little faults throughout the whole arise he professes to neglect the greek writers who could have given him more instruction on the very heads he professes to treat than all the others put together who does not know that upon the latin the sabine and hetruscan mythology which probably might themselves at a remoter period of time owe their origin to greece too the romans ingrafted almost the whole religion of greece to make what is called their own it would be hard to find any one circumstance that is properly of their invention in the ruder days of the republic the picturesque part of their religion which is the province he has chose and would be thought to confine himself to was probably borrowed entirely from the tuscans who as a wealthy and trading people may be well supposed and indeed are known to have had the arts flourishing in a considerable degree among them what could inform him here but dio halicarnassus who expressly treats of those times with great curiosity and industry and the remains of the first roman writers the former he has neglected as a greek and the latter he says were but little acquainted with the arts and consequently are but of small authority in the better ages when every temple and public building in rome was peopled with imported deities and heroes and when all the artists of reputation they made use of were greeks what wonder if their eyes grew familiarised to grecian forms and habits especially in a matter of this kind where so much depends upon the imagination and if those figures introduced with them a belief of such fables as first gave them being and dressed them out in their various attributes it was natural then and i should think necessary to go to the source itself the greek accounts of their own religion but to say the truth i suspect he was little conversant in those books and that language for he rarely quotes any but lucian an author that falls in every bodys way and who lived at the very extremity of that period he has set to his enquiries later than any of the poets he has meddled with and for that reason ought to have been regarded as but an indifferent authority especially being a syrian too his book as he says himself is i think rather a beginning than a perfect work but a beginning at the wrong end for if any body should finish it by enquiring into the greek mythology as he proposes it will be necessary to read it backward  there are several little neglects that one might have told him of which i noted in reading it hastily as page     a discourse about orange trees occasioned by virgils inter oderatum lauri nemus where he fancies the roman laurus to be our laurel though undoubtedly the bay tree which is odoratum and i believe still called lauro or alloro at rome and that the malum medicum in the georgick is the orange though theophrastus whence virgil borrowed it or even pliny whom he himself quotes might convince him it is the cedrato which he has often tasted at florence page     is an account of domenichinos cardinal virtues and a fling at the jesuits neither of which belong to them the painting is in a church of the barnabiti dedicated to st carlo borromeo whose motto is humilitas page     in a note he says the old romans did not regard fortune as a deity though servius tullius whom she was said to be in love with nay there was actually an affair between them founded her temple in foro boario by the way her worship was greek and this king was educated in the family of tarquinius priscus whose father was a corinthian so it is easy to conceive how early the religion of rome might be mixed with that of greece etc etc  dr middleton has sent me today a book on the roman senate the substance of a dispute between lord hervey and him though it never interrupted their friendship he says and i dare say not   letter vi mr gray to mr walpole cambridge march        as one ought to be particularly careful to avoid blunders in a compliment of condolence it would be a sensible satisfaction to me before i testify my sorrow and the sincere part i take in your misfortune to know for certain who it is i lament i knew zara and selima selima was it or fatima or rather i knew them both together for i cannot justly say which was which then as to your handsome cat the name you distinguish her by i am no less at a loss as well knowing ones handsome cat is always the cat one likes best or if one be alive and the other dead it is usually the latter that is the handsomest besides if the point were never so clear i hope you do not think me so illbred or so imprudent as to forfeit all my interest in the surviver oh no i would rather seem to mistake and imagine to be sure it must be the tabby one that had met with this sad accident till this affair is a little better determined you will excuse me if i do not begin to cry  tempus inane peto requiem spatiumque doloris which interval is the more convenient as it gives time to rejoice with you on your new honors mr walpole was about this time elected a fellow of the royal society  this is only a beginning i reckon next week we shall hear you are a freemason or a gormogon at least  heigh ho i feel as you to be sure have done long since that i have very little to say at least in prose somebody will be the better for it i do not mean you but your cat feue mademoiselle selime whom i am about to immortalize for one week or fortnight as follows      the reader need hardly be told that the  th ode in the collection of his poems was inserted in the place of these asterisks this letter as some other slight ones have been is printed chiefly to mark the date of one of his compositions  there is a poem for you it is rather too long for an epitaph   letter vii mr gray to dr wharton stoke june        your friendship has interested itself in my affairs so naturally that i cannot help troubling you a little with a detail of them the paragraph here omitted contained an account of mr grays loss of a house by fire in cornhill and the expense he should be at in rebuilding it though it was insured he could at this time ill bear to lay out the additional sum necessary for the purpose   and now my dear wharton why must i tell you a thing so contrary to my own wishes and yours i believe it is impossible for me to see you in the north or to enjoy any of those agreeable hours i had flattered myself with this business will oblige me to be in town several times during the summer particularly in august when half the money is to be paid besides the good people here would think me the most careless and ruinous of mortals if i should take such a journey at this time the only satisfaction i can pretend to is that of hearing from you and particularly at this time when i was bid to expect the good news of an increase of your family your opinion of diodorus is doubtless right but there are things in him very curious got out of better authorities now lost do you remember the egyptian history and particularly the account of the gold mines my own readings have been cruelly interrupted what i have been highly pleased with is the new comedy from paris by gresset called le mechant if you have it not buy his works altogether in two little volumes they are collected by the dutch booksellers and consequently contain some trash but then there are the ververt the epistle to p bougeant the chartreuse that to his sister an ode on his country and another on mediocrity and the sidnei another comedy all which have great beauties there is also a poem lately published by thompson called the castle of indolence with some good stanzas in it mr mason is my acquaintance i liked that ode ode to a water nymph published about this time in dodsleys miscellany on reading what follows many readers i suspect will think me as simple as ever in forbearing to expunge the paragraph but as i publish mr grays sentiments of authors as well living as dead without reserve i should do them injustice if i was more scrupulous with respect to myself my friends i am sure will be much amused with this and another passage hereafter of a like sort my enemies if they please may sneer at it and say which they will very truly that twentyfive years have made a very considerable abatement in my general philanthropy men of the world will not blame me for writing from so prudent a motive as that of making my fortune by it and yet the truth i believe at the time was that i was perfectly well satisfied if my publications furnished me with a few guineas to see a play or an opera much but have found no one else that did he has much fancy little judgment and a good deal of modesty i take him for a good and wellmeaning creature but then he is really in simplicity a child and loves every body he meets with he reads little or nothing writes abundance and that with a design to make his fortune by it my best compliments to mrs wharton and your family does that name include any body i am not yet acquainted with   letter viii mr gray to dr wharton stoke august         i am glad you have had any pleasure in gresset he seems to me a truly elegant and charming writer the mechant is the best comedy i ever read his edward i could scarce get through it is puerile though there are good lines such as this for example  le jour dun nouveau regne est le jour des ingrats but good lines will make any thing rather than a good play however you are to consider this is a collection made up by the dutch booksellers many things unfinished or written in his youth or designed not for the world but to make his friends laugh as the lutrin vivant etc there are two noble lines which as they are in the middle of an ode to the king may perhaps have escaped you  le cri dun peuple heureux est la seule eloquence  qui scait parler des rois which is very true and should have been a hint to himself not to write odes to the king at all  as i have nothing more to say at present i fill my paper with the beginning of an essay what name to give it i know not but the subject is the alliance of education and government i mean to show that they must both concur to produce great and useful men i desire your judgment upon it before i proceed any further   the first fiftyseven verses of an ethical essay accompanied this letter which i shall here insert with about fifty lines more all of them finished in his highest manner had this noble design been completed i may with great boldness assert that it would have been one of the most capital poems of the kind that ever appeared either in our own or any language i am not able to inform the reader how many essays he meant to write upon the subject nor do i believe that he had ever so far settled his plan as to determine that point but since his theme was as extensive as human nature an observation he himself makes in a subsequent letter on the esprit des loix it is plain the whole work would have been considerable in point of size he was busily employed in it at the time when m de montesquieus book was first published on reading it he said the baron had forestalled some of his best thoughts and yet the reader will find from the small fragment he has left that the two writers differ a little in one very material point viz the influence of soil and climate on national manners see lesprit des loix live    chap   etc some time after he had thoughts of resuming his plan and of dedicating it by an introductory ode to m de montesquieu but that great mans death which happened in      made him drop his design finally  on carefully reviewing the scattered papers in prose which he writ as hints for his own use in the prosecution of this work i think it best to form part of them into a kind of commentary at the bottom of the pages they will serve greatly to elucidate as far as they go the method of his reasoning  essay i commentary  the authors subject being as we have seen the necessary alliance between a good form of government and a good mode of education in order to produce the happiness of mankind the poem opens with two similes an uncommon kind of exordium but which i suppose the poet intentionally chose to intimate the analogical method he meant to pursue in his subsequent reasonings  st he asserts that men without education are like sickly plants in a cold or barren soil line   to   and   to    and  dly he compares them when unblest with a just and well regulated government to plants that will not blossom or bear fruit in an unkindly and inclement air l   to   and l    to    having thus laid down the two propositions he means to prove he begins by examining into the characteristics which taking a general view of mankind all men have in common one with another l    to    they covet pleasure and avoid pain l    they feel gratitude for benefits l    they desire to avenge wrongs which they effect either by force or cunning l    they are linked to each other by their common feelings and participate in sorrow and in joy l       if then all the human species agree in so many moral particulars whence arises the diversity of national characters this question the poet puts at line    and dilates upon to l    why says he have some nations shown a propensity to commerce and industry others to war and rapine others to ease and pleasure l    to    why have the northern people overspread in all ages and prevailed over the southern l    to    why has asia been time out of mind the seat of despotism and europe that of freedom l    to    are we from these instances to imagine men necessarily enslaved to the inconveniences of the climate where they were born l    to    or are we not rather to suppose there is a natural strength in the human mind that is able to vanquish and break through them l    to    it is confessed however that men receive an early tincture from the situation they are placed in and the climate which produces them l    to    thus the inhabitants of the mountains inured to labor and patience are naturally trained to war l    to    while those of the plain are more open to any attack and softened by ease and plenty l    to    again the egyptians from the nature of their situation might be the inventors of homenavigation from a necessity of keeping up an intercourse between their towns during the inundation of the nile l    to  those persons would naturally have the first turn to commerce who inhabited a barren coast like the tyrians and were persecuted by some neighboring tyrant or were drove to take refuge on some shoals like the venetian and hollander their discovery of some rich island in the infancy of the world described the tartar hardened to war by his rigorous climate and pastoral life and by his disputes for water and herbage in a country without landmarks as also by skirmishes between his rival clans was consequently fitted to conquer his rich southern neighbors whom ease and luxury had enervated yet this is no proof that liberty and valor may not exist in southern climes since the syrians and carthaginians gave noble instances of both and the arabians carried their conquests as far as the tartars rome also for many centuries repulsed those very nations which when she grew weak at length demolished the reader will perceive that the commentary goes further than the text the reason for which is that the editor found it so on the paper from which he formed that comment and as the thoughts seemed to be those which mr gray would have next graced with the harmony of his numbers he held it best to give them in continuation there are other maxims on different papers all apparently relating to the same subject which are too excellent to be lost these therefore as the place in which he meant to employ them cannot be ascertained i shall subjoin to this note under the title of detached sentiments  man is a creature not capable of cultivating his mind but in society and in that only where he is not a slave to the necessities of life  want is the mother of the inferior arts but ease that of the finer as eloquence policy morality poetry sculpture painting architecture which are the improvements of the former  the climate inclines some nations to contemplation and pleasure others to hardship action and war but not so as to incapacitate the former for courage and discipline or the latter for civility politeness and works of genius  it is the proper work of education and government united to redress the faults that arise from the soil and air  the principal drift of education should be to make men think in the northern climates and act in the southern  the different steps and degrees of education may be compared to the artificers operations upon marble it is one thing to dig it out of the quarry and another to square it to give it gloss and luster call forth every beautiful spot and vein shape it into a column or animate it into a statue  to a native of free and happy governments his country is always dear  he loves his old hereditary trees cowley while the subject of a tyrant has no country he is therefore selfish and baseminded he has no family no posterity no desire of fame or if he has of one that turns not on its proper object  any nation that wants public spirit neglects education ridicules the desire of fame and even of virtue and reason must be ill governed  commerce changes entirely the fate and genius of nations by communicating arts and opinions circulating money and introducing the materials of luxury she first opens and polishes the mind then corrupts and enervates both that and the body  those invasions of effeminate southern nations by the warlike northern people seem in spite of all the terror mischief and ignorance which they brought with them to be necessary evils in order to revive the spirit of mankind softened and broken by the arts of commerce to restore them to their native liberty and equality and to give them again the power of supporting danger and hardship so a comet with all the horrors that attend it as it passes through our system brings a supply of warmth and light to the sun and of moisture to the air  the doctrine of epicurus is ever ruinous to society it had its rise when greece was declining and perhaps hastened its dissolution as also that of rome it is now propagated in france and in england and seems likely to produce the same effect in both  one principal characteristic of vice in the present age is the contempt of fame  many are the uses of good fame to a generous mind it extends our existence and example into future ages continues and propagates virtue which otherwise would be as shortlived as our frame and prevents the prevalence of vice in a generation more corrupt even than our own it is impossible to conquer that natural desire we have of being remembered even criminal ambition and avarice the most selfish of all passions would wish to leave a name behind them  i find also among these papers a single couplet much too beautiful to be lost though the place where he meant to introduce it cannot be ascertained it must however have made a part of some description of the effect which the reformation had on our national manners when love could teach a monarch to be wise and gospel light first dawned from bullens eyes thus with all the attention that a connoisseur in painting employs in collecting every slight outline as well as finished drawing which led to the completion of some capital picture i have endeavored to preserve every fragment of this great poetical design it surely deserved this care as it was one of the noblest which mr gray ever attempted and also as far as he carried it into execution the most exquisitely finished that he carried it no further is and must ever be a most sensible loss to the republic of letters   her extensive empire       theocritus  as sickly plants etc l   if any copies of this essay would have authorized me to have made an alteration in the disposition of the lines i would for the sake of perspicuity have printed the first twelve in the following manner because i think the poetry would not have been in the least hurt by such a transposition and the poets meaning would have been much more readily perceived i put them down here for that purpose as sickly plants betray a niggard earth whose barren bosom starves her generous birth nor genial warmth nor genial juice retains their roots to feed and fill their verdant veins so draw mankind in vain the vital airs unformed unfriended by those kindly cares that health and vigor to the soul impart spread the young thought and warm the opening heart and as in climes where winter holds his reign the soil though fertile will not teem in vain forbids her gems to swell her shades to rise nor trusts her blossoms to the churlish skies so fond instruction etc  as sickly plants betray a niggard earth whose barren bosom starves her generous birth nor genial warmth nor genial juice retains their roots to feed and fill their verdant veins and as in climes where winter holds his reign the soil though fertile will not teem in vain forbids her gems to swell her shades to rise nor trusts her blossoms to the churlish skies so draw mankind in vain the vital airs unformed unfriended by those kindly cares that health and vigor to the soul impart spread the young thought and warm the opening heart so fond instruction on the growing powers of nature idly lavishes her stores if equal justice with unclouded face smile not indulgent on the rising race and scatter with a free though frugal hand light golden showers of plenty over the land but tyranny has fixed her empire there to check their tender hopes with chilling fear and blast the blooming promise of the year this spacious animated scene survey from where the rolling orb that gives the day his sable sons with nearer course surrounds to either pole and lifes remotest bounds how rude soever the exterior form we find however opinion tinge the varied mind alike to all the kind impartial heaven the sparks of truth and happiness has given with sense to feel with memory to retain they follow pleasure and they fly from pain their judgment mends the plan their fancy draws the event presages and explores the cause the soft returns of gratitude they know by fraud elude by force repel the foe while mutual wishes mutual woes endear the social smile and sympathetic tear say then through ages by what fate confined to different climes seem different souls assigned here measured laws and philosophic ease fix and improve the polished arts of peace there industry and gain their vigils keep command the winds and tame the unwilling deep here force and hardy deeds of blood prevail there languid pleasure sighs in every gale often over the trembling nations from afar  has scythia breathed etc l    the most celebrated of the early irruptions of the scythians into the neighboring countries is that under the conduct of madyes about the year of the creation    0 when they broke into asia during the reign of cyaxares king of the medes and conqueror of the assyrians plundered it at discretion and kept possession of it during twentyeight years many successive incursions attended with every kind of desolation are enumerated by historians particularly those in a d     during the reign of gallus and volusianus and in     under that of gallienus under the greek emperors also to mention only the years  0   and      it appears that the scythians still continued their accustomed ravages in later times the like spirit of sudden and destructive invasion has constantly prevailed and these same scythians under their modern name of tartars have at different periods overrun asia and even some parts of europe it is sufficient on this point to recall to the readers memory the names of gingischan octai and tamerlane has scythia breathed the living cloud of war and where the deluge burst with sweepy sway their arms their kings their gods were rolled away as often have issued host impelling host  the blueeyed myriads etc l    the different nations of germans who inhabited or bordered on this coast have been always distinguished by their various emigrations in search of a better soil and climate and of a more commodious settlement the reader will readily recollect the expedition of the teutones who joined the cimbri when they invaded the roman territories to the united amount it is said of  00000 fighting men the many inroads of the germans into gaul under the conduct of ariovistus and the numerous irruptions into the roman empire of the suevi the goths the vandals and lastly of the lombards most of which nations came originally from the coasts here mentioned the epithet blueeyed exhibits a distinguishing feature of the ancient germans and is particularly remarked by tacitus and juvenal truces et caerulei oculi observes the former de popul german cap   and the latter caerula quis stupuit germani lumina sat    ver     the blueeyed myriads from the baltic coast the prostrate south to the destroyer yields her boasted titles and her golden fields  with grim delight etc l    it may not be improper here after admiring the noble vein of poetical expression and imagery which adorns this description to relate an incident in itself curious which shows the propriety of it the normans who came originally from norway and scandinavia having after a century of ravages settled themselves in neustria since called normandy in      were invited into the southern parts of italy in the year  0   by gaimar prince of salerno the ambassadors by his particular direction carried with them a quantity of citrons and of other rare fruits as the most alluring proof of the mildness of the climate he thought and the event showed he was right in thinking so that this brood of winter delighted with the taste and fragrance of these delicacies would the more readily consent to his proposal see leo ostiensis in his chron cassin and petavius rationarium temp pars prim lib viii mr grays judgment in what remains to us of this essay is very remarkable he borrows from poetry his imagery his similes and his expressions but his thoughts are taken as the nature of the poem requires from history and observation with grim delight the brood of winter view a brighter day and heavens of azure hue scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose and quaff the pendent vintage as it grows proud of the yoke and pliant to the rod why yet does asia dread a monarchs nod while european freedom still withstands the encroaching tide that drowns her lessening lands and sees far off with an indignant groan her native plains and empires once her own can opener skies and suns of fiercer flame oerpower the fire that animates our frame as lamps that shed at eve a cheerful ray fade and expire beneath the eye of day need we the influence of the northern star to string our nerves and steel our hearts to war and where the face of nature laughs around must sickening virtue fly the tainted ground unmanly thought what seasons can control what fancied zone can circumscribe the soul who conscious of the source from whence she springs by reasons light on resolutions wings spite of her frail companion dauntless goes over lybias deserts and through zemblas snows she bids each slumbering energy awake another touch another temper take suspends the inferior laws that rule our clay the stubborn elements confess her sway their little wants their low desires refine and raise the mortal to a height divine not but the human fabric from the birth imbibes a flavor of its parent earth as various tracts enforce a various toil the manners speak the idiom of their soil an ironrace the mountaincliffs maintain foes to the gentler genius of the plain for where unwearied sinews must be found with sidelong plough to quell the flinty ground to turn the torrents swiftdescending flood to brave the savage rushing from the wood what wonder if to patient valor trained they guard with spirit what by strength they gained and while their rocky ramparts round they see the rough abode of want and liberty as lawless force from confidence will grow insult the plenty of the vales below what wonder in the sultry climes that spread where nile redundant over his summerbed from his broad bosom life and verdure flings  and broods over egypt etc l  0  the image seems to be taken from the figure of jupiter pluvius as represented on the antonine pillar but the whole passage rises to a height beyond the powers either of sculpture or painting to ascend the critic would with difficulty find any description in antiquity which exceeds this in point of true sublimity and broods over egypt with his watery wings if with adventurous oar and ready sail the dusky people drive before the gale or on frail floats to neighboring cities ride  that rise and glitter over the ambient tide l  0  the foregoing account of the

tide          letter ix mr gray to dr wharton cambridge march         you ask for some account of books the principal i can tell you of is a work of the president montesquieu the labor of twenty years it is called lesprit des loix   vol  to printed at geneva he lays down the principles on which are founded the three sorts of government despotism the limited monarchy and the republican and shows how from these are deduced the laws and customs by which they are guided and maintained the education proper to each form the influence of climate situation religion etc on the minds of particular nations and on their policy the subject you see is as extensive as mankind the thoughts perfectly new generally admirable as they are just sometimes a little too refined in short there are faults but such as an ordinary man could never have committed the style very lively and concise consequently sometimes obscure it is the gravity of tacitus whom he admires tempered with the gaiety and fire of a frenchman the time of night will not suffer me to go on but i will write again in a week   letter x mr gray to dr wharton cambridge april         i perceive that second parts are as bad to write as they can be to read for this which you ought to have had a week after the first has been a full month in coming forth the spirit of laziness the spirit of the place begins to possess even me who have so long declaimed against it yet has it not so prevailed but that i feel that discontent with myself that ennui that ever accompanies it in its beginnings time will settle my conscience time will reconcile me to this languid companion we shall smoke we shall tipple we shall doze together we shall have our little jokes like other people and our old stories brandy will finish what port began and a month after the time you will see in some corner of a london eveningpost yesterday died the reverend mr john gray senior fellow of clarehall a facetious companion and well respected by all that knew him his death is supposed to have been occasioned by a fit of an apoplexy being found fallen out of bed with his head in the chamber pot  in the meanwhile to go on with my account of new books montesquieus work which i mentioned before is now publishing anew in   vols octavo have you seen old crebillions catalina a tragedy which has had a prodigious run at paris historical truth is too much perverted in it which is ridiculous in a story so generally known but if you can get over this the sentiments and versification are fine and most of the characters particularly the principal one painted with great spirit  mr birch the indefatigable has just put out a thick octavo of original papers of queen elizabeths time there are many curious things in it particularly letters from sir robert cecil salisbury about his negotiations with henry iv of france the earl of monmouths odd account of queen elizabeths death several peculiarities of james i and prince henry etc and above all an excellent account of the state of france with characters of the king his court and ministry by sir george carew ambassador there this i think is all new worth mentioning that i have seen or heard of except a natural history of peru in spanish printed at london by don  something a man of learning sent thither by that court on purpose  you ask after my chronology it was begun as i told you almost two years ago when i was in the midst of diogenes laertius and his philosophers as a prooemium to their works my intention in forming this table was not so much for public events though these too have a column assigned them but rather in a literary way to compare the time of all great men their writings and their transactions i have brought it from the  0th olympiad where it begins to the    th that is     years this laborious work was formed much in the manner of the president henaults history de france every page consisted of nine columns one for the olympiad the next for the archons the third for the public affairs of greece the three next for the philosophers and the three last for poets historians and orators i do not find it carried further than the date abovementioned  my only modern assistants were marsham dodwell and bentley  i have since that read pausanias and athenaeus all through and aeschylus again i am now in pindar and lysias for i take verse and prose together like bread and cheese   letter xi mr gray to dr wharton cambridge august        i promised dr keen long since to give you an account of our magnificences here the duke of newcastles installation as chancellor of the university  but the news papers and he himself in person have got the start of my indolence so that by this time you are well acquainted with all the events that adorned that week of wonders thus much i may venture to tell you because it is probable nobody else has done it that our friend s zeal and eloquence surpassed all power of description vesuvio in an eruption was not more violent than his utterance nor since i am at my mountains pelion with all its pinetrees in a storm of wind more impetuous than his action and yet the senate house still stands and i thank god we are all safe and well at your service i was ready to sink for him and scarce dared to look about me when i was sure it was all over but soon found i might have spared my confusion all people joined to applaud him every thing was quite right and i dare swear not three people here but think him a model of oratory for all the dukes little court came with a resolution to be pleased and when the tone was once given the university who ever wait for the judgment of their betters struck into it with an admirable harmony for the rest of the performances they were just what they usually are every one while it lasted was very gay and very busy in the morning and very owlish and very tipsy at night i make no exceptions from the chancellor to bluecoat masons ode was the only entertainment that had any tolerable elegance and for my own part i think it with some little abatements uncommonly well on such an occasion pray let me know your sentiments for doubtless you have seen it the author of it grows apace into my good graces as i know him more he is very ingenious with great good nature and simplicity a little vain but in so harmless and so comical a way that it does not offend one at all a little ambitious but withal so ignorant in the world and its ways that this does not hurt him in ones opinion so sincere and so undisguised that no mind with a spark of generosity would ever think of hurting him he lies so open to injury but so indolent that if he cannot overcome this habit all his good qualities will signify nothing at all after all i like him so well i could wish you knew him   letter xii mr gray to his mother cambridge nov        the unhappy news i have just received from you equally surprises and afflicts me the death of his aunt mrs mary antrobus who died the  th of november and was buried in a vault in stoke churchyard near the chancel door in which also his mother and himself according to the direction in his will were afterward buried  i have lost a person i loved very much and have been used to from my infancy but am much more concerned for your loss the circumstances of which i forbear to dwell upon as you must be too sensible of them yourself and will i fear more and more need a consolation that no one can give except he who has preserved her to you so many years and at last when it was his pleasure has taken her from us to himself and perhaps if we reflect upon what she felt in this life we may look upon this as an instance of his goodness both to her and to those that loved her she might have languished many years before our eyes in a continual increase of pain and totally helpless she might have long wished to end her misery without being able to attain it or perhaps even lost all sense and yet continued to breathe a sad spectacle to such as must have felt more for her than she could have done for herself however you may deplore your own loss yet think that she is at last easy and happy and has now more occasion to pity us than we her i hope and beg you will support yourself with that resignation we owe to him who gave us our being for our good and who deprives us of it for the same reason i would have come to you directly but you do not say whether you desire i should or not if you do i beg i may know it for there is nothing to hinder me and i am in very good health   letter xiii mr gray to dr wharton stoke august      0 aristotle says one may write greek to you without scandal that   but aristotle may say whatever he pleases i do not find myself at all the worse for it i could indeed wish to refresh my  a little at durham by the sight of you but when is there a probability of my being so happy it concerned me greatly when i heard the other day that your asthma continued at times to afflict you and that you were often obliged to go into the country to breathe you cannot oblige me more than by giving me an account both of the state of your body and mind i hope the latter is able to keep you cheerful and easy in spite of the frailties of its companion as to my own it can neither do one nor the other and i have the mortification to find my spiritual part the most infirm thing about me you have doubtless heard of the loss i have had in dr middleton whose house was the only easy place one could find to converse in at cambridge for my part i find a friend so uncommon a thing that i cannot help regretting even an old acquaintance which is an indifferent likeness of it and though i do not approve the spirit of his books methinks it is pity the world should lose so rare a thing as a good writer mr gray used to say that good writing not only required great parts but the very best of those parts   my studies cannot furnish a recommendation of many new books to you there is a defense de lesprit des loix by montesquieu himself it has some lively things in it but is very short and his adversary appears to be so mean a bigot that he deserved no answer there are   vols in  to of histoire du cabinet du roy by messrs buffons and daubenton the first is a man of character but i am told has hurt it by this work it is all a sort of introduction to natural history the weak part of it is a love of system which runs through it the most contrary thing in the world to a science entirely grounded upon experiments and which has nothing to do with one cannot therefore help lamenting that mr gray let his imagination lie dormant so frequently in order to apply himself to this very science vivacity of imagination however i cannot help commending the general view which he gives of the face of the earth followed by a particular one of all the known nations their peculiar figure and manners which is the best epitome of geography i ever met with and written with sense and elegance in short these books are well worth turning over the memoirs of the abbe de mongon in   vols are highly commended but i have not seen them he was engaged in several embassies to germany england etc during the course of the late war the president henaults abrege chronologique de lhistoire de france i believe i have before mentioned to you as a very good book of its kind   about this time mr gray had put his last hand to his celebrated elegy in the country churchyard and had communicated it to his friend mr walpole whose good taste was too much charmed with it to suffer him to withhold the sight of it from his acquaintance accordingly it was shown about for some time in manuscript as mr gray intimates in the subsequent letter to dr wharton and received with all the applause it so justly merited amongst the rest of the fashionable world for to these only it was at present communicated lady cobham who now lived at the mansion house at stokepogis had read and admired it she wished to be acquainted with the author accordingly her relation miss speed and lady schaub then at her house undertook to bring this about by making him the first visit he happened to be from home when the ladies arrived at his aunts solitary mansion and when he returned was surprised to find written on one of his papers in the parlour where he usually read the following note lady schaubs compliments to mr gray she is sorry not to have found him at home to tell him that lady brown is very well this necessarily obliged him to return the visit and soon after induced him to compose a ludicrous account of this little adventure for the amusement of the ladies in question he wrote it in ballad measure and entitled it a long story when it was handed about in manuscript nothing could be more various than the opinions concerning it by some it was thought a masterpiece of original humor by others a wild and fantastic farrago and when it was published the sentiments of good judges were equally divided about it how it came to be printed i shall mention hereafter and also inform the reader why mr gray rejected it in the collection which he himself made of his poems in the meanwhile as i think it ought to have a place in these memoirs for reasons too obvious to insist upon i shall beg leave to preface it with my own idea of the authors peculiar vein of humor which with my notes on the piece itself may perhaps account in some sort for the variety of opinions which people of acknowledged taste have formed concerning it  mr gray had not in my opinion either in his conversation or writing much of what is called pure humor it was always so much blended either with wit fancy or his own peculiar character that it became equivocal and hence not adapted to please generally it had more of the manner of congreve than addison and we know where one person relishes my lady wishfort there are thousands that admire sir roger de coverley it will not however from hence follow that lady wishfort is ill drawn for my own part i think it one of the most entertaining characters that ever was written i know however that it is commonly thought extravagant and unnatural and i believe it is true that no woman ever existed who had so much folly and affectation and at the same so much wit and fancy yet every one sees that were this fancy and wit taken away her character would become insipid in proportion as it became more natural so that in this and other instances if congreves fools were fools indeed they would by being true characters cease to be entertaining ones it may be further observed on the subject of humor that it may and ought to be divided into several species there is one sort that of terences which simply pleases without forcing a smile another like mr addisons which not only pleases but makes us smile into the bargain shakespeares swifts congreves and priors usually go further and make us laugh i infer not from hence that this latter sort is the best i only assert that however it may be mixed with other ingredients it ought also to be called humor the critic however who judges by rule and who will not be pleased unless legitimately will be apt to condemn this species of mixed humor and the common reader will not always have either wit or imagination enough to comprehend or taste it but i have said mr gray not only mixed wit and fancy with his humor but also his own particular character and being naturally delicate and at times even fastidious his humor generally took the same cast and would therefore be only relished by such of his friends who conscious of his superior excellencies thought this defect not only pardonable but entertaining which a character of this sort being humorous in itself always is when it is not carried to any offensive extreme yet as this observation relates only to his conversation and familiar letters for to these only it can be applied i have no occasion to insist on it further and shall only add that whatever the generality of readers may think of mr grays talent in this way there will always be some and those far from the lowest class to whom it will appear excellent for humor may be true when it ceases to be pure or unmixt if the ingredients which go to its composition be true also false wit and a wild fancy would debase the best humor in the world as they frequently do in rabelais and stern without taking more exceptionable matters into consideration but when genuine they serve to heighten and embellish it  a long story in britains isle no matter where the mansion house at stokepogis then in the possession of viscountess cobham the style of building which we now call queen elizabeths is here admirably described both with regard to its beauties and defects and the third and fourth stanzas delineate the fantastic manners of her time with equal truth and humor the house formerly belonged to the earls of huntingdon and the family of hatton an ancient pile of building stands the huntingdons and hattons there employed the power of fairy hands to raise the cielings fretted height each panel in achievements clothing rich windows that exclude the light and passages that lead to nothing full often within the spacious walls when he had fifty winters over him sir christopher hatton promoted by queen elizabeth for his graceful person and fine dancing g  brawls were a sort of figuredance then in vogue and probably deemed as elegant as our modern cotillions or still more modern quadrilles my grave lord keeper led the brawls the seal and maces danced before him his bushy beard and shoestrings green his highcrownd hat and satin doublet moved the stout heart of englands queen though pope and spaniard could not trouble it what in the very first beginning shame of the versifying tribe your history whither are you spinning can you do nothing but describe a house there is and that is enough from whence one fatal morning issues the reader is already apprized who these ladies were the two descriptions are prettily contrasted and nothing can be more happily turned than the compliment to lady cobham in the eighth stanza a brace of warriors not in buff but rustling in their silks and tissues the first came capapee from france her conquering destiny fulfilling whom meaner beauties eye askance and vainly ape her art of killing the other amazon kind heaven had armed with spirit wit and satire but cobham had the polish given and tipd her arrows with good nature to celebrate her eyes her air  coarse panegyrics would but teaze her melissa is her nom de guerre alas who would not wish to please her with bonnet blue and capuchine and aprons long they hid their armor and veiled their weapons bright and keen in pity to the country farmer fame in the shape of i have been told that this gentleman a neighbor and acquaintance of mr grays in the country was much displeased at the liberty here taken with his name yet surely without any great reason mr pt by this time all the parish know it had told that thereabouts there lurked a wicked imp they call a poet who prowld the country far and near bewitched the children of the peasants dried up the cows and lamed the deer and sucked the eggs and killed the pheasants my lady heard their joint petition swore by her coronet and ermine she would issue out her high commission to rid the manor of such vermin the heroines undertook the task through lanes unknown over styles they ventured raped at the door nor stayed to ask but bounce into the parlour entered the trembling family they daunt they flirt they sing they laugh they tattle rummage his mother pinch his aunt and up stairs in a whirlwind rattle each hole and cupboard they explore each creek and cranny of his chamber run hurryskurry round the floor and over the bed and tester clamber into the drawers and china pry papers and books a huge imbroglio under a teacup he might lie or creased like dogsears in a folio on the first marching of the troops the muses hopeless of his pardon conveyed him underneath their hoops to a small closet in the garden so rumor says who will believe but that they left the door ajar where safe and laughing in his sleeve he heard the distant din of war short was his joy he little knew the power of magic was no fable out of the window whisk they flew fancy is here so much blended with the humor that i believe the two stanzas which succeed this line are amongst those which are the least relished by the generality the description of the spell i know has appeared to many persons absolutely unintelligible yet if the reader adverts to that peculiar idea which runs through the whole i imagine the obscurity complained of will be removed an incident we see so slight as the simple matter of fact required something like machinery to enliven it accordingly the author chose with propriety enough to employ for that purpose those notions of witchcraft ghosts and enchantment which prevailed at the time when the mansion house was built he describes himself as a demon of the lowest class a wicked imp who lamed the deer etc against whose malevolent power lady cobham the gloriana of the piece employs two superior enchantresses congruity of imagery therefore required the card they left upon the table to be converted into a spell now all the old writers on these subjects are very minute in describing the materials of such talismans hence therefore his grotesque idea of a composition of transparent birdlime edged with invisible chains in order to catch and draw him to the tribunal without going further for examples of this kind of imagery than the poets own works let me instance two passages of the serious kind similar to this ludicrous one in his ode entitled the bard  above below the rose of snow etc and again in the fatal sisters  see the griesly texture grow it must however be allowed that no person can fully relish this burlesque who is not much conversant with the old romancewriters and with the poets who formed themselves on their model but left a spell upon the table the words too eager to unriddle the poet felt a strange disorder transparent birdlime formed the middle and chains invisible the border so cunning was the apparatus the powerful pothooks did so move him that will he nill he to the greathouse he went as if the devil drove him the humor of this and the following stanza is more pure and consequently more obvious it might have been written by prior and the wit at the end is much in his best manner yet on his way no sign of grace for folks in fear are apt to pray to phoebus he preferred his case and begged his aid that dreadful day the godhead would have backed his quarrel but with a blush on recollection owned that his quiver and his laurel against four such eyes were no protection the court was sat the culprit there forth from their gloomy mansions creeping here fancy is again uppermost and soars as high on her comic as on another occasion she does on her lyric wing for now a chorus of ghostly old women of quality come to give sentence on the culprit poet just as the spirits of cadwallo urien and hoel join the bard in dreadful symphony to denounce vengeance on edward i the route of fancy we see is the same both on the humorous and sublime occasion no wonder therefore if either of them should fail of being generally tasted the lady janes and joans repair and from the gallery stand peeping such as in silence of the night come sweep along some winding entry the housekeeper g styack has often seen the sight or at

of my house i cannot say much the house he was rebuilding in cornhill see letter vii of this section  i wish i could but for my heart it is no less yours than it has long been and the last thing in the world that will throw it into tumults is a fine lady the verses you so kindly try to keep in countenance were written merely to divert lady cobham and her family and succeeded accordingly but being showed about in town are not liked there at all mrs  a very fashionable personage told mr walpole that she had seen a thing by a friend of his which she did not know what to make of for it aimed at every thing and meant nothing to which he replied that he had always taken her for a woman of sense and was very sorry to be undeceived on the other hand the stanzas elegy in a country churchyard which i now enclose to you have had the misfortune by mr walpoles fault to be made still more public for which they certainly were never meant but it is too late to complain they have been so applauded it is quite a shame to repeat it i mean not to be modest but it is a shame for those who have said such superlative things about them that i cannot repeat them i should have been glad that you and two or three more people had liked them which would have satisfied my ambition on this head amply i have been this month in town not at newcastlehouse but diverting myself among my gay acquaintance and return to my cell with so much the more pleasure i dare not speak of my future excursion to durham for fear of a disapointment but at present it is my full intention   letter xv mr gray to mr walpole cambridge feb         as you have brought me into a little sort of distress you must assist me i believe to get out of it as well as i can yesterday i had the misfortune of receiving a letter from certain gentlemen as their bookseller expresses it who have taken the magazine of magazines into their hands they tell me that an ingenious poem called reflections in a country churchyard has been communicated to them which they are printing forthwith that they are informed that the excellent author of it is i by name and that they beg not only his indulgence but the honor of his correspondence etc as i am not at all disposed to be either so indulgent or so correspondent as they desire i have but one bad way left to escape the honor they would inflict upon me and therefore am obliged to desire you would make dodsley print it immediately which may be done in less than a weeks time from your copy but without my name in what form is most convenient for him but on his best paper and character he must correct the press himself and print it without any interval between the stanzas because the sense is in some places continued beyond them and the title must be  elegy written in a country churchyard if he would add a line or two to say it came into his hands by accident i should like it better if you behold the magazine of magazines in the light that i do you will not refuse to give yourself this trouble on my account which you have taken of your own accord before now if dodsley do not do this immediately he may as well let it alone   letter xvi mr gray to dr wharton dec         have you read madame de maintenons letters they are undoubtedly genuine they begin very early in her life before she married scarron and continue after the kings death to within a little while of her own they bear all the marks of a noble spirit in her adversity particularly of virtue and unaffected devotion insomuch that i am almost persuaded she was actually married to lewis the xiv and never his mistress and this not out of any policy or ambition but conscience for she was what we should call a bigot yet with great good sense in short she was too good for a court misfortunes in the beginning of her life had formed her mind naturally lively and impatient to reflection and a habit of piety she was always miserable while she had the care of madame de montespans children timid and very cautious of making use of that unlimited power she rose to afterward for fear of trespassing on the kings friendship for her and after his death not at all afraid of meeting her own  i do not know what to say to you with regard to racine it sounds to me as if any body should fall upon shakespeare who indeed lies infinitely more open to criticism of all kinds but i should not care to be the person that undertook it if you do not like athaliah or britannicus there is no more to be said i have done  bishop halls satires called virgidemiae are lately republished they are full of spirit and poetry as much of the first as dr done and far more of the latter they were written at the university when he was about twentythree years old and in queen elizabeths time  you do not say whether you have read the crito of plato  i only recommend the dramatic part of the phaedo to you not the argumentative the subject of the erastae is good it treats of that peculiar character and turn of mind which belongs to a true philosopher but it is shorter than one would wish the euthyphro i would not read at all   letter xvii mr gray to mr walpole stoke jan      i am at present at stoke to which place i came at half an hours warning upon the news i received of my mothers illness and did not expect to have found her alive but when i arrived she was much better and continues so i shall therefore be very glad to make you a visit at strawberryhill whenever you give me notice of a convenient time i am surprised at the print a proof print of the cul de lamp which mr bentley designed for the elegy in a country churchyard and which represents a villagefuneral this occasioned the pleasant mistake of his two aunts the remainder of the letter relates entirely to the projected publication of mr bentleys designs which were printed after by dodsley this same year the latter part of it where he so vehemently declares against having his head prefixed to that work will appear highly characteristical to those readers who were personally acquainted with mr gray the print which was taken from an original picture painted by echart in mr walpoles possession was actually more than half engraved but afterward on this account suppressed  which far surpasses my idea of london graving the drawing itself was so finished that i suppose it did not require all the art i had imagined to copy it tolerably my aunts seeing me open your letter took it to be a buryingticket and asked whether any body had left me a ring and so they still conceive it to be even with all their spectacles on heaven forbid they should suspect it to belong to any verses of mine they would burn me for a poet on my own part i am satisfied if this design of yours succeed so well as you intend it and yet i know it will be accompanied with something not at all agreeable to me  while i write this i receive your second letter  sure you are not out of your wits this i know if you suffer my head to be printed you will infallibly put me out of mine i conjure you immediately to put a stop to any such design who is at the expense of engraving it i know not but if it be dodsley i will make up the loss to him the thing as it was i know will make me ridiculous enough but to appear in proper person at the head of my works consisting of half a dozen ballads in thirty pages would be worse than the pillory i do assure you if i had received such a book with such a frontispiece without any warning i believe it would have given me a palsy therefore i rejoice to have received this notice and shall not be easy till you tell me all thoughts of it are laid aside i am extremely in earnest and cannot bear even the idea  i had written to dodsley if i had not received yours to tell him how little i liked the title which he meant to prefix but your letter has put all that out of my head if you think it necessary to print these explanations see the abovementioned designs where the explanations here alluded to are inserted for the use of people that have no eyes i should be glad they were a little altered i am to my shame in your debt for a long letter but i cannot think of any thing else till you have set me at ease on this matter   while mr bentley was employed in making the designs mentioned in the preceding letter mr gray who greatly admired not only the elegance of his fancy but also the neatness as well as facility of his execution began a complimentary poem to him which i shall now insert many readers will perhaps think the panegyric carried too far as i own i did when he first showed it me yet it is but justice to declare that the original drawings now in mr walpoles possession which i have since seen are so infinitely superior to the published engravings of them that a person who has only seen the latter can by no means judge of the excellencies of the former besides there is so much of grotesque fancy in the designs themselves that it can be no great matter of wonder even if the engravers had done justice to them that they failed to please universally what i have said in defense of the long story might easily be applied to these productions of the sister art but not to detain the reader from the perusal of a fragment many stanzas of which are equal in poetical merit to the best in his most finished poems i shall here only add that it was for the sake of the design which mr bentley made for the long story that mr gray permitted it to be printed yet not without clearly forseeing that he risked somewhat by the publication of it as he intimates in the preceding letter and indeed the event showed his judgment to be true in this particular as it proved the least popular of all his productions  stanzas to mr bentley in silent gaze the tuneful choir among half pleased half blushing let the muse admire while bentley leads her sisterart along and bids the pencil answer to the lyre see in their course each transitory thought fixed by his touch a lasting essence take each dream in fancys airy coloring wrought to local symmetry and life awake the tardy rhymes that used to linger on to censure cold and negligent of fame in swifter measures animated run and catch a luster from his genuine flame ah could they catch his strength his easy grace his quick creation his unerring line the energy of pope they might efface and drydens harmony submit to mine but not to one in this benighted age is that diviner inspiration given that burns in shakespeares or in miltons page the pomp and prodigality of heaven as when conspiring in the diamonds blaze the meaner gems that singly charm the sight together dart their intermingled rays and dazzle with a luxury of light a corner of the only manuscript copy which mr gray left of this fragment is unfortunately torn and though i have endeavored to supply the chasm i am not quite satisfied with the words which i have inserted in the third line i print my additions in italics and shall be much pleased if any reader finds a better supplement to this imperfect stanza enough for me if to some feeling breast my lines a secret sympathy impart and as their pleasing influence flows confessed a sigh of soft reflection heave the heart in the march following mr gray lost that mother for whom on all occasions we have seen he showed so tender a regard she was buried in the same vault where her sisters remains had been deposited more than three years before as the inscription on the tombstone at least the latter part of it is undoubtedly of mr grays writing it here would claim a place even if it had not a peculiar pathos to recommend it and at the same time a true inscriptive simplicity in the vault beneath are deposited in the same pious confidence  letter xviii mr gray to mr mason durham dec         a little while before i received your melancholy letter i had been informed by mr charles avison of one of the sad events you mention the death of my father and of dr marmaduke pricket a young physician of my own age with whom i was brought up from infancy who died of the same infectious fever  i know what it is to lose persons that ones eyes and heart have long been used to and i never desire to part with the remembrance of that loss nor would wish you should it is something that you had a little time to acquaint yourself with the idea beforehand and that your father suffered but little pain the only thing that makes death terrible after i have said this i cannot help expressing my surprise at the disposition he has made of his affairs i must if you will suffer me to say so call it great weakness and yet perhaps your affliction for him is heightened by that very weakness for i know it is possible to feel an additional sorrow for the faults of those we have loved even where that fault has been greatly injurious to ourselves  let me desire you not to expose yourself to any further danger in the midst of that scene of sickness and death but withdraw as soon as possible to some place at a little distance in the country for i do not in the least like the situation you are in i do not attempt to console you on the situation your fortune is left in if it were far worse the good opinion i have of you tells me you will never the sooner do any thing mean or unworthy of yourself and consequently i cannot pity you on this account but i sincerely do on the new loss you have had of a good and friendly man whose memory i honor i have seen the scene you describe and know how dreadful it is i know too i am the better for it we are all idle and thoughtless things and have no sense no use in the world any longer than that sad impression lasts the deeper it is engraved the better   letter xix mr gray to dr wharton stoke sept         i am glad you enter into the spirit of strawberry castle it has a purity and propriety of gothicism in it with very few exceptions that i have not seen elsewhere my lord radnors vagaries i see did not keep you from doing justice to his situation which far surpasses every thing near it and i do not know a more laughing scene than that about twickenham and richmond dr akenside i perceive is no conjurer in architecture especially when he talks of the ruins of persepolis which are no more gothic than they are chinese the egyptian style see dr pococke not his discourses but his prints was apparently the mother of the greek and there is such a similitude between the egyptian and those persian ruins as gave diodorus room to affirm that the old buildings of persia were certainly performed by egyptian artists as to the other part of your friends opinion that the gothic manner is the saracen or moorish he has a great authority to support him that of sir christopher wren and yet i cannot help thinking it undoubtedly wrong the palaces in spain i never saw but in description which gives us little or no idea of things but the doges palace at venice i have seen which is in the arabesque manner and the houses of barbary you may see in dr shaws book not to mention abundance of other eastern buildings in turkey persia etc that we have views of and they seem plainly to be corruptions of the greek architecture broke into little parts indeed and covered with little ornaments but in a taste very distinguishable from that which we call gothic there is one thing that runs through the moorish buildings that an imitator would certainly have been first struck with and would have tried to copy and that is the cupolas which cover every thing baths apartments and even kitchens yet who ever saw a gothic cupola it is a thing plainly of greek original i do not see any thing but the slender spires that serve for steeples which may perhaps be borrowed from the saracen minarets on their mosques  i take it ill you should say any thing against the mole it is a reflection i see cast at the thames do you think that rivers which have lived in london and its neighborhood all their days will run roaring and tumbling about like your tramontane torrents in the north no they only glide and whisper   letter xx mr gray to dr wharton cambridge march        i do not pretend to humble any ones pride i love my own too well to attempt it as to mortifying their vanity it is too easy and too mean a task for me to delight in you are very good in showing so much sensibility on my account but be assured my taste for praise is not like that of children for fruit if there were nothing but medlars and blackberries in the world i could be very well content to go without any at all i dare say that mason though some years younger than i was as little elevated with the approbation of lord  and lord  as i am mortified by their silence  with regard to publishing i am not so much against the thing itself as of publishing this ode alone his ode on the progress of poetry  i have two or three ideas more in my head what is to come of them must they too come out in the shape of little sixpenny flams dropping one after another till mr dodsley thinks fit to collect them with mr thiss song and mr tothers epigram into a pretty volume i am sure mason must be sensible of this and therefore cannot mean what he says neither am i quite of your opinion with regard to strophe and antistrophe he often made the same remark to me in conversation which led me to form the last ode of caractacus in shorter stanzas but we must not imagine that he thought the regular pindaric method without its use though as he justly says when formed in long stanzas it does not fully succeed in point of effect on the ear for there was nothing which he more disliked than that chain of irregular stanzas which cowley introduced and falsely called pindaric and which from the extreme facility of execution produced a number of miserable imitators had the regular return of strophe antistrophe and epode no other merit than that of extreme difficulty it ought on this very account to be valued because we well know that easy writing is no easy reading it is also to be remarked that mr congreve who though without any lyrical powers first introduced the regular pindaric form into the english language made use of the short stanzas which mr gray here recommends see his ode to the queen works vol iii p     ed birm  setting aside the difficulty of execution methinks it has little or no effect on the ear which scarce perceives the regular return of metres at so great a distance from one another to make it succeed i am persuaded the stanzas must not consist of above nine lines each at the most pindar has several such odes   mr gray intimates in the foregoing letter that he had two or three more lyrical ideas in his head one of these was the bard the exordium of which was at this time finished i say finished because his conceptions as well as his manner of disposing them were so singularly exact that he had seldom occasion to make many except verbal emendations after he had first committed his lines to paper it was never his method to sketch his general design in careless verse i have many of his critical letters by me on my own compositions letters which though they would not much amuse the public in general contain excellent lessons for young poets from one of these i extract the following passage which seems to explain this matter more fully extreme conciseness of expression yet pure perspicuous and musical is one of the grand beauties of lyric poetry this i have always aimed at and never could attain the necessity of rhyming is one great obstacle to it another and perhaps a stronger is that way you have chosen of casting down your first thoughts carelessly and at large and then clipping them here and there at leisure this method after all possible pains will leave behind it a laxity a diffuseness the frame of a thought otherwise wellinvented wellturned and wellplaced is often weakened by it do i talk nonsense or do you understand me i am persuaded what i say is true in my head whatever it may be in prose for i do not pretend to write prose nothing can be more just than this remark yet as i say above it is a mode of writing which is only calculated for smaller compositions but mr gray though he applied it here to an ode was apt to think it a general rule now if an epic or dramatic poet was to resolve to finish every part of his work as highly as we have seen mr gray labored his first scene of agrippina i am apt to think he would tire of it as soon as he did for in the course of so multifarious a work he would find himself obliged to expunge some of the best written parts in order to preserve the unity of the whole i know only one way to prevent this and that was the method which racine followed who as his son tells us in that amusing life though much zested with bigotry which he has given us of his father when he began a drama disposed every part of it accurately in prose and when he had connected all the scenes together used to say ma tragedy est faite see la vie de jean racine p     see also his sons other works tom  d for a specimen in a first act of the iphigenia in tauris m racine it seems was an easy versifier in a language in which they say it is more difficult than in ours to versify it certainly is so with regard to dramatic compositions i am on this account persuaded that if the great poet had written in english he would have drawn out his first sketches not in prose but in careless blank verse yet this i give as mere matter of opinion  he always finished as he proceeded this though it made his execution slow made his compositions more perfect i think however that this method was only calculated to produce such short works as generally employed his poetical pen and that from pursuing it he grew tired of his larger designs before he had completed them the fact seems to justify my opinion but my principal reason for mentioning this at present is to explain the cause why i have not been scrupulous in publishing so many of his fragments in the course of these memoirs it would have been unpardonable in me to have taken this liberty with a deceased friend had i not found his lines as far as they went nearly as high finished as they would have been when completed if i am mistaken in this i hope the reader will rather impute it to a defect in my own judgment than a want of respect to mr grays memory  this consideration however emboldens me to print the following fragment of an ode in this place which was unquestionably another of the ideas alluded to in the preceding letter since i find in his memorandumbook of the preceding year      a sketch of his design as follows contrast between the winter past and coming spring  joy owing to that vicissitude  many who never feel that delight  sloth  envy ambition how much happier the rustic who feels it though he knows not how i print this careless note in order that the reader may conceive the intended arrangement of the whole who i doubt not will on perusing the following beautiful stanzas lament with me that he left it incomplete nor will it console him for the loss if i tell him that i have had the boldness to attempt to finish it myself making use of some other lines and broken stanzas which he had written but as my aim in undertaking this difficult task was merely to elucidate the poets general meaning i do not think that my additions are worthy to be inserted in this place they will find a more fit situation if thrown amongst those notes which i shall put at the end of his poems  ode now the golden morn aloft waves her dewbespangled wing with vermil cheek and whisper soft she wooes the tardy spring till april starts and calls around the sleeping fragrance from the ground and lightly over the living scene scatters his freshest tenderest green newborn flocks in rustic dance frisking ply their feeble feet forgetful of their wintry trance the birds his presence greet but chief the skylark warbles high his trembling thrilling extacy and lessening from the dazzled sight melts into air and liquid light yesterday the sullen year saw the snowy whirlwind fly mute was the music of the air the herd stood drooping by their raptures now that wildly flow no yesterday nor morrow know it is man alone that joy descries with forward and reverted eyes smiles on past misfortunes brow soft reflections hand can trace and over the cheek of sorrow throw a melancholy grace while hope prolongs our happier hour or deepest shades that dimly lower and blacken round our weary way gilds with a gleam of distant day still where rosy pleasure leads see a kindred grief pursue behind the steps that misery treads approaching comfort view the hues of bliss more brightly glow chastisd by sabler tints of woe and blended form with artful strife the strength and harmony of life see the wretch that long has tossed on the thorny bed of pain at length repair his vigor lost and breathe and walk again the meanest floweret of the vale the simplest note that swells the gale the common sun the air the skies to him are opening paradise     a third of these ideas i find in his commonplace book on the same page with his argument for the bard i shall insert this with some remarks upon it in my additional notes to his poems  i do not believe that he ever even began to compose the ode itself but the thought is as follows  all that men of power can do for men of genius is to leave them at their liberty compared to birds that when confined to a cage do but regret the loss of their freedom in melancholy strains and lose the luscious wildness and happy luxuriance of their notes which used to make the woods resound those who are conversant in the arrangement of a lyrical composition will easily perceive from this short argument that the ode would have opened with the simile which when adorned with those thoughts that breathe and words that burn that mr grays muse could so richly supply would have been at once a fine exordium and at the same time a natural introduction to the truth he meant to impress this however could hardly have been done without some little aid borrowed from satire for however true his proposition may be that all that men of power can do for men of genius is to leave them at their liberty or as i should put it that their best patronage signifies nothing if it abridges them of that liberty yet the fact is that neither of the parties are convinced of this truth till they have tried the experiment and find some reason or other no matter whether good or bad to think they had better never have tried it mons dalembert who has written an excellent essay on this subject which mr gray greatly admired and which perhaps gave him the first idea of this intended ode puts one of the more common of these reasons in so lively a manner that it may not be amiss here to insert it  parmi les grands seigneurs les plus affables il en est peu qui se depouillent avec des gens de lettres de leur grandeur vraie ou pretendue jusqu au point de loublier toutafait cest ce quon appercoit sur tout dans les conversations ou lon nest pas de leur avis il semble qua mesure que lhomme desprit seclipse lhomme de qualite se montre et paroisse exiger la deference dont lhomme desprit avoit commence par dispenser aussi le commerce intime des grands avec les gens de lettres ne finit que trop souvent par quelque rupture eclatante rupture qui vient presque toujours de loubli des regards reciproques auxquelles on a manque de part ou dautre peut etre meme des deux cotes essai sur la societe des grands avec les gens de lettres melanges de litterature and philosophy tom  d p     however i think a man of letters ought to have other reasons besides this for breaking such a connection after it has been once formed  i have now given the reader the best account in my power of what our authors unfinished lyrical ideas consisted i believe they are all that he in any sort committed to paper and probably those which he immediately alluded to in the preceding letter  letter xxi mr gray to mr stonhewer now auditor of excise his friendship with mr gray commenced at college and continued till the death of the latter  august         i thank you for your intelligence about herculaneum which was the first news i received of it i have since turned over monsignor baiardis book i believe the book here ridiculed was published by the authority of the king of naples but afterward on finding how ill qualified the author was to execute the task the business of describing the antiquities found at herculaneum was put into other hands who have certainly as far as they have gone performed it much better  where i have learned how many grains of modern wheat the roman congius in the capitol holds and how many thousandth parts of an inch the greek foot consisted of more or less for i forget which than our own he proves also by many affecting examples that an antiquary may be mistaken that for any thing any body knows this place under ground might be some other place and not herculaneum but nevertheless that he can show for certain that it was this place and no other place that it is hard to say which of the several herculess was the founder therefore in the third volume he promises to give us the memoirs of them all and after that if we do not know what to think of the matter he will tell us there is a great deal of wit too and satire and verses in the book which is intended chiefly for the information of the french king who will be greatly edified without doubt  i am much obliged to you also for voltaires performance it is very unequal as he is apt to be in all but his dramas and looks like the work of a man that will admire his retreat and his lemanlake no longer than till he finds an opportunity to leave it i do not recollect the title of this poem but it was a small one which m de voltaire wrote when he first settled at ferney by the long residence he has since made there it appears either that our author was mistaken in his conjecture or that an opportunity of leaving it had not yet happened  however though there be many parts which i do not like yet it is in several places excellent and every where above mediocrity as you have the politeness to pretend impatience and desire i would communicate and all that i annex a piece of the prophecy the second antistrophe and epode with a few lines of the third strophe of his ode entitled the bard were here inserted  which must be true at least as it was wrote so many hundred years after the events   letter xxii mr gray to dr wharton pembrokehall march         though i had no reasonable excuse for myself before i received your last letter yet since that time i have had a pretty good one having been taken up in quarrelling with peterhouse the reason of mr grays changing his college which is here only glanced at was in few words this two or three young men of fortune who lived in the same staircase had for some time intentionally disturbed him with their riots and carried their ill behavior so far as frequently to awaken him at midnight after having borne with their insults longer than might reasonably have been expected even from a man of less warmth of temper mr gray complained to the governing part of the society and not thinking that his remonstrance was sufficiently attended to quitted the college the slight manner in which he mentions this affair when writing to one of his most intimate friends certainly does honor to the placability of his disposition  and in removing myself from thence to pembroke this may be looked upon as a sort of era in a life so barren of events as mine yet i shall treat it in voltaires manner and only tell you that i left my lodgings because the rooms were noisy and the people of the house uncivil this is all i would choose to have said about it but if you in private should be curious enough to enter into a particular detail of facts and minute circumstances the bearer who was witness to them will probably satisfy you all i shall say more is that i am for the present extremely well lodged here and as quiet as in the grand chartreuse and that every body even dr long himself are as civil as they could be to foundress of the college mary of valens in person  with regard to any advice i can give you about your being physician to the hospital i frankly own it ought to give way to a much better judge especially so disinterested a one as dr heberden i love refusals no more than you do but as to your fears of effluvia i maintain that one sick rich patient has more of pestilence and putrefaction about him than a whole ward of sick poor  the similitude between the italian republics and those of ancient greece has often struck me as it does you i do not wonder that sullys memoirs have highly entertained you but cannot agree with you in thinking him or his master two of the best men in the world the king was indeed one of the bestnatured men that ever lived but it is owing only to chance that his intended marriage with madame destrees or with the marquise de verneuil did not involve him and the kingdom in the most inextricable confusion and his design upon the princess of conde in his old age was worse still as to the minister his base application to concini after the murder of henry has quite ruined him in my esteem and destroyed all the merit of that honest surly pride for which i honored him before yet i own that as kings and ministers go they were both extraordinary men pray look at the end of birchs state papers of sir j edmonds for the character of the french court at that time it is written by sir george carew  you should have received masons present the four odes which i had just published separately last saturday i desire you to tell me your critical opinion of the new odes and also whether you have found out two lines which he has inserted in his third to a friend which are superlative i should leave the reader to guess if he thought it worth his while what this couplet was which is here commended so much beyond its merit did not the ode conclude with a compliment to mr gray in which part he might probably look for it as those lines were written with the greater care to secure therefore my friend from any imputation of vanity whatever becomes of myself i shall here insert the passage while through the west where sinks the crimson day meek twilight slowly sails and waves her banners gray     we do not expect the world which is just going to be invaded will bestow much attention on them if you hear any thing you will tell us   letter xxiii mr gray to dr wharton june         though i allow abundance for your kindness and partiality to me i am yet much pleased with the good opinion you seem to have of the bard i have not however done a word more than the little you have seen having been in a very listless unpleasant and inutile state of mind for this long time for which i shall beg you to prescribe me somewhat strengthening and agglutinant lest it turn to a confirmed pthisis  i recommend two little french books to you one called memoirs de m de la port it has all the air of simplicity and truth and contains some few very extraordinary facts relating to anne of austria and cardinal mazarine the other is in two small volumes memoirs de madame staal the facts are no great matter but the manner and vivacity make them interesting she was a sort of confidante to the late duchess of maine and imprisoned a long time on her account during the regency  i ought before now to have thanked you for your kind offer which i mean soon to accept for a reason which to be sure can be none to you and mrs wharton and therefore i think it my duty to give you notice of it i have told you already of my mental ailments and it is a very possible thing also that i may be bodily ill again in town which i would not choose to be in a dirty inconvenient lodging where perhaps my nurse might stifle me with a pillow and therefore it is no wonder if i prefer your house but i tell you of this in time that if either of you are frightened at the thoughts of a sick body you may make a handsome excuse and save yourselves this trouble you are not however to imagine my illness is in esse no it is only in posse otherwise i should be scrupulous of bringing it home to you i think i shall be with you in about a fortnight   letter xxiv mr gray to mr mason stoke july         i feel a contrition for my long silence and yet perhaps it is the last thing you trouble your head about nevertheless i will be as sorry as if you took it ill i am sorry too to see you so punctilious as to stand upon answers and never to come near me till i have regularly left my name at your door like a mercers wife that imitates people who go a visiting i would forgive you this if you could possibly suspect i were doing any thing that i liked better for then your formality might look like being piqued at my negligence which has somewhat in it like kindness but you know i am at stoke hearing seeing doing absolutely nothing not such a nothing as you do at tunbridge chequered and diversisied with a succession of fleeting colors but heavy lifeless without form and void sometimes almost as black as the moral of voltaires lisbon his poem sur la destruction de lisbon published about that time  which angers you so i have had no more muscular inflations and am only troubled with this depression of mind you will not expect therefore i should give you any account of my verve which is at best you know of so delicate a constitution and has such weak nerves as not to stir out of its chamber above three days in a year but i shall enquire after yours and why it is off again it has certainly worse nerves than mine if your reviewers have frighted it sure i not to mention a score of your other critics am something a better judge than all the manmidwives and presbyterian parsons the reviewers at the time were supposed to be of these professions that ever were born pray give me leave to ask you do you find yourself tickled with the commendations of such people for you have your share of these too i dare say not your vanity has certainly a better taste and can then the censure of such critics move you i own it is an impertinence in these gentry to talk of one at all either in good or in bad but this we must all swallow i mean not only we that write but all the wes that ever did any thing to be talked of  while i am writing i receive yours and rejoice to find that the genial influences of this fine season which produce nothing in me have hatched high and unimaginable fantasies in you i had sent him my first idea of caractacus drawn out in a short argument i see methinks as i sit on snowdon some glimpse of mona and her haunted shades and hope we shall be very good neighbors any druidical anecdotes that i can meet with i will be sure to send you when i return to cambridge but i cannot pretend to be learned without books or to know the druids from modern bishops at this distance i can only tell you not to go and take mona for the isle of man it is anglesey a tract of plain country very fertile but picturesque only from the view it has of caernarvonshire from which it is separated by the menai a narrow arm of the sea forgive me for supposing in you such a want of erudition  i congratulate you on our glorious successes in the mediterranean shall we go in time and hire a house together in switzerland it is a fine poetical country to look at and no body there will understand a word we say or write   letter xxv mr gray to mr mason cambridge may      you are so forgetful of me that i should not forgive it but that i suppose caractacus may be the better for it yet i hear nothing from him neither in spite of his promises there is no faith in man no not in a welchman and yet mr parry a capital performer on the welsh harp and who was either born blind or had been so from his infancy has been here and scratched out such ravishing blind harmony such tunes of a thousand years old with names enough to choke you as have set all this learned body a dancing and inspired them with due reverence for my old bard his countryman whenever he shall appear mr parry you must know has put my ode in motion again and has brought it at last to a conclusion it is to him therefore that you owe the treat which i send you enclosed namely the breast and merrythought and rump too of the chicken which i have been chewing so long that i would give the world for neckbeef or cowheel  you will observe in the beginning of this thing some alterations of a few words partly for improvement and partly to avoid repetitions of like words and rhymes yet i have not got rid of them all the six last lines of the fifth stanza are new tell me whether they will do i am well aware of many weakly things toward the conclusion but i hope the end itself will do give me your full and true opinion and that not upon deliberation but forthwith mr hurd himself allows that lion port is not too bold for queen elizabeth  i have got the old scotch ballad on which douglas he had a high opinion of this first drama of mr home in a letter to another friend dated august  0 this year he says i am greatly struck with the tragedy of douglas though it has infinite faults the author seems to me to have retrieved the true language of the stage which had been lost for these hundred years and there is one scene between matilda and the old peasant so masterly that it strikes me blind to all the defects in the world the ballad which he here applauds is to be found in mr percys relics of ancient poetry vol iii p    a work published after the date of this letter was founded it is divine and as long as from hence to aston have you never seen it aristotles best rules are observed in it in a manner that shows the author had never read aristotle it begins in the fifth act of the play you may read it two thirds through without guessing what it is about and yet when you come to the end it is impossible not to understand the whole story i send you the two first stanzas   letter xxvi mr gray to mr hurd stoke august         i do not know why you should thank me for what you had a right and title to a present of his two pindaric odes just then published  but attribute it to the excess of your politeness and the more so because almost no one else has made me the same compliment as your acquaintance in the university you say do me the honor to admire it would be ungenerous in me not to give them notice that they are doing a very unfashionable thing for all people of condition are agreed not to admire nor even to understand one very great man writing to an acquaintance of his and mine says that he had read them seven or eight times and that now when he next sees him he shall not have above thirty questions to ask another a peer believes that the last stanza of the second ode relates to king charles the first and oliver cromwell even my friends tell me they do not succeed and write me moving topics of consolation on that head in short i have heard of no body but an actor and a doctor of divinity that profess their esteem for them an extract from a letter to dr wharton dated october        will explain this dr warburton is come to town and i am told likes them extremely he says the world never passed so just an opinion upon any thing as upon them for that in other things they have affected to like or dislike whereas here they own they do not understand which he looks upon to be very true but yet thinks they understand them as well as milton or shakespeare whom they are obliged by fashion to admire mr garricks complimentary verses to me you have seen i am told they were printed in the chronicle of last saturday the critical review is in raptures but mistakes the aeolian lyre for the harp of aeolus and on this pleasant error founds both a compliment and a criticism this is all i have heard that signifies any thing  oh yes a lady of quality a friend of masons who is a great reader she knew there was a compliment to dryden but never suspected there was any thing said about shakespeare or milton till it was explained to her and wishes that there had been titles prefixed to tell what they were about  from this mention of masons name you may think perhaps we are great correspondents no such thing i have not heard from him these two months i will be sure to scold in my own name as well as in yours i rejoice to hear you are so ripe for the press and so voluminous not for my own sake only whom you flatter with the hopes of seeing your labors both public and private but for yours too for to be employed is to be happy this principle of mine and i am convinced of its truth has as usual no influence on my practice i am alone and ennuye to the last degree yet do nothing indeed i have one excuse my health which you have so kindly enquired after is not extraordinary ever since i came hither it is no great malady but several little ones that seem brewing no good to me it will be a particular pleasure to me to hear whether content dwells in leicestershire and how she entertains herself there only do not be too happy nor forget entirely the quiet ugliness of cambridge   letter xxvii mr gray to mr mason stoke sept         i have as i desired mr stonhewer to tell you read over caractacus twice not with pleasure only but with emotion you may say what you will but the contrivance the manners the interests the passions and the expression go beyond the dramatic part in the manuscript now before him mr gray had only the first ode the others were not then written and although the dramatic part was brought to a conclusion yet it was afterward in many places altered he was mistaken with regard to the opinion the world would have about it that world which usually loves to be led in such matters rather than form an opinion for itself was taught a different sentiment and one of its leaders went so far as to declare that he never knew a second work fall so much below a first from the same hand to oppose mr grays judgment to his i must own gives me some satisfaction and to enjoy it i am willing to risk that imputation of vanity which may probably fall to my share for having published this letter i must add however that some of my friends advised it for the sake of the more general criticisms which they thought too valuable to be suppressed of your elfrida many many leagues i even say though you will think me a bad judge of this that the world will like it better i am struck with the chorus who are not there merely to sing and dance but bear throughout a principal part in the action and have beside the costume which is excellent as much a character of their own as any other person i am charmed with their priestly pride and obstinacy when after all is lost they resolve to confront the roman general and spit in his face but now i am going to tell you what touches me most from the beginning the first opening is greatly improved the curiosity of didius is now a very natural reason for dwelling on each particular of the scene before him nor is the description at all too long i am glad to find the two young men are cartismanduas sons they interest me far more i love people of condition they were men before that no body knew one could not make them a bow if one had met them at a public place  i always admired that interruption of the druids to evelina peace virgin peace etc and chiefly the abstract idea personified to use the words of a critic at the end of it that of caractacus would save my queen etc and still more that i know it reverend fathers it is heavens high will etc to i have done begin the rites this latter is exemplary for the expression always the great point with me i do not mean by expression the mere choice of words but the whole dress fashion and arrangement of a thought here in particular it is the brokenness the ungrammatical position the total subversion of the period that charms me all that ushers in the incantation from try we yet what holiness can do i am delighted with in quite another way for this is pure poetry as it ought to be forming the proper transition and leading on the mind to that still purer poetry that follows it  in the beginning of the succeeding act i admire the chorus again is it not now the hour the holy hour etc and their evasion of a lie say thou proud boy etc and sleep with the unsund silver which is an example of a dramatic simile the sudden appearance of caractacus the pretended respect and admiration of vellinus and the probability of his story the distrust of the druids and their reasoning with caractacus and particularly that it is meet thou should thou art a king etc and mark me prince the time will come when destiny etc are well and happily imagined apropos of the last striking passage i have mentioned i am going to make a digression  when we treat a subject where the manners are almost lost in antiquity our stock of ideas must needs be small and nothing betrays our poverty more than the returning to and harping frequently on one image it was therefore i thought you should omit some lines before though good in themselves about the scythed car that the passage now before us might appear with greater luster when it came and in this i see you have complied with me but there are other ideas here and there still that occur too often particularly about the oaks some of which i would discard to make way for the rest  but the subjects i speak of to compensate and more than compensate that unavoidable poverty have one great advantage when they fall into good hands they leave an unbounded liberty to pure imagination and fiction our favorite provinces where no critic can molest or antiquary gainsay us and yet to please me these fictions must have some affinity some seeming connection with that little we really know of the character and customs of the people for example i never heard in my days that midnight and the moon were sisters that they carried rods of ebony and gold or met to whisper on the top of a mountain but now i could lay my life it is all true and do not doubt it will be found so in some pantheon of the druids that is to be discovered in the library at herculaneum the car of destiny and death is a very noble invention of the same class and as far as that goes is so fine that it makes me more delicate than perhaps i should be about the close of it andraste sailing on the wings of fame that snatches the wreaths from oblivion to hang them on her loftiest amaranth though a clear and beautiful piece of unknown mythology has too greek an air to give me perfect satisfaction  now i proceed the preparation to the chorus though so much akin to that in the former act is excellent the remarks of evelina and her suspicions of the brothers mixed with a secret inclination to the younger of them though i think her part throughout wants retouching yet please me much and the contrivance of the following scene much more masters of wisdom no etc i always admired as i do the rocking stone and the distress of elidurus evelinas examination of his is a wellinvented scene and will be with a little pains a very touching one but the introduction of arviragus is superlative i am not sure whether those few lines of his short narrative my strength repaired it boots not that i tell etc do not please me as much as any thing in the whole drama the sullen bravery of elidurus the menaces of the chorus that think not religion etc the trumpet of the druids that i will follow him though in my chains etc have thou a brother no etc the placability of the chorus when they see the motives of eliduruss obstinacy give me great contentment so do the reflections of the druid on the necessity of lustration and the reasons for vellinuss easy escape but i would not have him seize on a spear nor issue hasty through the caverns mouth why should he not steal away unasked and unmissed till the hurry of passions in those that should have guarded him was a little abated but i chiefly admire the two speeches of elidurus ah vellinus is this then etc and ye do gaze on me fathers etc the manner in which the chorus reply to him is very fine but the image at the end wants a little mending the next scene is highly moving it is so very good that i must have it made yet better  now for the last act i do not know what you would have but to me the design and contrivance of it is at least equal to any part of the whole the shortlived triumph of the britons the address of caractacus to the roman victims evelinas discovery of the ambush the mistake of the roman fires for the rising sun the death of arviragus the interview between didius and caractacus his mourning over his dead son his parting speech in which you have made all the use of tacitus that your plan would admit every thing in short but that little dispute between didius and him it is well and therefore to increase that reverence etc down to give me a moment which must be omitted or put in the mouth of the druids i approve in the highest degree if i should find any fault with the last act it could only be with trifles and little expressions if you make any alterations i fear it will never improve it i mean as to the plan i send you back the two last sheets because you bid me i reserve my nibblings and minutiae for another day   letter xxviii mr gray to mr mason cambridge dec         a life spent out of the world has its hours of despondence its inconveniences its sufferings as numerous and as real though not quite of the same sort as a life spent in the midst of it the power we have when we will exert it over our own minds joined to a little strength and consolation nay a little pride we catch from those that seem to love us is our only support in either of these conditions i am sensible i cannot return you more of this assistance than i have received from you and can only tell you that one who has far more reason than you i hope ever will have to look on life with something worse than indifference is yet no enemy to it but can look backward on many bitter moments partly with satisfaction and partly with patience and forward too on a scene not very promising with some hope and some expectations of a better day the cause however which occasioned your reflection though i can judge but very imperfectly of it does not seem at present to be weighty enough to make you take any such resolution as you meditate use it in its season as a relief from what is tiresome to you but not as if it was in consequence of any thing you take ill on the contrary if such a thing had happened at the time of your transmigration i would defer it merely to avoid that appearance  as to myself i cannot boast at present either of my spirits my situation my employments or fertility the days and the nights pass and i am never the nearer to any thing but that one to which we are all tending yet i love people that leave some traces of their journey behind them and have strength enough to advise you to do so while you can i expect to see caractacus completed and therefore i send you the books you wanted i do not know whether they will furnish you with any new matter but they are well enough written and easily read i told you before that in a time of dearth i would borrow from the edda without entering too minutely on particulars but if i did so i would make each image so clear that it might be fully understood by itself for in this obscure mythology we must not hint at things as we do with the greek fables that every body is supposed to know at school however on second thoughts i think it would be still better to graft any wild picturesque fable absolutely of ones own invention on the druidstock i mean on those half dozen of old fancies that are known to be a part of their system this will give you more freedom and latitude and will leave no hold for the critics to fasten on  i send you back the elegy elegy in the garden of a friend as you desired me to do my advices are always at your service to take or to refuse therefore you should not call them severe you know i do not love much less pique myself on criticism and think even a bad verse as good a thing or better than the best observation that ever was made upon it i like greatly the spirit and sentiment of it much of which you perhaps owe to your present train of thinking the disposition of the whole too is natural and elegiac as to the expression i would venture to say did not you forbid me that it is sometimes too easy the last line i protest against this you will say is worse than blotting out rhymes the descriptive part is excellent  pray when did i pretend to finish or even insert passages into other peoples works as if it were equally easy to pick holes and to mend them all i can say is that your elegy must not end with the worst line in it it was endeavored to be improved accordingly how it stood when this criticism upon it was written i cannot now recollect  it is flat it is prose whereas that above all ought to sparkle or at least to shine if the sentiment must stand twirl it a little into an apothegm stick a flower in it gild it with a costly expression let it strike the fancy the ear or the heart and i am satisfied  the other particular expressions which i object to i mark on the manuscript now i desire you would neither think me severe nor at all regard what i say further than as it coincides with your own judgment for the child deserves your partiality it is a healthy wellmade boy with an ingenuous countenance and promises to live long i would only wash its face dress it a little make it walk upright and strong and keep it from learning paw words  i hope you couched my refusal of being poet laureat on the death of cibber which place the late duke of devonshire then lord chamberlain desired his brother to offer to mr gray and his lordship had commissioned me then in town to write to him concerning it to lord john cavendish in as respectful terms as possible and with all due acknowledgments to the duke if you hear who it is to be given to pray let me know for i interest myself a little in the history of it and rather wish somebody may accept it that will retrieve the credit of the thing if it be retrievable or ever had any credit row was i think the last man of character that had it eusden was a person of great hopes in his youth though at last he turned out a drunken parson dryden was as disgraceful to the office from his character as the poorest scribbler could have been from his verses   letter xxix mr gray to dr wharton february         would you know what i am doing i doubt you have been told already and hold my employments cheap enough but every one must judge of his own capability and cut his amusements according to his disposition the drift of my present studies is to know wherever i am what lies within reach that may be worth seeing whether it be building ruin park garden prospect picture or monument to whom it does or has belonged and what has been the characteristic and taste of different ages you will say this is the object of all antiquaries but pray what antiquary ever saw these objects in the same light or desired to know them for a like reason in short say what you please i am persuaded whenever my list he wrote it under its several divisions on the blank pages of a pocket atlas i printed lately a few copies of this catalogue for the use of some friends curious in such matters and when i am sufficiently furnished with their observations and improvements upon it shall perhaps reprint it and give it to the public as a shorter and more useful pocket companion to the english traveller than has hitherto appeared is finished you will approve it and think it of no small use my spirits are very near the freezing point and for some hours of the day this exercise by its warmth and gentle motion serves to raise them a few degrees higher  i hope the misfortune that has befallen mrs cibbers canary bird will not be the ruin of agis it is probable you will have curiosity enough to see it as it is by the author of douglas   letter xxx mr gray to dr wharton cambridge march        it is indeed for want of spirits as you suspect that my studies lie among the cathedrals and the tombs and the ruins to think though to little purpose has been the chief amusement of my days and when i would not or cannot think i dream at present i feel myself able to write a catalogue or to read the peerage book or millers gardening dictionary and am thankful that there are such employments and such authors in the world some people who hold me cheap for this are doing perhaps what is not half so well worth while as to posterity i may ask with somebody whom i have forgot what has it ever done to oblige me  to make a transition from myself to as poor a subject the tragedy of agis i cry to think that it should be by the author of douglas why it is all modern greek the story is an antique statue painted white and red frized and dressed in a negligee made by a yorkshire mantuamaker then here is the miscellany mr dodsley has sent me the whole set gilt and lettered i thank him why the two last volumes are worse than the four first particularly dr akenside is in a deplorable way i have been told that this writer unquestionably a man of great learning and genius entertained some years before his death a notion that poetry was only true eloquence in meter and according to this idea wrote his ode to the country gentlemen of england and afterward made considerable alterations in that collection of odes which he had published in the earlier part of his life we have seen in the second letter of this section that mr gray thought highly of his descriptive talents at that time we are not therefore to impute what he here says to any prejudice in the critic but to that change of taste in the poet which if the above anecdote be true would unavoidably flatten his descriptions and divest them of all picturesque imagery nay would sometimes convert his verse into mere prose or what is worse hard inflated prose  what signifies learning and the ancients mason will say triumphantly why should people read greek to lose their imagination their ear and their mother tongue but then there is mr shenstone who trusts to nature and simple sentiment why does he do no better he goes hopping along his own gravelwalks and never deviates from the beaten paths for fear of being lost  i have read dr swift and am disappointed his history of the four last years of queen anne  there is nothing of the negotiations that i have not seen better in m de torcy before the manner is careless and has little to distinguish it from common writers i meet with nothing to please me but the spiteful characters of the opposite party and its leaders i expected much more secret history   letter xxxi mr gray to mr stonhewer cambridge august         i am as sorry as you seem to be that our acquaintance harped so much on the subject of materialism when i saw him with you in town because it was plain to which side of the longdebated question he inclined that we are indeed mechanical and dependent beings i need no other proof than my own feelings and from the same feelings i learn with equal conviction that we are not merely such that there is a power within that struggles against the force and biass of that mechanism commands its motion and by frequent practice reduces it to that ready obedience which we call habit and all this in conformity to a preconceived opinion no matter whether right or wrong to that least material of all agents a thought i have known many in his case who while they thought they were conquering an old prejudice did not perceive they were under the influence of one far more dangerous one that furnishes us with a ready apology for all our worst actions and opens to us a full license for doing whatever we please and yet these very people were not at all the more indulgent to other men as they naturally should have been their indignation to such as offended them their desire of revenge on any body that hurt them was nothing mitigated in short the truth is they wished to be persuaded of that opinion for the sake of its convenience but were not so in their heart and they would have been glad as they ought in common prudence that nobody else should think the same for fear of the mischief that might ensue to themselves his french author i never saw but have read fifty in the same strain and shall read no more i can be wretched enough without them they put me in mind of the greek sophist that got immortal honor by discoursing so feelingly on the miseries of our condition that fifty of his audience went home and hanged themselves yet he lived himself i suppose many years after in very good plight  you say you cannot conceive how lord shaftesbury came to be a philosopher in vogue i will tell you first he was a lord  dly he was as vain as any of his readers  dly men are very prone to believe what they do not understand  thly they will believe any thing at all provided they are under no obligation to believe it  thly they love to take a new road even when that road leads no where  thly he was reckoned a fine writer and seemed always to mean more than he said would you have any more reasons an interval of above forty years has pretty well destroyed the charm a dead lord ranks but with commoners vanity is no longer interested in the matter for the new road is become an old one the mode of freethinking is like that of ruffs and farthingales and has given place to the mode of not thinking at all once it was reckoned graceful half to discover and half conceal the mind but now we have been long accustomed to see it quite naked primness and affectation of style like the good breeding of queen anns court has turned to hoydening and rude familiarity   it will i think be no improper supplement to the foregoing letter to insert a paper of mr grays which contains some very pertinent strictures on the writings of a later lord who was pleased to attack the moral attributes of the deity or what amounted to the same thing endeavored to prove that we have no adequate ideas of his goodness and justice as we have of his natural ones his wisdom and power this position the excellent author of the view of lord bolingbrokes philosophy calls the main pillar of his system and adds in another place that the fate of all religion is included in this question on this important point therefore that able writer has dwelt largely and confuted his lordship effectually some sort of readers however who probably would slight that confutation may regard the arguments of a layman and even a poet more than those which are drawn up by the pen of a divine and a bishop it is for the use of these that the paper is published who if they learn nothing else from it will find that mr gray was not of their party nor so great a wit as to disbelieve the existence of a deity in one of his pocketbooks i find a slight sketch in verse of his own character which may on account of one line in it come into a note here with sufcient propriety it was written in       too poor for a bribe and too proud to importune he had not the method of making a fortune could love and could hate so was thought somewhat odd no very great wit he believed in a god a post or a pension he did not desire but left church and state to charles townshend and squire this last line needs no comment for readers of the present time and it surely is not worth while to write one on this occasion for posterity     i will allow lord bolingbroke that the moral as well as physical attributes of god must be known to us only a posteriori and that this is the only real knowledge we can have either of the one or the other i will allow too that perhaps it may be an idle distinction which we make between them his moral attributes being as much in his nature and essence as those we call his physical but the occasion of our making some distinction is plainly this his eternity infinity omniscience and almighty power are not what connect him if i may so speak with us his creatures we adore him not because he always did in every place and always will exist but because he gave and still preserves to us our own existence by an exertion of his goodness we adore him not because he knows and can do all things but because he made us capable of knowing and of doing what may conduct us to happiness it is therefore his benevolence which we adore not his greatness or power and if we are made only to bear our part in a system without any regard to our own particular happiness we can no longer worship him as our allbounteous parent there is no meaning in the term the idea of his malevolence an impiety i tremble to write must succeed we have nothing left but our fears and those too vain for whither can they lead but to despair and the sad desire of annihilation if then justice and goodness be not the same in god as in our ideas we mean nothing when we say that god is necessarily just and good and for the same reason it may as well be said that we know not what we mean when according to dr clarke evid   th we affirm that he is necessarily a wise and intelligent being what then can lord bolingbroke mean when he says every thing shows the wisdom of god and yet adds every thing does not show in like manner the goodness of god conformably to our ideas of this attribute in either by wisdom he must only mean that god knows and employs the fittest means to a certain end no matter what that end may be this indeed is a proof of knowledge and intelligence but these alone do not constitute wisdom the word implies the application of these fittest means to the best and kindest end or who will call it true wisdom even amongst ourselves it is not held as such all the attributes then that he seems to think apparent in the constitution of things are his unity infinity eternity and intelligence from no one of which i boldly affirm can result any duty of gratitude or adoration incumbent on mankind more than if he and all things round him were produced as some have dared to think by the necessary working of eternal matter in an infinite vacuum for what does it avail to add intelligence to those other physical attributes unless that intelligence be directed not only to the good of the whole but also to the good of every individual of which that whole is composed  it is therefore no impiety but the direct contrary to say that human justice and the other virtues which are indeed only various applications of human benevolence bear some resemblance to the moral attributes of the supreme being it is only by means of that resemblance we conceive them in him or their effects in his works it is by the same means only that we comprehend those physical attributes which his lordship allows to be demonstrable how can we form any notion of his unity but from that unity of which we ourselves are conscious how of his existence but from our own consciousness of existing how of his power but of that power which we experience in ourselves yet neither lord bolingbroke nor any other man that thought on these subjects ever believed that these our ideas were real and full representations of these attributes in the divinity they say he knows they do not mean that he compares ideas which he acquired from sensation and draws conclusions from them they say he acts they do not mean by impulse nor as the soul acts on an organized body they say he is omnipotent and eternal yet on what are their ideas founded but on our own narrow conceptions of space and duration prolonged beyond the bounds of space and time either therefore there is a resemblance and analogy however imperfect and distant between the attributes of the divinity and our conceptions of them or we cannot have any conceptions of them at all he allows we ought to reason from earth that we do know to heaven which we do not know how can we do so but by that affinity which appears between one and the other  in vain then does my lord attempt to ridicule the warm but melancholy imagination of mr wollaston in that fine soliloquy must i then bid my last farewell to these walks when i close these lids and yonder blue regions and all this scene darken upon me and go out must i then only serve to furnish dust to be mingled with the ashes of these herds and plants or with this dirt under my feet have i been set so far above them in life only to be levelled with them in death religion of nature delineated sect   p  0  quarto no thinking head no heart that has the least sensibility but must have made the same reflection or at least must feel not the beauty alone but the truth of it when he hears it from the mouth of another now what reply will lord bolingbroke make to these questions which are put to him not only by wollaston but by all mankind he will tell you that we that is the animals vegetables stones and other clods of earth are all connected in one immense design that we are all dramatis personae in different characters and that we were not made for ourselves but for the action that it is foolish presumptuous impious and profane to murmur against the almighty author of this drama when we feel ourselves unavoidably unhappy on the contrary we ought to rest our head on the soft pillow of resignation on the immovable rock of tranquillity secure that if our pains and afflictions grow violent indeed an immediate end will be put to our miserable being and we shall be mingled with the dirt under our feet a thing common to all the animal kind and of which he who complains does not seem to have been set by his reason so far above them in life as to deserve not to be mingled with them in death such is the consolation his philosophy gives us and such the hope on which his tranquillity was founded the reader who would choose to see the argument as lord bolingbroke puts it will find it in the  th volume of his philosophical works sect  0    his ridicule on wollaston is in the  0th section of the same volume   letter xxxii mr gray to dr wharton sunday april        i am equally sensible of your affliction occasioned by the death of his eldest and at the time his only son  and of your kindness that made you think of me at such a moment would to god i could lessen the one or requite the other with that consolation which i have often received from you when i most wanted it but your grief is too just and the cause of it too fresh to admit of any such endeavor what indeed is all human consolation can it efface every little amiable word or action of an object we loved from our memory can it convince us that all the hopes we had entertained the plans of future satisfaction we had formed were illgrounded and vain only because we have lost them the only comfort i am afraid that belongs to our condition is to reflect when time has given us leisure for reflection that others have suffered worse or that we ourselves might have suffered the same misfortune at times and in circumstances that would probably have aggravated our sorrow you might have seen this poor child arrive at an age to fulfill all your hopes to attach you more strongly to him by long habit by esteem as well as natural affection and that toward the decline of your life when we most stand in need of support and when he might chance to have been your only support and then by some unforeseen and deplorable accident or some painful lingering distemper you might have lost him such has been the fate of many an unhappy father i know there is a sort of tenderness which infancy and innocence alone produce but i think you must own the other to be a stronger and a more overwhelming sorrow let me then beseech you to try by every method of avocation and amusement whether you cannot by degrees get the better of that dejection of spirits which inclines you to see every thing in the worst light possible and throws a sort of voluntary gloom not only over your present but future days as if even your situation now were not preferable to that of thousands round you and as if your prospect hereafter might not open as much of happiness to you as to any person you know the condition of our life perpetually instructs us to be rather slow to hope as well as to despair and i know you will forgive me if i tell you you are often a little too hasty in both perhaps from constitution it is sure we have great power over our own minds when we choose to exert it and though it be difficult to resist the mechanic impulse and bias of our own temper it is yet possible and still more so to delay those resolutions it inclines us to take which we almost always have cause to repent  you tell me nothing of mrs whartons or your own state of health i will not talk to you more upon this subject till i hear you are both well for that is the grand point and without it we may as well not think at all you flatter me in thinking that any thing i can do his friend had requested him to write an epitaph on the child  could at all alleviate the just concern your loss has given you but i cannot flatter myself so far and know how little qualified i am at present to give any satisfaction to myself on this head and in this way much less to you i by no means pretend to inspiration but yet i affirm that the faculty in question is by no means voluntary it is the result i suppose of a certain disposition of mind which does not depend of ones self and which i have not felt this long time you that are a witness how seldom this spirit has moved me in my life may easily give credit to what i say   letter xxxiii mr gray to mr palgrave rector of palgrave and thrandeston in suffolk he was making a tour in scotland when this letter was written to him  stoke sept        i do not know how to make you amends having neither rock ruin nor precipice near me to send you they do not grow in the south but only say the word if you would have a compact neat box of red brick with sash windows or a grotto made of flints and shellwork or a wallnuttree with three molehills under it stuck with honeysuckles round a basin of goldfishes and you shall be satisfied they shall come by the edinburgh coach  in the mean time i congratulate you on your new acquaintance with the savage the rude and the tremendous pray tell me is it any thing like what you had read in your book or seen in twoshilling prints do not you think a man may be the wiser i had almost said the better for going a hundred or two of miles and that the mind has more room in it than most people seem to think if you will but furnish the apartments i almost envy your last month being in a very insipid situation myself and desire you would not fail to send me some furniture for my gothic apartment which is very cold at present it will be the easier task as you have nothing to do but transcribe your little red books if they are not rubbed out for i conclude you have not trusted every thing to memory which is ten times worse than a leadpencil half a word fixed upon or near the spot is worth a cartload of recollection when we trust to the picture that objects draw of themselves on our mind we deceive ourselves without accurate and particular observation it is but illdrawn at first the outlines are soon blurred the colors every day grow fainter and at last when we would produce it to any body we are forced to supply its defects with a few strokes of our own imagination had this letter nothing else to recommond it the advice here given to the curious traveller of making all his memoranda on the spot and the reasons for it are so well expressed and withal so important that they certainly deserve our notice  god forgive me i suppose i have done so myself before now and misled many a good body that put their trust in me pray tell me but with permission and without any breach of hospitality is it so much warmer on the other side of the swale as some people of honor say than it is here has the singing of birds the bleating of sheep the lowing of herds deafened you at rainton did the vast old oaks and thick groves in northumberland keep off the sun too much from you i am too civil to extend my enquiries beyond berwick every thing doubtless must improve upon you as you advanced northward you must tell me though about melross rosslin chapel and arbroath in short your portfeuille must be so full that i only desire a loose chapter or two and will wait for the rest till it comes out   letter xxxiv mr gray to mr mason stoke nov        i should have told you that caradoc came safe to hand a second manuscript of caractacus with the odes inserted  but my critical faculties have been so taken up in dividing nothing with an old woman mrs rogers died about this time and left mr gray and mrs olliffe another of his aunts her joint executors  that they are not yet composed enough for a better and more tranquil employment shortly however i will make them obey me but am i to send this copy to mr hurd or return it to you methinks i do not love this traveling to and again of manuscripts by the post while i am writing your second packet is just arrived i can only tell you in gross that there seem to me certain passages altered which might as well have been let alone and that i shall not be easily reconciled to madors own song he means here the second ode which was afterward greatly altered  i must not have my fancy raised to that agreeable pitch of heathenism and wild magical enthusiasm and then have you let me drop into moral philosophy and cold good sense i remember you insulted me when i saw you last and affected to call that which delighted my imagination nonsense now i insist that sense is nothing in poetry but according to the dress she wears and the scene she appears in if you should lead me into a superb gothic building with a thousand clustered pillars each of them half a mile high the walls all covered with fretwork and the windows full of red and blue saints that had neither head nor tail and i should find the venus of medici in person perked up in a long niche over the high altar do you think it would raise or damp my devotions i say that mador must be entirely a briton and that his preeminence among his companions must be shown by superior wildness more barbaric fancy and a more striking and deeper harmony both of words and numbers if british antiquity be too narrow this is the place for invention and if it be pure invention so much the clearer must the expression be and so much the stronger and richer the imagery there is for you now   letter xxxv mr gray to mr palgrave london july         i am now settled in my new territories commanding bedford gardens and all the fields as far as highgate and hampstead with such a concourse of moving pictures as would astonish you so rusinurbeish that i believe i shall stay here except little excursions and vagaries for a year to come what though i am separated from the fashionable world by broad st giless and many a dirty court and alley yet here is air and sunshine and quiet however to comfort you i shall confess that i am basking with heat all the summer and i suppose shall be blowed down all the winter besides being robbed every night i trust however that the musaeum with all its manuscripts and rarities by the cartload will make ample amends for all the aforesaid inconveniences  i this day past through the jaws of a great leviathan into the den of dr templeman superintendant of the readingroom who congratulated himself on the sight of so much good company we were first a man that writes for lord royston  dly a man that writes for dr burton of york  dly a man that writes for the emperor of germany or dr pocock for he speaks the worst english i ever heard  thly dr stukely who writes for himself the very worst person he could write for and lastly i who only read to know if there be any thing worth writing and that not without some difficulty i find that they printed  000 copies of the harleian catalogue and have sold only fourscore that they have  00l a year income and spend   00 and are building apartments for the underkeepers so i expect in winter to see the collection advertised and set to auction  have you read lord clarendons continuation of his history do you remember mr s account of it before it came out how well he recollected all the faults and how utterly he forgot all the beauties surely the grossest taste is better than such a sort of delicacy   letter xxxvi mr gray to dr wharton london june       0 i am not sorry to hear you are exceeding busy except as it has deprived me of the pleasure i should have in hearing often from you and as it has been occasioned by a little vexation and disappointment to find ones self business i am persuaded is the great art of life i am never so angry as when i hear my acquaintance wishing they had been bred to some poking profession or employed in some office of drudgery as if it were pleasanter to be at the command of other people than at ones own and as if they could not go unless they were wound up yet i know and feel what they mean by this complaint it proves that some spirit something of genius more than common is required to teach a man how to employ himself i say a man for women commonly speaking never feel this distemper they have always something to do time hangs not on their hands unless they be fine ladies a variety of small inventions and occupations fill up the void and their eyes are never open in vain  as to myself i have again found rest for the sole of my gouty foot in your old dining room the house in southamptonrow where mr gray lodged had been tenanted by dr wharton who on account of his ill health left london the year before and was removed to his paternal estate at old park near durham  and hope that you will find at least an equal satisfaction at old park if your bog prove as comfortable as my oven i shall see no occasion to pity you and only wish you may brew no worse than i bake  you totally mistake my talents when you impute to me any magical skill in planting roses i know i am no conjurer in these things when they are done i can find fault and that is all now this is the very reverse of genius and i feel my own littleness reasonable people know themselves better than is commonly imagined and therefore though i never saw any instance of it i believe mason when he tells me that he understands these things the prophetic eye of taste as mr pit called it sees all the beauties that a place is susceptible of long before they are born and when it plants a seedling already sits under the shadow of it and enjoys the effect it will have from every point of view that lies in prospect you must therefore invoke caractacus and he will send his spirits from the top of snowdon to crossfell or wardenlaw  i am much obliged to you for your antique news froissard is a favorite book of mine though i have not attentively read him but only dipped here and there and it is strange to me that people who would give thousands for a dozen portraits originals of that time to furnish a gallery should never cast an eye on so many moving pictures of the life actions manners and thoughts of their ancestors done on the spot and in strong though simple colors in the succeeding century froissard i find was read with great satisfaction by every body that could read and on the same footing with king arthur sir tristram and archbishop turpin not because they thought him a fabulous writer but because they took them all for true and authentic historians to so little purpose was it in that age for a man to be at the pains of writing truth pray are you come to the four irish kings that went to school to king richard the seconds master of the ceremonies and the man who informed froissard of all he had seen in st patricks purgatory  the town are reading the king of prussias poetry le philosophe sans souci and i have done like the town they do not seem so sick of it as i am it is all the scum of voltaire and lord bolingbroke the cramberecocta of our worst freethinkers tossed up in germanfrench rhyme tristram shandy is still a greater object of admiration the man as well as the book one is invited to dinner where he dines a fortnight before as to the volumes yet published there is much good fun in them and humor sometimes hit and sometimes missed have you read his sermons with his own comic figure from a painting by reynolds at the head of them they are in the style i think most proper for the pulpit our author was of opinion that it was the business of the preacher rather to persuade by the power of eloquence to the practice of known duties than to reason with the art of logic on points of controverted doctrine hence therefore he thought that sometimes imagination might not be out of its place in a sermon but let him speak for himself in an extract from one of his letters to me in the following year your quotation from jeremy tailor is a fine one i have long thought of reading him for i am persuaded that chopping logic in the pulpit as our divines have done ever since the revolution is not the thing but that imagination and warmth of expression are in their place there as much as on the stage moderated however and chastised a little by the purity and severity of religion  and show a strong imagination and a sensible heart but you see him often tottering on the verge of laughter and ready to throw his periwig in the face of the audience   letter xxxvii mr gray to mr stonhewer london june       0 though you have had but a melancholy employment it is worthy of envy and i hope will have all the success it deserves mr stonhewer was now at houghtonlespring in the bishopric of durham attending on his sick father rector of that parish  it was the best and most natural method of cure and such as could not have been administered by any but your gentle hand i thank you for communicating to me what must give you so much satisfaction  i too was reading m dalembert two subsequent volumes of his melanges de literature and philosophy  and like you am totally disappointed in his elements i could only taste a little of the first course it was dry as a stick hard as a stone and cold as a cucumber but then the letter to rousseau is like himself and the discourses on elocution and on the liberty of music are divine he has added to his translations from tacitus and what is remarkable though that authors manner more nearly resembles the best french writers of the present age than any thing he totally fails in the attempt is it his fault or that of the language  i have received another scotch packet of the fragments of erse poetry many of which mr gray saw in manuscript before they were published in a letter to dr wharton written in the following month he thus expresses himself on the same subject if you have seen mr stonhewer he has probably told you of my old scotch or rather irish poetry i am gone mad about them they are said to be translations literal and in prose from the erse tongue done by one macpherson a young clergyman in the highlands he means to publish a collection he has of these specimens of antiquity if it be antiquity but what perplexes me is i cannot come at any certainty on that head i was so struck with their beauty that i writ into scotland to make a thousand enquiries the letters i have in return are ill wrote ill reasoned unsatisfactory calculated one would imagine to deceive and yet not cunning enough to do it cleverly in short the whole external evidence would make one believe these fragments counterfeit but the internal is so strong on the other side that i am resolved to believe them genuine spite of the devil and the kirk it is impossible to conceive that they were written by the same man that writes me these letters on the other hand it is almost as hard to suppose if they are original that he should be able to translate them so admirably in short this man is the very demon of poetry or he has lighted on a treasure hid for ages the welsh poets are also coming to light i have seen a discourse in manuscript about them by one mr evans a clergyman with specimens of their writing this is in latin and though it does not approach the other there are fine scraps among it with a third specimen inferior in kind because it is merely description but yet full of nature and noble wild imagination five bards pass the night at the castle of a chief himself a principal bard each goes out in his turn to observe the face of things and returns with an extempore picture of the changes he has seen it is an october night the harvestmonth of the highlands this is the whole plan yet there is a contrivance and a preparation of ideas that you would not expect the oddest thing is that every one of them sees ghosts more or less the idea that struck and surprised me most is the following one of them describing a storm of wind and rain says ghosts ride on the tempest tonight sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind their songs are of other worlds did you never observe while rocking winds are piping loud that pause as the gust is recollecting itself and rising upon the ear in a shrill and plaintive note like the swell of an aeolian harp i do assure you there is nothing in the world so like the voice of a spirit thomson had an ear sometimes he was not deaf to this and has described it gloriously but given it another different turn and of more horror i cannot repeat the lines it is in his winter there is another very fine picture in one of them it describes the breaking of the clouds after the storm before it is settled into a calm and when the moon is seen by short intervals the waves are tumbling on the lake and lash the rocky sides the boat is brimfull in the cove the oars on the rocking tide sad sits a maid beneath a cliff and eyes the rolling stream her lover promised to come she saw his boat when it was evening on the lake are these his groans in the gale is this his broken boat on the shore the whole of this descriptive piece has been since published in a note to a poem entitled croma see ossians poems vol  st p   0  vo it is somewhat remarkable that the manuscript in the translators own hand which i have in my possession varies considerably from the printed copy some images are omitted and others added i will mention one which is not in the manuscript the spirit of the mountain shrieks in the tragedy of douglas published at least three years before i always admired this fine line the angry spirit of the water skriekd quere did mr home take this sublime image from ossian or has the translator of ossian since borrowed it from mr home     letter xxxviii mr gray to dr clarke physician at epsom with this gentleman mr gray commenced an early acquaintance at college  pembrokehall aug       0 not knowing whether you are yet returned from your seawater i write at random to you for me i am come to my resting place and find it very necessary after living for a month in a house with three women that laughed from morning to night and would allow nothing to the sulkiness of my disposition company and cards at home parties by land and water abroad and what they call doing something that is racketing about from morning to night are occupations i find that wear out my spirits especially in a situation where one might sit still and be alone with pleasure for the place was a hill near henley like clifden opening to a very extensive and diversified landscape with the thames which is navigable running at its foot  i would wish to continue here in a very different scene it must be confessed till michaelmas but i fear i must come to town much sooner cambridge is a delight of a place now there is no body in it i do believe you would like it if you knew what it was without inhabitants it is they i assure you that get it an ill name and spoil all our friend dr  vide letter xi of this section one of its nuisances is not expected here again in a hurry he is gone to his grave with five fine mackarel large and full of roe in his belly he eat them all at one dinner but his fate was a turbot on trinity sunday of which he left little for the company besides bones he had not been hearty all the week but after this sixth fish he never held up his head more and a violent looseness carried him off  they say he made a very good end  have you seen the erse fragments since they were printed i am more puzzled than ever about their antiquity though i still incline against every bodys opinion to believe them old those you have already seen are the best though there are some others that are excellent too   letter xxxix mr gray to mr mason cambridge aug  0    0 i have sent musaeus i had desired mr gray to revise my monody on mr popes death in order that i might correct it for the edition i was then preparing of my poems back as you desired me scratched here and there and with it also a bloody satire the parodies in question entitled odes to obscurity and oblivion were written by mess lloyd and colman and have been reprinted since in mr lloyds poems  written against no less persons than you and i by name i concluded at first it was mr  because he is your friend and my humble servant but then i thought he knew the world too well to call us the favorite minions of taste and of fashion especially as to odes for to them his ridicule is confined so it is not him but mr colman nephew to lady bath author of the connoisseur a member of one of the inns of court and a particular acquaintance of mr garrick what have you done to him for i never heard his name before he makes very tolerable fun with me where i understand him which is not every where but seems more angry with you lest people should not understand the humor of the thing which indeed to do they must have our lyricisms at their finger ends letters come out in lloyds eveningpost to tell them who and what it was that he meant and says it is like to produce a great combustion in the literary world so if you have any mind to combustle about it well and good for me i am neither so literary nor so combustible had mr pope sat as easy to the sarcasms of the many writers that endeavored to eclipse his poetical fame as mr gray here appears to have done the world would not have been possessed of a dunciad but it would have been impressed with a more amiable idea of its authors temper it is for the sake of showing how mr gray felt on such occasions that i publish this letter  the monthly review i see just now has much stuff about us on this occasion it says one of us at least has always borne his faculties meekly i leave you to guess which of us that is i think i know you simpleton you you must be meek must you and see what you get by it  i do not like your improvements at aston it looks so like settling if i come i will set fire to it i will never believe the bs and the cs are dead though i smelt them that sort of people always live to a good old age i dare swear they are only gone to ireland and we shall soon hear they are bishops  the erse fragments have been published five weeks ago in scotland though i had them not by a mistake till the other day as you tell me new things do not reach you soon at aston i enclose what i can the rest shall follow when you tell me whether you have not got the pamphlet already i send the two to mr wood which i had before because he has not the affectation of not admiring it was rather a want of credulity than admiration that mr gray should have laid to my charge i suspected that whether the fragments were genuine or not they were by no means literally translated i suspect so still and a former note gives a sufficient cause for that suspicion see page      i have another from mr macpherson which he has not printed it is mere description but excellent too in its kind if you are good and will learn to admire i will transcribe and send it  as to their authenticity i have made many enquiries and have lately procured a letter from mr david hume the historian which is more satisfactory than any thing i have yet met with on that subject he says  certain it is that these poems are in every bodys mouth in the highlands have been handed down from father to son and are of an age beyond all memory and tradition adam smith the celebrated professor in glasgow told me that the piper of the argyleshire militia repeated to him all those which mr macpherson had translated and many more of equal beauty major mackay lord raes brother told me that he remembers them perfectly well as likewise did the lord of macfarline the greatest antiquarian we have in this country and who insists strongly on the historical truth as well as the poetical beauty of these productions i could add the lord and lady macleod with many more that live in different parts of the highlands very remote from each other and could only be acquainted with what had become in a manner national works all this external evidence and much more has since been collected and published by dr blair see his appendix to his critical dissertation on the works of ossian and yet notwithstanding a later irish writer has been hardy enough to assert that the poems in question abound with the strangest anachronisms for instance that cucullin lived in the first and fingal in the third century two princes who are said to have made war with the danes a nation never heard of in europe till tee ninth which war could not possibly have happened till  00 years after the death of the supposed poet who sings it see ohallorans introduction to the study of the history and antiquities of ireland quarto      to whatever side of the question truth may lean it is of little moment to me my doubts arising as i have said in the former note from internal evidence only and a want of proof of the fidelity of the translation  there is a country surgeon in lochaber who has by heart the entire epic poem mentioned by mr macpherson in his preface and as he is old is perhaps the only person living that knows it all and has never committed it to writing we are in the more haste to recover a monument which will certainly be regarded as a curiosity in the republic of letters we have therefore set about a subscription of a guinea or two guineas a piece in order to enable mr macpherson to undertake a mission into the highlands to recover this poem and other fragments of antiquity he adds too that the names of fingal ossian oscar etc are still given in the highlands to large mastiffs as we give to ours the names of caesar pompey hector etc   letter xl mr gray to dr wharton london      i rejoice to find that you not only grow reconciled to your northern scene but discover beauties round you that once were deformities i am persuaded the whole matter is to have always something going forward happy they that can create a rosetree or erect a honeysuckle that can watch the brood of a hen or see a fleet of their own ducklings launch into the water it is with a sentiment of envy i speak it who never shall have even a thatched roof of my own nor gather a strawberry but in covent garden i will not however believe in the vocality of old park till next summer when perhaps i may trust to my own ears  the nouvelle heloise cruelly disappointed me but it has its partisans amongst which are mason and mr hurd for me i admire nothing but fingal in a letter to another friend informing him that he had sent fingal down to him he says for my part i will stick to my credulity and if i am cheated think it is worse for him the translator than for me the epic poem is foolishly so called yet there is a sort of plan and unity in it very strange for a barbarous age yet what i more admire are some of the detached pieces  the rest i leave to the discussion of antiquarians and historians yet my curiosity is much interested in their decision no man surely ever took more pains with himself to believe any thing than mr gray seems to have done on this occasion i conclude you have seen it if not stonhewer can lend it you yet i remain still in doubt about the authenticity of these poems though inclining rather to believe them genuine in spite of the world whether they are the inventions of antiquity or of a modern scotchman either case is to me alike unaccountable je my perd  i send you a swedish and english calendar see stillingfleets tracts p      the first column is by berger a disciple of linnaeus the second by mr stillingfleet the third very imperfect indeed by me you are to observe as you tend your plantations and take your walks how the spring advances in the north and whether old park most resembles upsal or stratton the latter has on one side a barren black heath on the other a light sandy loam all the country about it is a dead flat you see it is necessary you should know the situation i do not mean any reflection upon any bodys place and this is the description mr stillingfleet gives of his friend mr marshams seat to which he retires in the summer and botanizes i have lately made an acquaintance with this philosopher who lives in a garret here in the winter that he may support some near relations who depend upon him he is always employed consequently according to my old maxim always happy always cheerful and seems to me a very worthy honest man his present scheme is to send some persons properly qualified to reside a year or two in attica to make themselves acquainted with the climate productions and natural history of the country that we may understand aristotle theophrastus etc who have been heathen greek to us for so many ages and this he has got proposed to lord bute no unlikely person to put it into execution as he is himself a botanist   letter xli mr gray to mr mason london jan         i cannot pity you au contraire i wish i had been at aston when i was foolish enough to go through the six volumes of the nouvelle heloise all i can say for myself is that i was confined for three weeks at home by a severe cold and had nothing better to do there is no one event in it that might not happen any day of the week separately taken in any private family yet these events are so put together that the series of them is more absurd and more improbable than amadis de gaul the dramatis personae as the author says are all of them good characters i am sorry to hear it for had they been all hanged at the end of the third volume nobody i believe would have cared in short i went on and on in hopes of finding some wonderful denouement that would set all right and bring something like nature and interest out of absurdity and insipidity no such thing it grows worse and worse and if it be rousseaus which is not doubted is the strongest instance i ever saw that a very extraordinary man may entirely mistake his own talents by the motto and preface it appears to be his own story or something similar to it if it be considered that mr gray always preferred expression and sentiment to the arrangement of a story it may seem somewhat extraordinary that the many striking beauties of these kinds with which this singular work abounds were not excepted from so general a censure for my own part to use a phrase of his own they strike me blind to all the defects which he has here enumerated   the operahouse is crowded this year like any ordinary theater elisi is finer than any thing that has been here in your memory yet as i suspect has been finer than he is he appears to be near forty a little potbellied and thickshouldered otherwise no bad figure his action proper and not ungraceful we have heard nothing since i remember operas but eternal passages divisions and flights of execution of these he has absolutely none whether merely from judgment or a little from age i will not affirm his point is expression and to that all the graces and ornaments he inserts which are few and short are evidently directed he goes higher they say than farinelli but then this celestial note you do not hear above once in a whole opera and he falls from this altitude at once to the mellowest softest strongest tones about the middle of his compass that can be heard the mattei i assure you is much improved by his example and by her great success this winter but then the burlettas and the paganina i have not been so pleased with any thing these many years she too is fat and above forty yet handsome withal and has a face that speaks the language of all nations she has not the invention the fire and the variety of action that the spiletta had yet she is light agile ever in motion and above all graceful but then her voice her ear her taste in singing good god  as mr richardson the painter says pray ask lord  for i think i have seen him there once or twice as much pleased as i was   letter xlii mr gray to mr mason august      be assured your york canon never will die so the better the thing is in value the worse for you this was written at a time when by the favor of dr fountain dean of york i expected to be made a residentiary in his cathedral  the true way to immortality is to get you nominated ones successor age and diseases vanish at your name fevers turn to radical heat and fistulas to issues it is a judgment that waits on your insatiable avarice you could not let the poor old man die at his ease when he was about it and all his family i suppose are cursing you for it  i wrote to lord  on his recovery and he answers me very cheerfully as if his illness had been but slight and the pleurisy were no more than a hole in ones stocking he got it he says not by scampering racketing and riding post as i had supposed but by going with ladies to vauxhall he is the picture and pray so tell him if you see him of an old alderman that i knew who after living forty years on the fat of the land not milk and honey but arrack punch and venison and losing his great toe with a mortification said to the last that he owed it to two grapes which he eat one day after dinner he felt them lie cold at his stomach the minute they were down  mr montagu as i guess at your instigation has earnestly desired me to write some lines to be put on a monument which he means to erect at bellisle see p    of the poems  it is a task i do not love knowing sir william williams so slightly as i did but he is so friendly a person and his affliction seemed to me so real that i could not refuse him i have sent him the following verses which i neither like myself nor will he i doubt however i have showed him that i wished to oblige him tell me your real opinion   letter xliii mr gray to dr wharton cambridge dec        i feel very ungrateful every day that i continue silent and yet now that i take my pen in hand i have only time to tell you that of all the places which i saw in my return from you hardwicke pleased me the most a seat of the duke of devonshire in nottinghamshire  one would think that mary queen of scots was but just walked down into the park with her guard for half an hour her gallery her room of dience her antichamber with the very canopies chair of state footstool lit de repos oratory carpets and hangings just as she left them a little tattered indeed but the more venerable and all preserved with religious care and papered up in winter  when i arrived in london i found professor turner professor of modern languages in the university of cambridge had been dead above a fortnight and being cockered and spirited up by some friends though it was rather the latest i got my name suggested to lord bute you may easily imagine who undertook it and indeed he did it with zeal this person was the late sir henry erskine as this was the only application mr gray ever made to ministry i thought it necessary to insert his own account of it the place in question was given to the tutor of sir james lowther  i received my answer very soon which was what you may easily imagine but joined with great professions of his desire to serve me on future occasions and many more fine words that i pass over not out of modesty but for another reason so you see i have made my fortune like sir francis wronghead this nothing is a profound secret and no one here suspects it even now today i hear mr e delaval fellow of pembrokehall and of the royal society has got it but we are not yet certain next to myself i wished for him  you see we have made a peace i shall be silent about it because if i say any thing antiministerial you will tell me you know the reason and if i approve it you will think i have my expectations still all i know is that the duke of newcastle and lord hardwick both say it is an excellent peace and only mr pit calls it inglorious and insidious   letter xliv mr gray to mr mason february        doctissime domine anne tibi arrident complimenta william tailor how esquire of ongar in essex an honorary fellow of pembrokehall was now on his travels in italy where he had made an acquaintance with the celebrated count algarotti and had recommended to him mr grays poems and my dramas after the perusal he received a letter from the count written in that style of superlative panegyric peculiar to italians a copy of this letter mr how had just now sent to our common friend mr brown then president of the college and also another of the counts addressed to sigr paradisi a tuscan poet in which after explaining the arguments of my two dramatic poems he advises him to translate them but principally caractacus  this anecdote not only explains the above paragraph but the subsequent letter if so i hope your vanity is tickled with the verghe doro of count algarotti and the intended translation of sigr agostino paradisi for my part i am ravished for i too have my share are you upon the road to see all these wonders and snuff up the incense of pisa or has mr brown abated your ardour by sending you the originals i am waiting with impatience for your coming  i am obliged to you for your drawing and very learned dissertation annexed this relates to the ruin of a small gothic chapel near the northwest end of the cathedral at york not noticed by drake in his eboracum when mr gray made me a visit at that place the summer before he was much struck with the beautiful proportion of the windows in it which induced me to get mr paul sandby to make a drawing of it and also to endeavor in a letter to mr gray to explain to what foundation it belonged as his answer contains some excellent general remarks on gothic building i thought proper to publish it though the particular matter which occasioned them was not of any great consequence  you have made out your point with a great degree of probability for though the nimis adhoesit might startle one yet the sale of the tithes and chapel to webster seems to set all right again and i do believe the building in question was the chapel of st sepulcher but then that the ruin now standing was the individual chapel as erected by archbishop roger i can by no means think i found myself merely on the style and taste of architecture the vaults under the choir are still in being and were undoubtedly built by this very archbishop they are truly saxon only that the arches are pointed though very obtusely it is the south transept not the north that is the oldest part of the minster now above ground it is said to have been begun by geffrey plantagenet who died about thirty years after roger and left it unfinished his successor walter gray completed it so we do not exactly know to which of these two prelates we are to ascribe any certain part of it gray lived a long time and was archbishop from      to         henry iii and in this reign it was that the beauty of the gothic architecture began to appear the chapter house is in all probability his work and i should suppose built in his latter days whereas what he did of the south transept might be performed soon after his accession it is in the second order of this building that the round arches appear including a row of pointed ones which you mention and which i also observed similar to those in st sepulchres chapel though far inferior in the proportions and neatness of workmanship the same thing is repeated in the north transept but this is only an imitation of the other done for the sake of regularity for this part of the building is no older than archbishop roman who came to the sea in      and died       all the buildings of henry the seconds time under whom roger lived and died      are of a clumsy and heavy proportion with a few rude and awkward ornaments and this style continues to the beginning of henry the thirds reign though with a little improvement as in the nave of fountains abbey etc then all at once come in the tall picked arches the light clustered columns the capitals of curling foliage the fretted tabernacles and vaultings and a profusion of statues etc that constitute the good gothic style together with decreasing and flying buttresses and pinnacles on the outside nor must you conclude any thing from rogers own tomb which has i remember a wide surbased arch with scalloped ornaments etc for this can be no older than the nave itself which was built by archbishop melton after the year      one hundred and thirty years after rogers death  i have compared helvetius and elfrida as you desired me as the plagiarism to which mr gray here alludes is but little known and i think for its singularity is somewhat curious i shall beg the readers patience while i dilate upon it though i am aware it will stretch this note to an unconscionable length m helvetius in the third chapter of his third essay de lesprit which treats of the extent of memory means to prove that this faculty in the extreme is not necessary to constitute a great genius for this purpose he examines whether the greatness of the very different talents of lock and of milton ought to be considered as the effect of their possessing this talent in an extraordinary degree he then proceeds as follows as the last example of the small extent of memory necessary to a fine imagination i shall give in a note the translation of a piece of english poetry which with the preceding will i believe prove to those who would decompose the works of illustrious men that a great genius does not necessarily suppose a great memory i now set down that note with references to elfrida underneath it and i choose to give it in the english translation printed in      that the parallel passages may be the more obvious at first sight a young virgin awaked and guided by love goes before the appearance of aurora to a valley where she waits for the coming of her lover who at the rising of the sun is to offer a sacrifice to the gods her soul in the soft situation in which she is placed by the hopes of approaching happiness indulges while waiting for him the pleasure of contemplating the beauties of nature and the rising of that luminary that was to bring the object of her tenderness she expresses herself thus  already the sun gilds the tops of those antique oaks and the waves of those falling torrents that roar among the rocks shine with his beams already i perceive the summit of those shaggy mountains whence arise the vaults which halfconcealed in the air offer a formidable retreat to the solitary who there retires how nobly does this venerable wood gilt with the glories of the orient sun embosom yon fair mansion  on the shaggy mound where tumbling torrents roar around where pendent mountains over your head stretch a formidable shade  where lulled in pious peace the hermit lies   night folds up her veil ye wanton fires that mislead the wandering traveller retire away ye goblins all wont the bewildered traveller to daunt   to the quagmires and marshy fens and thou sun lord of the heavens who fillest the air with reviving heat who sowest with dewy pearls the flowers of these meadows and give colors to the varied beauties of nature receive my first homage hail to thy living light ambrosial morn  that bids each dewyspangled flowret rise and dart around its vormel dies  unfolds the scene of glory to our eye where throned in artless majesty the cherub beauty sits on natures rustic shrine    and hasten thy course thy appearance proclaims that of my lover freed from the pious cares that detain him still at the foot of the altars love will soon bring him to mine twill not be long ere his unbending mind shall lose in sweet oblivion every care among the embowering shades that veil elfrida   let all around me partake of my joy let all bless the rising luminary by which we are enlightened ye flowers that enclose in your bosoms the odours that cool night condenses there open your buds and exhale in the air your balmy vapors i know not whether the delightful intoxication that possesses my soul does not embellish whatever i behold but the rivulet that in pleasing meanders winds along this valley enchants me with his murmurs zephyrus caresses me with his breath the fragrant plants pressed under my feet waft to my senses their perfume oh if felicity sometimes condescends to visit the abode of mortals to these places doubtless she retires the soft air salutes me with most cool and temperate breath and as i tread the flowrbesprinkled lawn sends up a gale of fragrance i should guess if ever content deigned visit mortal clime this was her place of dearest residence   but with what secret trouble am i agitated already impatience mingles its poison with the sweetness of my expectation this valley has already lost all its beauties is joy then so fleeting it is as easy to snatch it from us as for the light down of these plants to be blown away by the breath of the zephyrs for safety now sits wavering on your love like the light do n upon the thistles beard which every breeze may part   in vain have i recourse to flattering hope each moment increases my disturbance he will come no more who keeps him at a distance from me what duty more sacred than that of calming the inquietudes of love but what do i say fly jealous suspicions injurious to his fidelity avaunt ye vain delusive fears   and formed to extinguish my tenderness if jealousy grows by the side of love it will stifle it if not pulled up by the roots it is the ivy which by a verdant chain embraces but dries up the trunk which serves for its support see elfrida ah see how round yon branching elm the ivy clasps its green chain and poisons what supports it not less injurious to the shoots of love is sickly jealousy   i know my lover too well to doubt of his tenderness he like me has far from the pomp of courts sought the tranquil asylum of the fields touched by the simplicity of my heart and by my beauty my sensual rivals call him in vain to their arms shall he be seduced by the advances of coquetry which on the cheek of the young maid tarnishes the snow of innocence and the carnation of modesty and daubs it with the whiteness of art and the paint of effrontery  to guard your beauties from the blast of courtly gales the crimson blush of virgin modesty the delicate soft tints of innocence there all fly off and leave no boast behind but wellrangd faded features   what do i say his contempt for her is perhaps only a snare for me can i be ignorant of the partiality of men and the arts they employ to seduce us nourished in a contempt for our sex it is not us it is their pleasures that they love cruel as they are they have placed in the rank of the virtues the barbarous fury of revenge and the mad love of their country but never have they reckoned fidelity among the virtues without remorse they abuse innocence and often their vanity contemplates our griefs with delight but no fly far from me ye odious thoughts my lover will come a thousand times have i experienced it as soon as i perceive him my agitated mind is calm and i often forget the too just cause i have for complaint for near him i can only know happiness  my truant heart forgets each lesson that resentment taught and in thy sight knows only to be happy in the french it is more literal pres de lui je ne scais quetre heureuse  yet if he is treacherous to me if in the very moment when my love excuses him he consummates the crime of infidelity in another bosom may all nature take up arms in revenge may he perish what do i say ye elements be deaf to my cries thou earth open not thy profound abyss let the monster walk the time prescribed him on thy splendid surface let him still commit new crimes and still cause the tears of the too credulous maids to flow and if heaven avenges them and punishes him may it at least be at the prayer of some other unfortunate woman till then ye elements rest and thou firm earth open not thy yawning jaws but let this monster stalk his due time on thine affrighted surface yes let him still go on still execute his savage purposes and daily make more widows weep as i do here ends this odd instance of plagiarism when m helvetius was in england a year or two after i had made the discovery of it i took my measures as mr gray advised me to learn how he came by it and accordingly requested two noblemen to whom he was introduced to ask him some questions concerning it but i could gain no satisfactory answer i do not however by any means suppose that the person who cooked up the disjointed parts of my drama into this strange fricasee was m helvetius himself i rather imagine as i did from the first that he was imposed upon by some young english traveller who contrived this expedient in order to pass with him for a poet the great philosopher it is true has in this note been proved to be the receiver of stolen goods but out of respect to his numerous fashionable disciples both abroad and at home whose credit might suffer with that of their master i acquit him of what would only be held criminal at the old bailey that he received these goods knowing them to be stolen   and find thirteen parallel passages five of which at least are so direct and close as to leave no shadow of a doubt and therefore confirm all the rest it is a phenomenon that you will be in the right to inform yourself about and which i long to understand another phenomenon is that i read it without finding it out all i remember is that i thought it not at all english and did not much like it and the reason is plain for the lyric flights and choral flowers suited not in the least with the circumstances or character of the speaker as he had contrived it   letter xlv mr gray to mr brown now master of pembrokehall  february         you will make my best acknowledgments to mr how who not content to rank me in the number of his friends is so polite as to make excuses for having done me that honor  i was not born so far from the sun as to be ignorant of count algarottis name and reputation nor am i so far advanced in years or in philosophy as not to feel the warmth of his approbation the odes in question as their motto shows were meant to be vocal to the intelligent alone how few they were in my own country mr how can testify and yet my ambition was terminated by that small circle i have good reason to be proud if my voice has reached the ear and apprehension of a stranger distinguished as one of the best judges in europe  i am equally pleased with the just applause he bestows on mr mason and particularly on his caractacus which is the work of a man whereas elfrida is only that of a boy a promising boy indeed and of no common genius yet this is the popular performance and the other little known in comparison  neither count algarotti nor mr how i believe have heard of ossian the son of fingal if mr how were not upon the wing and on his way homewards i would send it to him in italy he would there see that imagination dwelt many hundred years ago in all her pomp on the cold and barren mountains of scotland the truth i believe is that without any respect of climates she reigns in all nascent societies of men where the necessities of life force every one to think and act much for himself   letter xlvi count algarotti to mr gray pisa    aprile      sono stato lungo

sottescrivermi  de v s illusmo devotis etc algarotti   letter xlvii mr gray to dr wharton pembrokehall aug        you may well wonder at my long taciturnity i wonder too and know not what cause to assign for it is certain i think of you daily i believe it is owing to the nothingness of my history for except six weeks that i passed in town toward the end of the spring and a little jaunt to epsom and boxhill i have been here time out of mind in a place where no events grow though we preserve those of former days by way of hortus siccus in our libraries  i doubt you have not yet read rousseaus emile every body that has children should read it more than once for though it abounds with his usual glorious absurdity though his general scheme of education be an impracticable chimera yet there are a thousand lights struck out a thousand important truths better expressed than ever they were before that may be of service to the wisest men particularly i think he has observed children with more attention and knows their meaning and the working of their little passions better than any other writer as to his religious discussions which have alarmed the world and engaged their thoughts more than any other part of his book i set them all at naught and wish they had been omitted that i may put together the rest of mr grays sentiments concerning this singular writer i insert here an extract from a letter of later date written to myself i have not read the philosophic dictionary i can now stay with great patience for any thing that comes from voltaire they tell me it is frippery and blasphemy and wit i could have forgiven myself if i had not read rousseaus lettres de la montagne always excepting the contract social it is the dullest performance he ever published it is a weak attempt to separate the miracles from the morality of the gospel the latter he would have you think he believes was sent from god and the former he very explicitly takes for an imposture this is in order to prove the cruelty and injustice of the state of geneva in burning his emile the latter part of his book is to show the abuses that have crept into the constitution of his country which point if you are concerned about it he makes out very well and his intention in this is plainly to raise a tumult in the city and to be revenged on the petit conseil who condemned his writings to the flames    letter xlviii mr gray to mr palgrave mr grays correspondent was now making the tour of france and italy  march      my instructions of which you are so desirous are twofold the first part relates to what is past and that will be rather diffuse the second to what is to come and that we shall treat more succinctly and with all due brevity  first when you come to paris you will not fail to visit the cloister of the chartreuse where le sueur in the history of st bruno has almost equalled raphael then your gothic inclinations will naturally lead you to the saint chapelle built by st louis in the treasury is preserved one of the noblest gems of the augustan age when you take a trip into the country there is a fine old chapel at vincennes with admirable painted windows and at fontainbleau the remains of francis the firsts magnificence might give you some pleasure in your way to lions you will take notice of the view over the saone from about tournus and macon fail not to walk a few miles along the banks of the rhone down the river i would certainly make a little journey to the grande chartreuse up the mountains at your return out of italy this will have little effect at turin you will visit the capuchins convent just without the city and the superga at no great distance for the sake of the views at genoa observe the terreno of the palace brignoli as a model of an apartment elegantly disposed in a hot climate at parma you will adore the great madonna and st jerome once at st antonio abbate but now i am told in the ducal palace in the madonna della steccata observe the moses breaking the tables a chiaroscuro figure of the parmeggiano at too great a height and ill lighted but immense at the capuchins the great pieta of annib caracci in the villa ducale the room painted by carlo cignani and the last works of agostino caracci at modena when our author was himself in italy he studied with much attention the different manners of the old masters i find a paper written at the time in which he has set down several subjects proper for painting which he had never seen executed and has affixed the names of different masters to each piece to show which of their pencils he thought would have been most proper to treat it as i doubt not but this paper will be an acceptable present to the reynoldss and wests of the age i shall here insert it  an altarpiece  guido  the top a heaven in the middle at a distance the padreeterno indistinctly seen and lost as it were in glory on either hand angels of all degrees in attitudes of adoration and wonder a little lower and next the eye supported on the wings of seraphs christ the principal figure with an air of calm and serene majesty his hand extended as commanding the elements to their several places near

of correggio  afterward when he had seen the original in the possession of the late sir luke schaub he always expressed the highest admiration of it though we see by his here giving it to salvator rosa he thought the subject too horrid to be treated by coreggio and indeed i believe it is agreed that the capital picture in question is not of his hand m  another  albano or the parmeggiano  iphigenia asleep by the fountainside her maids about her cymon gazing and laughing  this subject has been often treated once indeed very curiously by sir peter lely in the way of portrait when his

making to arbroath has been the cause that i did not answer your very obliging setter so soon as i ought to have done a man of merit that honors me with his esteem and has the frankness to tell me so doubtless can need no excuses his apology is made and we are already acquainted however distant from each other  i fear i cannot as i would wish do myself the pleasure of waiting on you at aberdeen being under an engagement to go tomorrow to taymouth and if the weather will allow it to the blair of athol this will take up four or five days and at my return the approach of winter will scarce permit me to think of any farther expeditions northwards my stay here will however be a fortnight or three weeks longer and if in that time any business or invitation should call you this way lord strathmore gives me commission to say he shall be extremely glad to see you at glames and doubt not it will be a particular satisfaction to me to receive and thank you in person for the favorable sentiments you have entertained of me and the civilities with which you have honored me   letter l mr gray to dr wharton glamescastle sept         i deferred writing to you till i had seen a little more of this country than you yourself had seen and now being just returned from an excursion which i and major lion have been making into the highlands i sit down to give you an account of it but first i must return to my journey hither on which i shall be very short partly because you know the way as far as edinburgh and partly that there was not a great deal worth remarking the first night we passed at tweedmouth    miles the next at edinburgh    miles where lord strathmore left the major and me to go to lenoxlove lord blantyres where his aunt lives so that afternoon and all next day i had leisure to visit the castle holyroodhouse heriots hospital arthurs seat etc and am not sorry to have seen that most picturesque at a distance and nastiest when near of all capital cities i supped with dr robertson and other literati and the next morning lord strathmore came for us we crossed at the queens ferry in a fouroared yawl without a sail and were tossed about rather more than i should wish to hazard again lay at perth a large scotch town with much wood about it on the banks of the tay a very noble river next morning ferried over it and came by dinnertime to glames being from edinburgh    miles which makes in all from hetton     miles the castle this is said to be the very castle in which duncan was murdered by macbeth stands in strathmore i e the great valley which winds about from stonehaven on the east coast of kincardineshire obliquely as far as stirling near  00 miles in length and from seven to ten miles in breadth cultivated every where to the foot of the hills on either hand with oats or bear a species of barley except where the soil is mere peatearth black as a coal or barren sand covered only with broom and heath or a short grass fit for sheep here and there appear just above ground the huts of the inhabitants which they call towns built of and covered with turf and among them at great distances the gentlemens houses with enclosures and a few trees round them  amidst these the castle of glames distinguishes itself the middle part of it rising proudly out of what seems a great and thick wood of tall trees with a cluster of hanging towers on the top you descend to it gradually from the south through a double and triple avenue of scotch firs  0 or  0 feet high under three gateways this approach is a full mile long and when you have passed the second gate the firs change to limes and another oblique avenue goes off on either hand toward the offices these as well as all the enclosures that surround the house are bordered with three or four ranks of sycamores ashes and white poplars of the noblest height and from  0 to  00 years old other alleys there are that go off at right angles with the long one small groves and walled gardens of earl patricks planting full of broadleaved elms oaks birch black cherrytrees laburnums etc all of great stature and size which have not till this week begun to show the least sense of morning frosts the third gate delivers you into a court with a broad pavement and grassplats adorned with statues of the four stuart kings bordered with old silver firs and yewtrees alternately and opening with an iron palisade on either side to two square oldfashioned parterres surrounded by stone fruitwalls the house from the height of it the greatness of its mass the many towers atop and the spread of its wings has really a very singular and striking appearance like nothing i ever saw you will comprehend something of its shape from the plan of the second floor which i enclose the wings are about  0 feet high the body which is the old castle with walls  0 feet thick is near  00 from the leads i see to the south of me just at the end of the avenue the little town of glames the houses built of stone and slated with a neat kirk and small square tower a rarity in this region just beyond it rises a beautiful round hill and another ridge of a longer form adjacent to it both covered with woods of tall fir beyond them peep over the black hills of sidlaw over which winds the road to dundee to the north within about seven miles of me begin to rise the grampians hill above hill on whose tops three weeks ago i could plainly see some traces of the snow that fell in may last to the east winds a way to the strath such as i have before described it among the hills which sink lower and lower as they approach the sea to the west the same valley not plain but broken unequal ground runs on for above  0 miles in view there i see the crags above dunkeld there benigloe and benimore rise above the clouds and there is that shekhallian that spires into a cone above them all and lies at least    miles in a direct line from this place  lord strathmore who is the greatest farmer in this neighborhood is from break of day to dark night among his husbandmen and laborers he has near  000 acres of land in his own hands and is at present employed in building a low wall of four miles long and in widening the bed of the little river deane which runs to south and southeast of the house from about twenty to fifty feet wide both to prevent inundations and to drain the lake of forfar this work will be two years more in completing and must be three miles in length all the highlanders that can be got are employed in it many of them know no english and i hear them singing erse songs all day long the price of labor is eight pence a day but to such as will join together and engage to perform a certain portion in a limited time two shillings  i must say that all his labors seem to prosper and my lord has casually found in digging such quantities of shellmarl as not only fertilize his own grounds but are disposed of at a good price to all his neighbors in his nurseries are thousands of oaks beech larches horsechesnuts sprucefirs etc thick as they can stand and whose only fault is that they are grown tall and vigorous before he has determined where to plant them out the most advantageous spot we have for beauty lies west of the house where when the stonewalls of the meadows are taken away the grounds naturally unequal will have a very parklike appearance they are already full of trees which need only thinning here and there to break the regularity of their troutstream which joins the river deane hard by pursuing the course of this brook upwards you come to a narrow sequestered valley sheltered from all winds through which it runs murmuring among great stones on one hand the ground gently rises into a hill on the other are the rocky banks of the rivulet almost perpendicular yet covered with sycamore ash and fir that though it seems to have no place or soil to grow in yet has risen to a good height and forms a thick shade you may continue along this gill and passing by one end of the village and its church for half a mile it leads to an opening between the two hills covered with firwoods that i mentioned above through which the stream makes its way and forms a cascade of ten or twelve feet over broken rocks a very little art is necessary to make all this a beautiful scene the weather till the last week has been in general very fine and warm we have had no fires till now and often have sat with the windows open an hour after sunset now and then a shower has come and sometimes sudden gusts of wind descend from the mountains that finish as suddenly as they arose but today it blows a hurricane upon the whole i have been exceeding lucky in my weather and particularly in my highland expedition of five days  we set out then the   th of september and continuing along the strath to the west passed through megill where is the tomb of queen wanders that was riven to death by staned horses for nae gade that she did so the women there told me i assure you through cowper of angus over the river ila then over a wide and dismal heath fit for an assembly of witches till we came to a string of four small lakes in a valley whose deep blue waters and green margin with a gentlemans house or two seated on them in little groves contrasted with the black desert in which they were inchased the ground now grew unequal the hills more rocky seemed to close in upon us till the road came to the brow of a steep descent and the sun then setting between two woods of oak we saw far below us the river tay come sweeping along at the bottom of a precipice at least   0 feet deep clear as glass full to the brim and very rapid in its course it seemed to issue out of woods thick and tall that rose on either hand and were overhung by broken rocky crags of vast height above them to the west the tops of higher mountains appeared on which the evening clouds reposed down by the side of the river under the thickest shades is seated the town of dunkeld in the midst of it stands a ruined cathedral the towers and shell of the building still entire a little beyond it a large house of the duke of athol with its offices and gardens extends a mile beyond the town and as his grounds were interrupted by the streets and roads he has flung arches of communication across them that add to the scenery of the place which of itself is built of good white stone and handsomely slated so that no one would take it for a scotch town till they come into it here we passed the night if i told you how you would bless yourself  next day we set forward to taymouth    miles farther west the road winding through beautiful woods with the tay almost always in full view to the right being here from   to  00 feet over the strathtay from a mile to three miles or more wide covered with corn and spotted with groups of people then in the midst of their harvest on either hand a vast chain of rocky mountains that changed their face and opened something new every hundred yards as the way turned or the clouds passed in short altogether it was one of the most pleasing days i have passed these many years and at every step i wished for you at the close of day we came to balloch mr pennant in his tour in scotland explains this word the mouth of the loch  so the place was called but now taymouth improperly enough for here it is that the river issues out of lochtay a glorious lake    miles long and one mile and a half broad surrounded with prodigious mountains there on its northeastern brink impending over it is the vast hill of lawers to the east is that enormous creature shekhallian i e the maidens pap spiring above the clouds directly west beyond the end of the lake benimore the great mountain rises to a most awful height and looks down on the tomb of fingal lord breadalbanes policy so they call here all such ground as is laid out for pleasure takes in about  000 acres of which his house offices and a deerpark about three miles round occupy the plain or bottom which is little above a mile in breadth through it winds the tay which by means of a bridge i found here to be     feet over his plantations and woods rise with the ground on either side the vale to the very summit of the enormous crags that overhang it along them on the mountains side runs a terrass a mile and a half long that overlooks the course of the river from several seats and temples perched on particular rocky eminences you command the lake for many miles in length which turns like some huge river and loses itself among the mountains that surround it at its eastern extremity where the river issues out of it on a peninsula my lord has built a neat little town and church with a high square tower and just before it lies a small round island in the lake covered with trees amongst which are the ruins of some little religious house  trees by the way grow here to great size and beauty i saw four old chestnuts in the road as you enter the park of vast bulk and height one beach tree i measured that was    feet   inches in the girth and i guess near  0 feet in height the gardener presented us with peaches nectarines and plums from the stonewalls of the kitchengarden for there are no brick nor hot walls the peaches were good the rest well tasted but scarce ripe we had also golden pippins from an espalier not ripe and a melon very well flavoured and fit to cut of the house i have little to say it is a very good noblemans house handsomely furnished and well kept very comfortable to inhabit but not worth going far to see of the earls taste i have not much more to say it is one of those noble situations that man cannot spoil it is however certain that he has built an inn and a town just where his principal walks should have been and in the most wonderful spot of ground that perhaps belongs to him in this inn however we lay and next day returning down the river four miles we passed it over a fine bridge built at the expense of the government and continued our way to logierait just below which in a most charming scene the tummel which is here the larger river of the two falls into the tay we ferried over the tummel in order to get into marshal wades road which leads from dunkeld to inverness and continued our way along it toward the north the road is excellent but dangerous enough in conscience the river often running directly under us at the bottom of a precipice  00 feet deep sometimes masked indeed by wood that finds means to grow where i could not stand but very often quite naked and without any defense in such places we walked for miles together partly for fear and partly to admire the beauty of the country which the beauty of the weather set off to the greatest advantage as evening came on we approached the pass of gillikrankie where in the year      the hessians with their prince at their head stopped short and refused to march a foot farther  vestibulum ante ipsum primisque in faucibus orci stands the solitary mansion of mr robertson of fascley close by it rises a hill covered with oak with grotesque masses of rock staring from among their trunks like the sullen countenances of fingal and all his family frowning on the little mortals of modern days from between this hill and the adjacent mountains pent in a narrow channel comes roaring out the river tummel and falls headlong down involved in white foam which rises into a mist all round it but my paper is deficient and i must say nothing of the pass itself the black river garry the blair of athol mount benigloe my return by another road to dunkeld the hermitage the strabram and the rumbling brig in short since i saw the alps i have seen nothing sublime till now in about a week i shall set forward by the stirling road on my return all alone pray for me till i see you for i dread edinburgh and the itch and expect to find very little in my way worth the perils i am to endure   letter li mr gray to mr beattie glamescastle oct        i must beg you would present my most grateful acknowledgments to your society for the public mark of their esteem which you say they are disposed to confer on me the marischal college of aberdeen had desired to know whether it would be agreeable to mr gray to receive from them the degree of doctor of laws mr beattie wrote to him on the subject and this is the answer  i embrace with so deep and just a sense of their goodness the substance of that honor they do me that i hope it may plead my pardon with them if i do not accept the form i have been sir for several years a member of the university of cambridge and formerly when i had some thoughts of the profession took a bachelor of laws degree there since that time though long qualified by my standing i have always neglected to finish my course and claim my doctors degree judge therefore whether it will not look like a slight and some sort of contempt if i receive the same degree from a sister university i certainly would avoid giving any offense to a set of men among whom i have passed so many easy and i may say happy hours of my life yet shall ever retain in my memory the obligations you have laid me under and be proud of my connection with the university of aberdeen  it is a pleasure to me to find that you are not offended with the liberties i took when you were at glames you took me too literally if you thought i meant in the least to discourage you in your pursuit of poetry all i intended to say was that if either vanity that is a general and undistinguishing desire of applause or interest or ambition has any place in the breast of a poet he stands a great chance in these our days of being severely disappointed and yet after all these passions are suppressed there may remain in the mind of one ingenti perculsus amore and such i take you to be incitements of a better sort strong enough to make him write verse all his life both for his own pleasure and that of all posterity  i am sorry for the trouble you have had to gratify my curiosity and love of superstition mr gray when in scotland had been very inquisitive after the popular superstitions of the country his correspondent sent him two books on this subject foolish ones indeed as might be expected but the best that could be had a history of secondsight and a history of witches  yet i heartily thank you on monday sir i set forward on my way to england where if i can be of any little use to you or should ever have the good fortune to see you it will be a particular satisfaction to me lord strathmore and the family here desire me to make their compliments to you  ps remember dryden and be blind to all his faults mr beattie it seems in their late interview had expressed himself with less admiration of dryden than mr gray thought his due he told him in reply that if there was any excellence in his own numbers he had learned it wholly from that great poet and pressed him with great earnestness to study him as his choice of words and versification were singularly happy and harmonious      letter lii mr gray to dr wharton pembrokehall march        i am amazed at myself when i think i have never wrote to you to be sure it is the sin of witchcraft or something worse had i been married like mason some excuse might be made for it who for the first time since that great event has just thought fit to tell me that he never passed so happy a winter as the last and this in spite of his anxieties which he says might even make a part of his happiness for his wife is by no means in health she has a constant cough yet he is assured her lungs are not affected and that it is nothing of the consumptive kind as to me i have been neither happy nor miserable but in a gentle stupefaction of mind and very tolerable health of body hitherto if they last i shall not much complain the accounts one has lately had from all parts make me suppose you buried in the snow like the old queen of denmark as soon as you are dug out i should rejoice to hear your voice from the battlements of old park  every thing is politics there are no literary productions worth your notice at least of our country the french have finished their great encyclopedia in    volumes but there are many flimsy articles very hastily treated and great incorrectness of the press there are now    volumes of buffons natural history and he is not come to the monkies yet who are a numerous people the life of petrarch has entertained me it is not well written but very curious and laid together from his own letters and the original writings of the fourteenth century so that he takes in much of the history of those obscure times and the characters of many remarkable persons there are two volumes quarto and another unpublished yet will complete it  mr walpole writes me now and then a long and lively letter from paris to which place he went last year with the gout upon him sometimes in his limbs often in his stomach and head he has got somehow well not by means of the climate one would think goes to all public places sees all the best company and is very much in fashion he says he sunk like queen eleanor at charing cross and has risen again at paris he returns in april i saw the lady you enquire after when i was last in london and a prodigious fine one she is she had a strong suspicion of rouge on her cheeks a cage of foreign birds and a piping bullfinch at her elbow two little dogs on a cushion in her lap and a cockatoo on her shoulder they were all exceeding glad to see me and i them   letter liii mr gray to dr wharton pembrokehall aug         whatever my pen may do i am sure my thoughts expatiate no where oftener or with more pleasure than to old park i hope you have made my peace with the angry little lady it is certain whether her name were in my letter or not she was as present to my memory as the rest of the whole family and i desire you would present her with two kisses in my name and one apiece to all the others for i shall take the liberty to kiss them all great and small as you are to be my proxy some readers will think this paragraph very trifling yet many i hope will take it as i give it for a pleasing example of the amiableness of his domestic character   in spite of the rain which i think continued with very short intervals till the beginning of this month and quite effaced the summer from the year i made a shift to pass may and june not disagreeably in kent i was surprised at the beauty of the road to canterbury which i know not why had not struck me before the whole country is a rich and wellcultivated garden orchards cherrygrounds hopgardens intermixed with corn and frequent villages gentle risings covered with wood and every where the thames and medway breaking in upon the landscape with all their navigation it was indeed owing to the bad weather that the whole scene was dressed in that tender emerald green which one usually sees only for a fortnight in the opening of the spring and this continued till i left the country my residence was eight miles east of canterbury in a little quiet valley on the skirts of barhamdown at denton where his friend the rev william robinson brother to matthew robinson esquire late member for canterbury then resided in these parts the whole soil is chalk and whenever it holds up in half an hour it is dry enough to walk out i took the opportunity of three or four days fine weather to go into the isle of thanet saw margate which is bartholomew fair by the sea side ramsgate and other places there and so came by sandwich deal dover folkstone and hithe back again the coast is not like hartlepool there are no rocks but only chalky cliffs of no great height till you come to dover there indeed they are noble and picturesque and the opposite coasts of france begin to bound your view which was left before to range unlimited by any thing but the horizon yet it is by no means a shipless sea but every where peopled with white sails and vessels of all sizes in motion and take notice except in the isle which is all cornfieldsd and has very little enclosure there are in all places hedgerows and tall trees even within a few yards of the beach particularly hithe stands on an eminence covered with wood i shall confess we had fires at night ay and at day too several times in june but do not go and take advantage in the north at this for it was the most untoward year that ever i remember  have you read the new bath guide it is the only thing in fashion and is a new and original kind of humor miss prues conversion i doubt you will paste down as a certain yorkshire baronet did before he carried it to his daughters yet i remember you all read crazy tales without pasting buffons first collection of monkies is come out it makes the   th volume something but not much to my edification for he is pretty well acquainted with their persons but not with their manners  my compliments to mrs wharton and all your family i will not name them lest i should affront any body   letter live mr gray to mr mason march         i break in upon you at a moment when we least of all are permitted to disturb our friends only to say that you are daily and hourly present to my thoughts if the worst as this little billet which i received at the hotwells at bristol then breathed and still seems to breathe the very voice of friendship in its tenderest and most pathetic note i cannot refrain from publishing it in this place i opened it almost at the precise moment when it would necessarily be the most affecting be not yet past you will neglect and pardon me but if the last struggle be over if the poor object of your long anxieties be no longer sensible to your kindness or to her own sufferings allow me at least in idea for what could i do were i present more than this to sit by you in silence and pity from my heart not her who is at rest but you who lose her may he who made us the master of our pleasures and of our pains preserve and support you adieu  i have long understood how little you had to hope   letter lv mr gray to mr beattie old park near darlington durham aug         i received from mr williamson that very obliging mark you were pleased to give me of your remembrance had i not entertained some flight hopes of revisiting scotland this summer and consequently of seeing you at aberdeen i had sooner acknowledged by letter the favor you have done me those hopes are now at an end but i do not therefore despair of seeing again a country that has given me so much pleasure nor of telling you in person how much i esteem you and as you choose to call them your amusements the specimen of them which you were so good to send me i think excellent the sentiments are such as a melancholy imagination naturally suggests in solitude and silence and that though light and business may suspend or banish them at times return with but so much the greater force upon a feeling heart the diction is elegant and unconstrained not loaded with epithets and figures nor flagging into prose the versification is easy and harmonious my only objection is      a paragraph is here omited as it contained merely a few particular criticisms a liberty of the same kind i have before taken in some of the preceding letters the poem in question contained many touching reflections on morality it is to be hoped dr beattie will one day give it to the public   you see sir i take the liberty you indulged me in when i first saw you and therefore i make no excuses for it but desire you would take your revenge on me in kind  i have read over but too hastily mr fergusons book there are uncommon strains of eloquence in it and i was surprised to find not one single idiom of his country i think in the whole work he has not the fault you mention to explain this i must take the liberty to transcribe a paragraph from mr beatties letter dated march  0 to which the above is an answer a professor at edinburgh has published an essay on the history of civil society but i have not seen it it is a fault common to almost all our scotch authors that they are too metaphysical i wish they would learn to speak more to the heart and less to the understanding but alas this is a talent which heaven only can bestow whereas the philosophic spirit as we call it is merely artificial and level to the capacity of every man who has much patience a little learning and no taste he has since dilated on this just sentiment in his admirable essay on the immutability of truth  his application to the heart is frequent and often successful his love of montesquieu and tacitus has led him into a manner of writing too shortwinded and sententious which those great men had they lived in better times and under a better government would have avoided  i know no pretense that i have to the honor lord gray is pleased to do me lord gray had said that our author was related to his family  but if his lordship chooses to own me it certainly is not my business to deny it i say not this merely on account of his quality but because he is a very worthy and accomplished person i am truly sorry for the great loss he has had since i left scotland if you should chance to see him i will beg you to present my respectful humble service to his lordship  i gave mr williamson all the information i was able in the short time he staid with me he seemed to answer well the character you gave me of him but what i chiefly envied in him was his ability of walking all the way from aberdeen to cambridge and back again which if i possessed you would soon see your obliged etc   letter lvi mr gray to mr beattie pembrokehall dec         since i had the pleasure of receiving your last letter which did not reach me till i had left the north and was come to london i have been confined to my room with a fit of the gout now i am recovered and in quiet at cambridge i take up my pen to thank you for your very friendly offers which have so much the air of frankness and real goodmeaning that were my body as tractable and easy of conveyance as my mind you would see me tomorrow in the chamber you have so hospitably laid out for me at aberdeen but alas i am a summerbird and can only sit drooping till the sun returns even then too my wings may chance to be clipped and little in plight for so distant an excursion  the proposal you make me about printing at glasgow what little i have ever written does me honor i leave my reputation in that part of the kingdom to your care and only desire you would not let your partiality to me and mine mislead you if you persist in your design mr foulis certainly ought to be acquainted with what i am now going to tell you when i was in london the last spring dodsley the bookseller asked my leave to reprint in a smaller form all i ever published to which i consented and added that i would send him a few explanatory notes and if he would omit entirely the long story which was never meant for the public and only suffered to appear in that pompous edition because of mr bentleys designs which were not intelligible without it i promised to send him something else to print instead of it lest the bulk of so small a volume should be reduced to nothing at all now it is very certain that i had rather see them printed at glasgow especially as you will condescend to revise the press than at london but i know not how to retract my promise to dodsley by the way you perhaps may imagine that i have some kind of interest in this publication but the truth is i have none whatever the expense is his and so is the profit if there be any i therefore told him the other day in general terms that i heard there would be an edition put out in scotland by a friend of mine whom i could not refuse and that if so i would send thither a copy of the same notes and additions that i had promised to send to him this did not seem at all to cool his courage mr foulis must therefore judge for himself whether he thinks it worth while to print what is going to be printed also at london if he does i will send him in a packet to you the same things i shall send to dodsley they are imitations of two pieces of old norwegian poetry in which there was a wild spirit that struck me but for my paraphrases i cannot say much you will judge the rest are nothing but a few parallel passages and small notes just to explain what people said at the time was wrapped in total darkness you will please to tell me as soon as you can conveniently what mr foulis says on this head that if he drops the design i may save myself and you the trouble of this packet i ask your pardon for talking so long about it a little more and my letter would be as big as all my works  i have read with much pleasure an ode of yours in which you have done me the honor to adopt a measure that i have used on lord hays birthday though i do not love panegyric i cannot but applaud this for there is nothing mean in it the diction is easy and noble the texture of the thoughts lyric and the versification harmonious the few expressions i object to are     another paragraph of particular criticism is here omitted  these indeed are minutiae but they weigh for something as half a grain makes a difference in the value of a diamond   letter lvii mr gray to mr beattie pembrokehall feb        i am almost sorry to have raised any degree of impatience in you because i can by no means satisfy it the sole reason i have to publish these few additions now is to make up in both for the omission of that long story and as to the notes i do it out of spite because the public did not understand the two odes which i have called pindaric though the first was not very dark and the second alluded to a few common facts to be found in any sixpenny history of england by way of question and answer for the use of children the parallel passages i insert out of justice to those writers from whom i happened to take the hint of any line as far as i can recollect  i rejoice to be in the hands of mr foulis who has the laudable ambition of surpassing his predecessors the etiennes and the elzevirs as well in literature as in the proper art of his profession he surprises me in mentioning a lady after whom i have been enquiring these fourteen years in vain when the two odes were first published i sent them to her but as i was forced to direct them very much at random probably they never came to her hands when the present edition comes out i beg of mr foulis to offer her a copy in my name with my respects and grateful remembrances he will send another to you sir and a third to lord gray if he will do me the honor of accepting it these are all the presents i pretend to make for i would have it considered only as a new edition of an old book after this if he pleases to send me one or two i shall think myself obliged to him i cannot advise him to print a great number especially as dodsley has it in his power to print as many as he pleases though i desire him not to do so  you are very good to me in taking this trouble upon you all i can say is that i shall be happy to return it in kind whenever you will give me the opportunity   letter lviii the two following letters explain the occasion of this address in a way so honorable to his grace and are withal so authentic a testimony of mr grays gratitude that they leave me nothing to add on the subject  mr gray to the duke of grafton cambridge july      my lord your grace has dealt nobly with me and the same delicacy of mind that induced you to confer this favor on me unsolicited and unexpected may perhaps make you averse to receive my sincerest thanks and grateful acknowledgments yet your grace must excuse me they will have their way they are indeed but words yet i know and feel they come from my heart and therefore are not wholly unworthy of your graces acceptance i even flatter myself such is my pride that you have some little satisfaction in your own work if i did not deceive myself in this it would complete the happiness of  my lord your graces most obliged and devoted servant   letter lix mr gray to mr nicholls rector of lounde and bradwell in suffolk his acquaintance with mr gray commenced a few years before the date of this when he was a student of trinityhall cambridge  jermynstreet aug        that mr brocket has broken his neck by a fall from his horse you will have seen in the news papers and also that i your humble servant have kissed the kings hand for his succession they are both true but the manner how you know not only i can assure you that i had no hand at all in his fall and almost as little in the second event he died on the sunday on wednesday following his grace the duke of grafton wrote me a very polite letter to say that his majesty had commanded him to offer me the vacant professorship not only as a reward of etc but as a credit to etc with much more too high for me to transcribe so on thursday the king signed the warrant and next day at his levee i kissed his hand he made me several gracious speeches which i shall not repeat because every body that goes to court does so besides the day was so hot and the ceremony so embarrassing to me that i hardly knew what he said  adieu i am to perish here with heat this fortnight yet and then to cambridge to be sure my dignity is a little the worse for wear but mended and washed it will do for me   letter lx mr gray to mr beattie pembrokehall oct         it is some time since i received from mr foulis two copies of my poems one by the hands of mr t pit the other by mr merrill a bookseller of this town it is indeed a most beautiful edition and must certainly do credit both to him and to me but i fear it will be of no other advantage to him as dodsley has contrived to glut the town already with two editions beforehand one of   00 and the other of   0 both indeed far inferior to that of glasgow but sold at half the price i must repeat my thanks sir for the trouble you have been pleased to give yourself on my account and through you i must desire leave to convey my acknowledgments to mr foulis for the pains and expense he has been at in this publication  we live at so great a distance that perhaps you may not yet have learned what i flatter myself you will not be displeased to hear the middle of last summer his majesty was pleased to appoint me regius professor of modern history in this university it is the best thing the crown has to bestow on a layman here the salary is  00 l per ann but what enhances the value of it to me is that it was bestowed without being asked the person who held it before me died on the sunday and on wednesday following the duke of grafton wrote me a letter to say that the king offered me this office with many additional expressions of kindness on his graces part to whom i am but little known and whom i have not seen either before or since he did me this favor instances of a benefit so nobly conferred i believe are rare and therefore i tell you of it as a thing that does honor not only to me but to the minister  as i lived here before from choice i shall now continue to do so from obligation if business or curiosity should call you southwards you will find few friends that will see you with more cordial satisfaction than dear sir etc   end of the fourth section section the fifth the reader will have gathered from the preceding series of letters that the greatest part of mr grays life was spent in that kind of learned leisure which has only selfimprovement and selfgratification for its object he will probably be surprised that with so very strait an income he should never have read with a view of making his researches lucrative to himself or useful to the public the truth was mr gray had ever expunged the word lucrative from his own vocabulary he may be said to have been one of those very few personages in the annals of literature especially in the poetical class who are devoid of selfinterest and at the same time attentive to economy and also among mankind in general one of those very few economists who possess that talent untinctured with the slightest stain of avarice were it my purpose in this place to expatiate on his moral excellencies i should here add that when his circumstances were at the lowest he gave away such sums in private charity as would have done credit to an ampler purse but it is rather my lesspleasing province at present to acknowledge one of his foibles and that was a certain degree of pride which led him of all other things to despise the idea of being thought an author professed i have been told indeed that early in life he had an intention of publishing an edition of strabo and i find amongst his papers a great number of geographical disquisitions particularly with respect to that part of asia which comprehends persia and india concerning the ancient and modern names and divisions of which extensive countries his notes are very copious the indefatigable pains which he also took with the writings of plato and the quantity of critical as well as explanatory observations which he has left upon almost every part of his works plainly indicate that no man in europe was better prepared to republish and illustrate that philosopher than mr gray another work on which he bestowed uncommon labor was the anthologia amongst the books which his friendship bequeathed to me is henry stevenss edition of that collection of greek epigrams interleaved in which he has transcribed several additional ones that he selected in his extensive reading has inserted a great number of critical notes and emendations and subjoined a copious index in which every epigram is arranged under the name of its respective author it should seem that mr grays pains were on this occasion very ill employed for the late lord chesterfield writing to his son says i hope you are got out of the worst company in the world the greek epigrams martial has wit and is worth looking into sometimes but i recommend the greek epigrams to your supreme contempt see lord chesterfields letters let    however if what mr gray says be true p     supra that a dead lord ranks only with commoners there may come a time when lord chesterfields dictum in matters of taste may not be held more infallible than that of his own and other dead lords in points of religion and morality nay when his own plan of gentle manly education may be thought less capable of furnishing his country with useful members of society than the plain oldfashioned one which he wrote to explode if this day does not quickly come one may without pretending to a gift of prophecy pronounce that england will neither be nor deserve to be any thing better than a province of france  this manuscript though written in that exact manner as if intended for the press i do not know that it was ever mr grays design to make public the only work which he meditated upon with this direct view from the beginning was a history of english poetry he has mentioned this himself in an advertisement prefixed to those three fine imitations of norse and welsh poetry which he gave the world in the last edition of his poems but the slight manner in which he there speaks of that design may admit here of some additional explanation several years ago i was indebted to the friendship of the present learned bishop of gloucester for a transcript of this paper is to be found printed in the life of mr pope written by mr ruffhead a curious manuscript paper of mr popes which contains the first sketch of a plan for a work of this kind and which i have still in my possession mr gray was greatly struck with the method which mr pope had traced out in this little sketch and on my proposal of engaging with him in compiling such a history he examined the plan more accurately enlarged it considerably and formed an idea for an introduction to it in this was to be ascertained the origin of rhyme and specimens given not only of the provencal poetry to which alone mr pope seemed to have adverted but of the scaldic british and saxon as from all these different sources united english poetry had its original though it could hardly be called by that name till the time of chaucer with whose school i e the poets who wrote in his manner the history itself was intended to commence the materials which i collected for this purpose are too inconsiderable to be mentioned but mr gray besides versifying those odes that he published made many elaborate disquisitions into the origin of rhyme and that variety of meter to be found in the writings of our ancient poets he also transcribed many parts of the voluminous lidgate from manuscripts which he found in the university library and those of private colleges remarking as he went along the several beauties and defects of this immediate scholar of chaucer he however soon found that a work of this kind pursued on so very extensive a plan would become almost endless and hearing at the same time that mr thomas warton fellow of trinitycollege oxford of whose abilities from his observations on spenser we had each of us conceived the highest opinion was engaged in a work of the same kind we by mutual consent relinquished our undertaking and soon after on that gentlemans desiring a sight of the plan mr gray readily sent him a copy of it this gentleman has just now politely acknowledged the favor in his preface to his first volume on this subject a work which as he proceeds in it through more enlightened periods will undoubtedly give the world as high an idea of his critical taste as the present specimen does of his indefatigable researches into antiquity   at a time when i am enumerating the more considerable of mr grays antiquarian pursuits i must not omit to mention his great knowledge of gothic architecture he had seen and accurately studied in his youth while abroad the roman proportions on the spot both in ancient ruins and in the works of palladio in his later years he applied himself to consider those stupendous structures of more modern date that adorn our own country which if they have not the same grace have undoubtedly equal dignity he endeavored to trace this mode of building from the time it commenced through its various changes till it arrived at its perfection in the reign of henry the eighth and ended in that of elizabeth for this purpose he did not so much depend upon written accounts as that internal evidence which the buildings themselves give of their respective antiquity since they constantly furnish to the wellinformed eye arms ornaments and other undubitable marks by which their several ages may be ascertained on this account he applied himself to the study of heraldry as a preparatory science and has left behind him a number of genealogical papers more than sufficient to prove him a complete master of it by these means he arrived at so very extraordinary a pitch of sagacity as to be enabled to pronounce at first sight on the precise time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was erected he invented also several terms of art the better to explain his meaning on this subject i frequently pressed him to digest these in a regular order and offered under his direction to adapt a set of drawings to them which might describe every ornament peculiarly in use in every different era but though he did not disapprove this hint he neglected it and has left no papers that would lead to its prosecution i therefore mention it in this place only to induce certain of his friends to whom i know he communicated more of his thoughts upon this subject than to me to pursue the design if they think it would be attended with utility to the public  there is an eloge on m labbe le beuf published in the histoiredelacad des inscriptions and belles lettres vol   th by which it appears that gentleman had precisely the same idea with mr gray on this subject and by pursuing it had arrived at the same degree of skill les voyages and les lectures de m labbe le beuf lavoient tellement familiarise avec les monumens quil apercevoit les differences les plus delicates de lancienne architecture il demeloit du premier coupdoeil les caracteres de chaque siecle a linspection dun batiment il pouvoit dire quelquefois a vingt annees pres dans quel temps il avoit ete construit les ceintres les chapiteaux les moulures portoient a ces yeux la date de leur batisse beaucoup des grands edifices ont ete louvrage de plusieurs siecles plus encore ont ete repares en des siecles differens il decomposoit un meme batiment avec une facilite singuliere il fixoit lage des diverses parties and ses decisions etoient toujours fondees sur les preuves indubitables on en trouve une foul dexemples dans son histoire du diocese de paris his panegyrist also informs us that he was solicited by his friend m joly de fleury to reduce into a body of science the discoveries which he had made that his ill health prevented him but that the work is now in the hands of a person very capable of perfecting his idea yet i question whether a work of this kind from a french writer will be of any great importance since i am informed by a very competent judge that the resemblance between gothic architecture in england and in france is surprisingly slight except in the cathedral at amiens and a few other churches supposed to be built by the english while in possession of french provinces the public has much more to hope from mr t wartons late promise to it as he of all other living writers is best qualified to give complete satisfaction to the curious on this subject in the meanwhile it may not be amiss to inform the reader that mr benthams remarks on saxon churches which make a part of an elaborate introduction to his history of ely cathedral lately published will convey to him many sentiments of mr gray as amongst other antiquaries he contributed his assistance to that gentleman who in his preface has accordingly mentioned the obligation  but the favorite study of mr gray for the last ten years of his life was natural history which he then rather resumed than began as by the instructions of his uncle antrobus he was a considerable botanist at fifteen he followed it closely and often said that he thought it a singular felicity to have engaged in it as besides the constant amusement it gave him in his chamber it led him more frequently out into the fields and by making his life less sedentary improved the general course of his health and spirits  habituated as he had long been to apply only to firstrate authors as to the fountainhead of that knowledge which he was at the time solicitous to acquire it is obvious that when he resolved to make himself master of natural history he would immediately become the disciple of the great linnaeus his first business was to understand accurately his termini artis which he called justly the learning a new original language he then went regularly through the vegetable animal and fossile kingdoms the marginal notes which he has left not only on linnaeus but the many other authors which he read on these subjects are very numerous but the most considerable are on hudsons flora anglica and the tenth edition of the systema naturae which latter he interleaved and filled almost entirely while employed on zoology he also read aristotles treatise on that subject with great care and explained many difficult passages of that obscure ancient from the lights he had acquired from modern naturalists  having now given a general account of that variety of literary pursuits which in their turns principally engaged his attention and which were either not mentioned or only glanced at in the preceding letters let me be permitted to say a word or two of his amusements the chief and almost the only one of these if we except the frequent experiments he made on flowers in order to mark the mode and progress of their vegetation was music his taste in this art was equal to his skill in any more important science it was founded on the best models those great masters in italy who flourished about the same time with his favorite pergolesi of his and of leos bononcinis vincis and hasses works he made a valuable collection while abroad chiefly of such of their vocal compositions as he had himself heard and admired observing in his choice of these the same judicious rule which he followed in making his collection of prints which was not so much to get together complete sets of the works of any master as to select those the best in their kind which would recall to his memory the capital pictures statues and buildings which he had seen and studied by this means as he acquired in painting great facility and accuracy in the knowledge of hands so in music he gained supreme skill in the more refined powers of expression especially when we consider that art as an adjunct to poetry for vocal music and that only excepting perhaps the lessons of the younger scarlatti was what he chiefly regarded his instrument was the harpsicord on which though he had little execution yet when he sung to it he so modulated the small powers of his voice he was much admired for his singing in his youth yet he was so shy in exercising this talent that mr walpole tells me he never could but once prevail on him to give a proof of it and then it was with so much pain to himself that it gave him no manner of pleasure  as to be able to convey to the intelligent hearer no common degree of satisfaction this however he could seldom be prevailed upon to do even by his most intimate acquaintance  to conclude this slight sketch of his literary character i believe i may with great truth assert that excepting pure mathematics and the studies dependent on that science there was hardly any part of human learning in which he had not acquired a competent skill in most of them a confummate mastery  i proceed now as i did in the former sections to select for the readers perusal the last series of his letters they are few in number yet contain all the incidents that occurred in that very short space of time during which providence was pleased further to continue him a blessing to his friends and an ornament to his country  letter i mr gray to mr nicholls i was absent from college and did not receive your melancholy letter till my return hither yesterday so you must not attribute this delay to me but to accident to sympathize with you in such a loss the death of his uncle governor floyer is an easy task for me but to comfort you not so easy can i wish to see you unaffected with the sad scene now before your eyes or with the loss of a person that through a great part of your life has proved himself so kind a friend to you he who best knows our nature for he made us what we are by such afflictions recalls us from our wandering thoughts and idle merriment from the insolence of youth and prosperity to serious reflection to our duty and to himself nor need we hasten to get rid of these impressions time by appointment of the same power will cure the smart and in some hearts soon blot out all the traces of sorrow but such as preserve them longest for it is partly left in our own power do perhaps best acquiesce in the will of the chastiser  for the consequences of this sudden loss i see them well and i think in a like situation could fortify my mind so as to support them with cheerfulness and good hopes though not naturally inclined to see things in their best aspect when you have time to turn yourself round you must think seriously of your profession you know i would have wished to see you wear the livery of it long ago but i will not dwell on this subject at present to be obliged to those we love and esteem is a pleasure but to serve and oblige them is a still greater and this with independance no vulgar blessing are what a profession at your age may reasonably promise without it they are hardly attainable remember i speak from experience  in the mean time while your present situation lasts which i hope will not be long continue your kindness and confidence in me by trusting me with the whole of it and surely you hazard nothing by so doing that situation does not appear so new to me as it does to you you well know the tenor of my conversation urged at times perhaps a little farther than you liked has been intended to prepare you for this event and to familiarize your mind with this spectre which you call by its worst name but remember that honesta res est laeta paupertas i see it with respect and so will every one whose poverty is not seated in their mind an excellent thought finely expressed  there is but one real evil in it take my word who know it well and that is that you have less the power of assisting others who have not the same resources to support them you have youth you have many kind wellintentioned people belonging to you many acquaintance of your own or families that will wish to serve you consider how many have had the same or greater cause for dejection with none of these resources before their eyes adieu i sincerely wish your happiness  ps i have just heard that a friend of mine is struck with a paralytick disorder in which state it is likely he may live incapable of assisting himself in the hands of servants or relations that only gape after his spoils perhaps for years to come think how many things may befall a man far worse than poverty or death this letter was written a year or two before the time when this series of letters should commence but as it was not communicated to me before the last section was printed off and has a connection with that which follows it i chose to begin this section with it the date not appearing to be very material and the pathetic and friendly turn of it strongly pleading for its insertion      letter ii mr gray to mr nicholls pembroke college june         and so you have a garden of your own mr nicholls by having pursued the advice of his correspondent we find was now possessed of that competency which he wished him happy not only in having so sage an adviser but in his own good sense which prompted him to follow such advice the gaiety whim and humor of this letter contrast prettily with the gravity and serious reflection of the former  and you plant and transplant and are dirty and amused are not you ashamed of yourself why i have no such thing you monster nor ever shall be either dirty or amused as long as i live my gardens are in the windows like those of a lodger up three pair of stairs in petticoatlane or camomilestreet and they go to bed regularly under the same roof that i do dear how charming it must be to walk out in ones own garding and sit on a bench in the open air with a fountain and leaden statue and a rolling stone and an arbor have a care of sore throats though and the ago  however be it known to you though i have no garden i have sold my estate and got a thousand guineas consisting of houses on the west side of handalley london mrs olliffe was the aunt here mentioned who had a share in this estate and for whom he procured this annuity she died in      a few months before her nephew  and fourscore pounds a year for my old aunt and a twenty pound prize in the lottery and lord knows what arrears in the treasury and am a rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that has had losses and one that has two gowns and every thing handsome about him and in a few days shall have new window curtains are you avized of that ay and a new mattrass to lie upon  my ode has been rehearsed again and again ode for music on the duke of graftons installation see poems p    his reason for writing it is given in the next letter  and the scholars have got scraps by heart i expect to see it torn piecemeal in the northbriton before it is born if you will come you shall see it and sing in it amidst a chorus from salisbury and gloucester music meeting great names there and all well versed in judas maccabaeus i wish it were once over for then i immediately go for a few days to london and so with mr brown to aston though i fear it will rain the whole summer and skiddaw will be invisible and inaccessible to mortals  i have got de la landes voyage through italy in eight volumes he is a member of the academy of sciences and pretty good to read i have read too an octavo volume of shenstones letters poor man he was always wishing for money for fame and other distinctions and his whole philosophy consisted in living against his will in retirement and in a place which his taste had adorned but which he only enjoyed when people of note came to see and commend it his correspondence is about nothing else but this place and his own writings with two or three neighboring clergymen who wrote verses too  i have just found the beginning of a letter which somebody had dropped i should rather call it firstthoughts for the beginning of a letter for there are many scratches and corrections as i cannot use it myself having got a beginning already of my own i send it for your use on some great occasion  dear sir after so long silence the hopes of pardon and prospect of forgiveness might seem entirely extinct or at least very remote was i not truly sensible of your goodness and candor which is the only asylum that my negligence can fly to since every apology would prove insufficient to counterbalance it or alleviate my fault how then shall my deficiency presume to make so bold an attempt or be able to suffer the hardships of so rough a campaign etc etc etc    letter iii mr gray to mr beattie cambridge july         the late ceremony of the duke of graftons installation has hindered me from acknowledging sooner the satisfaction your friendly compliment gave me i thought myself bound in gratitude to his grace unasked to take upon me the task of writing those verses which are usually set to music on this occasion in a short note which he wrote to mr stonhewer june    when at his request he sent him the ode in manuscript for his graces perusal he expresses this motive more fully i did not intend the duke should have heard me till he could not help it you are desired to make the best excuses you can to his grace for the liberty i have taken of praising him to his face but as somebody was necessarily to do this i did not see why gratitude should sit silent and leave it to expectation to sing who certainly would have sung and that a gorge deployee upon such an occasion  i do not think them worth sending you because they are by nature doomed to live but a single day or if their existence is prolonged beyond that date it is only by means of newspaper parodies and witless criticisms this sort of abuse i had reason to expect but did not think it worth while to avoid  mr foulis is magnificent in his gratitude when the glasgow edition of mr grays poems was sold off which it was in a short time mr foulis finding himself a considerable gainer mentioned to mr beattie that he wished to make mr gray a present either of his homer in   vols folio or the greek historians printed likewise at his press in    vols duodecimo  i cannot figure to myself how it can be worth his while to offer me such a present you can judge better of it than i and if he does not hurt himself by it i would accept his homer with many thanks i have not got or even seen it  i could wish to subscribe to his new edition of milton and desire to be set down for two copies of the large paper but you must inform me where and when i may pay the money  you have taught me to long for a second letter and particularly for what you say will make the contents of it his correspondent had intimated to him his intention of sending him his first book of the minstrel see the seventh letter of this series  i have nothing to requite it with but plain and friendly truth and that you shall have joined to a zeal for your fame and a pleasure in your success  i am now setting forward on a journey toward the north of england but it will not reach so far as i could wish i must return hither before michaelmas and shall barely have time to visit a few places and a few friends   letter iv mr gray to dr wharton aston oct         i hope you got safe and well home after that troublesome night dr wharton who had intended to accompany mr gray to keswick was seized at brough with a violent fit of his asthma which obliged him to return home this was the reason that mr gray undertook to write the following journal of his tour for his friends amusement he sent it under different covers i give it here in continuation it may not be amiss however to hint to the reader that if he expects to find elaborate and nicelyturned periods in this narration he will be greatly disappointed when mr gray described places he aimed only to be exact clear and intelligible to convey peculiar not general ideas and to paint by the eye not the fancy there have been many accounts of the westmoreland and cumberland lakes both before and since this was written and all of them better calculated to please readers who are fond of what they call fine writing yet those who can content themselves with an elegant simplicity of narrative will i flatter myself find this to their taste they will perceive it was written with a view rather to inform than surprise and if they make it their companion when they take the same tour it will inhance their opinion of its intrinsic excellence in this way i tried it myself before i resolved to print it  i long to hear you say so for me i have continued well been so favored by the weather that my walks have never once been hindered till yesterday that is a fortnight and three or four days and a journey of more than  00 miles i am now at aston for two days tomorrow i go to cambridge mason is not here but mr alderson receives me according to my promise i send you the first sheet of my journal to be continued without end  sept  0 a mile and a half from brough where we parted on a hill lay a great army there is a great fair for cattle kept on the hill near brough on this day and the preceding encamped to the left opened a fine valley with green meadows and hedgerows a gentlemans house peeping forth from a grove of old trees on a nearer approach appeared myriads of cattle and horses in the road itself and in all the fields round me a brisk stream hurrying cross the way thousands of clean healthy people in their best partycolored apparel farmers and their families esquires and their daughters hastening up from the dales and down the fells from every quarter glittering in the sun and pressing forward to join the throng while the dark hills on whose tops the mists were yet hanging served as a contrast to this gay and moving scene which continued for near two miles more along the road and the crowd coming toward it reached on as far as appleby on the ascent of the hill above appleby the thick hanging wood and the long reaches of the eden clear rapid and full as ever winding below with views of the castle and town gave much employment to the mirror mr gray carried usually with him on these tours a planoconvex mirror of about four inches diameter on a black foil and bound up like a pocketbook a glass of this sort is perhaps the best and most convenient substitute for a camera obscura of any thing that has hitherto been invented and may be had of any optician  but now the sun was wanting and the sky overcast oats and barley cut every where but not carried in passed kirbythore sir william dalstons house at acornbank whinfield park harthorn oaks countesspillar broughamcastle mr browns large new house crossed the eden and the eimot pronounce eeman with its green vale and dined at three oclock with mrs buchanan at penrith on trout and partridge in the afternoon walked up beaconhill a mile to the top and could see ulswater through an opening in the bosom of that cluster of broken mountains which the doctor well remembers whinfield and lowther parks etc and the craggy tops of an hundred nameless hills these lie to west and south to the north a great extent of black and dreary plains to the east crossfell just visible through mists and vapors hovering round it  oct   a gray autumnal day the air perfectly calm and mild went to see ulswater five miles distant soon left the keswickroad and turned to the left through shady lanes along the vale of eeman which runs rapidly on near the way ripling over the stones to the right is delmaine a large fabric of pale red stone with nine windows in front and seven on the side built by mr hassle behind it a fine lawn surrounded by woods and a long rocky eminence rising over them a clear and brisk rivulet runs by the house to join the eeman whose course is in sight and at a small distance farther on appears hatton st john a castlelike old mansion of mr huddleston approached dunmallert a finepointed hill covered with wood planted by old mr hassle beforementioned who lives always at home and delights in planting walked over a spungy meadow or two and began to mount the hill through a broad straight green alley among the trees and with some toil gained the summit from hence saw the lake opening directly at my feet majestic in its calmness clear and smooth as a blue mirror with winding shores and low points of land covered with green enclosures white farmhouses looking out among the trees and cattle feeding the water is almost every where bordered with cultivated lands gently sloping upwards from a mile to a quarter of a mile in breadth till they reach the feet of the mountains which rise very rude and awful with their broken tops on either hand directly in front at better than three miles distance placefell one of the bravest among them pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the lake and forces it to alter its course forming first a large bay to the left and then bending to the right i descended dunmallert again by a side avenue that was only not perpendicular and came to bartonbridge over the eeman then walking through a path in the wood round the bottom of the hill came forth where the eeman issues out of the lake and continued my way along its western shore close to the water and generally on a level with it saw a cormorant flying over it and fishing the figure of the lake nothing resembles that laid down in our maps it is nine miles long and at widest under a mile in breadth after extending itself three miles and a half in a line to southwest it turns at the foot of placefell almost due west and is here not twice the breadth of the thames at london it is soon again interrupted by the root of helvellyn a lofty and very rugged mountain and spreading again turns off to southeast and is lost among the deep recesses of the hills to this second turning i pursued my way about four miles along its borders beyond a village scattered among trees and called watermallock in a pleasant grave day perfectly calm and warm but without a gleam of sunshine then the sky seeming to thicken and the valley to grow more desolate and evening drawing on i returned by the way i came to penrith  oct   i set out at ten for keswick by the road we went in      saw greystock town and castle to the right which lie about three miles from ulswater over the fells passed through penradoch and threlcot at the foot of saddleback whose surrowed sides were gilt by the noonday sun whilst its brow appeared of a sad purple from the shadow of the clouds as they sailed slowly by it the broad and green valley of gardies and lowside with a swift stream glittering among the cottages and meadows lay to the left and the much finer but narrower valley of st johns opening into it hilltop the large though low mansion of the gaskarths now a farmhouse seated on an eminence among woods under a steep fell was what appeared the most conspicuous and beside it a great rock like some ancient tower nodding to its fall passed by the side of skiddaw and its cub called latterrig and saw from an eminence at two miles distance the vale of elysium in all its verdure the sun then playing on the bosom of the lake and lighting up all the mountains with its luster dined by two oclock at the queens head and then straggled out alone to the parsonage where i saw the sun set in all its glory  oct   a heavenly day rose at seven and walked out under the conduct of my landlord to borrowdale the grass was covered with a hoarfrost which soon melted and exhaled in a thin bluish smoke crossed the meadows obliquely catching a diversity of views among the hills over the lake and islands and changing prospect at every ten paces left cockshut which we formerly mounted and castlehill a loftier and more rugged hill behind me and drew near the foot of wallacrag whose bare and rocky brow cut perpendicularly down above  00 feet as i guess though the people called it much more awfully overlooks the way our path here tends to the left and the ground gently rising and covered with a glade of scattering trees and bushes on the very margin of the water opens both ways the most delicious view that my eyes ever beheld opposite are the thick woods of lord egremont and newlandvalley with green and smiling fields embosomed in the dark cliffs to the left the jaws of borrowdale with that turbulent chaos of mountain behind mountain rolled in confusion beneath you and stretching far away to the right the shining purity of the lake reflecting rocks woods fields and inverted tops of hills just ruffled by the breeze enough to show it is alive with the white buildings of keswick crosthwaite church and skiddaw for a back ground at a distance behind you the magnificent heights of wallacrag here the glass played its part divinely the place is called carfclosereeds and i chose to set down these barbarous names that any body may enquire on the place and easily find the particular station that i mean this scene continues to barrowgate and a little farther passing a brook called barrowbeck we entered borrowdale the crags named lawdoorbanks begin now to impend terribly over your way and more terribly when you hear that three years since an immense mass of rock tumbled at once from the brow and barred all access to the dale for this is the only road till they could work their way through it luckily no one was passing at the time of this fall but down the side of the mountain and far into the lake lie dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all shapes and in all directions something farther we turned aside into a coppice ascending a little in front of lawdoor waterfall the height appeared to be about  00 feet the quantity of water not great though these three days excepted it had rained daily in the hills for near two months before but then the stream was nobly broken leaping from rock to rock and foaming with fury on one side a towering crag that spired up to equal if not overtop the neighboring cliffs this lay all in shade and darkness on the other hand a rounder broader projecting hill shagged with wood and illuminated by the sun which glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract the force of the water wearing a deep channel in the ground hurries away to join the lake we descended again and passed the stream over a rude bridge soon after we came under gowdarcrag a hill more formidable to the eye and to the apprehension than that of lawdoor the rocks at top deepcloven perpendicularly by the rains hanging loose and nodding forwards seem just starting from their base in shivers the whole way down and the road on both sides is strewed with piles of the fragments strangely thrown across each other and of a dreadful bulk the place reminds me of those passes in the alps where the guides tell you to move on with speed and say nothing lest the agitation of the air should loosen the snows above and bring down a mass that would overwhelm a caravan i took their counsel here and hastened on in silence  non ragioniam di lor ma guarda e passa the hills here are clothed all up their steep sides with oak ash birch holly etc some of it has been cut forty years ago some within these eight years yet all is sprung again green flourishing and tall for its age in a place where no soil appears but the staring rock and where a man could scarce stand upright here we met a civil young farmer overseeing his reapers for it is now oatharvest who conducted us to a neat white house in the village of grange which is built on a rising ground in the midst of a valley round it the mountains form an awful amphitheatre and through it obliquely runs the derwent clear as glass and showing under its bridge every trout that passes beside the village rises a round eminence of rock covered entirely with old trees and over that more proudly towers castlecrag invested also with wood on its sides and bearing on its naked top some traces of a fort said to be roman by the side of this hill which almost blocks up the way the valley turns to the left and contracts its dimensions till there is hardly any road but the rocky bed of the river the wood of the mountains increases and their summits grow loftier to the eye and of more fantastic forms among them appear eaglescliff dovesnest whitedalepike etc celebrated names in the annals of keswick the dale opens about four miles higher till you come to seawhaite where lies the way mounting the hills to the right that leads to the waddmines all farther access is here barred to prying mortals only there is a little path winding over the fells and for some weeks in the year passable to the dalesmen but the mountains know well that these innocent people will not reveal the mysteries of their ancient kingdom the reign of chaos and old night only i learned that this dreadful road dividing again leads one branch to ravenglas and the other to hawkshead  for me i went no farther than the farmers better than four miles from keswick at grange his mother and he brought us butter that siserah would have jumped at though not in a lordly dish bowls of milk thin oatencakes and ale and we had carried a cold tongue thither with us our farmer was himself the man that last year plundered the eagles eyrie all the dale are up in arms on such an occasion for they lose abundance of lambs yearly not to mention hares partridges grouse etc he was let down from the cliff in ropes to the shelf of the rock on which the nest was built the people above shouting and hollowing to fright the old birds which flew screaming round but did not dare to attack him he brought off the eaglet for there is rarely more than one and an addle egg the nest was roundish and more than a yard over made of twigs twisted together seldom a year passes but they take the brood or eggs and sometimes they shoot one sometimes the other parent but the survivor has always found a mate probably in ireland and they breed near the old place by his description i learn that this species is the erne the vulture albicilla of linnaeus in his last edition but in yours falco albicilla so consult him and pennant about it  we returned leisurely home the way we came but saw a new landscape the features indeed were the same in part but many new ones were disclosed by the midday sun and the tints were entirely changed take notice this was the best or perhaps the only day for going up skiddaw but i thought it better employed it was perfectly serene and hot as midsummer  in the evening i walked alone down to the lake by the side of crowpark after sunset and saw the solemn coloring of night draw on the last gleam of sunshine fading away on the hilltops the deep serene of the waters and the long shadows of the mountains thrown across them till they nearly touched the hithermost shore at a distance were heard the murmurs of many waterfalls not audible in the daytime i wished for the moon but she was dark to me and silent hid in her vacant interlunar cave   oct   i walked to crowpark now a rough pasture once a glade of ancient oaks whose large roots still remain on the ground but nothing has sprung from them if one single tree had remained this would have been an unparalled spot and smith judged right when he took his print of the lake from hence for it is a gentle eminence not too high on the very margin of the water and commanding it from end to end looking full into the gorge of borrowdale i prefer it even to cockshuthill which lies beside it and to which i walked in the afternoon it is covered with young trees both sown and planted oak spruce scotchfir etc all which thrive wonderfully there is an easy ascent to the top and the view far preferable to that on castlehill which you remember because this is lower and nearer to the lake for i find all points that are much elevated spoil the beauty of the valley and make its parts which are not large look poor and diminutive the picturesque point is always thus low in all prospects a truth which though the landscape painter knows he cannot always observe since the patron who employs him to take a view of his piace usually carries him to some elevation for that purpose in order i suppose that he may have more of him for his money yet when i say this i would not be thought to mean that a drawing should be made from the lowest point possible as for instance in this very view from the lake itself for then a foreground would be wanting on this account when i failed on derwentwater i did not receive so much pleasure from the superb amphitheatre of mountains around me as when like mr gray i traversed its margin and i therefore think he did not lose much by not taking boat  while i was here a little shower fell red clouds came marching up the hills from the east and part of a bright rainbow seemed to rise along the side of castlehill  from hence i got to the parsonage a little before sunset and saw in my glass a picture that if i could transmit to you and fix it in all the softness of its living colors would fairly sell for a thousand pounds this is the sweetest scene i can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty the rest are in a sublimer style  oct   i walked through the meadows and cornfieldsd to the derwent and crossing it went up howhill it looks along bassinthwaitwater and sees at the same time the course of the river and a part of the upperlake with a full view of skiddaw then i took my way through portingskall village to the park a hill so called covered entirely with wood it is all a mass of crumbling slate passed round its foot between the trees and the edge of the water and came to a peninsula that juts out into the lake and looks along it both ways in front rises wallacrag and castlehill the town the road to penrith skiddaw and saddleback returning met a brisk and cold northeastern blast that ruffled all the surface of the lake and made it rise in little waves that broke at the foot of the wood after dinner walked up the penrith road two miles or more and turning into a cornfield to the right called castlerig saw a druidcircle of large stones  0  feet in diameter the biggest not eight feet high but most of them still erect they are fifty in number see this piece of antiquity more fully described with a plate annexed by mr pennant in his second tour to scotland in      p     the valley of st johns appeared in fight and the summits of catchidecam called by camden casticand and helvellyn said to be as high as skiddaw and to rise from a much higher base  oct   went in a chaise eight miles along the east side of bassingthwaite water to ousebridge pronounced ewsbridge the road in some part made and very good the rest slippery and dangerous cartroad or narrow rugged lanes but no precipices it runs directly along the foot of skiddaw opposite to widhopebrows clothed to the top with wood a very beautiful view opens down to the lake which is narrower and longer than that of keswick less broken into bays and without islands it is somewhat extraordinary that mr gray omitted to mention the islands on derwentwater one of which i think they call it vicars island makes a principal object in the scene see smiths view of derwentwater  at the foot of it a few paces from the brink gently sloping upward stands armathwate in a thick grove of scotch firs commanding a noble view directly up the lake at a small distance behind the house is a large extent of wood and still behind this a ridge of cultivated hills on which according to the keswick proverb the sun always shines the inhabitants here on the contrary call the vale of derwentwater the devils chamber pot and pronounce the name of skiddawfell which terminates here with a sort of terror and aversion armathwate house is a modern fabric not large and built of darkred stone belonging to mr spedding whose grandfather was steward to old sir james lowther and bought this estate of the himers the sky was overcast and the wind cool so after dining at a publickhouse which stands here near the bridge that crosses the derwent just where it issues from the lake and sauntering a little by the waterside i came home again the turnpike is finished from cockermouth hither five miles and is carrying on to penrith several little showers today a man came in who said there was snow on crossfell this morning  oct   i walked in the morning to crowpark and in the evening up penrith road the clouds came rolling up the mountains all round very dark yet the moon shone at intervals it was too damp to go toward the lake tomorrow i mean to bid farewell to keswick  botany might be studied here to great advantage at another season because of the great variety of soils and elevations all lying within a small compass i observed nothing but several curious lichens and plenty of gale or dutch myrtle perfuming the borders of the lake this year the waddmine had been opened which is done once in five years it is taken out in lumps sometimes as big as a mans fist and will undergo no preparation by fire not being fusible when it is pure soft black and closegrained it is worth sometimes thirty shillings a pound there are no charr ever taken in these lakes but plenty in buttermerewater which lies a little way north of borrowdale about martinmas which are potted here they sow chiefly oats and bigg here which are now cutting and still on the ground the rains have done much hurt yet observe the soil is so thin and light that no day has passed in which i could not walk out with ease and you know i am no lover of dirt fell mutton is now in season for about six weeks it grows fat on the mountains and nearly resembles venison excellent pike and perch here called bass trout is out of season partridge in great plenty  oct   i left keswick and took the ambleside road in a gloomy morning and about two miles from the town mounted an eminence called castlerigg and the sun breaking out discovered the most enchanting view i have yet seen of the whole valley behind me the two lakes the river the mountains all in their glory so that i had almost a mind to have gone back again the road in some few parts is not completed yet good country road through sound but narrow and stony lanes very safe in broad daylight this is the case about causewayfoot and among naddlefells to lancwaite the vale you go in has little breadth the mountains are vast and rocky the fields little and poor and the inhabitants are now making hay and see not the sun by two hours in a day so long as at keswick came to the foot of helvellyn along which runs an excellent road looking down from a little height on leeswater called also thirlmeer or wibornwater and soon descending on its margin the lake looks black from its depth and from the gloom of the vast crags that scowl over it though really clear as glass it is narrow and about three miles long resembling a river in its course little shining torrents hurry down the rocks to join it but not a bush to overshadow them or cover their march all is rock and loose stones up to the very brow which lies so near your way that not above half the height of helvellyn can be seen  next i passed by the little chapel of wiborn out of which the sunday congregation were then issuing soon after a beck near dunmeilraise when i entered westmoreland a second time and now began to see holmcrag distinguished from its rugged neighbors not so much by its height as by the strange broken outlines of its top like some gigantick building demolished and the stones that composed it flung cross each other in wild confusion just beyond it opens one of the sweetest landscapes that art ever attempted to imitate the bosom of the mountains spreading here into a broad basin discovers in the midst grasmerewater its margin is hollowed into small bays with bold eminences some of rock some of soft turf that halfconceal and vary the figure of the little lake they command from the shore a low promontory pushes itself far into the water and on it stands a white village with the parish church rising in the midst of it hanging enclosures cornfieldsd and meadows green as an emerald with their trees and hedges and cattle fill up the whole space from the edge of the water and just opposite to you is a large farmhouse at the bottom of a steep smooth lawn embosomed in old woods which climb halfway up the mountains side and discover above them a broken line of crags that crown the scene not a single red tile no flaring gentlemans house or gardenwalls break in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise but all is peace rusticity and happy poverty in its neatest most becoming attire  the road winds here over grasmerehill whose rocks soon conceal the water from your sight yet it is continued along behind them and contracting itself to a river communicates with ridalewater another small lake but of inferior size and beauty it seems shallow too for large patches of reeds appear pretty far within it into this vale the road descends on the opposite banks large and ancient woods mount up the hills and just to the left of our way stands ridalehall the familyseat of sir michael fleming a large oldfashioned fabric surrounded with wood sir michael is now on his travels and all this timber far and wide belongs to him near the house rises a huge crag called ridalehead which is said to command a full view of wynandermere and i doubt it not for within a mile that great lake is visible even from the road as to going up the crag one might as well go up skiddaw  i now reached ambleside eighteen miles from keswick meaning to lie there but on looking into the best bedchamber dark and damp as a cellar grew delicate gave up wynandermere in despair and resolved i would go on to kendal directly fourteen miles farther by not staying a little at ambleside mr gray lost the sight of two most magnificent cascades the one not above half a mile behind the inn the other down ridalecrag where sir michael fleming is now making a pathway to the top of it these when i saw them were in full torrent whereas lawdoor waterfall which i visited in the evening of the very same day was almost without a stream hence i conclude that this distinguished feature in the vale of keswick is like most northern rivers only in high beauty during bad weather but his greatest loss was in not seeing a small waterfall visible only through the window of a ruined summer house in sir michaels orchard here nature has performed every thing in little that she usually executes on her largest scale and on that account like the miniature painter seems to have finished every part of it in a studied manner not a little fragment of rock thrown into the basin not a single stem of brushwood that starts from its craggy sides but has its picturesque meaning and the little central stream dashing down a cleft of the darkestcoloured stone produces an effect of light and shadow beautiful beyond description this little theatrical scene might be painted as large as the original on a canvass not bigger than those which are usually dropped in the operahouse  the road in general fine turnpike but some parts about three miles in all not made yet without danger  for this determination i was unexpectedly well rewarded for the afternoon was fine and the road for the space of full five miles ran along the side of wynandermere with delicious views across it and almost from one end to the other it is ten miles in length and at most a mile over resembling the course of some vast and magnificent river but no flat marshy grounds no osierbeds or patches of scrubby plantations on its banks at the head two valleys open among the mountains one that by which we came down the other langsledale in which wrynose and hardknot two great mountains rise above the rest from thence the fells visibly sink and soften along its sides sometimes they run into it but with a gentle declivity in their own dark and natural complexion oftener they are green and cultivated with farms interspersed and round eminences on the border covered with trees toward the south it seemed to break into larger bays with several islands and a wider extent of cultivation the way rises continually till at a place called orresthead it turns southeast losing sight of the water  passed by ingschapel and staveley but i can say no farther for the dusk of evening coming on i entered kendal almost in the dark and could distinguish only a shadow of the castle on a hill and tentergrounds spread far and wide round the town which i mistook for houses my inn promised sadly having two wooden galleries like scotland in front of it it was indeed an old illcontrived house but kept by civil sensible people so i stayed two nights with them and fared and slept very comfortably  oct   the air mild as summer all corn off the ground and the skylarks singing aloud by the way i saw not one at keswick perhaps because the place abounds in birds of prey i went up the castlehill the town consists chiefly of three nearly parallel streets almost a mile long except these all the other houses seem as if they had been dancing a countrydance and were out there they stand back to back corner to corner some up hill some down without intent or meaning along by their side runs a fine brisk stream over which are three stonebridges the buildings a few comfortable houses excepted are mean of stone and covered with a bad rough cast near the end of the town stands a handsome house of col wilsons and adjoining to it the church a very large gothic fabric with a square tower it has no particular ornaments but double isles and at the east end four chapels or choirs one of the parrs another of the stricklands the third is the proper choir of the church and the fourth of the bellinghams a family now extinct there is an altartomb of one of them dated      with a flat brass arms and quarterings and in the window their arms alone arg a huntinghorn sab strung gules in the stricklands chapel several modern monuments and another old altartomb not belonging to the family on the side of it a fess dancetty between ten billets deincourt in the parrs chapel is a third altartomb in the corner no figure or inscription but on the side cut in stone an escutcheon of roos of kendal three waterbudgets quartering parr two bars in a bordure engrailed  dly an escutcheon vaire a fess for marmion  dly an escutcheon three chevronels braced and a chief which i take for fitzhugh at the foot is an escutcheon surrounded with the garter bearing roos and parr quarterly quartering the other two beforementioned i have no books to look in therefore cannot say whether this is the lord parr of kendal queen catharines father or her brother the marquis of northampton perhaps it is a cenotaph for the latter who was buried at warwick in      the remains of the castle are seated on a fine hill on the side of the river opposite the town almost the whole enclosure of the walls remains with four towers two square and two round but their upper part and embattlements are demolished it is of rough stone and cement without any ornament or arms round enclosing a court of like form and surrounded by a moat nor ever could it have been larger than it is for there are no traces of outworks there is a good view of the town and river with a fertile open valley through which it winds  after dinner i went along the milthrop turnpike four miles to see the falls or force of the river kent came to sizergh pronounced siser and turned down a lane to the left this seat of the stricklands an old catholic family is an ancient hallhouse with a very large tower embattled the rest of the buildings added to it are of later date but all is white and seen to advantage on a back ground of old trees there is a small park also well wooded opposite to this turning to the left i soon came to the river it works its way in a narrow and deep rocky channel overhung with trees the calmness and brightness of the evening the roar of the waters and the thumping of huge hammers at an ironforge not far distant made it a singular walk but as to the falls for there are two they are not four feet high i went on down to the forge and saw the demons at work by the light of their own fires the iron is brought in pigs to milthrop by sea from scotland etc and is here beat into bars and plates two miles further at levens is the seat of lord suffolk where he sometimes passes the summer it was a favorite place of his late countess but this i did not see  oct  0 i proceeded by burton to lancaster twentytwo miles very good country well enclosed and wooded with some common interspersed passed at the foot of farltonknot a high fell four miles north of lancaster on a rising ground called boulton pronounced bouton we had a full view of cartmellsands with here and there a passenger riding over them it being low water the points of furness shooting far into the sea and lofty mountains partly covered with clouds extending north of them lancaster also appeared very conspicuous and fine for its most distinguished features the castle and church mounted on a green eminence were all that could be seen woe is me when i got thither it was the second day of their fair the inn in the principal street was a great old gloomy house full of people but i found tolerable quarters and even slept two nights in peace  in a fine afternoon i ascended the castlehill it takes up the higher top of the eminence on which it stands and is irregularly round encompassed with a deep moat in front toward the town is a magnificent gothic gateway lofty and huge the overhanging battlements are supported by a triple range of corbels the intervals pierced through and showing the day from above on its top rise light watchtowers of small height it opens below with a grand pointed arch over this is a wrought tabernacle doubtless once containing its founders figure on one side a shield of france semyquartered with england on the other the same with a label ermine for john of gaunt duke of lancaster this opens to a court within which i did not much care to enter being the countygaol and full of prisoners both criminals and debtors from this gateway the walls continue and join it to a vast square tower of great height the lower part at least of remote antiquity for it has small roundheaded lights with plain short pillars on each side of them there is a third tower also square and of less dimensions this is all the castle near it and but little lower stands the church a large and plain gothic fabric the high square tower at the west end has been rebuilt of late years but nearly in the same style there are no ornaments of arms etc any where to be seen within it is lightsome and spacious but not one monument of antiquity or piece of painted glass is left from the churchyard there is an extensive seaview for now the tide had almost covered the sands and filled the river and besides the greatest part of furness i could distinguish peelcastle on the isle of fowdrey which lies off its southern extremity the town is built on the slope and at the foot of the castlehill more than twice the bigness of aukland with many neat buildings of white stone but a little disorderly in their position and ad libitum like kendal many also extend below on the keys by the riverside where a number of ships were moored some of them threemasted vessels decked out with their colors in honor of the fair here is a good bridge of four arches over the lune that runs when the tide is out in two streams divided by a bed of gravel which is not covered but in springtides below the town it widens to near the breadth of the thames at london and meets the sea at five or six miles distance to southwest  oct    i crossed the river and walked over a peninsula three miles to the village of pooton which stands on the beach an old fisherman mending his nets while i enquired about the danger of passing those sands told me in his dialect a moving story how a brother of the trade a cockler as he styled him driving a little cart with two daughters women grown in it and his wife on horseback following set out one day to pass the sevenmile sands as they had frequently been used to do for nobody in the village knew them better than the old man did when they were about halfway over a thick fog rose and as they advanced they found the water much deeper than they expected the old man was puzzled he stopped and said he would go a little way to find some mark he was acquainted with they staid a while for him but in vain they called aloud but no reply at last the young women pressed their mother to think where they were and go on she would not leave the place she wandered about forlorn and amazed she would not quit her horse and get into the cart with them they determined after much time wasted to turn back and give themselves up to the guidance of their horses the old woman was soon washed off and perished the poor girls clung close to their cart and the horse sometimes wading and sometimes swimming brought them back to land alive but senseless with terror and distress and unable for many days to give any account of themselves the bodies of their parents were found next ebb that of the father a very few paces distant from the spot where he had left them  in the afternoon i wandered about the town and by the key till it grew dark  oct    i set out for settle by a fine turnpikeroad twentynine miles through a rich and beautiful enclosed country diversified with frequent villages and churches very unequal ground and on the left the river lune winding in a deep valley its hanging banks clothed with fine woods through which you catch long reaches of the water as the road winds about at a considerable height above it in the most picturesque part of the way i passed the park belonging to the hon mr clifford a catholic the grounds between him and the river are indeed charming this scene opens just three miles from lancaster on what is called the queens road to see the view in perfection you must go into a field on the left here ingleborough behind a variety of lesser mountains makes the background of the prospect on each hand of the middle distance rise two sloping hills the left clothed with thick woods the right with variegated rock and herbage between them in the richest of valleys the lune serpentizes for many a mile and comes forth ample and clear through a wellwooded and richly pastured foreground every feature which constitutes a perfect landscape of the extensive sort is here not only boldly marked but also in its best position  the house is ordinary and the park nothing but a rocky fell scattered over with ancient hawthorns next i came to hornby a little town on the river wanning over which a handsome bridge is now building the castle in a lordly situation attracted me so i walked up the hill to it first presents itself a large white ordinary sashed gentlemans house and behind it rises the ancient keep built by edward stanley lord monteagle he died about      in king henry the eighths time it is now only a shell the rafters are laid within it as for flooring i went up a winding stonestaircase in one corner to the leads and at the angle is a single hexagon watchtower rising some feet higher fitted up in the taste of a modern summer house with sashwindows in gilt frames a stucco cupola and on the top a vast gilt eagle built by mr charteris the present possessor he is the second son of the earl of wemys brother to the lord elcho and grandson to col charteris whose name he bears  from the leads of the tower there is a fine view of the country round and much wood near the castle ingleborough which i had seen before distinctly at lancaster to northeast was now completely wrapped in clouds all but its summit which might have been easily mistaken for a long black cloud too fraught with an approaching storm now our road begun gradually to mount toward the apennine the trees growing less and thinner of leaves till we came to ingleton eighteen miles it is a pretty village situated very high and yet in a valley at the foot of that huge monster of nature ingleborough two torrents cross it with great stones rolled along their beds instead of water and over them are flung two handsome arches the nipping air though the afternoon was growing very bright now taught us we were in craven the road was all up and down though no where very steep to the left were mountaintops to the right a wide valley all enclosed ground and beyond it high hills again in approaching settle the crags on the left drew nearer to our way till we descended bruntonbrow into a cheerful valley though thin of trees to giggleswick a village with a small piece of water by its side covered over with coots near it a church which belongs also to settle and half a mile farther having passed the ribble over a bridge i arrived there it is a small market town standing directly under a rocky fell there are not in it above a dozen goodlooking houses the rest are old and low with little wooden porticos in front my inn pleased me much though small for the neatness and civility of the good woman that kept it so i lay there two nights and went  oct    to visit gordalescar which lay six miles from settle but that way was directly over a fell and as the weather was not to be depended on i went round in a chaise the only way one could get near it in a carriage which made it full thirteen miles half of it such a road but i got safe over it so there is an end and came to malham pronounced maum a village in the bosom of the mountains seated in a wild and dreary valley from thence i was to walk a mile over very rough ground a torrent rattling along on the left hand on the cliffs above hung a few goats one of them danced and scratched an ear with its hind foot in a place where i would not have stood stockstill for all beneath the moon as i advanced the crags seemed to close in but discovered a narrow entrance turning to the left between them i followed my guide a few paces and the hills opened again into no large space and then all farther way is barred by a stream that at the height of about fifty feet gushes from a hole in the rock and spreading in large sheets over its broken front dashes from steep to steep and then rattles away in a torrent down the valley the rock on the left rises perpendicular with stubbed yewtrees and shrubs staring from its side to the height of at least  00 feet but these are not the thing it is the rock to the right under which you stand to see the fall that forms the principal horror of the place from its very base it begins to slope forwards over you in one block or solid mass without any crevice in its surface and overshadows half the area below with its dreadful canopy when i stood at i believe four yards distance from its foot the drops which perpetually distill from its brow fell on my head and in one part of its top more exposed to the weather there are loose stones that hang in air and threaten visibly some idle spectator with instant destruction it is safer to shelter yourself close to its bottom and trust to the mercy of that enormous mass which nothing but an earthquake can stir the gloomy uncomfortable day well suited the savage aspect of the place and made it still more formidable i stayed there not without shuddering a quarter of an hour and thought my trouble richly paid for the impression will last for life at the alehouse where i dined in malham vivares the landscapepainter had lodged for a week or more smith and bellers had also been there and two prints of gordale have been engraved by them  oct    leaving my comfortable inn to which i had returned from gordale i set out for skipton sixteen miles from several parts of the road and in many places about settle i saw at once the three famous hills of this country ingleborough penigent and pendle the first is esteemed the highest and their features not to be described but by the pencil without the pencil nothing indeed is to be described with precision and even then that pencil ought to be in the very hand of the writer ready to supply with outlines every thing that his pen cannot express by words as far as language can describe mr gray has i think pushed its powers for rejecting as i before hinted every general unmeaning and hyperbolical phrase he has selected both in this journal and on other similar occasions the plainest simplest and most direct terms yet notwithstanding his judicious care in the use of these i must own i feel them defective they present me it is true with a picture of the same species but not with the identical picture my imagination receives clear and distinct but not true and exact images it may be asked then why am i entertained by wellwritten descriptions i answer because they amuse rather than inform me and because after i have seen the places described they serve to recall to my memory the original scene almost as well as the truest drawing or picture in the meanwhile my mind is flattered by thinking it has acquired some conception of the place and rests contented in an innocent error which nothing but ocular proof can detect and which when detected does not diminish the pleasure i had before received but augments it by superadding the charms of comparison and verification and herein i would place the real and only merit of verbal prose description to speak of poetical would lead me beyond the limits as well as the purpose of this note i cannot however help adding that i have seen one piece of verbal description which completely satisfies me because it is throughout assisted by masterly delineation it is composed by the rev mr gilpin of cheam in surry and contains amongst other places an account of the very scenes which in this tour our author visited this gentleman possessing the conjoined talent of a writer and a designer has employed them in this manuscript to every purpose of picturesque beauty in the description of which a correct eye a practiced pencil and an eloquent pen could assist him he has consequently produced a work unique in its kind at once but i have said it is in manuscript and i am afraid likely to continue so for would his modesty permit him to print it the great expense of plates would make its publication almost impracticable   craven after all is an unpleasing country when seen from a height its valleys are chiefly wide and either marshy or enclosed pasture with a few trees numbers of black cattle are fatted here both of the scotch breed and a larger sort of oxen with great horns there is little cultivated ground except a few oats  skipton to which i went through longpreston and gargrave is a pretty large market town in a valley with one very broad street gently sloping downwards from the castle which stands at the head of it this is one of our good countesss buildings anne countess of pembroke and montgomery  but on old foundations it is not very large but of a handsome antique appearance with round towers a grand gateway bridge and moat surrounded by many old trees it is in good repair and kept up as a habitation of the earl of thanet though he rarely comes thither what with the sleet and a foolish dispute about chaises that delayed me i did not see the inside of it but went on fifteen miles to otley first up shodebank the steepest hill i ever saw a road carried over in england for it mounts in a strait line without any other repose for the horses than by placing stones every now and then behind the wheels for a full mile then the road goes on a level along the brow of this high hill over rumbaldmoor till it gently descends into wharldale so they call the vale of the wharf and a beautiful vale it is wellwooded wellcultivated wellinhabited but with high crags at a distance that border the green country on either hand through the midst of it deep clear full to the brink and of no inconsiderable breadth runs in long windings the river how it comes to pass that it should be so fine and copious a stream here and at tadcaster so much lower should have nothing but a wide stony channel without water i cannot tell you i passed through longaddingham ilkeley pronounced eecly distinguished by a lofty brow of loose rocks to the right burley a neat and pretty village among trees on the opposite side of the river lay middletonlodge belonging to a catholic gentleman of that name weston a venerable stone fabric with large offices of mr vavasour the meadows in front gently descending to the water and behind a great and shady wood farnley mr fawkess a place like the last but larger and rising higher on the side of the hill otley is a large airy town with clean but low rustic buildings and a bridge over the wharf i went into its spacious gothic church which has been newroofed with a flat stuccoceiling in a corner of it is the monument of thomas lord fairfax and helen ask his lady descended from the cliffords and latimers as her epitaph says the figures not illcut particularly his in armor but bareheaded lie on the tomb i take them to be the parents of the famous sir thomas fairfax   letter v mr gray to dr wharton april       0 i have utterly forgot where my journal left off but i think it was after the account of gordale near settle if so there was little more worth your notice the principal things were wharldale in the way from skipton to otley and kirstall abbey three miles from leeds  here a paragraph describing wharldale in the foregoing journal was repeated  kirstall is a noble ruin in the semisaxon style of building as old as king stephen toward the end of his reign      the whole church is still standing the roof excepted seated in a delicious quiet valley on the banks of the river air and preserved with religious reverence by the duke of montagu adjoining to the church between that and the river are variety of chapels and remnants of the abbey shattered by the encroachments of the ivy and surrounded by many a sturdy tree whose twisted roots break through the fret of the vaulting and hang streaming from the roofs the gloom of these ancient cells the shade and verdure of the landscape the glittering and murmur of the stream the lofty towers and long perspectives of the church in the midst of a clear bright day detained me for many hours and were the truest objects for my glass i have yet met with any where as i lay at that smoky ugly busy town of leeds i dropped all further thoughts of my journal and after passing two days at masons though he was absent pursued my way by nottingham leicester harborough kettering thrapston and huntingdon to cambridge where i arrived on the   d of october having met with no rain to signify till this last day of my journey there is luck for you  i do think of seeing wales this summer having never found my spirits lower than at present and feeling that motion and change of the scene is absolutely necessary to me i will make aston in my way to chester and shall rejoice to meet you there the last week in may mason writes me word that he wishes it and though his old house is down and his new one not up proposes to receive us like princes in grain   letter vi mr gray to mr nicholls this letter was written the   th of november      but as it delineates another abbey in a different manner it seems to make no improper companion to that which precedes it  i received your letter at southampton and as i would wish to treat every body according to their own rule and measure of good breeding have against my inclination waited till now before i answered it purely out of fear and respect and an ingenuous diffidence of my own abilities if you will not take this as an excuse accept it at least as a wellturned period which is always my principal concern  so i proceed to tell you that my health is much improved by the sea not that i drank it or bathed in it as the common people do no i only walked by it and looked upon it the climate is remarkably mild even in october and november no snow has been seen to lie there for these thirty years past the myrtles grow in the ground against the houses and guernsey lilies bloom in every window the town clean and well built surrounded by its old stone walls with their towers and gateways stands at the point of a peninsula and opens full south to an arm of the sea which having formed two beautiful bays on each hand of it stretches away in direct view till it joins the british channel it is skirted on either side with gentlyrising grounds clothed with thick wood and directly cross its mouth rise the high lands of the isle of wight at distance but distinctly seen in the bosom of the woods concealed from profane eyes lie hid the ruins of nettely abbey there may be richer and greater houses of religion but the abbot is content with his situation see there at the top of that hanging meadow under the shade of those old trees that bend into a half circle about it he is walking slowly good man and bidding his beads for the souls of his benefactors interred in that venerable pile that lies beneath him beyond it the meadow still descending nods a thicket of oaks that mask the building and have excluded a view too garish and luxuriant for a holy eye only on either hand they leave an opening to the blue glittering sea did you not observe how as that white sail shot by and was lost he turned and crossed himself to drive the tempter from him that had thrown that distraction in his way i should tell you that the ferryman who rowed me a lusty young fellow told me that he would not for all the world pass a night at the abbey there were such things seen near it though there was a power of money hid there from thence i went to salisbury wilton and stonhenge but of these things i say no more they will be published at the university press  ps i must not close my letter without giving you one principal event of my history which was that in the course of my late tour i set out one morning before five oclock the moon shining through a dark and misty autumnal air and got to the seacoast time enough to be at the suns levee i saw the clouds and dark vapors open gradually to right and left rolling over one another in great smoky wreathes and the tide as it flowed gently in upon the sands first whitening then slightly tinged with gold and blue and all at once a little line of insufferable brightness that before i can write these five words was grown to half an orb and now to a whole one too glorious to be distinctly seen this puts me in mind of a similar description written by dr jeremy tailor which i shall here beg leave to present to the reader who will find by it that the old divine had occasionally as much power of description as even our modern poet as when the sun approaches toward the gates of the morning he first opens a little eye of heaven and sends away the spirits of darkness gives light to the cock and calls up the lark to mattins and by and by gilds the fringes of a cloud and peeps over the eastern hills thrusting out his golden horns  and still while a man tells the story the sun gets up higher till he shows a fair face and a full light j taylors holy dying p     it is very odd it makes no figure on paper yet i shall remember it as long as the sun or at least as long as i endure i wonder whether any body ever saw it before i hardly believe it     letter vii mr gray to mr beattie pembroke hall july      0 i rejoice to hear that you are restored to better state of health to your books and to your muse once again that forced dissipation and exercise we are obliged to fly to as a remedy when this frail machine goes wrong is often almost as bad as the distemper we would cure yet i too have been constrained of late to pursue a like regimen on account of certain pains in the head a sensation unknown to me before and of great dejection of spirits this sir is the only excuse i have to make you for my long silence and not as perhaps you may have figured to yourself any secret reluctance i had to tell you my mind concerning the specimen you so kindly sent me of your new poem this letter was written in answer to one that enclosed only a part of the first book of the minstrel in manuscript and i believe a sketch of mr beatties plan for the whole  on the contrary if i had seen any thing of importance to disapprove i should have hastened to inform you and never doubted of being forgiven the truth is i greatly like all i have seen and wish to see more the design is simple and pregnant with poetical ideas of various kinds yet seems somehow imperfect at the end why may not young edwin when necessity has driven him to take up the harp and assume the profession of a minstrel do some great and singular service to his country what service i must leave to your invention such as no general no statesman no moralist could do without the aid of music inspiration and poetry this will not appear an improbability in those early times and in a character then held sacred and respected by all nations besides it will be a full answer to all the hermit has said when he dissuaded him from cultivating these pleasing arts it will show their use and make the best panegyric of our favorite and celestial science and lastly what weighs most with me it will throw more of action pathos and interest into your design which already abounds in reflection and sentiment as to description i have always thought that it made the most graceful ornament of poetry but never ought to make the subject your ideas are new and borrowed from a mountainous country the only one that can furnish truly picturesque scenery some trifles in the language or versification you will permit me to remark a few paragraphs of particular criticism are here omitted   i will not enter at present into the merits of your essay on truth because i have not yet given it all the attention it deserves though i have read it through with pleasure besides i am partial for i have always thought david hume a pernicious writer and believe he has done as much mischief here as he has in his own country a turbid and shallow stream often appears to our apprehensions very deep a professed skeptic can be guided by nothing but his present passions if he has any and interests and to be masters of his philosophy we need not his books or advice for every child is capable of the same thing without any study at all is not that naivete and good humor which his admirers celebrate in him owing to this that he has continued all his days an infant but one that unhappily has been taught to read and write that childish nation the french have given him vogue and fashion and we as usual have learned from them to admire him at second hand on a similar subject mr gray expresses himself thus in a letter to mr walpole dated march         he must have a very good stomach that can digest the crambe recocta of voltaire atheism is a vile dish though all the cooks of france combine to make new sauces to it as to the soul perhaps they may have none on the continent but i do think we have such things in england shakespeare for example i believe had several to his own share as to the jews though they do not eat pork i like them because they are better christians than voltaire this was written only three months before his death and i insert it to show how constant and uniform he was in his contempt of infidel writers dr beattie received only one letter more from his correspondent dated march        it related to the first book of the minstrel now sent to him in print and contained criticisms on particular passages and commendations of particular stanzas those criticisms the author attended to in a future edition because his good taste found that they deserved his attention the passages therefore being altered the strictures die of course as to the notes of commendation the poem itself abounds with so many striking beauties that they need not even the hand of mr gray to point them out to a reader of any feeling all therefore that i shall print of that letter is the concluding paragraph relating to his essay on the immutability of truth i am happy to hear of your success in another way because i think you are serving the cause of human nature and the true interests of mankind your book is read here too and with just applause    letter viii mr gray to mr how this letter and the following if received earlier would have found their place according to their dates in the fourth section but i choose rather to print them here out of place than to reserve them for another edition that the purchasers of this may not have hereafter cause to complain that the book was incomplete  cambridge sept  0      i ought long since to have made you my acknowledgements for the obliging testimonies of your esteem that you have conferred upon me but count algarottis books three small treatises on painting the opera and the french academy for painters in italy they have been since collected in the leghorn edition of his works did not come to my hands till the end of july and since that time i have been prevented by illness from doing any of my duties i have read them more than once with increasing satisfaction and should wish mankind had eyes to descry the genuine sources of their own pleasures and judgment to know the extent that nature has prescribed to them if this were the case it would be their interest to appoint count algarotti their arbiter elegantiarum he is highly civil to our nation but there is one point in which he does not do us justice i am the more solicitous about it because it relates to the only taste we can call our own the only proof of our original talent in matter of pleasure i mean our skill in gardening or rather laying out grounds and this is no small honor to us since neither italy nor france have ever had the least notion of it nor yet do at all comprehend it when they see it that the chinese have this beautiful art in high perfection seems very probable from the jesuits letters and more from chamberss little discourse published some years ago the author has since enlarged and published it under the title of a dissertation on oriental gardening in which he has put it out of all doubt that the chinese and english tastes are totally dissimilar  but it is very certain we copied nothing from them nor had any thing but nature for our model it is not forty years since the art was born among us see mr walpoles history of this art at the end of the last volume of his anecdotes of painters when he favors the world with its publication  and it is sure that there was nothing in europe like it and as sure we then had no information on this head from china at all i question whether this be not saying too much sir william temples account of the chinese gardens was published some years before this period and it is probable that might have promoted our endeavors not indeed of imitating them but of imitating what he said was their archetype nature   i shall rejoice to see you in england and talk over these and many other matters with you at leisure do not despair of your health because you have not found all the effects you had promised yourself from a finer climate i have known people who have experienced the same thing and yet at their return have lost all their complaints as by miracle  ps i have answered count algarottis letter and his to mr mason i conveyed to him but whether he has received his books i have not yet heard     mr how on receiving the foregoing letter communicated the objection which it contained to the count who admitting the justness of it altered the passage as appears from the following extract of the answer which he sent to that gentleman  mi spiace solamente che quella critica concernente i giardini inglesi non la abbia fatta a me medesimo quasi egli dovesse credermi piu amico della mia opinione che della verita ecco come ho cangiato qual luogo dopo le parole nel tesser la favola di un poema simili ai giardini della cina sono quelli che piantano gl inglesi dietro al medesimo modello della natura quanto ella ha di vago e di vario boschetti collinette acque vive praterie con dei tempietti degli obelischi ed anche di belle rovine che spuntano qua e la si trova quivi reunito dal gusto dei kent e dei chambers as he had written on the subject this mistake was natural enough in count algarotti  che hanno di tanto sorpassato il le nautre tenuto gia il maestro dell architettura diro cosi de giardini dalle ville dinghilterra e sbandita la simmetria francese i piu bei siti pajono naturali il culto e misto col negletto e il disordine che vi regna e leffetto dell art la meglio ordinata it is seldom that an author of a reputation so established as mr how truly remarked when he sent this extract to mr gray so easily readily and explicitly gives up his own opinion to that of another or even to conviction itself nor perhaps would count algarotti have done so had he not been thoroughly apprized to whose correction he submitted  letter ix mr gray to mr how pembroke hall jan         i was willing to go through the eight volumes of count algarottis works which you lately presented to the library of this college before i returned you an answer this must be my excuse to you for my silence first i condole with you that so neat an edition should swarm in almost every page with errors of the press not only in notes and citations from greek english and french authors but in the italian text itself greatly to the disreputation of the leghorn publishers this is the only reason i think that could make an edition in england necessary but i doubt you would not find the matter much mended here our presses as they improve in beauty declining daily in accuracy besides you would find the expense very considerable and the sale in no proportion to it as in reality it is but few people in england that read currently and with pleasure the italian tongue and the fine old editions of their capital writers are sold at london for a lower price than they bear in italy an english translation i can by no means advise the justness of thought and good sense might remain but the graces of elocution which make a great part of algarottis merit would be entirely lost and that merely from the very different genius and complexion of the two languages  doubtless there can be no impropriety in your making the same present to the university that you have done to your own college you need not at all to fear for the reputation of your friend he has merit enough to recommend him in any country a tincture of various sorts of knowledge an acquaintance with all the beautiful arts an easy command a precision warmth and richness of expression and a judgment that is rarely mistaken on any subject to which he applies it i had read the congresso di citera before and was excessively pleased with it in spite of prejudice for i am naturally no friend to allegory nor to poetical prose the giudicio damore is an addition rather inferior to it what gives me the least pleasure of any of his writings is the newtonianism it is so direct an imitation of fontenelle a writer not easy to imitate and least of all in the italian tongue whose character and graces are of a higher style and never adapt themselves easily to the elegant badinage and legerete of conversation that sit so well on the french the essays and letters many of them entirely new to me on the arts are curious and entertaining those on other subjects even where the thoughts are not new but borrowed from his various reading and conversation often better put and better expressed than in the originals i rejoice when i see machiavel defended or illustrated who to me appears one of the wisest men that any nation in any age has produced most of the other discourses military or political are well worth reading though that on koulikhan was a mere jeu desprit a sort of historical exercise the letters from russia i had read before with pleasure particularly the narrative of munick and lascys campaigns the detached thoughts are often new and just but there should have been a revisal of them as they are frequently to be found in his letters repeated in the very same words some too of the familiar letters might have been spared the verses are not equal to the prose but they are above mediocrity   letter x this letter was written some years before and would have been inserted after letter liii of the fourth section if received in time  mr gray to mr nicholls it is long since that i heard you were gone in haste into yorkshire on account of your mothers illness and the same letter informed me that she was recovered otherwise i had then wrote to you only to beg you would take care of her and to inform you that i had discovered a thing very little known which is that in ones whole life one never can have any more than a single mother you may think this is obvious and what you call a trite observation you are a green gosling i was at the same age very near as wise as you and yet i never discovered this with full evidence and conviction i mean till it was too late it is thirteen years ago and seems but as yesterday and every day i live it sinks deeper into my heart he seldom mentioned his mother without a sigh after his death her gowns and wearing apparel were found in a trunk in his apartments just as she had left them it seemed as if he could never take the resolution to open it in order to distribute them to his female relations to whom by his will he bequeathed them  many a corollary could i draw from this axiom for your use not for my own but i will leave you the merit of doing it for yourself pray tell me how your health is i conclude it perfect as i hear you offered yourself as a guide to mr palgrave into the sierramorena of yorkshire for me i passed the end of may and all june in kent not disagreeably in the west part of it from every eminence the eye catches some long reach of the thames or medway with all their shipping in the east the sea breaks in upon you and mixes its white transient sails and glittering blue expanse with the deeper and brighter greens of the woods and corn this sentence is so fine i am quite ashamed but no matter you must translate it into prose palgrave if he heard it would cover his face with his pudding sleeve i do not tell you of the great and small beasts and creeping things innumerable that i met with because you do not suspect that this world is inhabited by any thing but men and women and clergy and such twolegged cattle now i am here again very disconsolate and all alone for mr brown is gone and the cares of this world are coming thick upon me you i hope are better off riding and walking in the woods of studley etc etc i must not wish for you here besides i am going to town at michaelmas by no means for amusement   letter xi mr gray to mr nicholls pembrokehall jan         i rejoice you have met with froissart he is the herodotus of a barbarous age had he but had the luck of writing in as good a language he might have been immortal his locomotive disposition for then there was no other way of learning things his simple curiosity his religious credulity were much like those of the old grecian see more of his opinion of this author sect iv letter xxxvi  when you have tant chevauche as to get to the end of him there is monstrelet waits to take you up and will set you down at philip de comines but previous to all these you should have read villehardouin and joinville i do not think myself bound to defend the character of even the best of kings i suppose his correspondent had made some strictures on the character of henry iv of france see sect iv letter xxii  pray slash them all and spare not  it would be strange too if i should blame your greek studies or find fault with you for reading isocrates i did so myself twenty years ago and in an edition at least as bad as yours the panegyric the de pace areopagitic and advice to philip are by far the noblest remains we have of this writer and equal to most things extant in the greek tongue but it depends on your judgment to distinguish between his real and occasional opinion of things as he directly contradicts in one place what he has advanced in another for example in the panathenaic and the de pace etc on the naval power of athens the latter of the two is undoubtedly his own undisguised sentiment  i would by all means wish you to comply with your friends request and write the letter he desires i trust to the cause and to the warmth of your own kindness for inspiration write eloquently that is from your heart in such expressions as that will furnish this short sentence contains a complete definition of natural eloquence when it becomes an art it requires one more prolix and our author seems to have begun to sketch it on a detached paper its province says he is to reign over minds of slow perception and little imagination to set things in lights they never saw them in to engage their attention by details and circumstances gradually unfolded to adorn and heighten them with images and colors unknown to them and to raise and engage their rude passions to the point to which the speaker wishes to bring them   men sometimes catch that feeling from a stranger which should have originally sprung from their own heart   letter xii mr gray to dr wharton may         my last summers tour was through worcestershire gloucestershire monmouthshire herefordshire and shropshire five of the most beautiful counties in the kingdom the very principal light and capital feature of my journey was the river wye which i descended in a boat for near forty miles from ross to chepstow its banks are a succession of nameless beauties one out of many you may see not ill described by mr whately in his observations on gardening under the name of the newweir he has also touched upon two others tinterne abbey and persfield both of them famous scenes and both on the wye monmouth a town i never heard mentioned lies on the same river in a vale that is the delight of my eyes and the very seat of pleasure the vale of abergavenny ragland and chepstow castles ludlow malvernhills hampton court near lemster the leasows hagley the three cities and their cathedrals and lastly oxford where i passed two days on my return with great satisfaction were the rest of my acquisitions and no bad harvest in my opinion but i made no journal myself else you should have had it i have indeed a short one written by the companion of my travels mr nicholls  that serves to recall and fix the fleeting images of these things  i have had a cough upon me these three months which is incurable the approaching summer i have sometimes had thoughts of spending on the continent but i have now dropped that intention and believe my expeditions will terminate in old park but i make no promise and can answer for nothing my own employment so sticks in my stomach and troubles my conscience and yet travel i must or cease to exist till this year i hardly knew what mechanical low spirits were but now i even tremble at an east wind   this is the last letter which i have selected for this section and i insert it chiefly for the occasion which it affords me of commenting on the latter part of it where he speaks of his own employment as professor of modern history an office which he had now held nearly three years and had not begun to execute the duties of it his health which was all the time gradually on the decline and his spirits only supported by the frequent summer excursions during this period might to the candid reader be a sufficient apology for this omission or rather procrastination but there is more to be said in his excuse and i should ill execute the office i have undertaken of arranging these papers with a view of doing honor to his memory if i did not endeavor to remove every exception that might with a show of reason be taken to his conduct in this instance  his business as professor consisted of two parts one the teaching of modern languages the other the reading of lectures on modern history the patent which created the office authorized him to execute the former of these by deputies the latter the same patent prescribed to him to commence by reading a public lecture in the schools and to continue to do so once at least in every term as this patent did not ascertain the language in which the lecture was to be read he was at liberty to do it either in latin or english he chose the former and i think rather injudiciously because though no man in the earlier part of his life was more ready in latin composition he had now lost the habit and might therefore well have excused himself by the nature of his subject from any superadded difficulty of language however immediately on his appointment he sketched out an admirable plan for his inauguration speech in which after enumerating the preparatory and auxiliary studies requisite such as ancient history georgraphy chronology etc amongst these auxiliaries he has set down memoria tecnica an art in which he had much exercised himself when young i find many memorial verses among his scattered papers and i suspect he found good account in the practice for few men were more ready and accurate in their dates of events than our author he descended to the authentic sources of the science such as public treaties  state records  private correspondence of ambassadors etc he also wrote the exordium of this thesis not indeed in a manner correct enough to be here given by way of fragment but so spirited in point of sentiment as leaves it much to be lamented that he did not proceed to its completion at the same time he drew up and laid before the duke of grafton just then chosen chancellor of the university three different schemes for regulating the method of choosing pupils privately to be instructed by him one of these was so much approved as to be sent to oxford in order to be observed by the new professor then appointed in that place and the same plan or something very similar to it regulates the private lectures which mr grays successor now reads at cambridge but the public ones i believe are still omitted in both universities and yet i conceive that on these had mr gray been appointed earlier in life to the office he would have chosen chiefly to exert his uncommon abilities indeed if we consider the nature of the study itself modern history so far as it is a detail of facts and so far only a boy just come from school can be supposed to be taught it may be as completely learned from private reading as from the mouth of any lecturer whatever what can his lecture consist of if it aims to teach what it ought but a chain of wellauthenticated events judiciously selected from the numerous writers on the subject what can it then be more than an abridgment added to the innumerable ones with which our libraries are already crowded i know of no difficult propositions which this study contains to the proof of which the pupil must be led step after step by the slow hand of demonstration or that require to be elucidated by the conviction of a mechanical experiment on this subject carefully to read is completely to understand it is the exercise of memory not of reason but a public lecturer reading to an audience well instructed in these facts has a wider and nobler field it is his province to trace every important event to its political spring to develope the cause and thence deduce the consequence in the course of such disquisitions the rational faculties of his auditors are employed in weighing the force of his arguments and their judgments finally convinced by the decisive strength of them what would be an idle display of either logic or rhetoric where youths are only to be initiated into the knowledge of facts becomes before this circle of mature hearers a necessary exertion of erudition and genius from such lectures afterward collected into a volume not only the university but the nation itself nay all other nations might reap their advantage and receive from this the benefit they have received from other similar institutions for though mr gray in one of the plans lately mentioned observes that lectures read in public are generally things of more ostentation than use yet he adds if indeed they should gradually swell into a book and the author should find reason to hope they might deserve the attention of the public it is possible they might become of general service of this we have already some instances as judge blackstones lectures on the common law and the bishop of oxfords on hebrew poetry  but these reflections lead me beyond my purpose which was only to remove from my deceased friend any imputation which on this account might rest on his memory certain it is that notwithstanding his ill health he constantly intended to read lectures and i remember the last time he visited me at aston in the summer of the year    0 he expressed much chagrin on this subject and even declared it to be his steadfast resolution to resign his professorship if he found himself unable to do real service in it what i said to dissuade him from this though i urged as may be supposed every argument i could think of had i found so little weight with him that i am almost persuaded he would very soon have put this intention into execution but death prevented the trial the particulars of which it is now my melancholy office to relate  the gout which he always believed hereditary in his constitution for both his parents died of that distemper had for several years attacked him in a weakly and unfixed manner and the great temperance which he observed particularly in regard to his drinking served perhaps to prevent any severe paroxism but by no means eradicated the constitutional malady in the latter end of may      just about the time he wrote the last letter he removed to london where he became feverish and his dejection of spirits increased the weather being then very sultry our common friend dr gisborne physician to his majestys household  advised him for an opener and freer air to remove from his lodgings in jermynstreet to kensington where he frequently attended him and where mr gray so far got the better of his disorder as to be able to return to cambridge meaning from thence to set out very soon for old park in hopes that traveling from which he usually received so much benefit would complete his cure but on the   th of july while at dinner in the college hall he felt a sudden nausea which obliged him to rise from table and retire to his chamber this continued to increase and nothing staying on his stomach he sent for his friend dr glynn who finding it to be the gout in that part thought his case dangerous and called in dr plumptree the physical professor they prescribed to him the usual cordials given in that distemper but without any good effect for on the   th he was seized with a strong convulsion fit which on the  0th returned with increased violence and on the next evening he expired he was sensible at times almost to the last and from the first aware of his extreme danger but expressed no visible concern at the thoughts of his approaching dissolution  this account i draw up from the letters which dr brown then on the spot wrote to me during his short illness and as i felt strongly at the time what tacitus has so well expressed on a similar occasion i may with propriety use his words mihi praeter acerbitatem amici erepti auget maestitiam quod adsidere valetudini fovere deficientem satiari vultu complexu non contigit vita agricolae cap xlv  i was then on the eastern side of yorkshire at a distance from the direct post and therefore did not receive the melancholy intelligence soon enough to be able to reach cambridge before his corpse had been carried to the place he had by will appointed for its interment to see the last rites duly performed therefore fell to the lot of dr brown i had only to join him on his return from the funeral in executing the other trusts which his friendship had authorized us jointly to perform  the method in which i have arranged the foregoing pages has i trust one degree of merit that it makes the reader so well acquainted with the man himself as to render it totally unnecessary to conclude the whole with his character if i am mistaken in this point i have been a compiler to little purpose and i chose to be this rather than a biographer that i might do the more justice to the virtues and genius of my friend i might have written his life in the common form perhaps with more reputation to myself but surely not with equal information to the reader for whose sake i have never related a single circumstance of mr grays life in my own words when i could employ his for the purpose fortunately i had more materials for this use than commonly fall to the lot of an editor and i certainly have not been sparing in the use of them whether i have been too lavish must be left to the decision of the public  with respect to the latin poems which i have printed in the three first sections of these memoirs i must beg leave to add one word here though a little out of place a learned and ingenious person to whom i communicated them after they were printed off was of opinion that they contain some few expressions not warranted by any good authority and that there are one or two false quantities to be found in them i once had an intention to cancel the pages and correct the passages objected to according to my friends criticisms but on second thoughts i deemed it best to let them stand exactly as i found them in the manuscripts the accurate classical reader will perhaps be best pleased with finding out the faulty passages himself and his candor will easily make the proper allowances for any little mistakes in verses which he will consider never had the authors last hand  i might here lay down my pen yet if any reader should still want his character i will give him one which was published very soon after mr grays decease it appeared in the london magazine a month or two after his decease and was prefaced with an eulogy on his poetical merit which i did not think necessary to reprint in a work where that merit so very fully speaks for itself  it appears to be well written and as it comes from an anonymous pen i choose the rather to insert it as it will on that account be less suspected of partiality  perhaps he was the most learned man in europe he was equally acquainted with the elegant and profound parts of science and that not superficially but thoroughly he knew every branch of history both natural i have given in the beginning of this section an account of the great pains which mr gray bestowed on natural history i have since been favored with a letter from a gentleman well skilled in that science who after carefully perusing his interleaved systema naturae of linnaeus gives me this character of it in the class of animals the mammalia he has concentrated if i may use the expression what the old writers and the diffuse buffon have said upon the subject he was universally adapted the concise language of linnaeus and has given it an elegance which the swede had no idea of but there is little of his own in this class and it served him only as a commonplace but it is such a commonplace that few men but mr gray could form in the birds and fishes he has most accurately described all that he had an opportunity of examining but the volume of insects is the most perfect on the english insects there is certainly nothing so perfect in regard to the plants there is little else than the english names and their native soils extracted from the species plantarum of linnaeus i suppose no man was so complete a master of his system he has selected the distinguishing marks of each animal etc with the greatest judgment and what no man else probably could have done he has made the german latin of linnaeus purely classical and civil had read all the original historians of england france and italy and was a great antiquarian criticism metaphysics morals politics made a principal part of his plan of study voyages and travels of all sorts were his favorite amusement and he had a fine taste in painting prints architecture and gardening he has disclaimed any skill in this art in the xxxvith letter of the fourth section and usually held it in less estimation than i think it deserves declaring himself to be only charmed with the bolder features of unadorned nature  with such a fund of knowledge his conversation must have been equally instructing and entertaining but he was also a good man a wellbred man a man of virtue and humanity there is no character without some speck some imperfection and i think the greatest defect in his was an affectation in delicacy or rather effeminacy this is rightly put it was rather an affectation in delicacy and effeminacy than the things themselves and he chose to put on this appearance chiefly before persons whom he did not wish to please  and a visible fastidiousness or contempt and disdain of his inferiors in science he also had in some degree that weakness which disgusted voltaire so much in mr congreve i have often thought that mr congreve might very well be vindicated on this head it seldom happens that the vanity of authorship continues to the end of a mans days it usually soon leaves him where it found him and if he has not something better to build his selfapprobation upon than that of being a popular writer he generally finds himself ill at ease if respected only on that account mr congreve was much advanced in years when the young french poet paid him this visit and though a man of the world he might now feel that indifference to literary fame which mr gray who always led a more retired and philosophic life certainly felt much earlier both of them therefore might reasonably at times express some disgust if their quiet was intruded upon by persons who thought they flattered them by such intrusion  though he seemed to value others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge it was not on account of their knowledge that he valued mankind he contemned indeed all pretenders to literature but he did not select his friends from the literary class merely because they were literate to be his friend it was always either necessary that a man should have something better than an improved understanding or at least that mr gray should believe he had  yet he could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters and though without birth or fortune or station his desire was to be looked upon as a private independent gentleman who read for his amusement perhaps it may be said what signifies so much knowledge when it produced so little is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few poems but let it be considered that mr gray was to others at least innocently employed to himself certainly beneficially his time passed agreeably he was every day making some new acquisition in science his mind was enlarged his heart softened his virtue strengthened the world and mankind were shown to him without a mask and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling and unworthy of the attention of a wise man except the pursuit of knowledge and the practice of virtue in that state wherein god has placed us  the end of the memoirs contents of the memoirs section i introduction

train appear disclose the longexpecting flowers and wake the purple year the attic warbler pours her throat responsive to the cuckows note the untaught harmony of spring while whispering pleasure as they fly cool zephyrs through the clear blue sky their gathered fragrance fling wherever the oaks thick branches stretch a broader browner shade wherever the rude and mossgrown beech oercanopies the glade beside some waters rushy brink with me the muse shall sit and think at ease reclined in rustic state how vain the ardour of the crowd how low how little are the proud how indigent the great still is the toiling hand of care the panting herds repose yet hark how through the peopled air the busy murmur glows the insect youth are on the wing eager to taste the honied spring and float amid the liquid noon some lightly over the current skim some show their gaylygilded trim quickglancing to the sun to contemplations sober eye such is the race of man and they that creep and they that fly shall end where they began alike the busy and the gay but flutter through lifes little day in fortunes varying colors dressed brushed by the hand of rough mischance or chilled by age their airy dance they leave in dust to rest methinks i hear in accents low the sportive kind reply poor moralist and what art thou a solitary fly thy joys no glittering female meets no hive have thou of hoarded sweets no painted plumage to display on hasty wings thy youth is flown thy sun is set thy spring is gone  we frolic while it is may ode ii on the death of a favorite cat drowned in a tub of gold fishes twas on a lofty vases side where chinas gayest art had died the azure flowers that blow demurest of the tabby kind the pensive selima reclined gazed on the lake below her conscious tail her joy declared the fair round face the snowy beard the velvet of her paws her coat that with the tortoise vies her ears of jet and emerald eyes she saw and purrd applause still had she gazed but midst the tide two angel forms were seen to glide the genii of the stream their scaly armours tyrian hue through richest purple to the view betrayed a golden gleam the hapless nymph with wonder saw a whisker first and then a claw with many an ardent wish she stretched in vain to reach the prize what female heart can gold despise what cats averse to fish presumptuous maid with looks intent again she stretched again she bent nor knew the gulf between malignant fate sat by and smiled the slippery verge her feet beguiled she tumbled headlong in eight times emerging from the flood she mewed to every watery god some speedy aid to send no dolphin came no nereid stirred nor cruel tom nor susan heard a favorite has no friend from hence ye beauties undeceived know one false step is never retrieved and be with caution

cleave with pliant arm thy glassy wave the captive linnet which enthrall what idle progeny succeed to chase the rolling circles speed or urge the flying ball while some on earnest business bent their murmuring labors ply against graver hours that bring constraint to sweeten liberty some bold adventurers disdain the limits of their little reign and unknown regions dare descry still as they run they

revive teach me to love and to forgive exact my own defects to scan what others are to feel and know myself a man ode v the progress of poesy pindaric when the author first published this and the following ode he was advised even by his friends to subjoin some few explanatory notes but had too much respect for the understanding of his readers to take that liberty    pindar olymp ii i   awake aeolian lyre awake and give to rapture all thy trembling strings the subject and simile as usual with pindar are united the various sources of poetry which gives life and luster to all it touches are here described its quiet majestic progress enriching every subject otherwise dry and barren with a pomp of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers and its more rapid and irresistible course when swollen and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions from helicons harmonious springs a thousand rills their mazy progress take the laughing flowers that round them blow drink life and fragrance as they flow now the rich stream of music winds along deep majestic smooth and strong through verdant vales and ceres golden reign now rolling down the steep amain headlong impetuous see it pour the rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar i   power of harmony to calm the turbulent sallies of the soul the thoughts are borrowed from the first pythian of pindar oh sovereign of the willing soul parent of sweet and solemnbreathing airs enchanting shell the sullen cares and frantic passions hear thy soft control on thracias hills the lord of war has curbed the fury of his car and dropped his thirsty lance at thy command perching on the sceptred hand of jove thy magic lulls the feathered king with ruffled plumes and flagging wing quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie the terror of his beak and lightenings of his eye i   power of harmony to produce all the graces of motion in the body thee the voice the dance obey tempered to thy warbled lay over idalias velvetgreen the rosycrowned loves are seen on cythereas day with antic sports and blueeyed pleasures frisking light in frolic measures now pursuing now retreating now in circling troops they meet to brisk notes in cadence beating glance their manytwinkling feet slow melting strains their queens approach declare wherever she turns the graces homage pay with arms sublime that float upon the air in gliding state she wins her easy way over her warm cheek and rising bosom move the bloom of young desire and purple light of love ii   to compensate the real and imaginary ills of life the muse was given to mankind by the same providence that sends the day by its cheerful presence to dispel the gloom and terrors of the night mans feeble race what ills await labor and penury the racks of pain disease and sorrows weeping train and death sad refuge from the storms of fate the fond complaint my song disprove and justify the laws of jove say has he given in vain the heavenly muse night and all her sickly dews her specter wan and birds of boding cry he gives to range the dreary sky till down the eastern cliffs afar hyperions march they spy and glittering shafts of war ii   extensive influence of poetic genius over the remotest and most uncivilized nations its connection with liberty and the virtues that naturally attend on it see the erse norwegian and welsh fragments the lapland and american songs in climes beyond the solar road where shaggy forms over icebuilt mountains roam the muse has broke the twilightgloom to cheer the shivering natives dull abode and often beneath the odorous shade of chilis boundless forests laid she deigns to hear the savage youth repeat in loose numbers wildly sweet their feathercincturd chiefs and dusky loves her track wherever the goddess roves glory pursue and generous shame the unconquerable mind and freedoms holy flame ii   progress of poetry from greece to italy and from italy to england chaucer was not unacquainted with the writings of dante or of petrarch the earl of surrey and sir tho wyatt had traveled in italy and formed their taste there spenser imitated the italian writers milton improved on them but this school expired soon after the restoration and a new one arose on the french model which has subsisted ever since woods that wave over delphis steep isles that crown the aegean deep fields that cool ilissus laves or where maeanders amber waves in lingering labrinths creep how do your tuneful echoes languish mute but to the voice of anguish where each old poetic mountain inspiration breathed around every shade and hallowed fountain murmured deep a solemn sound till the sad nine in greeces evil hour left their parnassus for the latian plains alike they scorn the pomp of tyrantpower and coward vice that revels in her chains when latium had her lofty spirit lost they sought oh albion next thy seaencircled coast iii   far from the sun and summergale in thy green lap was natures shakespeare darling laid what time where lucid avon strayed to him the mighty mother did unveil her awful face the dauntless child stretched forth his little arms and smiled this pencil take she said whose colors clear richly paint the

clothed and longresounding pace iii   hark his hands the lyre explore brighteyed fancy hovering over scatters from her pictured urn thoughts that breathe and words that burn we have had in our language no other odes of the sublime kind than that of dryden on st cecilias day for cowley who had his merit yet wanted judgment style and harmony for such a task that of pope is not worthy of so great a man mr mason indeed of late days has touched the true chords and with a masterly hand in some of his choruses  above all in the last of caractacus hark heard ye not yon footstep dread etc  but ah it is heard no more  oh lyre divine what daring spirit wakes thee now though he inherit nor the pride nor ample pinion pindar that the theban eagle bear sailing with supreme dominion through the azure deep of air yet often before his infant eyes would run such forms as glitter in the muses ray with orient hues unborrowd of the sun yet shall he mount and keep his distant way beyond the limits of a vulgar fate beneath the good how far  but far above the great ode vi the bard pindaric this ode is founded on a tradition current in wales that edward the  st when he completed the conquest of that country ordered all the bards that fell into his hands to be put to death  i    ruin seize thee ruthless king  confusion on thy banners wait  though fanned by conquests crimson wing  they mock

for the better understanding the first of these the reader is to be informed that in the eleventh century sigurd earl of the orkneyislands went with a fleet of ships and a considerable body of troops into ireland to the assistance of sictryg with the silken beard who was then making war on his fatherinlaw brian king of dublin the earl and all his forces were cut to pieces and sictryg was in danger of a total defeat but the enemy had a greater loss by the death of brian their king who fell in the action on christmas day the day of the battle a native of caithness in scotland saw at a distance a number of persons on horseback riding full speed toward a hill and seeming to enter into it curiosity led him to follow them till looking through an opening in the rocks he saw twelve gigantic figures resembling women they were all employed about a loom and as they wove they sung the following dreadful song which when they had finished they tore the web into twelve pieces and each taking her portion galloped six to the north and as many to the south these were the valkyriur female divinities servants of odin or woden in the gothic mythology their name signifies chusers of the slain they were mounted on swift horses with drawn swords in their hands and in the throng of battle selected such as were destined to slaughter and conducted them to valkalla the hall of odin or paradise of the brave where they attended the banquet and served the departed heroes with horns of mead and ale    now the storm begins to lower haste the loom of hell prepare ironsleet of arrowy shower hurtles in

his lifetime is given exactly as he left it in the london and glasgow editions and the few added pieces are printed verbatim from his corrected manuscripts i have also inserted all his explanatory notes at the bottom of their respective pages but those which only pointed out imitative expressions have been reserved for these concluding pages because many of them appeared to me not very material and therefore would have crowded the text as unnecessarily as my own annotations  notes etc ode i the original manuscript title which mr gray gave to this ode was noontide probably he then meant to write two more descriptive of morning and evening his unfinished ode vide p     of the memoirs opens with a fine description of the former and his elegy with as beautiful a picture of the latter which perhaps he might at that time have meditated upon for the exordium of an ode but this is only conjecture it may however be remarked that these three capital descriptions abound with ideas which affect

the same blemish but i think they are the only two to be found in this correct writer and i mention them here that succeeding poets may not look upon them as authorities the judicious reader will not

odes    exact my own defects to scan stanza   l    the many hard consonants which occur in this line hurt the ear mr gray perceived it himself but did not alter it as the words themselves were those which best conveyed his idea and therefore he did not choose to sacrifice sense to sound  had mr gray completed the fine lyrical fragment which i have inserted in the fourth section of the memoirs i should have introduced it into the text of his poems as the fifth and last of his monostrophic odes in order to fulfill the promise which i made to my reader see p     i shall now reprint the piece with my own additions to it i have already made my apology for the attempt and therefore shall only add that although as is usually done on such occasions i print my supplemental lines in the italic character yet i am well aware that their inferiority would but too easily distinguish them without any typographical assistance  ode on the pleasure arising from vicissitude now the golden morn aloft

leads the general song warm let the lyric transport flow warm as the ray that bids it glow and animates the vernal grove with health with harmony and love yesterday the sullen year saw the snowy whirlwind fly mute was the music of the air the herd stood drooping by their raptures now that wildly flow no yesterday nor morrow know it is man alone that joy descries with forward and reverted eyes smiles on past misfortunes brow soft reflections hand can trace and over the cheek of sorrow throw a melancholy grace while hope prolongs our happier hour or deepest shades that dimly lower and blacken round our weary way gilds with a gleam of distant day still where rosy pleasure leads see a kindred grief pursue behind the steps that misery treads approaching comfort view the hues of bliss more brightly glow chastisd by sabler tints of woe and blended form with artful strife the strength and harmony of life see the wretch that long has tossed on the thorny bed of pain at length repair

notes at the bottom of the page point out and this with all the accuracy of metaphysical precision disguised under the appearance of pindaric digression on the first line of it he gave in his edition the following note  pindar styles his own poetry with its musical accompanyments  aeolian song aeolian strings the breath of the aeolian flute it will seem strange to the learned reader that he thought such explanation necessary and he will be apt to look on it as the mere parade of greek quotation but his reason for it was that the critical reviewers had mistaken his meaning see note p   0 of the memoirs and supposed the ode addressed to the harp of aeolus which they said was altogether uncertain and irregular and therefore must be very ill adapted to the dance see epode i l   this ridiculous blunder which he did not think proper openly to advert on led him to produce his greek quotations that they might chew on them at their leisure but he would hardly have done this had not the reception his ode met with made him abate not only of respect to his critics but to his readers in general see his own note    awake aeolian lyre awake stanza   l    imitation awake my glory awake lute and harp davids ps g variation in his manuscript it originally stood awake my lyre my glory wake and it would have been lucky for the abovementioned critics if it had been thus printed    perching on the sceptered hand antist i l    this description of the bird of jupiter mr gray in his own edition modestly calls a weak imitation of some incomparable lines in the first pythian of pindar but if they are compared with mr gilbert wests translation of the above lines though far from a bad one their superior energy to his version will appear very conspicuous perched on the scepter of the olympian king the thrilling darts of harmony he feels and indolently hangs his rapid wing while gentle sleep his closing eyelid seals and over his heaving limbs in loose array to every balmy gale the ruffling feathers play here if we except the second line we find no imagery or expression of the iyrical cast the rest are loaded with unnecessary epithets and would better suit the tamer

follow are sweetly introduced by the short and unequal measures that precede them the whole stanza is indeed a masterpiece of rhythm and charms the ear by its wellvaried cadence as much as the imagery which it contains ravishes the fancy there is says our author in one of his manuscript papers  a toute ensemble of sound as well as of sense in poetical composition always necessary to its perfection what is gone before still dwells upon the ear and insensibly harmonizes with the present line as in that succession of fleeting notes which is called melody nothing can better exemplify the truth of this fine observation than his own poetry    the bloom of young desire and purple light of love ep i l     imitation   phrynichus apud athenaeum g   till down the eastern cliffs afar hyperions march

ii l    imitation extra anni solisque vias  virgil tutta lontana dal camin del sole petrarch canzon ii g   far from the sun and summergale stanza   l    an ingenious person who sent mr gray his remarks anonymously on this and the following ode soon after they were published gives this stanza and the following a very just and wellexpressed eulogy a poet is perhaps never more conciliating than when he praises favorite predecessors in his art milton is not more the pride than shakespeare the love of their country it is therefore equally judicious to diffuse a tenderness and a grace through the praise of shakespeare as to extol in a strain more elevated and sonorous the boundless soarings of miltons epic imagination the critic has here well noted the beauty of contrast which results from the two descriptions yet it is further to be observed to the honor of our poets judgment that the tenderness and grace in the former does not prevent it from strongly characterizing the three capital perfections of shakespeares genius and when he describes his power of exciting terror a species of the sublime he ceases to be diffuse and becomes as he ought to be concise and energetical   0 he passed the flaming bounds of place and time antist iii l    imitation  flammantia maenia mundi lucretius g    the living throne the sapphire blaze antist iii l    imitation for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone  this was the appearance of the glory of the lord ezekiel i  0       g    closed his eyes in endless night antist iii l    imitation  homer od g this has been condemned as a false thought and more worthy of an italian poet than of mr gray count algarotti we have found in his letter to mr how praises it highly but as he was an italian critic his judgment in this point will not perhaps by many be thought to overbalance the objection the truth is that this fiction of the cause of miltons blindness is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of shakespeare and therefore would be equally admissable had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known on this account the judgment revolts against it milton himself has told us in a strain of heartfelt exultation see his sonnet cyriac skynner that he lost his eyesight  overplyd in libertys defense his noble task whereof all europe rings from side to side and when we know this to have been the true cause we cannot admit a fictitious one however sublimely conceived or happily expressed if therefore so lofty and unrivalled a description will not atone for this acknowledged defect in relation to matter of fact all that the impartial critic can do is to point out the reason and to apologize for the poet who was necessitated by his subject to consider milton only in his poetical capacity

ii pindar compares himself to that bird and his enemies to ravens that croak and clamor in vain below while it pursues its flight regardless of their noise g     the critic above quoted concludes his remarks on this ode which he had written after his observations on the bard in a manner which accounts in my opinion for the superior pleasure that it has given to him and also to the generality of readers i quit says he this ode with the strongest conviction of its abundant merit though i took it up for this last attentive perusal persuaded that it was not a little inferior to the other they are not the treasures of imagination only that have so copiously enriched it it speaks but surely less feelingly than the bard still my favorite to the heart can we in truth be equally interested for the fabulous exploded gods of other nations celebrated in the first half of this ode as by the story of our own edwards and henrys or allusions to it can a description the most perfect language ever attained to of tyranny expelling the muses from parnassus seize the mind equally with the horrors of berkley castle with the apostrophe to the tower and spare the meek usurpers holy head i do not mean however wholly to decry fabulous subjects or allusions nor more than to suggest the preference due to historical ones where happily the poets fertile imagination supplies him with a plentiful choice of both kinds and he finds himself capable of treating both according to their respective natures with equal advantage  ode vi   i promised the reader in the    th page of the memoirs to give him in this place the original argument of this capital ode as its author had set it down on one of the pages of his commonplace book it is as follows the army of edward i as they march through a deep valley are suddenly stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure seated on the summit of an inaccessible rock who with a voice more than human reproaches the king with all the misery and desolation which he had brought on his country foretells the misfortunes of the norman race and with prophetic spirit declares that all his cruelty shall never extinguish the noble ardour of poetic genius in this island and that men shall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valor in immortal strains to expose vice and infamous pleasure and boldly censure tyranny and oppression his song ended he precipitates himself from the mountain and is swallowed up by the river that rolls at its foot fine as the conclusion of this ode is at present i think it would have been still finer if he could have executed it according to this plan but unhappily for his purpose instances of english poets were wanting spenser had that enchanting flow of verse which was peculiarly calculated to celebrate virtue and valor but he chose to celebrate them not literally but in allegory shakespeare who had talents for every thing was undoubtedly capable of exposing vice and infamous pleasure and the drama was a proper vehicle for his satire but we do not ever find that he professedly made this his object nay we know that in one inimitable character he has so contrived as to make vices of the worst kind such as cowardice drunkenness dishonesty and lewdness not only laughable but almost amiable for with all these sins on his head who can help liking falstaff milton of all our great poets was the only one who boldly censured tyranny and oppression but he chose to deliver this censure not in poetry but in prose dryden was a mere court parasite to the most infamous of all courts pope with all his laudable detestation of corruption and bribery was a tory and addison though a whig and a fine writer was unluckily not enough of a poet for his purpose on these considerations mr gray was necessitated to change his plan toward the conclusion hence we perceive that in the last epode he praises spenser only for his allegory shakespeare for his powers of moving the passions and milton for his epic excellence i remember the ode lay unfinished by him for a year or two on this very account and i hardly believe that it would ever have had his last hand but for the circumstance of his hearing parry play on the welsh harp at a concert at cambridge see letter xxv sect iv which he often declared inspired him with the conclusion    mr smith the musical composer and worthy pupil of mr handel had once an idea of setting this ode and of having it performed by way of serenata or oratorio a common friend of his and mr grays interested himself much in this design and drew out a clear analysis of the ode that mr smith might more perfectly understand the poets meaning he conversed also with mr gray on the subject who gave him an idea for the overture and marked also some passages in the ode in order to ascertain which should be recitative which air what kind of air and how accompanied the design was however not executed and therefore i shall only in order to give the reader a taste of mr grays musical feelings insert in this place what his sentiments were concerning the overture it should be so contrived as to be a proper introduction to the ode it might consist of two movements the first descriptive of the horror and confusion of battle the last a march grave and majestic but expressing the exultation and insolent security of conquest this movement should be composed entirely of wind instruments except the kettledrum heard at intervals the da capo of it must be suddenly broke in upon and put to silence by the clang of the harp in a tumultuous rapid movement joined with the voice all at once and not ushered in by any symphony the harmony may be strengthened by any other stringed instrument but the harp should every where prevail and form the continued running accompanyment submitting itself to nothing but the voice    ruin seize thee ruthless king strophe   l    on this noble exordium the anonymous critic beforementioned thus eloquently expresses his admiration this abrupt execration plunges the reader into that sudden fearful perplexity which is designed to predominate through the whole the irresistible violence of the prophets passions bears him away who as he is unprepared by a formal ushering in of the speaker is unfortified against the impressions of his poetical phrenzy and overpowered by them as sudden thunders strike

paintings both believed to be originals one at florence the other in the duke of orleanss collection at paris g  mr gray never saw the large cartoon done by the same divine hand in the possession of the duke of montagu at his seat at boughton in northamptonshire else i am persuaded he would have mentioned it in this note the two finished pictures abroad which i believe are closetpieces can hardly have so much spirit in them as this wonderful drawing it gave me the sublimest idea i ever received from painting moses breaking the tables of the law by parmegiano was a figure which mr gray used to say came still nearer to his meaning than the picture of raphael    dear as the light that visits these sad eyes dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart ep i l    and     imitation as dear to me as

stimulated bosom    weave the warp etc strophe   l    can there be an image more just apposite and nobly imagined than this tremendous tragical winding sheet in the rest of this stanza the wildness of thought expression and cadence are admirably adapted to the character and situation of the speaker and of the bloody specter his assistants it is not indeed peculiar to it alone but a beauty that runs throughout the whole composition that the historical events are briefly sketched out by a few striking circumstances in which the poets office of rather exciting and directing than satisfying the readers imagination is perfectly observed such abrupt hints resembling the several fragments of a vast ruin suffer not the mind to be raised to the utmost pitch by one image of horror but that instantaneously a second and a third are presented to it and the affection is still uniformly supported anon critic   0 fair laughs the morn etc   it is always entertaining and sometimes useful to be informed how a writer frequently improves on his original thoughts on this account i have occasionally set down the few variations which mr gray made in his lyrical compositions the six lines before us convey perhaps the most beautiful piece of imagery in the whole ode and were a wonderful improvement on those which he first wrote which though they would appear fine in an inferior poet are infinitely below those which supplanted them i find them in one of his corrected manuscripts as follow  variation mirrors of saxon truth and loyalty your helpless old expiring master view they hear not scarce religion dares supply her muttered requiems and her holy dew yet thou proud boy from pomfrets walls shall send a sigh and envy often thy happy grandsires end    fill high the sparkling bowl epode ii l   etc  this stanza as an ingenious friend remarks has exceeding merit it breathes in a lesser compass what the ode breathes at large the high spirit of lyric enthusiasm the transitions are sudden and impetuous the language full of fire and force and the imagery carried without impropriety to the most daring height the manner of richards death by famine exhibits such beauties of personification as only the richest and most vivid imagination could supply from thence we are hurried with the wildest rapidity into the midst of battle and the epithet kindred places at once before our eyes all the peculiar horrors of civil war immediately by a transition most striking and unexpected the poet falls into a tender and pathetic address which from the sentiments and also from the numbers has all the melancholy flow and breathes all the plaintive softness of elegy again the scene changes again the bard rises into an allegorical description of carnage to which the meter is admirably adapted and the concluding sentence of personal punishment on edward is denounced with a solemnity that chills and terrifies     no more our longlost arthur we bewail all hail ye genuine

loves shall moralize my song spensers proeme to the fairy queen g    i cannot quit this and the preceding ode without saying a word or two of my own concerning the obscurity which has been imputed to them and the preference which in consequence has been given to his elegy it seems as if the persons who hold this opinion suppose that every species of poetry ought to be equally clear and intelligible than which position nothing can be more repugnant to the several specific natures of composition and to the practice of ancient art not to take pindar and his odes for an example though what i am here defending were written professedly in imitation of him i would ask are all the writings of horace his epistles satires and odes equally perspicuous amongst his odes separately considered are there not remarkable differences of this very kind is the spirit and meaning of that which begins descend coelo and dic age tibia ode   lib   so readily comprehended as persicos odi puer apparatus ode    l   and is the latter a finer piece of lyrical composition on that account is integer vitae scelerisque purus ode    l   superior to pindarum quisquis studet aemulari ode   l   because it may be understood at the first reading and the latter not without much study and reflection now between these odes thus compared there is surely equal difference in point of perspicuity as between the progress of poesy and the prospect of eton the ode on the spring and the bard but say these objectors the end of poetry is universally to please obscurity by taking off from our pleasure destroys that end i will grant that if the obscurity be great constant and unsurmountable this is certainly true but if it be only found in particular passages proceeding from the nature of the subject and the very genius of the composition it does not rob us of our pleasure but superadds a new one which arises from conquering a difficulty and the pleasure which accrues from a difficult passage when well understood provided the passage itself be a fine one is always more permanent than that which we discover at the first glance the lyric muse like other fine ladies requires to be courted and retains her admirers the longer for not having yielded too readily to their solicitations this argument ending as it does in a sort of simile will i am persuaded not only have its force with the intelligent readers the synetoi but also with the men of fashion as to critics of a lower class it may be sufficient to transcribe for their improvement an unfinished remark or rather maxim which i found amongst our authors papers and which he probably wrote on occasion of the common preference given to his elegy  the gout de comparaison as bruyere styles it is the only taste of ordinary minds they do not know the specific excellency either of an author or a composition for instance they do not know that tibullus spoke the language of nature and love that horace saw the vanities and follies of mankind with the most penetrating eye and touched them to the quick that virgil ennobled even the most common images by the graces of a glowing melodious and welladapted expression but they do know that virgil was a better poet than horace and that horaces epistles do not run so well as the elegies of tibullus  ode vii this ode to which on the title i have given the epithet of irregular is the only one of the kind which mr gray ever wrote and its being written occasionally and for music is a sufficient apology for the defect exclusive of this for a defect it certainly is it appears to me in point of lyrical arrangement and expression to be equal to most of his other odes it is remarkable that amongst the many irregular odes which have been written in our own language drydens and popes on st cecilias day are the only ones that may properly be said to have lived the reason is as i have hinted in a note p     of the memoirs that this mode of composition is so extremely easy that it gives the writer an opening to every kind of poetical licentiousness whereas the regularly repeated stanza and still more the regular succession of strophe antistrophe and epode put so strong a curb on the wayward imagination that when she has once paced in it she seldom chooses to submit to it a second time it is therefore greatly to be wished in order to stifle in their birth a quantity of compositions which are at the same time wild and jejune that regular odes and these only should be deemed legitimate amongst us  the cambridge edition published at the expense of the university is here followed but i have added at the bottom of the page a number of explanatory notes which this ode seemed to want still more than that which preceded it especially when given not to the university only but the public in general who may be reasonably supposed to know little of the particular founders of different colleges and their history here alluded to for the sake of uniformity in the page i have divided the ode into stanzas and discarded the musical divisions of recitative air and chorus but shall here insert them in their order according as the different stanzas were set by dr randal professor of music  stanza   the first eight lines air the four last chorus stanza   recitative throughout but accompanied at the sixth line stanza   air this stanza being supposed to be sung by milton is very judiciously written in the meter which he fixed upon for the stanza of his christmashymn twas in the winter wild etc  stanza   recitative throughout the last nine lines accompanied stanza   air quartetto the musical reader will easily see and admire how well this stanza is suited to that species of music stanza   first six lines recitative the rest of the stanza beginning at thy liberal heart air stanza   recitative throughout stanza   grand chorus and well suited for that purpose ode viii   the occasion of mr grays writing for it may be rather called so than versifying this and the three following odes however closely he has done them has been given in the beginning of the  th section of the memoirs and his reason for first publishing them in the   th letter of the  th their best comment since it is the best illustration of their excellency will be to insert here the latin versions of the originals from whence they were taken as it is probable that many readers who have hitherto admired them as compositions have not compared them with those literal versions for want of having the books which are not common ones at hand    ex orcadibus thormodi torfaei hafniae

which mr gray selected for imitation in this ode    si mihi liceret vindictam in deirorum populum far aeque ac diluvium omnes una strage prostrarem     amicum enim amisi incautus qui in resistendo

with the literal translations which i have here inserted will i am persuaded be convinced that nothing of the kind was ever executed with more fire and at the same time more judgment he keeps up through them all the wild romantic spirit of his originals elevates them by some wellchosen epithet or image where they flag yet in such a manner as is perfectly congruous with the general idea of the poems and if he either varies or omits any of the original thoughts they are only of that kind which according to our modern sentiments would appear vulgar or ludicrous two instances of this kind occur in the latter part of this last ode how well has he turned the idea of the fourth line ex iis qui nimio potu madidi and the conclusion aliter ad hoc carmen compingendum etc the former of which is ridiculous the latter insipid    i find amongst mr grays papers a few more lines taken from other parts of the gododin which i shall here add with their respective latin versions they may serve to show succeeding poets the manner in which the spirit of these their ancient predecessors in the art may best be transfused into a modern imitation of them have ye seen the tusky boar or the bull with

into latin by messrs ansty and roberts and in the same year another though i think inferior version of it was published by mr lloyd the reader has been informed in the memoirs of the time and manner of its first publication he originally gave it only the simple title of stanzas written in a country churchyard i persuaded him first to call it an elegy because the subject authorized him so to do and the alternate measure in which it was written seemed peculiarly fit for that species of composition i imagined too that so capital a poem written in this measure would as it were appropriate it in future to writings of this sort and the number of imitations which have since been made of it even to satiety seem to prove that my notion was well founded in the first manuscript copy of this exquisite poem i find the conclusion different from that which he afterward composed and though his afterthought was unquestionably the best yet there is a pathetic melancholy in the four rejected stanzas which highly claims preservation i shall therefore give them as a variation in their proper place    the knell of parting day l    imitation  squilla di lontano che paia l giorno pianger che

walks of fate hark how the sacred calm that breathes around bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease in still small accents whispering from the ground a grateful earnest of eternal peace no more with reason and thyself at strife give anxious cares and endless wishes room but through the cool sequestered vale of life pursue the silent tenor of thy doom and here the poem was originally intended to conclude before the happy idea of the hoaryheaded swain etc suggested itself to him i cannot help hinting to the reader that i think the third of these rejected stanzas equal to any in the whole

quaintness in the other the thought however is rather obscurely expressed in both readings he means to say in plain prose that we wish to be remembered by our friends after our death in the same manner as when alive we wished to be remembered by them in our absence this would be expressed clearer if the metaphorical term fires was rejected and the line ran thus awake and faithful to her first

yonder hanging lawn after which in his first manuscript followed this stanza him have we seen the greenwood side along while over the heath we hied our labor done often as the woodlark pipd her

poem but also compleats the account of his whole day whereas this evening seen being omitted we have only his morning walk and his noontide repose    engraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn l      between this line and the epitaph mr gray originally inserted a very beautiful stanza which was printed in some of the first editions but afterward omitted because he thought and in my own opinion very justly that it was too long a parenthesis in this place the lines however are in themselves exquisitely fine and demand preservation  there scattered often the earliest of the year by hands
