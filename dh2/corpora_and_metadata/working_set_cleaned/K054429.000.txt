alone among all the useful sciences has at this time the misfortune to be unrepresented in parliament and as the statute for preventing frauds and abuses in the making and vending unsound adulterate and bad drugs and medicines is now near expiring i hope it may not be improper to show the necessity of continuing that act and to offer some amendments thereto which the artful evasions and corruptions of mercenary artificers have rendered absolutely necessary  your early acquaintance with the nature and constitution of parliaments your weight in our national assembly and your extensive benevolence have pointed you out the fittest patron and advocate for a scheme wholely calculated for the public benefit to correct the many enormous abuses in pharmacy and consequently to promote the health and temporal happiness of a considerable part of mankind therefore i shall venture without any farther apology to submit the following lines to your serious consideration  there is no well regulated country where the legislature has not made some provision for the preservation of the health of the body natural as well as for that of the body politic yet pity it is that in most for want of due information all the laws hitherto enacted in regard to medicine have fallen far short of it is good intentions for as an evil whose source or cause is unknown must be remediless so is it scarce possible that the frauds or abuses in any art or trade though ever so pernicious to society can be prevented or punished by law until they are first discovered and made apparent to the lawgivers  if some of the honest artists or tradesmen of every occupation would ingenuously disclose the secret corruptions of their respective callings without which they may for ever escape the cognizance and censure of the legislature we might then hope for a general reformation but alas we are too like the ephesian smith in scripture ready upon every attempt to purge us from iniquity to cry out with him the craft is in danger  the natural fragile structure of the human frame which has rendered it subject to sundry inevitable vicissitudes from the force of external bodies from the alterations of the air the nature of the aliments and from the very vital actions has made the hecling art in general of all others the most useful and necessary for the support and wellbeing of mankind and nearly coaeval with the creation boerh instit medic prolegom  so sensible were men in all ages of the usefulness and dignity of physic that it has ever been held in the utmost reverence and esteem the inventors or improvers of this noble art were by the ancients ranked among the gods and styled sons of gods and the hands of gods it was a long time practiced by heroes only or the sons of gods aelian de animal lib ii cap    being deemed too sacred for profane hands the heathen jews and primitive christians agreed in paying the utmost respect to the healing art believing it of divine and heavenly origin cicer tusculan quaest lib   hippoc de pris medicina s aug de civit dei  hence we find the greatest honors possible were conferred on the ancient physicians in the most wise polite and politic states they were generally caressed or envied by kings and princes who designed to study and endeavored to acquire and practice their inestimable art many natural productions as well as artificial preparations to this day retain the name of a royal discoverer or inventor and two mesue and avicen of the most considerable ancient physical writers whose works are extant at this time were one the

the freedom of athens in a crown a royal diadem to the value of a thousand pieces of gold and settled a considerable stipend for his maintenance during life at the public expense  they likewise made a law prohibiting all women bondsmen or slaves meddling with physic as they did likewise in locris which decreed that disobedience to the directions or prescriptions of physicians should be punished with death julius caesar made all physicians that should settle in rome freemen and denizens sueon  and when for some reasons of state a succeeding emperor banished the greeks that city yet the

considerable improvement of the moderns which were to the ancients utterly unknown  there can hardly be any one insensible of the value of health and life since the very first impulse of nature prompts every creature to use all ways and means to preserve them and nothing but an uninterrupted enjoyment of health can render any man regardless of so invaluable a blessing it was the dreadful contagion which raged in rome about the  0 st year after the building that city where there were not then found physicians enough to attend the sick dion halcarnas  that first made the robust romans sensible of the use and excellency of physic which they afterward so generously encouraged and so amply rewarded salus populi suprema lex esto is a precept which was once religiously observed in its fullest extent by every worthy roman senator and though it might not have been originally pronounced or received in this sense literally yet i apprehend the application of it merely to the bodily health of the people can be no wide deviation from the sense of the wise author since the general welfare of the community depends upon the health of it is members  physic or medicine is the art by which our lives and health are preserved and restored and abuses or maladministration in any branch thereof must necessarily prejudice or subvert the whole this cannot be charged upon physic or surgery for it may in truth be affirmed that this kingdom was never so happily provided in that way as at present with men of both professions inferior to none in europe in erudition judgment and probity but pharmacy or the apothecarys art in particular which ministers in an especial manner to the two former branches namely physic and surgery though the good success of both most considerably depends thereupon is lest neglected and uncultivated overrun with errors abuses and frauds and though there are no corruptions in any art so pernicious and destructive to the public as those of apothecaries yet melancholy consideration none are so little liable to discovery or punishment deceits in most trades are perceptible to the generality and are not only in some sense cognizable by law but as they must sooner or later be discovered by the customers common policy will direct most tradesmen to some integrity in their callings but as the most baneful frauds in pharmacy being never suspected are seldom or never perceptible to the public though often felt few or none besides physicians surgeons or apothecaries being sensible of the evils in this way so none transgresses with more case and security than the dishonest apothecary he may destroy the reputation of the most careful and judicious physicians and surgeons and murder thousands of their patients his bill is nevertheless paid and he is still unsuspectedly entertained caressed and employed by the surviving families a little artifice can tinsel or varnish over the most vile frauds or perfidious neglects of the unjust apothecary if he can command a brazen front with an hardened servile conscience it is enough all is safe for his vassal apprentices who only can be privy to his villainy are hushed they are obliged to keep his secrets without distinction  as pharmacy is a most useful and necessary art nay according to one of the fathers of physic celsus see j d horst inst pharmac l ii c i  the most useful branch of medicine when in a state of purity and perfection so it is the most pernicious and destructive when it is not exercised with the utmost integrity care fidelity and good understanding no knave so vile so dangerous to society as a bad apothecary the rapacious highwayman a professed enemy to mankind bids the unwary traveller stand and at the peril of his life part with his money but the dishonest apothecary a more subtle kind of robber pretends a friendship for his customer yet takes the same opportunity with the former which the love of life and health and dread of death that human nature is possessed with amply affords him and so robs thousands of their fortunes giving them only some vile useless drug in exchange by which their lives are always endangered and often destroyed and yet notwithstanding the apothecary is never in the least suspected so that the orphan may often pay him for the death of his parents parents for that of their children widows for their husbands and so forth and perhaps gratefully acknowledge the great care and tenderness of their worthy apothecary though he might have been more instrumental to their death than the disease  for these reasons the apothecaries have no temporal advantages in nor any incitements to honesty or integrity in their calling for while men can buy the most base and worst commodities and may without detection substitute them for or sell them at the same rate with the best and most genuine we shall probably be infested with such mercenary wretches as will prefer their own illgotten gain to a clear conscience and the safety and welfare of their neighbors the far greater profit arising from illegal trade  i would not be hereby thought to charge all the worthy apothecaries of this kingdom with ignorance disingenuity or disintegrity far be it from me i am well assured that we have some as judicious as skilful and as honest in their way as any in europe but as it may not be allowable to point at the indentical guilty persons either by naming the one or exempting the other so i am obliged to make the charge in general against the whole fraternity my self not excepted so let him whom the cap fits wear it  shakespeares hamlet let the galled jade wince  it is through a real concern for the just good men that are indiscriminately blended with the unjust and for the scandalous disrepute which the excellent art of pharmacy is fallen into together with the long train of evils which attend the public in general from the base craft and corruption of avaricious falsifiers of medicines that i am urged to this work  i have a long time had a conflict with myself about this important undertaking i must confess i some time feared the united powers of the wicked against me having on the like occasion heretofore fatally experienced the strength of the confederate opponents of reformation and above all i avoided taking upon me a task to which i am conscious of and confess my inequality but at length laying aside all selfish fear and finding none of the many more capable inclined to engage in such a just and necessary warfare i have at all hazards presumed to give you the following informations and to submit these just though indigested observations to the wisdom of the legislature from whose paternal care and benevolence alone we may expect the due encouragement of virtue and the suppression of vice of every kind if my weak endeavors answer any useful purposes i have my full recompense in being but ever so mean an instrument of effecting a public good i hope the merits of the cause for which i am but a slender advocate and the simplicity and honesty of mine intentions will gain your attention plead for the weakness of my performance and supply the want of rhetoric and oratory  in order to lay this matter properly before you i judge it expedient  i to consider the rise and primitive state of pharmacy and from the best authority to point out the proper office and duty of and the requisite qualifiations for an apothecary in which i shall cnsorily endeavor to explain the difference between apothecaries and druggists  ii to show the present state of pharmacy and how far the mdern deviate from the proper office and duty and fall short of the qualifications of the atient true apthries in which fatal degeneracy it will appear that it is scarcely possible for a man to learn that art fully and then to get an honest livelihood by that profession solely let his knowledge and understanding in it be ever so considerable unless he had the good fortune of an extraordinary genius which may lead him to study it properly and of ganing a set of customers who pay uncommon deference to his judgment and integrity  iii to lay open some of the most inconsiderable and obvious frauds and abuses in this way whether through ignorance or design of apothecaries or druggists and to point out some of the most pernicious sophistications of medicines with the evil consequences thereof and  iv and lastly to offer some means to prevent such horrid malpractices for the future whereby the king is not only basely defrauded in his just revenue by which every subject must suffer but also the public is robbed of the chief blessing of this life health and the means of restoring it and the fair and honest apothecary is crampt and restrained in the lawful discharge of his function being undersold by the fraudulent and dishonest  i in the pure primitive ages of the healing art the physician not only prescribed but collected prepared dispensed and administered medicaments as well as performed chirurgical operations for the now three distinct branches of medicine called physic pharmacy and surgery were till about the time of herophilus and erasistratus managed by one and the same hand cells pref l i le clerc hist de la med p ii l i c ix  but finding it too laborious and burdensome and according to a trite aphorism of the father of physic hippoc lib i aph i that the lise of man was too short to comprehend fully or to complete the knowledge of that sublime art it was judged expedient to divide it into these three different parts that having less to study in each it might become less tedious and prolix insomuch that every student may hope to arrive at a competent degree of knowledge in that branch which he chose for his peculiar study whereupon the three distinct offices of physician apothecary and surgeon were instituted  the physicians on account of seniority and superlative erudition are justly allowed the preeminence of the two other brethren which indeed i think that profession merits of all others divinity only excepted a physician must have a most liberal education he must be well versed in all the learned languages in natural history in all parts of philosophy in anatomy the animal economy the histories of distempers their natures signs symptoms causes diagnostics prognostics indications of cure etc he must likewise be well grounded in the theories of the chemic and galenic pharmacies and of surgery for according to the wise author of medicine hippoc lex natural endowments learning a proper place for study education from infancy industry and time are requisite to constitute a physician in consequence of which we find the education of such is in schools and universities seminaries of polite literature where all things are learned to complete the physician and the gentleman thus must a physician be qualified before he can undertake the care of the sick in any the slightest disorder and he who made the greatest progress in that admirable art even the divine sage hippoc epist ad democrit is not ashamed to confess that though he was now advanced in old age and got to the extremity of life he had not yet arrived at the end of physic whence it follows that physic is the deepest and most extensive study and it is practice the weightiest and most important charge that human nature can possibly undertake  surgery now usurps the second rank and though it has had a worse fate than physic in falling some time into the hands of ignorant and illiterate men yet it is knowledge is again happily revived among us and all those who make a figure in that profession are not only men of learning and erudition but inferior to none in europe in judgment and understanding in that excellent art  for some centuries surgery   as well as pharmacy   friends hist phys vol   p iii was subservient and ministerial to physic the first surgeons  l ast polit l iii c ii medicines mainaeuvre and

directed and conducted in the exercise and discharge of their respective functions so that the then surgeons never bled opened tumors amputated limbs nor performed any other operation in their profession nor did the apothecaries apply or administer any medicine but in consultation with or by the advice or approbation of the physicians yet as it is now essentially necessary to complete a surgeon that he be a man of learning a perfect master of anatomy and of course well acquainted with the animal economy and his object being one and his practice being grounded on the same principles and rationale with physic with this only distinction that one treats the external the other the internal disorders of the human body it does not seem unreasonable that such surgeons should bleed and perform other operations in that way and even prescribe especially external applications upon their own judgment solely  but the case is quite otherwise with apothecaries for although they should be good scholars and necessarily conversant with the writings of the learned who treated on their profession yet does their requisite readings no where instruct them in anatomy or the animal economy nor in any of the many other necessary qualifications of physicians or surgeons the knowledge of the materia medica only excepted the apothecarys office his very appellation in all the known languages denotes thus among the ancients medicus sellularis implied an apothecary or one who prepared and dispensed medicines as did likewise pharmaceuta and medicamentarius in like manner apothecarius an apothecary from apotheca a shop warehouse or repository or in the more common acceptance a place where drugs or medicines are kept or sold and he may be aptly called a physicshopkeeper also pharmacopaeus a maker preparer or compounder of medicines and likewise seplasiarius from seplasia a marketplace in capua once a famed mart for drugs and perfumed ointments and the sole proper business and office of an apothecary is to collect or procure at due times and seasons from the proper places the several usual medicinal productions of nature the simples of the mineral vegetable and animal

experimentally grounded in the knowledge of the galenic and ghemic pharmacies which is a large field for a man to exercise his talents in learning and it must well employ his time every season of the year after if he intends discharging the duty of his office strictly and faithfully pharmacopola is an injurious name improperly given to an apothecary the pharmacopolae of the ancients seem to have been such as were employed by artists in collecting or procuring the simples they were mere venders of drugs and pretended to no art or knowledge beyond that but as these men in time degenerated into knaves or quacks they became hateful to society and the name of pharmacopola with most writers since implies a canting hawker a false quack or a deceitful mountebank how applicable this appellation in the worst sense may be to some dealers in medicine who call themselves druggists i shall not here determine but we have the satisfaction to observe that that trade is again revived for in london marseilles amsterdam rotterdam leghorn hamburgh and most other regular trading cities in europe the druggist is none other than a mere merchant of drugs and in the best sense of the word pharmacopola  so different a profession from physic was pharmacy deemed that not above a century passed since the grocers company in london dispensed medicines but it was at length found expedient that some should separate from that body who should take upon them the entire management of the medicinal part of that trade that by applying themselves solely to an affair of so great importance to the public they might cultivate and attain to a competent knowledge in so useful and necessary an art whereupon pharmacy was revived and the apothecaries throwing off all encumbrances betook them to their proper profession in which they soon became eminent were taken notice of and encouraged by the learned and grew into such favor with king james the first that he incorporated them by royal charter and used to call them his own company thus they became a distinct society from the grocers  the illustrious college of physicians of augsburgh which was the first that i find who took the pains of compiling and published the celebrated augustane dispensatory has most minutely and justly laid down the qualifications for and the office and duty of an apothecary from whom with some few amendments from other authentic writers i make the following abstract  as pharmacy is a most considerable branch of the healing art being the physicians chief agent so the apothecary should be a just good man and principally grounded in the knowledge of his profession  he should in general be untainted in his morals and of a perfect sound understanding endowed with a just reverence for the supreme being and the true principles of the christian religton pious and faithful just and equitable humane benign affable placable merciful and ready mild and bountiful to the poor and indigent ever preferring public to private gains vigilant and regardful of the dangers and necessities of the sick in acts of mercy and charity diligent and unwearied not covetous penurious or mercenary for in buying of drugs he is to prefer the testimony of a clear conscience the good of his neighbor and his own credit and reputation to ill gotten riches or lucre wherefore he is to procure gemine good drugs and medicines at any rate rather than by buying at the vilest dispense adulterate or bad medicines and deceive his unwary customer to the peril or prejudice of his life or health he should be sober and regular in all his conduct no gamester sot or drunkard nor prone to libidinous concupiscence or venery  these premised his capacity is next to be considered he must not only have a strong natural genius to lead him to this art but he must be a good scholar to enable him to read the ordinary prescripts of physicians and surgeons which from the difficulty of translating them with any certainty into the vulgar tongues and for other obvious reasons are all over europe wrote in latin and especially that he may acquire a thorough knowledge of his profession by consulting the works of the learned who treat upon the several branches thereof  the authors recommended are dioscorides galen aegineta aetius mesue nich proepositus and myrepfius pliny corn celsus a m brasavolus valor cordus anut foesius fuchsius garcias

ghaunt etc from these the apothecary can best learn the medicinal parts of the mineral vegetable and animal kingdoms with their proper nes and synonyma in the arabic greek latin and vulgar tongues these will teach him to discern the good from the bad and to select the true and genuine from the false and sophisticated and in short from them he can collect the generic marks and characteristics of the simple with proper instructions for preparing and necessary animadversions on the compound medicaments  having laid these solid foundations for his future practice his economy comes next under consideration  his shop should be situate in a convenient open temperate place not exposed to damps winds dust smoke or stench and as it contains sundry distilled liquors wines or vinous infusions tinctures and sirups electuaries consections and conserves which too much heat will render vapid or mothery ferment sour or otherwise spoil and which excessive cold will chill and freeze congeal crystallize or otherwise prejudice a vintner need hardly observe a greater exactness or regularity in adjusting the temperature of his cellar or vault than an apothecary should in that of his shop or storeroom wherefore he should avoid the extreme heat of the sun which on one hand he is exposed to all the summer months and on the other the extraordinary cold of the winter for which reasons that aspect is most eligible which affords the greatest mediocrity nor should it be exposed in any to the many inconveniences and evils of open unglassed windows and doors nor made more intemperate by fires made on particular occasions only either in summer or winter  and that the medicines may be handled cleanly and neatly those for internal use more especially which are taken with the greater reluctance and disdain the more sordidly they are observed to be treated the apothecary is to keep his shop and utensils sweet pure and clean and with indefatigable diligence furnish it with the usual commodities at due seasons and preserve them for future use in fit receptacles and convenient places  he is not to sell or administer nor suffer or cause to be administered to any without the immediate license of a magistrate or the prescription of a judicious physician any sort of poison or poisonous drugg philtres provocatives of terms or abortion opium or laudanum strong vomitives or purgatives nor other such like powerful medicines especially the chemical preparations of mercury and antimony  he should be strictly just and faithful cautious and circumspect in the dispensing and preparing the ordinary prescriptions of physicians as well as the officinal compositions nor should he rashly or conceitedly substitute any one thing for another in a medicine trusting to his own judgment or knowledge nor omit the least or meanest ingredient hi any composition whatsoever without the advice consent or approbation of the prescriber or some other skilful prudent physician but with religious fidelity care and integrity dispense all prescripts in quality and quantity truly and exactly according to the literal sense of such prescript or recipe he is to keep an exact registry of all such recipes and the originals carefully filed he is to keep such as are for secret complaints from being exposed he is to repeat no medicine without the direction of the prescriber see prolegom isagog in pharmac august cap i i d horstij inst pharmaceut part i cap ii hoffman clav pharm schroed p     so sensible were the wise senate of augsbourg of the use and necessity of these rules that they made some excellent laws as well to enforce the observation thereof as to regulate the practices of physic pharmacy and surgery in every other instance and the senate of ghaunt also took much the like method  among other statutes it is enacted that no apothecary shall so far swerve from his duty as to interfere with the proper office of a physician or surgeon and that none presumes to sell or administer medicines strong purgatives and provocatives especially without the prescription of a physician lest by the rash illjudged or untimely use of the most efficacious remedies the health of the public may suffer and the best medicines fall into contempt and disrepute physicians only being the proper judges of the fit subjects and just times of administering such remedies  the apothecaries are obliged to prepare and compound all their medicines by the college dispensatory see the kings proclamat prefixed to the london dispensat and to sell them at the rates fixed by the senate all quacks empirics mountebanks and such like impostors and pretenders to medicine whatsoever not found legally qualified are expelled the state see the decrees and statutes of the senates of augsbourg and ghaunt annexed to their several dispensatories  the apothecaries of paris are obliged not only to conform to the dispensatory strictly and literally but are likewise prohibited to vend or administer any medicines whatsoever without the prescription of one of the faculty of medicine or one of the kings physicians see an arret of parliament prefixed to the parisian dispensatory  nothing assuredly can contribute more to the improvement and benefit of the healing art than the professors of the different branches thereof applying themselves entirely to the study and practice of their respective callings and this was certainly the wise design of our predecessors in dividing it into those three several parts and were it yet further subdivided it is probable it might be brought to greater certainty and rendered more generally beneficial to mankind than it can be in an aggregate state since the meanest branch can sufficiently employ the whole attention and understanding of a man we find that many of the ancients were of this opinion herodot l ii s     and that it was approved by the late celebrated doctor harris of london pharmc antiempiric p      what considerable discoveries and improvements have already been made in physic in general by these divisions are very obvious to all that are conversant with the history of medicine physicians by appointing proper agents for the more operose and mechanic parts of their profession threw off all encumbrance and obtained more time and leisure for study surgery was cultivated under the same management and both have arrived at the extraordinary pitch of eminence we now see them in under these wise regulations pharmacy too while it kept within the proper bounds shone and flourished for it is observable that no set of men made a better figure in their way than the apothecaries that retained their integrity and kept within the just limits of their occupation which the works of many of them amply testify of these

honorable mention as do messieurs bolduc and geoffroy of paris whose worth and merit none can be a stranger to who reads the memoirs of the acadmy royal of sciences i have reserved to bring up the rear the brightest ornament of his profession the late learned and ingenious mr samuel dale whose excellent pharmacolgia has rendered him well known to all the physical world for though he lived in brantry in essex yet was his merit so well known to the illustrious college of physicians of london that before he published the last edition of his works which he greatly augmented and improved he was honored with a license to practice physic with him let me remember that great and laborious artist and curious naturalist seba of amsterdam whose prodigious musaeum with the history thereof five large volumes in folio must render his memory famous to latest posterity  ii while pharmacy was practiced by such able hands as those physic which has so great a dependence upon it must have flourished but such became the insatiable avarice of most of the apothecaries that they could not long content themselves with the ample profit that arose upon the sale of their proper commodities and manufactures but envious of their elder brethren of the faculty of physic they now endeavored to imitate them as the frogs in the fable did the oxen and indeed with much the same success and sought after new methods of increasing their sordid gains this they effected by treacherously and surreptitiously invading the provinces of physicians and surgeons and alluring the populace under the specious pretense of giving advice in physic and surgery gratis which fatal delusion readily ensnared the ignorant vulgar who could not be sensible of their gross ignorance and manifest incapacity for such an undertaking nor apprehend that these very bountiful gentry took care to tax their medicines with their invaluable advice so that their prescriptions of which it must be confessed they are always most liberal are now charged infinitely more than their real value or what those of physicians and surgeons though of more intrinsic worth being certainly better adapted to particular exigencies to the constitution and the indications of cure might be made up and sold for and thus by iniquitously enhancing the prices of remedies and giving them in unnecessary abundance they clandestinely acquired unmerited fees equal to those justly due to the most regularly educated and most experienced physicians or surgeons  that this is the present case every intelligent candid apothecary must confess and these fallacies might be further evinced beyond dispute were the generality to be made sensible of the just rates of medicines and the most monstrous extravagant bills they are frequently charged to see two drachms of sal punel not worth a penny disguised with some insignificant color and an unintelligible pompous title and sold for sixteen pence must surely move your contempt and indignation who without abhorrence and surprise could see sham gasgoins powder without a grain of bezoar sold at five shilling the dram when by omitting that only dear ingredient it could not have cost the maker one penny yet these and many such like impositions are daily practsed by mercenary quacks and by them judged necessary and their undoubted right on account of their extraordinary skill great care frequent visits and trouble in attending and prescribing i have known a gentlemans bill who sickened on monday and died the wednesday following amount to above five pounds though his careful apothecary had but a streets breadth to cross between his shop and the patients lodging it is more than probable that if the unhappy sufferer took to the value of his bill in medicines it was the cause of his death and would though he had the most athletic constitution but to acquit his apothecary of this murder every one of the profession must confess that no man could well require or consume medicines to that value in the time then what physician could expect so much for his attendance in the ordinary manner for so long  it must be allowed that all artists have a just right to charge upon their wares the necessary expenses and trouble that attend the preparing and vending them but those of apothecaries in the sale of their commodities without doors they have unnecessarily and unjustly brought upon themselves for the most part so let the world judge their merit in imposing such an iniquitous tax upon the public  some perhaps will in goodnature urge in favor of their worthy apothecary that for a bill of ten pounds he is often put off with five or six a modest humble creature his merit as well as demerit is best known to himself  it is true some apothecaries may think themselves well paid with half their bill and it is not improbable they often are too well for while they can swell their accounts to what size they please by the quantities of medicines they prescribe and charging what they will it is likely care will be taken to suit the bill to the humor of the customer so that if he should pay but a fourth part they are sure to be no losers but which of them will remit one penny of their bill on their own accord be it ever so highly rated to such as do not wrangle for it and is not whatsoever ever they receive over and above the real value of the medicines justly disposed of the most base and wicked extortion  such apothecaries would probably join in the impious breathings of garths diasenna if they thought their goods were too low rated  thrice happy were those golden days of old when dear as burgundy ptisans were sold when patients chose to die with better will than live to pay the apothecarys bill and cheaper than for our assistance call might go to aix or bourbon spring and fall dispensatory cant iii the extraordinary unlimited gain arising from these horrid usurpations has now tempted the apothecaries utterly to forsake their proper and immediate office and duty for instead of pursuing the true means of learning pharmacy reading the works of the celebrated writers upon that subject such being generally in greek or latin languages to which most dealers in drugs are entire strangers they have totally neglected and forsaken it and in the room of such authors furnished themselves with only some vile english dispensatory the despicable cobwebs of some poor illiterate wretch who quacked for a livelihood and spun these paultry traps for ignorant unwary flies such were the memorable starmongers and voluminous quacks culpeper and salmon and the erroneous conceited scriblers quincy and alleyne whose dispensatories practices of physic and other such like fallacious quackbooks which will not bear reading by any that have read the originals being calculated only for such mean illiterate reptiles as addict themselves to that vile pernicious trade of quacking can but prompt a man to think he understands physic and practice it when a better education must convince him of the contrary and make him tremble at the thoughts of the stupendous task  thus has pharmacy been perverted and debased for though held by the ancients in the second rank yet is it now deemed the last and meanest of the three branches and indeed under the present mismanagement and depravity it may of all trades be reckoned the vilest and most despicable and instead of being useful it is become apparently destructive to society a footman or porter may now adays pass for an apothecary we see shops daily served and attended by such or ignorant women i have known an apothecarys shop served by a journey man of a certain mean mechanic trade who knew not a letter in the alphabet nay a wretch who conversed more with brutes than men the stabletender or groom of a certain eminent apothecary has been exalted from rubbing of horses heels to attending his masters table and thence to wiping of compters and pounding mortars and being translated from his masters to a shop of his own acquired so much craft as to pass for an apothecary lived in repute among his neighbors for many years and died not long since in very considerable circumstances hence the calling is become so vile and scandalous that few besides the meaner sort put their children to learn it and so contemptible are those after a most servile and tedious apprenticeship that a journeyman tailor or shoemaker or any of the meanest handycraft trades shall get better wages than a journey man apothecary of ever so good understanding in his profession the most ignorant being capable of serving most of our common shops which consists chiefly in retailing medicines made up by a nominal druggist as incapable of preparing as an apothecary of prescribing them justly or bought from a poor ignorant herbgatherer who both frequently sell one thing for another of ever so different qualities which impositions are implicitly overlooked by master and man neither thinking the knowledge of simple or compound medicines material or necessary nor their preparation or composition his proper occupation they lay themselves out for practicing physic and surgery for which as well as their own profession the reading a false english dispensatory is reckoned a sufficient qualification so quacking being the principal business of a modern apothecary he generally goes through that himself therefore needs no judicious emanuensis any rawboy being soon made capable of the ordinary business of his shop for which reason rather than pay journeymans wages apprentices are multiplied at any rate and at all hazards whence we come to have more apothecaries shops than any city in europe in proportion we are within eight or ten equal in number with those of paris which i think is allowed to be six times as populous as dublin  but this fatal degeneracy has now made such a progress that we really forget or know not what we should be for regardless of the worth and dignity of our art and of the public benefit the apothecaries have neglected and abandoned it and in the vain pursuit of another like aesops dog quitted the real substance for an empty shadow so losing their art have dwindled into vile fallacious quacks vain and audacious pretenders to physic and surgery and destructive hawkers of medicine the very method of educating youth in this calling is either quite forgotten or so far perverted and changed from what it must have been heretofore that it is by great accident if ever we happen to see any one of common understanding in that profession few having more than the undeserved name of apothecary and that only because he lived in some mean servile station for a time with one of tha appellation these pretenders are above the ordinary business and attendance of a shop that with then is quite out of the question they fly at higher game you may see some of these wouldbe doctors in all parts of the town in quest of prey one dressed with all the formality of a prig another affecting a dirty slovenly mien and an unnatural sullen grimmace instead of the natural gravity which must necessarily possess men of understanding in the important practice of physic the first shall assume a most pedantic dogmatic air the second an illfeigned awkward hippocratic leer and either shall smell taste or inspect excrements examine the visage and tongue and feel the pulse with great solemnity then in a long spun uncouth jargon of illchosen unintelligible technical words enough to raise the admiration and puzzle all the nursekeepers in christendom shall ask a poor languishing patient a set of tedious impertinent commonplace questions which he cannot possibly understand and consequently cannot answer but the wily quack with a selfsufficient look and a weighty revolving humh  cries so  ay  very well  hemh  i thought so  i apprehend you and so forth then armed with fatal pen ink and paper he prescribes largely some stinking mothered waters fermented sirrups pernicious burning spirits ungrateful medicated brandyjuleps g harvey  or at best unwholesome and unsavory punch which the prescriber to whom indeed their worth is solely known calls specific or alexipharmic and takes care often to repeat because he would not have his patient die for want of a cordial as it is termed or rather that he may sell his wares and have an opportunity of charging for his visits though he does not know but he hereby in effect signs the poor sufferers deathwarrant though he meant only to draw a small bill in his own favor yet ask this mighty shamdoctor how the meanest compositions in his shop are made whence this or the other simple ingredient what it is distinguishing marks and characteristics or the like i will venture to answer for him rather than betray his ignorance he will confess he bought them from some honst druggist no no he does not stoop to such mean things he practices physic like garths colon  in trifling show his tinsel talent lies and form the want of intellects supplies in aspect grand and goodly he appears revered as patriarchs in primaeval years hourly his learned impertinence affords a barren superfluity of words the patients ears remorseless he assails murders with jargon where his medicine fails dispens cant ii let us now take a further view of such an apothecary and see how he can teach pharmacy  the apprentice of such a master begins with a small smattering of grammar rules and sometimes none which he least tyro should soon discover his ignorance and illiterature or in time out do him judges sufficient his fund of sense genius or other abilities are never considered being indeed but trifling to a modern apothecary for a little acquired craft may make a mere blockhead or even an idiot pass for an apothecary his apprenticeship commences with the servile drudgery of the most abject slave as for instruction of any kind he must not expect it his master who shines among his nursekeepers and coequals had none so that to learn his trade the only prospect left is to follow the good example of master which in this instance is not attended with much difficulty and therefore requires but few documents for although he deigns to suffer his vassal to make up some few physicians prescriptions out of pure complaisance to the elder brothers of the faculty of physic or insuperable love of pelf yet he never sullies his own delicate hands with any preparation his fingers are made for nobler purposes feeling of pulses in other words picking of pockets nor does he think it needful he should when from certain half bred or mungrel apothecaries falsely called druggists he can buy almost every preparation or composition or rather substitutes for any cent per cent cheaper than any honest man can make them nothing need be wanting while there is any thing of the same or like appearance in the shop the poor deluded boy is told that master by experience knows this or the other base and foreign substitute to be equal if not the same with whatever he is pleased to vend it for thus is he to learn his future occupation  at length the slavish apprenticeship ended the miserable unedisied drudge of a vile quack is now become a master  of what  why of a shop only forsooth  see him already by example if not by precept thorough paced not only in the little mean insinuating artifices and tricks of quacks and ordinary haberdashers of drugs but likewise imbued with the base penury and sordid craft of pinching on the one hand the industrious wretch who for want of better employment seeks a miserable livelihood by gathering the herbs or reptiles of the earth and extorting on the other an exorbitant profit from the pitiful farthing of the most necessitous having observed it needful while an apprentice he chiefly studied the asiucia medica the querks and artifices of physicobbers rather than the necessary qualifications of a good apothecary to which he is yet a stranger he therefore apes something of the dress and mien of a physician well knowing that esteem is oftener gained by artifice and outward appearance than by real worth r merit and then by fawning cringing dissimulation and the like gains a set of acquaintance and customers in low life by whom he is extolled till by degrees or accident he rises a step higher and so is soon like molieres faggotmaker though not always by stripes persuaded to think himself a doctor his customers he now calls patients in imitation of his superiors and had he called them sufferers the appellation would be still more expressive and significant  his sole care is now to vend the destructive magazine of perishable shoptrumpery which is not very difficult to effect when the quack has pushed himself into some repute with the vulgar among whom he must have many jackcalls by whom the skilful physicians and surgeons are artfully decried and falsely vilified who might by abstinence diet air or exercise or by dexterity of hand or bandage perhaps without the use of a shopmedicine cure sundry maladies for which the physicshopkeeper bears them mortal enmity as they do not promote his trade unnecessarily with the usual fallacious insinuation of his unparallelled skill and judgment in physic and surgery and his thorough acquaintance with the practice of both from the number of recipes which come into his hands but above all the cheapness of his advice and attendance being said to charge no more than the bare prices of a few necessary cheap remedies which is the principal recommendation his character thu established he has frequent opportunities of putting off his commodities at any rate and this he take care to improve by raising so many dangers and difficulties that he keeps his poor sufferers in as wretche a state of dread and dependence as the wicked an ignorant quack coctier did the timorous king  france lewis xi mezeray  these abject vassals of an usurping apthecary to palliate cure or prevent some imagina or fictitious distemper are never to cease takin medicines being persuaded they cannot live an ho longer than they are crammed with some unnecessa nauseous part or other of his decaying shoplumber t after many filthy expensive drenches harrassed natu sinks under the oppressive weight or by her own strength breaks the bonds and he is pleased to take the honor of the cure and to pronounce them in statu sano if a bleeding or any chirurgical operation should be wanting provided it be such as his ignorance and incapacity may not too plainly appear in and wherewith he may consume plenty of styptics lituss balsams liniments ointments and plasters it is done by the apothecary cito tuto and jucunde and that too without the least help of a surgeon which the sick are told to be quite unnecessary as physicians in other cases the fees of both being pretended to be saved by the quack as a thrifty ale wife to avoid excise gave her customers ale gratis paying two pence for the toast and nutmeg put into each quart  moreover to confirm the populace in their vain notions of their apothecarys judgment in physic he has generally the artifice to become the basest plagiary for among the customers he uses on every occasion or rather abuses the prescriptions and even borrows the very words of the familyphysician thus he steals the doctor from himself if i may be allowed the phrase insomuch that when by force he is called in and consulted it is ten to one the prejudiced patients will say that the doctor said and directed the very same things which the worthy apothecary did before in this or some other case which they think or perhaps are told was the same  i cannot here overlook that most abominable practice of some apothecaries and druggists who not only personate one another by assuming the name of their neighboring brethren in order to steal their customers but a certain audacious quack has been known to personate a late physician of his name and to recommend himself after as an apothecary these base artifices lead them to make repetitions of prescriptions which they never saw being on anothers file how fatal such horrid guesswork must often prove to the patient and proscriber is easily judged and how late a gentleman of figure suffered by this sort of chicane as well as his physician i shall not say lest it should too far injure a certain pert young quack apothecary whose rashness in this instance will i hope prove a warning to him for the future  thus admirably equipped with craft and artifice and with impudence and assurance the inseparable attendants of ignorance this monstrous amphibious animal this wretched cebler in medicine who has not in reality a single qualification for a physician or surgeon nor perhaps even for an apothecary vainly pretends to the knowledge of the three and so takes upon him the sole care and management of the sick in all distempers and disorders acute or chronic physical or chirurgical cases are all alike to him well knowing that his incapacity is not obvious to the unhappy parties concerned he hardily persists in his malpractices being blinded with ignorance prompted by avarice and having his conscience hardened by an early contracted habit of iniquity till he has rendered the unhappy sufferers immedicable and then seldom or never before permits a physician or surgeon to be called in or rather if he can brings in some poor pretender to or mercenary tool of either profession to justify his apparent misconduct or to take the honor of giving the tortured sufferer the coup de grace  i shall beg leave to give one melancholy instance of this kind our of many a certain unfortunate man who too much confided in the boasted skill of a bold presumptuous quack committed himself to his care for a certain slight secret disorder the apothecary judging it the only way to make a penny of the patient proceeded to administer medicines by wholesale for within the compass of three months he gave him above forty doses of mercurial physic with sundry other costly drenches which brought a considerable flux of humors upon the affected part to which he then made diverse unctuous applications till at length it became cancerous lastly he had recourse to salivation but with no better success the patient grew sensibly worse yet the quack to dispel the growing doubts and suspicions of the poor abused man called in a reputed physician to justify his malpractice and assist him in the cure the doctor being unable to satisfy the unhappy sufferer in his distrust of the quack he called in better assistance and had his life with great difficulty saved by the amputation of the distempered member notwithstanding all this gross abuse of the miserable patient this unworthy apothecary who may be presumed to be the principal cause of the greatest evil attending this case makes a most extravagant large bill with a charge of twenty shillings to his coadjutor the doctor annexed  by these and such like unnatural transgresons is the apothecary led out of the way of his duy and bred an utter stranger to all parts of his proper calling by this vile craft he gets his bread no wonder then he should be firmly attached to it this is all he learns all he knows all he practices all he teaches and this he finds sufficient to recommend him he indeed generally takes care to secure an interest in some party or club whether religious or politic no matter with how little reason provided he espouses and defends their principles with a good stock of blind zeal and violence he is sure of the societys favor so he may securely neglect his true profession he therefore employs his whole time in quacking or stroling over the town in quest of prey for to avoid the dangerous imputation of having nothing to do no practice as the phrase is he must never be found at home not to be seen in his noisome shop except by accident to prescribe for some sudden emergency or perhaps sometimes to edify by reading over his own illchosen stolen recipes there carefully filed more for show than use that done he must hurry forth and rush through the streets as if he had so many calls that he cannot tell which first to answer while the principal part of his business furnishing the shop and serving the wretched customers is left to some mercenary shamdruggist a miserable herbgatherer and a raw apprentice the very druggist who in all other nations in europe is but pharmacopela a mere drugmerchant is with us not only a physician and surgeon but also a galenic and chemic apothecary a seller of druggs medicines vernices oils paints or colors poisons etc a jack of all trades and in truth master of none  for bad as the usual education of an apothecary may be if it could be yet worse he may make a good modern druggist enough and it is demonstrable that among the many who assume that name there are not above two in dublin that have any right to it these who are if possible worse quacks than the apothecaries and generally worse qualified in every respect were the first who introduced that blackest villainy of sophisticating and debasing of medicines to gain fame and applause by underselling their honest brethren and you shall now find most of them ready to make up the prescriptions of physicians and surgeons brought to them by the ignorant vulgar who alone indeed entrust them with such at any rate they are offered even though they cannot read them and though they may be composed of sundry medicaments to them utterly unknown how must the unhappy patient and prescriber suffer whose prescriptions fall into such unworthy hands  thus wretchedly is pharmacy taught and practiced now adays how foreign to the manner of the ancient true apothecaries is i hope evident from the foregoing and how contradictory to reason justice and common sense is i believe to every rational unprejudiced man obvious yet that under the present fatal mismanagement it is and must continue so is i think most demonstrable for a man who takes the greatest pains to learn that art and acquires the most extraordinary knowledge and all the requisite qualifications therein and ever so strictly and diligently attends to the vegular calls of his profession and discharges the duty and proper office of an apothecary if he does not most audaciously and adventurously quack in all cases without distinction he is surely deemed but a blockhead and may remain to the generality unknown and starve or perhaps have the comfort of being reputed in his narrow circle of acquaintance a good honest fellow but no apothecary that is to say no quack and is therefore despised because he has the candor and integrity not to intermeddle with any business but his own nor to attempt things beyond his sphere in short it is not such a man that is with us deemed an apothecary no it is the most despicable of all human beings a wretch ignorant of all arts yet pretending to the greatest a false dissembling sycophant that poor shallow mimick or untowardly ape of a physician surgeon and apothecary the vile deluding quack where then is the encouragement to excel in this art when the most ignorant of it are by the generality preferred and most esteemed  i am well apprized that these will appear strange innovations to some of the brethren as well as to those who have not only let the pretended apothecaries into the secrets of their families but also indiscreetly committed the care of their health and lives into such unworthy hands and suffered themselves to be blindly and implicitly governed by them yet even those upon impartial examination and serious consideration will find them literally just and true it requires no great depth of sagacity to sound these ambitious pretenders and to find how unfit and incapable they are to practice the profession whose name they undeservedly bear and how much more that of physic and surgery how many are there among us so palpably ignorant in a most material branch of their professed art as to be daily imposed upon not only by their druggist but even by the simple herbgatherer who both frequently impose upon them one thing for another though ever so different in their nature and properties is it not notorious that thapsia or deadly carrot for turpeth goutwort or herb gerard for masterwort english black maidenhair for the black and true maidenhairs spurious germander for ground pine burnet for saxifrage male fern for osmondroyal figwort for solomons seal wallpepper or stone crop for small houseleek cypress for savin stinking black horehound for the white bugle for betony and many such like pernicious impostures are daily palmed upon the ignorant apothecaries notwithstanding the most apparent disparity in their outward appearance as well as in their virtues and effects and is not the common excuse of our apothecaries upon the examiners condemning any drugg or medicine in their shops that they bought it at an high price from mr such an one a druggist did not about sixty apothecaries and druggists oppose the bill for preventing frauds and abuses in pharmacy and jointly assert many gross absurdities and falsehoods and make many most frivolous equivocations in their case offered to the house of peers in the year      did they not therein call castor a cod and cassia fruit a cane like a sugar cane and what less than the darkest ignorance or the most consummate perversity could thus prompt them to trifle with so august an assembly did not two apothecaries of some eminence in the year      advertise mrs stephenss medicines for sale long before the materials could possibly be had or prepared and did not these worthy brethren afterward employ a certain abandoned infamous quack once well known to watchwen and midnight magistrates to bailiffs proctors churchwardens etc to vilify him whom they only suspected to have detected their abominable deceit in charity i hope and am willing to believe all this and more the effects of pure confirmed ignorance which though equally pernicious with design there is not at present the least prospect of removing for since it is not worth while to spend any time or pains to learn a disregarded profession by which so little profit is to be gained as by true pharmacy the bare name being enough to garnish the quack nay to dub him a doctor in his own and the vulgar eyes it can hardly be otherwise expected as the livelihood of most apothecaries now adays depends upon their hawking about and quacking with such of their weak unguarded neighbors as suffer themselves to fall a prey to their perfidious craft and avarice  it is most wonderful and to those who are not thoroughly acquainted with the proper office and duty of an apothecary inconceivable what an abject state of depravity and degeneracy the apothecaries of this age are fallen into and such in time must be the case of physic also from the necessary mutual connection of each art with the other but moreover it cannot be long worth any mans while to spend the best part of his life and much of his fortune in tedious laborious studies deep and accurate researches into the most hidden and remote recesses of nature when no distinction is made between him and so base a pretender to physic as an illiterate unbred apothecary more especially when it is in the power of such to prevent his doing the good he seeks in his profession to elude his best skill and frustrate all his hopes and intentions of cure by ignorance dishonesty or neglect which must soon bring him and the whole art into the utmost contempt  but it is yet more surprising that these very men should so far have deceived the public as to have their pernicious quacking and tampering with the health and lives of the people still countenanced by many persons in other respects of good sense and some of the best families to see an hawking apothecary that worst kind of mountebank in dearth of trade run strolling through the streets gaping for prey must surely move the contempt and indignation of every considerate man who knows how he should be employed yet pursue him but a little further you will find the cringing vagrant a still greater object of your disdain that learned physician and ingenious humorist dr mandeville gives the following true and lively portraits of one of these mercenary seekers treatise upon hypochondriac and hysteric passions p     i have seen says he an apothecary in an idle afternoon go to the house of a person of quality who made use of him there happened to be none at home but children and servants who from the highest to the lowest were in perfect health if here he came for business you will say he was disappointed but you are mistaken the courteous gentleman with an engaging familiarity accosts every servant in the house and puts off a purge to the cook a vomit to the butler a box of pills to one of the footmen and a pot of lucatelluss balsam to old nurse the children absolutely refusing to take any physic at least inwardly he coaxes little master into the use of a charming dentifrice and a sweet smelling collyrium to rince his mouth with after it that shall preserve his teeth and make them look like ivory though he should eat nothing but sugar and sweetmeats all the day long to pretty miss he will send a lotion for her hair and a cosmetic paste for her hands that shall render one as bright as silver and the other whiter than snow with a beautifying wash to the maid that assisted in persuading them the affable gentleman has every bodys good word the children are pleased the servants commend him my lady is obliged to him and ten to one but the first opportunity of driving that way her coach stops at his door and she thanks him for the care he took of her family in her absence  admirable encouragement to vending the shop trampery at any rate unnecessarily sure every rational unprejudiced man must judge this and such like mean artifices of apothecaries more culpable and more pernicious to the public than the paltry harangues of a brawling mountebank to a rude rabble as such only will hear him whereas the former have recourse to all ranks and degrees of men  how the more rational and better sort of people come to acquiesce under these heavy grievances in the most tender point and suffer the greatest impositions in matters of the last moment without ever having even attempted a redress is astonishing but as it must now be owing to their not knowing the abuses and cheats long custom having made them familiar it is to be hoped that when the evil consequences thereof are laid open every good man will concur in taking some measures to prevent them for the future  sure there is nothing more inconsistent with common reason than the taking apothecaries from their proper office and station i never saw a patient that was not desirous the apothecary should himself prepare whatsoever medicines should be prescribed for him and if he is employed in quacking and his time devoted to that alone how is it possible he can see his customers justly served but if none other evil had arose from the taking apothecaries from their occupation and encouraging them to quack and thereby to neglect their immediate office and duty than subjecting the public to the grievous tax of consuming as much of the apothecaries drugs and at such a rate as they think proper methinks that should have deterred men from it sufficiently should any of the most reputable and creditable artists or tradesmen besides be employed in furnishing a family with their goods will any one say to such come and see me examine mine house and send me as much of your commodities as you think requisite for me i believe no man in his senses could be so weak and yet why should people repose more confidence in apothecaries than in other tradesmen in the like instances they are but men and although there may yet be among them some not unworthy of sparta in her primitive purity yet this is too great a trust to be reposed in mere mortals for they have shops like other tradesmen and these too furnished with perishable wares which they must therefore vend the more expeditiously had they capacities for practicing physic or surgery they ordinarily have no gratuity allowed them for the supposed good they do or for their trouble but what they procure for themselves by charging it on their medicines which with giving them in great unnecessary abundance they assuredly take care of being left entirely their own carvers and were they as well qualified for that weighty undertaking as hippocrates it is hardly to be expected that they should be such saints as to refuse or neglect procuring payment or recompense for their extraordinary labors or what they call their art especially while it is left at their option the ready way to effect which is by stuffing the unhappy sufferer with much nauseous and probably unnecessary or improper medicines even in such slight disorders as nature without their impertinent interruptions could better throw off by her unassisted powers  if a fishmonger or poulterer says mandeville should go to a customers house after dinner when the master and mistress were abroad advise the servants one to a fine salmon the other to a dozen of turkey pouts and send them home accordingly would you not think them very impudent rascals most certainly and yet the officious quack apothecary is equally guilty with either both having put off their wares where they knew they were not at all wanting or necessary with this aggravation that the former gave some things useful and of known value but the latter things entirely useless at best of small intrinsic worth to the taker of none unless by accident and perhaps very dangerous and hurtful  the cause of the groundless notions usually entertained of the skill and judgment of apothecaries in physic and surgery and the cheapness of their advice is a vain vulgar prejudice industriously propagated by artful quacks and their servile tools and emissaries from the apothecaries seeing the practice of physicians and surgeons in sundry distempers and disorders with the great numbers of the prescriptions of both which necessarily come into their hands it is insinuated and imagined that they must understand the whole art of healing in all it is parts as well as those who have made it their sole study and practice for many years and this is the reason why apothecaries are usually first called to the sick by which means they are in fact rendered the jackcalls of physicians and surgeons in as much as it is manifest that they often make work for both by multiplying patients and rendering many cases worse and more inveterate than when they were first consulted if the unhappy sufferers have the good fortune to outlive their expensive injudicious tamperings for any time  it may now perhaps be advanced as heretofore upon another occasion see observe on the physicians bill       and it must be allowed that a thorough bred experienced apothecary who knows the faces qualities and virtues of simple and compound medicines to which i must add who understands anatomy and the animal economy and knows the histories causes and diagnostics of distempers without which he can never be capable of making just observations on the effects of remedies or curing diseases may be as safely confided in as the graduate of any university and the same may be said of an old nursekeeper  it is certain a gang of lawless thieves and vagabonds founded the greatest commonwealth in the world and promulged the wisest human laws for the punishment and suppression of vice and the encouragement of virtue vertots romans revol  but sure we are not to expect the like from every set of benditti nor suffer any evil to be done that good may accrue why then should the present race of apothecaries who neither have nor can pretend to the requisite qualifications of physicians or surgeons be allowed to sport with the health lives and fortunes of the public at their discretion when it is evident they should not be trusted with the care of the sick in any disorder nor even in their own profession till they have first given open proofs of their understanding it nothing should induce you to give any men such an unreasonable and unjust toleration our happy constitution is such that no man or body of men can make a monopoly of any art science or trade for a meritorious person amesnable to the laws may be admitted to profess or practice any occupation whatsoever if any man is conscious of his knowledge or capacity in medicine he may present himself to the college of physicians and sue for a license to practice which having answered the proper examitions they are obliged to grant they cannot refuse so that an apothecary or any other person found duly qualified may obtain a license to practice physic but we find none of our apothecaries have in any instance legally qualified themselves for such a weighty undertaking most contenting themselves with no better a diploma than a shop garnished with sundry empty painted and labelled vessels with it is windows adorned with monstrous or strange useless animals as tortoises toads etc how then are they to be trusted in matters of such importance are they not rather to be industriously avoided and justly despised  to attain to a competent knowledge in pharmacy and afterward to discharge the office justly and faithfully must require more time than apothecaries can properly spare who attempt arts for which they have laid no sort of foundation and as none of them have performed any of the requisites for a physician or surgeon and few or none even those for an apothecary i think it as arrogant and as impudent in an apothecary to presume to practice physic or surgery or to pretend to any skill or judgment in either as it would be in the most illiterate printer or bookseller to pretend to the mathematics or any other branch of philosophy or literature merely because he printed sundry learned books in these sciences for sale or for a colorgrinder to use mandevilles words to painting only because he grinds the several colors and perhaps prepares the palate and pencils for his master and sees him frequently paint the apothecary it is true may frequently see patients in all manner of distempers and disorders hear and see the most judicious physicians and surgeons accurately examine their various complaints may peruse their several prescriptions nay prepare and administer them the printer likewise may see the best manuscripts of the most celebrated authors in all branches of philosophy may print and reprint them and have thousands of impressions to dispose of and the colorgrinder also may daily see his master execute his best skill and most sublime designs in drawing and may by his directions make up and lay out in due order upon the palate the several proper colors and also provide the several necessary pencils and tools for painting the same and yet notwithstanding each must probably remain in the darkest ignorance and continue utter strangers to physic philosophy and painting until regularly initiated into the rudiments and duly and methodically instructed in the several rules of the respective arts and all that such may be said to know in them are a few technical words learned by rote or accident which can serve only to impose upon the ignorant these impostors it is certain may shine among their kind and even deceive men of sense and learning in other matters for a while but they can never stand the test of proper judges happy indeed were it for the public had the pretenders to these three arts been equally conspicuous to the world if so it is more than probable there would be more botches observed in the practice of the pretenders to physic and surgery to say nothing of downright murders which are usually hid by the friendly gravedigger than there are to be seen in the nocturnal works of the printers of last speeches and ballads or in the vile insignificant daubings of the pretenders to painting on the paltry signs in all the streets in town  as to the cheapness of the advice of apothecaries in physic or surgery it is a most false and deceitful insinuation it is value will best appear by considering their qualification if it appears they have none as i think it must what is their advice worth should it not be avoided as a pest i know it is objected by some and made a handle by quacks that the fees of physicians and surgeons are too high and that people in low life cannot purchase their attendance or advice i have in some measure answered these objections already page    i shall endeavor to obviate them further it is true there is no nation in the world at this time that so justly prizes the merits of physicians and surgeons or so nobly rewards both as great britain and ireland for from our natural freedom no restraint has been laid on rewarding just deserts in any instance yet notwithstanding there are no people in europe even where fees are lowest that may be better attended than those of these kingdoms did not officious selfish quacks interfere  there is no set of men who deserve better of the public than physicians and surgeons none have been and are more publicly and privately beneficent the extraordinary munificence of dr radcliffe and sir hans sloane in england of our sir patrick dun and dr stevens with many others are monuments which must attest this truth to futurity and i can affirm on the other hand that i never met with an object so despicable that could not command the advice and attendance of numbers of physicians and surgeons of the first rank upon its own terms and that i have often known physicians to refuse fees from tradesmen of good circumstances and yet attend them constantly for many days after without any other obligation that that of humanity is not this much better than to be subject to pay rigorously the smaller fees and to have the bodies liable to be detained dead or alive for payment as we hear it is in some neighboring nations our poor have no reason to complain in this instance of any thing mere than the oppression of quacks the houses of our physicians and surgeons are open to and they are as ready to succor the poor sick as the opulent are not our infirmary and hospitals attended gratis  it were well for apothecaries as well as surgeons in low life that none but real objects could partake of these charities   iii i now come to my third head namely to lay open some of the most considerable frauds and abuses of apothecaries and druggists and to point out some of the most pernicious sophistications of medicines with the evil consequences thereof  it is commonly said that physicians and apothecaries kill more than they cure  however ludicrous or satirical this phrase may sound it is a melancholy consideration that the illnatured sarcasm often proves just and is likely to continue so until the apothecaries and druggists are brought under some proper regulations which may restrain them from hawking and quacking and confine them within the just limits of their respective callings for into such an abyss of depravity and degeneracy are these men fallen by their grasping at matters beyond their sphere that now through ignorance or dishonesty there is scarce a medicine of any worth to be had genuine the knowledge of many of the most valuable simples is utterly lost and in their room some vile and foreign counterfeit as quacks for apothecaries foisted upon the unwary public for corruption by long impunity hardens the offenders multiplies the number of the guilty and is now so far from being deemed scandalous in this way that it is really become fashionable  before i proceed to wilful errors it may not be impertinent first to expose some arising from the ignorance and illiterature of apothecaries being probably the principal causes of many more and which may produce as evil consequences as any others  the works of the most authentic medical writers are in arabic greek or latin the best known names of distempers as well as of medicines the exotic druggs especially are in these or some other foreign languages often compound and most of the technical words in medicine are also compound though mostly of greek and latin we do not as yet know an english name for one vegetable in twenty for as physic took it is origin in the eastern parts of the world and is not as yet truly naturalized to our tongue and idiom it has hitherto been found so uncertain and difficult to reduce the terms of art and names of medicaments into any other tongue than the latin properly and expressively that all the colleges of physicians in europe have not only been obliged to give their dispensatories in latin but in many to admit an entire greek word or phrase as being least ambiguous most expressive and significant and this is the principal reason for writing extemporaneous prescriptions also in latin this made it necessary for apothecaries to understand the learned languages and they were in all ages sensible of it until of late some hirelings sprang up who finding what a propensity people had to quackcry judged they might scribble that way for the vulgar to gain a livelihood and so presumed to translate the works of the learned in physic into the vulgar tongue which false pretended trannslations being seldom or never read by any that understand the originals have passed with their manifold errors unobserved to this day among these erroneous hackney translators the most celebrated among the apothecaries at present i may say the most in fashion is the late famous dr quincy a quondam apothecary of london who it is said wrote for bread in a jail what right he might have had to annex m d to his name i have not yet been able to learn with any certainty unless he followed the good example of his worthy predecessor salmon who being called to account for putting these letters after his name upon the specious title pages of his many volumes of fulsome falsehood and nonsense it is said declared he did not mean them for medicinae doctor but for medicamentorum donator in which sense mr quincy and every other apothecary has no doubt without leave of an university a right to use them  the ignorance of the present set of apothecaries and their unacquaintance with the learned languages puts them under a necessity instead of observing the original london dispensatory and preparing and dispensing their medicines thereby as the kings proclamation prefixed to it enjoins to use a spurious translation of that dispensatory by the aforesaid quincy in which he has committed the most gross and dangerous mistakes for instance in the sirup of marshmallows a composition of softening cooling pectoral and diuretic herbs etc he renders adiantum album and nigrum capillary herbs called black and white maidenhairs black and white hellebores an harsh drastic purgative root and an acrid and almost caustic and vomitive one in the room of mild safe balsamic plants so plainly repugnant to the intended virtues of that medicine he has rendered sesquiunciam one ounce and an half half an ounce even in a composition wherein there are above six pounds sterling difference in the expense of that medicine when dispensed by the dispensatory and the same done by his translation besides the virtue of the remedys being abated in proportion to what is omitted of the principal ingredient the same author leaves out several things prescribed by the college dispensatory in many compositions omits directing the several parts of simples thereby directed to be used and in short commits many unpardonable errors and omissions too tedious to enumerate which are swallowed implicitly by the ignorant and illiterate to the unspeakable detriment of the public in another of his pharmaceutic works his praelectiones pharmac by dr shaw lect ix he teaches the apothecary how to substitute and gives even a list of such things as he justifies the substitution of for others among these he says that balsam capivi may be given for balm of gilead styrax for balm of tolu saffron for bezoar bole for dragons blood for carthamus seed mustard seed and other such like shocking incoherencies yet all these however dangerous and destructive to society they may prove are in some sort excusable in these who could have known no better at least they are more pardonable than the many wilful frauds and corruptions which the apothecaries and druggists have been so long accustomed to that like a liar who has told his false tale so often over that he at length brings himself to believe it truth they have so far hardened their consciences as to judge the most vile and pernicious counterfeits not only justifiable but as good as the true and genuine medicines and so have generously reduced the prices of many compositions by half less than any honest man can sell them by which means several have become such absolute strangers to the very faces of medicines that they have been known to reject the genuine when offered to sale and prefer the most base substitutes or adulterations  the unparalleled naked villainy of the english druggists which ours as far as they can imitate is the principal cause of the many abominable sophistications of medicines i am well informed that these avaricious falsifiers who are well versed in robbing their king and country were so audacious and so impudent as to declare in a body before the british parliament in answer to the preamble of a bill passed in the reign of king george the first of glorious memory that they did not vend any unsound or adulterate drugs or medicines to the prejudice of his majestys good subjects of great britain but that all such they sent to ireland  and they thought no doubt their useless scraps and offals too good for us because we find by woeful experience that the latter part of their wicked assertion they daily verify for though the british privy council did this unhappy island the justice to retort this answer upon the same worthy set of men when by the instigation of their irish correspondents they opposed the bill passed here in the year      and so unanimously recommended it to the royal assent yet no means has hitherto been found to prevent this being the common sink of all the corrupt or decayed drugs of england  the abuse of the drawback given to encourage trade and exportation in england proves now a manifest injury to the kings revenues and an insuperable impediment to following our trade here honestly which must necessarily be destructive of the health and lives of the people of this kingdom for the dread of discovery and due punishment upon exposing bad drugs to sale in london together with the advantages arising by the drawback upon sending them to ireland though they were quite rotten and useless will always be a motive to infest us with the refuse of all their sortments the very cullings of their drugs nay the mere sweepings of their drugwarehouses for when a londoner imports a drug and pays the duty he removes it to a warehouse and sorts it and what proves so unsound or decayed that he cannot with impunity or credit sell there he transports to ireland swearing it to be within the limited time and consigning it to a proper correspondent it arrives here the correspondent receives it pays the duty which if not taxed in our book of rates wherein most drugs are much lower rated than in england it is valued upon oath by the londoners directions perhaps not as many pence as it was first valued shillings the duty is accordingly paid and a certificate thereof returned to the london transporter who is thereby entitled to drawback the duty paid at first importation for so much as was entered in ireland except a small matter not exceeding two and an half per cent or thereabouts so that rubarb whose duty upon importation in england is six shillings and ten pence the pound draws back upon exportation about six shillings and four pence and most other drugs in like proportion for this cause the most vile drugs which can escape the examiners in london are sent hither the saving the drawback if they got no more for them here where by the by a customer is never wanting for such being a sufficient encouragement this is so notorious a practice that our importers often openly confess it and the english merchants are so expert at this trade that they send their correspondents invoyces with the drawback calculated and deducted from their accounts i have known about twenty pounds of damaged rubarb sent by a merchant in london to an apothecary in dublin upon commission with directions to sell it expeditiously for whatever he could and although there was not a single ounce sound or fit for use in the cargo yet a certain great druggist bought it at about a fourth of the then current price of good rubarb and dyed it to impose upon his customers  familiar instances of these abuses almost every entry of drugs and i believe of many other merchandises affords i shall mention but a remarkable one made by a late celebrated druggist about the year      he imported eight hundred weight of jesuits bark entered it at the customhouse valued upon oath at a groat per pound the landofficer mr craven surprised at this strange undervaluation not knowing the quality of the drug before he would make a seizure which if undervalued he had a right to advised with that faithful eminent chemist the ingenious mr maple who upon examining it assured him that it was not worth one penny a pound having not a single characteristic of the drugg it was entered for by which it might be even known  this instance shows the cause in confirmation of the observations of some learned physicians harris pharm antiempir p   0 why one dram or two of peruvian bark succeeded better formerly than some ounces now a days  thus is the king most ungenerously robbed of his just revenues and thus are the health and lives of his subjects endangered or destroyed by the iniquitous confederacy of the english and irish druggists particularly in their gross abuse of that great encouragement to trade a drawback and as such vile pernicious stuff as this is daily imported and sold by mercenary men among us who have nothing to recommend them but their underselling every fair dealer it is plain a faithful apothecary who chooses the best commodities at any rate for the good of his customers and his own private satisfastion must appear a most extravagant extortioner to all such as cannot distinguish the qualities of medicines and consequently he cannot expect a livelihood by his profession if he persists in candor and integrity  besides the many impositions we are liable to in this way from abroad there are many of our own manufacture equally pernicious to the public of which give me leave to instance but a sew  when gum ammoniac in the crude impure mass is sold at about ten shillings the pound yet is the plaster made by dissolving it in vinegar of squills and juice of hemlock straining and boiling it to a proper consistence in which it loses very considerably of it is weight besides the trouble and expense that necessarily attends the operation so debased as to be sold for less than a fourth of the price of the gum  calbanum has suffered the same fate it is a substance of much the like texture with the former and must be strained or otherwise depurated to render it fit for use by which it suffers much the same loss with the ammoniac yet notwithstanding so long have people been accustomed to fraud in this medicine and so familiar is the substitute now become that the generous genuine gum is utterly rejected by the goodwomen and others and so hardened are the very falsifiers grown in this wicked practice that the pretended druggists in effect confess it for i have it under the hand of one of them in a bill of rates that he sells the strained for little more than one third of the price of the crude galbanum  so base is the counterfeit sold for balsam capivi which is a natural tear or juice issuing upon incision of a certain tree in america that it is openly sold with us for less than the kings duty upon importation of that drug  when such barefaced villainy is committed in the simple drugs what may we not expect in the compound medicines since the more compound or mixed a remedy is the better opportunity there must be for cheating by substituting the basest for the best or leaving out the dearest and principal ingredient in the composition in order to deceive the customers and undersell the honest compounder  to point out all the abuses in this way must alas be no less than a comment upon the dispensatory which would be too tedious and prolix and by reason of the difficulty of comprehending the nature or effects of frauds in pharmacy without some knowledge in physic as well as a good understanding in that art i have chose to mention but ome of the most obvious  when jallap root is sold for six or seven shillings the pound yet is the resin extracted at great expense and labor though sixteen ounces of one will not afford two ounces of the other so vilely sophisticated as to be sold by our druggists for two shillings an ounce  the more compound and expensive a medicine is the more art and industry is used to sophisticate or debase it thus the treacle of andromachus which takes it is name from the physician of nero the tyrant who invented it and the mithridate which takes it is name also from it is royal author mithridates king of pontus both which have been received into all the dispensatories and ever since deemed the capital medicines in all the shops in europe and of which the wise states of venice have taken such special care in the composition that they are not to be dispensed in the republic but under the inspection of magistrates appointed for that purpose whence the former got the common appellation of venicetreacle because for a long time none was reckoned good that was not made there although it is most certain that it may and has been as justly and faithfully dispensed and prepared here as there or in any other place whatsoever these noble medicines which for such a tract of time have stood the test and were ever held in the highest esteem are now fallen into such disrepute and contempt through the frequent debasings and adulterations they have undergone that it is rare to find either ever prescribed for internal use by physicians  the temptations to dishonesty are certainly greater in our trade than in any other whatsoever from the prodigious gains and assured secrecy that attend our worst deceits most are capable of distinguishing frauds in the ordinary necessaries of life but as some branch of medicine alone can apprehend those in pharmacy so the apothecaries transgress undiscovered or even unsuspected openly easily and securely few medicines have suffered more by the hands of dishonest operators than those once justly famed compositions just now mentioned the one of which consists of above seventy the other of about fifty ingredients mostly very rare the products of the most remote parts of the world and consequently difficult to be had sound and genuine yet are both so wretchedly debased by mercenary artificers that they are daily openly sold for less than half the first cost of the true composition nay the very inscription and seal clapped upon the treacle of venice by the inspecting magistrates is now artfully counterfeited in london and put upon pots or canisters of their own vile manufacture to deceive the ignorant and unwary and this kind you may sometimes see hawked here as well as in england by a pretended venetian sailor who perhaps never crossed the seas  it is well known to every physician and good apothecary that spirit of hartshorn properly speaking consists of nothing more than the volatile salt dissolved in the radical humidity and blended with a small portion of the native exalted oil of that animal extracted from his horns by fire according to art and it is celebrated uses and virtues are too well known to require any panegyric yet this most admirable medicine is now so basely counterfeited that the few who have it genuine cannot pretend to sell it without loss being undersold by all the avaricious falsifiers of medicines who make what they unjustly give that name to and impose upon the public in it is room of no better materials than stale piss brine soot and rochelime and nevertheless this adulteration has so far gained ground and prevailed that nothing but the pungent quicksmelling spirit of piss will go down with the generality being so long accustomed to this vile excrementitious distillment which strikes the senses so much more quick and piquant that they pronounce the other dead or vapid  spirit of sal ammoniac is directed to be made with salt of tartar but because lime is cheaper and affords more spirit it is mostly used for it though the spirits raised by both are extremely different  how unequal the effects of true spirit of hartshorn and that of piss and spirit of sal ammoniac with salt of tartar and that with lime may be upon the human body i must leave to the learned in physic to determine but this i can say from actual observation that true spirit of hartshorn and that of sal ammoniac with salt of tartar are in their own natures truly alkaline and produce a considerable contrast or ebullition upon mixture with acids those with lime the contrary  whence i think it reasonable to judge their respective virtues and methods of acting extremely opposite  i could lay mine hand upon a certain venerable antique gentleman who occasionally personates a physician or surgeon an apothecary chemist or druggist and garth s colon dispensary cant ii   in morals loose but most precise in look  who takes a shorter and easier method of counterfeiting these spirits though equally foreign to the true and perhaps equally pernicious with the former sophistications he takes sal ammoniac one part potashes two parts and common water a sufficient quantity to dissolve the whole when dissolved he strains and puts one part in a glass falsely labelled for spirit of sal ammoniac and the other tinged yellow in one more unjustly titled for spirit of hartshorn and sells both at a most exorbitant price under the respective false denominations aforesaid by the iniquitous use of the name of a certain considerable chemist beforementioned on whom he fathers many other spurious compositions  unassisted reason without any great knowledge in physic or chemy may show what a contrary effect these cheats must produce from the genuine medicines and it is not difficult to conceive how both patient and prescriber must suffer by the use of this horrid imposture for it is evidently but a mere solution of these crude salts and consequently laden with the caustic potashes as well as the marine salt in the sal ammoniac both which compose a third kind very repugnant to the properties of either spirit of sal ammoniac or hartshorn and which is so fixed as not to be raised by any degree of fire whereas what is truly volatile alone which only can answer the intentions of those who prescribe either spirits is elevated by the gentlest heat  the tincture of castor another admirable remedy is likewise basely sophisticated it is ordered by the learned authors of the dispensatory we are to follow to be extracted with spirit of french wine rectified first distilled from castor cinnamon cloves nutmegs lavender flowers and some other aromatic nervous medicines and this is called spirit of castor which must undoubtedly render the tincture more powerful and effectual for the purposes designed yet notwithstanding quite regardless of it is virtues or effects you will find the apothecaries great strangers to this medicine i have heard one of the most eminent among them a man of great reputed honesty and understanding say in the presence of some considerable members of the college of physicians that this spirit is good for nothing and that brandy extracted as good a tincture from the castor it must indeed be confessed that brandy or the common foetid foul malt or molossus spirits which are most frequently used upon this and the like occasions instead of spirit of wine will acquire as deep a color from castor and such like substances as the spirit of castor or any other spirit of equal strength with them can do and that may perhaps suffice such as only aim at the basest rate to counterfeit the external form or appearance of a medicine to answer their own mercenary ends alone and we know deceptions are attempted in this kind where the very similitude is wanting for this same false reddish tincture has been sold for the spirit which is pure and limpid  i would ask any candid man conversant in pharmacy a few questions which he cannot without concern answer is it not known that common copperose a nauseous and unwholesome drug is sold for salt of steel an agreeable safe and efficacious medicine and even at a rate but little less than that of the genuine the better to cover the deceit that new england castor though vastly inferior in virtues and of a very different make and appearance from the russian which we are always ordered to use is taken and sold for that only because a pound of the former seldom exceeds in value one ounce of the latter that pot or gravelled ashes of about a groat the pound is sold for the fixed salts of tartar of wormwood and other vegetalles which are not to be made without great trouble and expense and notwithstanding the extraordinary difference that appears between them upon experiment see hoffman obser phys chym p     boerhaav elem chem tom ii p     that suet or some animal fat but slightly impregnated with mace is sold for the expressed oil of mace at less than the very spice can be sold for that common barbados aloes of about twenty pence a pound is used in many compositions and sold for the succotrine aloes worth about eight shillings the pound that saffron is omitted in many medicines wherein it is ordered or spanish or bastard saffron used instead of british notwithstanding the greatest disparity in their virtues and prices that molossus or common treacle is used in several electuaries and other medicines instead of the sirups directed that common white bryony root bought at about two pence the pound is mixed with and sold for jallap worth about six shillings the pound that jallap and other harsh purgatives are used in the lenitive electuary and daffeys elixir instead of sena that common resin is mixed with and sold for resin of jallap that two considerable nominal druggists bought up several hundred weight of a certain astringent dying stuff seized by an ignorant examiner of drugs at the customhouse for sena of which it had hardly any outward resemblance and to which it was diametrically opposite in quality mixed it with and sold it for sena that gamboge is mixed with and sold for turpeth mineral that red lead is mixed with the red and white lead with the white precipitates of mercury and that spanish white or whiting of about a groat a stone is sold for white lead which is worth so much the pound and some say even for diaphoretic antimony do not most seeds lose their medicinal virtues with their vegetative quality and yet are not the seeds sold among us usually such the very useless sweepings of seedmongersshops is not the vinegar of squills generally made with green instead of dry squills which are ordered by the dispensatory though it is apparent to common reason that they are rather preserved than yield their virtues in that manner and this only because that root loses about one half of it is weight in drying i wish i could say no more and i am sorry to say that every sensible man who has taken pains to learn and pry into the secrets of our pharmacy must know these and many more and must answer these quaeres in the affirmative  thus have i endeavored to lay before you a short sketch of the most common wilful abuses of apothecaries and druggists which alone may show how the dishonest injure the king s revenues impose upon the public in general and prejudice every branch of the healing art the apothecaries in particular the honest of whom are grievously oppressed by the fraudulent see p     as these are the effects of sordid avarice and degeneracy no honest intelligent man can with a clear conscience conceal them such errors as proceed from pure simple ignorance as destilling sal ammoniac in iron tin or leaden pots when every operator of judgment must know that that salt from it is known subtilty and aptness to enter the pores of metals and dissolve them was by the chemists called the key to metals and it has been proved by a most accurate observer stahl fundam chym dogm and experim c v  that all metals are sensibly affected by destilling spirit of sal ammoniac from them and that consequently nothing but glass can withstand it is penetrating force effectually as likewise destilling sundry spirits oils and waters and the boiling or infusing sirups decoctions infusions oils ointments etc in untinned copper bodies or vessels which manifestly alters their properties and their levigating testacious and other hard bodies upon soft stones by which means cursorsstream black flag has been often sold for crabsclaws corral nay for pearl bezoar and other precious stones if they ever used any after being first infected by powdering in a soft brass mortar these i say i could pass over in compassion and charity and not impute them as crimes to any they indeed call for reformation but wilful and apparently pernicious corruptions and abuses cry aloud for a scourge  when apothecaries become such obstinate hardy malefactors what can it tend to less than the utter subversion and ruin of physic which is so connected with and has so great a dependence on pharmacy that they must necessarily rise and fall with each other  i would ask the judicious tender physicians and surgeons are they not often in more pain than some of those they prescribe for when they do not know what shop their prescriptions may fall into on the due preparation of which the health or life of the patient as well as their credit and reputation depends how vain and uncertain are all their most accurate observations on diseases and the effects of remedies rendered by the various diversification of their prescriptions when the same recipe shall produce different effects according to the several shops it has been prepared in who can presume to prescribe the wellknown doses of the most powerful and efficacious chemical medicines the mercurial preparations especially when less than a sixth of an ordinary dose has been found to induce the most baneful symptoms  but hap what will the apothecary knows he is sase let him but vend his wares it is all he seeks as for mischances those can only fall upon the patient and prescriber and if perchance he is suspected as he attends closely and perhaps for that end he speaks first and soon acquits himself with impunity and though conscious of the badness or at best uncertain of the goodness of his medicines having bought not prepared them frames many artful excuses and never fails to heap the scandal of their ill success on the defenseless prescriber which is justly due to his ignorance dishonesty or neglect  bad as the consequences of the forementioned corruptions prove it were happy they had extended no farther but this contagious degeneracy has now made such a surprising progress that we have not only lost our art but with it the knowledge of many of the most valuable simples and use in their stead the most foreign and unnatural substitutes thus for a small testaceous production found in the stomachs of fresh water crabs or crawfishes called lapides or oculi cancrorum crabseyes we do not blush to sell some small pellets of outlandish clay artfully molded into the same form even though it is obvious that they do not retain the least resemblance of the properties or virtues of the true crabseyes  some of our learned naturalists hoffman obs phys chym lib ii obs i boerhaav elem chem tom ii p     geoff lectures on matter med affirm that what we now use for nitre is extremely different from the nitre of the ancients in appearance and effects in like manner that noble styptic and vulnerary roman vitriol is not to be seen among us yet we do not scruple selling for it hungarian or cyprus copperose though of quite another nature and as different in color and appearance as well as effects as green from blue  a man can hardly hear the name of arsenic without horror from the frequent deadly effects of that drug and yet we are well assured that the arsenic of the ancients was no more a poison than any other active medicine for the yellow called auripigmentum and the red called sanderacha were both given internally by hippocrates dioscorides avicenna fallopius and others m geoffroy aforesaid says that the indians drink wine infused in arsenical cups as a sovereign remedy and it is most certain that we never have had any just complaints or even mention made of the least ill effects from either until the factitious kind a most incorrigible poison and utterly unknown to the ancients falsely usurped it is name and place whereby the true native arsenics being more rare became quite neglected and are now buried in oblivion hoffm obs phys chym lib iii obs i boerhaav elem chem tom i p        thus likewise turpentine a balsamic exudation from the terebinthus or turpentinetree and even that from the larix or larchtree which is yet more common and called veniceturpentine though improperly is now scarcely ever seen and hardly known among us because the cheaper substitutes of the resins of firs pines etc and their oil which is falsely called and sold for oil of turpentine blended together by fire is sold in it is place by the druggists vastly cheaper than the genuine can be imported for this vile cheat has been often openly detected in this kingdom an experienced artificer in frauds well versed in thus counterfeiting the works of dame nature and who produced more turpentine in his way annually than many of the largest trees in the venetian territories had his artifice brought to light by his compositions taking fire and burning his and some neighboring houses in a certain great city and though he might have justly dreaded another fate yet has he lived to apply to himself a phrase taken from the regeneration of the phaenix often misapplied by canting false chemists damnum reparabitur igni which is indeed verified for that base incendiary has by that accident been raised out of dust ashes and poverty by the generous but misapplied contribution of the citizens  we have an account of one that died a martyr to this cause in the country dublin journal aug      0   if any honest industrious man should be at the pains to procure these things genuine what must he do with them long disuse has rendered them now unknown and besides his customers can only judge of the different rates and not the qualities of medicines so he is reckoned an extravagant extortioner and loses their favor and custom and the commodities may lie upon his hands till they perish before he can sell them to advantage thus unlike all other artists is the just conscientious apothecary to be requited  i could now most willingly drop the ungrateful task of exposing mens faults were it not necessary to a perfect cure to dive into the bottom of their morbid state in hopes that when all are exposed to open view you with the rest of the great physicians of the state when next in consultation assembled may apply some remedy to this cursed chronic distemper  it may be thought probable when men might in the most considerable instances gratify their shameful avarice with the greatest secrecy and impunity that they would not hazard a discovery though there was no law to punish them by a more open transgression which every body may detect but see how a long habit of iniquity at once obdurates the hearts and captivates the senses of the feeble wicked wretch  the apothecaries and druggists not content with the fairest opportunities of defrauding the public in almost every other respect must deceive every customer patient or prescriber by altering the weights and measures directed by ours and almost all other collegiate dispensatories in europe for i can affirm that they are not smaller in any  when a physician writes for an ounce of any medicine he expects eight drachms of sixty grains each according to the table of weights prefixed to the dispensatory but he unexpectedly falls short of about fifty four grains for instead of the medical the civil or avoirdupoize weights are used each ounce of which contains but about seven drachms and six grains of the former weight the evils arising from this practice are not in many cases less detrimental to the public than the frauds and abuses already mentioned in medicines  all the officinal compositions and extemporaneous prescriptions are so calculated by the prescribers that if duly prepared according to their intentions they must necessarily know to the greatest exactness the quantity of the principal and indeed of every respective ingredient contained in a dose or any given quantity of the mixed medicine thus for instance four scruples of venice treacle are known to contain one grain of opium half a dram of the earl of warwicks powder eighteen grains of scammony and so forth without knowing this to the greatest certainty no man can safely prescribe for by this rule it is that all mixed or compound medicines are dosed and prescribed but as the weights are now confounded it is not possible for a physician to adjust the dose of any composition with the least certainty suppose for example an electuary is prescribed in every ounce of which it is intended there should be ten or twenty grains of opium or of any strong purgative or other active medicine of so great energy that it required the greatest accuracy in the dosing this electuary instead of being dispensed by the proper weights is done partly by the avoirdupois and partly by the medical for the pounds ounces and half ounces are of the former but the drachms half drachms and scruples of the latter denomination in our shops so that instead of ten or twenty grains in one ounce or eight drachms here is the like number of grains in seven drachms and six grains of this electuary and as the same disproportion holds in all other compositions the grains not varying in any weights so the physician in this respect too is exposed to the most dangerous deception for his patients must be frequently over dosed in the chief active ingredients in his prescriptions and in the more simple under dosed as every ounce given wants almost one eighth this dire confusion increases with the weights for the medical pound is above two ounces l ghter than the avoirdupois what a doubtful inconsistent medley must such compositions be as are dispensed thus unjustly and irregularly  the same irregularity has likewise confused the medical measures which are gallons pints or pounds and ounces used in the dispensation of certain liquids for though apothecaries may have just ounce measures yet if four ounces of any simple water are prescribed the naggin is most commonly used which wants about half an ounce of the intended just measure this is of the same consequence with the errors in weights as laudanum opium etc which are weighed are often intended to be conveyed in proper doses in certain proportions of juleps etc which are mostly measured  how unlikely then is the best physician to cure his patients when though he should get good medicines which is above twenty to one against him yet they are assuredly not dispensed by the weights or measures he expects or intends so that it is great odds his prescriptions are by this means too frequently abused or misapplied  one thing more though out of place i must here observe my brethren yet to blame in and that is the unprecedented evil custom of keeping several destructive poisons and poisonous drugs not at all used in medicine promiscuous in their shops with sundry other drugs of great and near resemblance in outward aspect which are often handled weighed in the same scales powdered or otherwise prepared in the same mortars or other utensils and upon the same compters where diverse medicines are handled weighed or prepared  insatiable avarice which begot an inordinate desire of extending the profession of pharmacy to grasp at things out of it is way and reach for the sake of lucre first made apothecaries poisoners in any instance and probably the words pharmacus and pharmacum synonymous for apothecary villain or poisoner remedy or poison  sure no man can be insensible of the dire effects of handling or keeping poisons near medicines when it is notorious that the baneful dust of such nay the very effluvia of some contaminate the very ambient air and consequently every thing it touches can it be from any other cause than their too near vicinity to the factitious arsenic boxes that so mild and inoffensive things as burnt hearts horn and cream of tartar have often induced the most dreadful sickness and vomitings and to some proved deadly unless the cream of tartar is adulterated as we have too much reason to doubt with willis riverius and harris pharmacolog antiempiric p   0 and seq  have we not had many melancholy instances of fatal miscarriages in this way from such shops as deal in poisons and if these do not convince the mercenary apothecaries and druggists of their errors and dissuade them from this dangerous practice for the future the force of reason will probably prove fruitless and we may expect relief in this as well as the forementioned grievances from nothing less than a severe rigorous law  no apothecary or druggist in london transgresses in this instance colorselling there is a quite distinct branch of trade and the colormen who profess that alone are as ignorant of medicinal drugs if possible as any of our pretended apothecaries or druggists this gives them more leisure and makes them more careful and solicitous to improve and cultivate that business whence we find the colors oils vernices etc are with them properly treated and so to be had pure and good in their kind which is more than our colormen can say for these or any of their proper commodities  if apothecaries and druggists had not fallen into a most abject state of sloth and stupidity it would not have been necessary to make this second application to parliament for laws to restrain them from this manifest evil at least they might consider that hitherto they have been treated like ancient spartans while their crimes lay hidden but to risk a discovery of all by such transgressions as must be obvious to vulgar eyes is surely the worst policy methinks those that will steal should like the spartan youth let the fox tear the loins and even consume the bowels rather than it should appear who stole him unless he through a sense of penitence discovers  i shall now close this section with one short reflection  if this cursed apostasy this fatal degeneracy which we here complain of and most earnestly desire to be reformed had tended to no worse an evil than the ruin and subversion of one of the most ancient noble and useful arts to say nothing of it is bringing it is eldest twinsister physic which must necessarily rise and fall with it to the ground and was not attended with that dismal train of evil consequences to mankind in general which we daily discover sure the vile miscreants who have brought it to this low pass and rendered it destructive instead of useful to the public must be deemed most highly culpable and the most unworthy members of human society as the destroyers of useful arts are deservedly reckoned more criminal and despicable than the inventors or improvers of them have been accounted beneficent and honorable and since it is apparent that pharmacy is an art which the three first ranks of men among the ancients to wit kings priests and prophets did not disdain to cultivate and occupy as both sacred and profane histories evidently testify an art which is the mother and nurse of many others and which in it is purity contributed to the preservation not only of the living but likewise of the dead bodies of the illustrious in fine an art which under god is one of the principal agents in preserving the noblest machine of the almightys creation from disorder in restoring it when disordered and when by time it is springs and movements are worn out and it is actions thereby cease keeps it from corruption and decay for many ages and since it is now manifest that this excellent art has been effaced perverted and almost quite obliterated by the pernicious abuses corruptions and frauds of apothecaries and druggists surely the subject of it is restoration and reformation well deserves the serious attention of parliament as by the wise interposition of that alone we may hope to see pharmacy rescued from the hands of barbarous assassins revived and once more shine in it is pristine luster and beauty restored to it is original use worth and dignity this is all that now seems wanting to bring the practice of physic to it is primitive certainty which by the forementioned errors and impositions has been long rendered precarious and uncertain  iv order now leads me to the fourth and last thing proposed namely to offer some means to prevent such horrid malpractices for the future etc  i have in the foregoing endeavored with the greatest care and impartiality to state the case of pharmacy to the best of my power as the distemper is most inveterate perplexed and complicate so to prescribe adequate remedies for it requires a consultation but from the unjust opposition and ill usage i met with from the fraternity in my late attempt to reclaim the profession i can neither ask nor expect their assistance or concurrence in this essay therefore as necessity requires it i must alone venture to offer my best thoughts upon the whole though it is an hard task and prescribing in either physic or law not my proper province  before my prescriptions are put in practice let my worthy seniors justly correct and reprove me i shall receive their amendments with pleasure and shall cheerfully assent with every good man that shall rationally treat this luxuriant evil  when the source of a distemper is known the method of cure is least difficult and when the cause of a disorder is removed the effect of course must cease the former i think i have discovered the latter there are various ways of bringing about physicians as far as it may be consistent with reason and the safety of the sick gratify their taste and adapt medicines to their gouts and weakly appetites we know of old that the distempered apothecaries and druggists have the most vitiated palates and very weak squeamish stomachs and that they never yet could relish or digest any remedy given to alter or amend their morbid habit of body though many mild rational attempts were made to restore them to their natural health they would never consent to use the means directed at length wearied with trying all the just methods that must with sensible men have prevailed the college of physicians finally began to treat them as real maniacs required with helleborine and other drastic remedies which indeed had no better effect for like true bethlemites they spurned the medicines and when by force they were poured down their throats they spewed them in their archiators faces this will need no explanation when you recollect the violent opposition both publicly and privately made to the bill depending in the house of commons in the year      to prevent abuses in the practices of physic and pharmacy in like manner in the year      when the act now in force took it is rise in the house of lords though the whole fraternity privately and publicly confessed a reformation greatly wanting and though some of the most eminent among them approved of the means then proposed yet did they jointly unanimously oppose it and published a case which they laid before the house in which they asserted many weak falsehoods and made sundry trivial and ridiculous evasions to prevent farther inquiries being made into their habitual frauds or any laws passing to restrain them from their long accustomed evil practices these instances i think necessary to show how averse these men are and ever have been to reformation i am sorry to say it looks as if they had loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for since no man can fear that truth and integrity can suffer by an open examination or any fair test sure this aversion thereto is another plain proof of the necessity for some effectual law which i humbly conceive may be made very conveniently by adding a few proper clauses to the present act and i submit it to your judgment whether or no it may be expedient to make the following amendments in that bill and whether they may or not answer the good purposes designed    that the college of physicians the better to enable them to execute this act be empowered to increase the number of their fellows the charter of the college of physicians of london is

rewards or gratuities penalties etc  the reasons for these several proposed amendments i hope are evident from the foregoing if not i believe i shall be able to show them when required  although i have been obliged to protract this letter beyond the intended length in order to give a just clear notion of the whole matter and to obviate any difficulties or objections that may arise or be made against it by designing men yet i must beg you will with patience and your usual candor now hear me a few words in mine own behalf  from the unexpected ill treatment i met with in a former weak attempt of this kind a short scheme for preventing frauds and abuses in pharmacy      on which the present act was founded  it is easy to conceive what i may now expect from many of the gentlemen who call themselves apothecaries chemists and druggists tites by which most apothecaries druggists etc registered themselves by the act in the year       though i flatter myself i do in some sort deserve the thanks of every man who would honestly follow any of these occupations my design being only to show who is properly and truly an apothecary or druggist and what the proper office and duty of each together with the necessity of their adhering to their immediate respective professions solely diligently notwithstanding i look for the taunts and outcries of the multitude of ignorant idle selfish and invidious men among us against me in every shape however i shall not think myself obliged to take the least notice of selfinterested backbiters nor their pyratical missionaries who will probably as before go about industriously to blast my credit and asperse and villify my character not even remarks upon the scheme for preventing frauds and abuses in pharmacy etc wrote by a certain quack apothecary anonymous scribbling privateers or hackneypamphleteers  some will perhaps advance with the humorous garth dispens cant iii  that  that juggler which anothers slight will show but teaches how the world his own may know to this indictment i shall according to form plead not guilty and so put myself for trial on my customers and the public  but the grand insinuation in my prejudice which has heretofore been made and will now probably be revived is that regardless of all public good in unreasonable aversion and apposition to my fraternity and by way of advertising and extolling my self by depretiating them i have turned a reformer being in every instance acted more by selfish mercenary views than any other  this i hope to every considerate unprejudiced reader will appear as malicious and as groundless as the rest of their base detraction is false and uncharitable i challenge any man to say i was ever once known to lessen the just merits of any apothecary or druggist whatsoever had i none other motive than common policy i should not attempt to recommend my self to the world by such low mean artifice moreover let it but be considered did i heretofore or do i now offer ought to the detriment of any honest just apothecary chemist or druggist if i have i declare it the effects of mere inadvertency for it is not to be reasonably imagined that i should knowingly do any thing to the prejudice of a profession which i have made my choice by which i have hitherto lived and still purpose to follow as long as the same excellent set of customers which have hitherto dealt with me and most nobly and generously encouraged me are pleased to continue their unmerited favors in the next place i submit it to the judgment of every candid breast what mercenary views i could have had in this undertaking i believe it is evident though i was at great expense and much trouble in writing and printing and in attending the parliament in the year      that instead of gaining any selfish advantages thereby or in any sort soliciting for such i have been a considerable sufferer if it were by none other means than bringing upon me though i hope undeservedly the implacable hatred and enmity of all the apothecaries and druggists and i hope there are some men of quality and distinction still living who can attest that though i was encouraged to sue for a parliamentary reward yet i justly disdained all applications for the like being content with the public good which was likely to accrue from my weak endeavors virtue to a prepared heart never fails of bringing an ample concomitant reward  this i will however confefs that i have some selfish private though not altogether mercenary views in soliciting a reformation of pharmacy and a strict examination of apothecaries and their shops because i would from my self as well as others remove all temptations to the abuse or corruption of my profession and by all ways and means promote the knowledge thereof and give all reasonable encouragement to following it strictly justly and faithfully and i conceive the examination of apothecaries and druggists and the inspection of their shops would be one motive as it must prove as advantageous to every skilful honest apothecary and druggist as it must be disadvantageous to the unskilful and dishonest moreover as the apothecaries and druggists have been very active and i have some reasons to judge there are some of them still unwearied in wounding my character and reputation in the most false malicious and uncharitable manner i hope it is not culpable in me to seek with the redress of a general grievance a public method of confuting those groundless calumnies for in such a trial i flatter my self it will appear that if i should not have had as fair an opportunity of learning pharmacy or as good a capacity as many of those who make a better figure in the profession i have taken more pains in acquiring some knowledge in it in order to make amends for such disadvantages and to supply such a natural defect  i might have taken the usual liberty of dedicators and here claim a sanctuary to my self and this poor performance by prefixing your illustrious name but even this is an artifice i despise for if it has not merit enough to maintain it is ground though clothed in this mean simplicity let it be rejected or fall unregarded  from one of your great humanity refined taste and just notions of morality i fear i may dread some censure for an unbecoming zeal in using through this discourse some terms of reproach expressions which may bespeak an unseemly freedom with my fraternity or such as as may savor somewhat of spleen or invective in this respect perhaps i am to blame but when you consider how difficult it is to treat such vile offenders as i complain of more properly or for a man of any conscience or understanding barely to mention such base degeneracy such abominable perfidious villainy as i have laid before you or even but to think of the like without some heat indignation and abhorrence i hope it will in some measure plead my excuse i have industriously avoided personal reflections except where the offenders were so singularly notorious that they must be known to many by mentioning their crimes only and although i have from many of the society received much unkind ungenerous and i may say uncharitable unchristian treatment and although the dignity of the parliament house in full session could not protect me from their violent rage and merciless insults not only in the offices adjoining but even at the bar of the house of peers yet i most solemnly aver it to you that it is not the persons but their vices i detest and would expose i know there are still among them men of distinguished worth and candor who are ready and willing to suffer a reformation and i am inclined to think that many of those who formerly opposed it were led thereto by inadvertency or the clamors of the multitude if any thing i have said should offend or seem levelled at particular persons i must say with the ingenious garth preface to dispens it is at such only as are presumed to be engaged in dishonorable confederacies against the public and against the dignity of their own profession but if there be none such then these characters are but imaginary and consequently ought to give no body offense   i conclude with the words of the late learned doctor pinac nature rerum britt praef merret on another occasion  acrem me habebunt verissimumque vindicem fraudesque detegam ab artis

honorable station as well as the greatest regard to your person  sir your most faithful and most obedient servant c lucas dublin november         finis
