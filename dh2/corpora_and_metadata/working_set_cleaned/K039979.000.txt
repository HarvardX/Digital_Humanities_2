and swear a thousand things they never intend to perform if the poor woman shows any fear the bullies rave the more and she gives up at once that noblest privilege of the sex making the wisest fools and the stoutest miserable  i have a tongue to be sure that moves quick and by outrunning my wit sometimes may encourage young coxcombs to hope too much but then my heart all the while poor thing knows nothing of the matter and feels no more than my shoeknots  song my eyes may speak pleasure tongue flow without measure yet my heart in my bosom lies still thus the river is flowing the millclapper going but the millers asleep in his mill though lovers surround me with speeches confound me yet my heart in my bosom lies still thus the river is flowing the millclapper going but the millers asleep in his mill the little god eyes me and thinks to surprise me but my heart is awake in my breast thus boys slily creeping would catch a bird sleeping but the linnets awake in his nest where can this tycho have hid himself i am sure he went this way  stay is not that my gentleman creeping along the side of the canal it is either he my other lover faladal or the monkey in his new

livery i dont know how love may have altered me but i know a few weeks ago that i had the best face in this island or my glass is a deceiver of youth if i had not so much tenderness in my composition i would play the devil among these petticoats  but here she comes again and i cannot say boo to her for the life of me   reenter robinette it was the monkey and a very pretty fellow he is now he is well dressed  tycho sighs in the tree la what is that  did not i hear somebody sigh it must be my lover tycho  where are you tycho   tycho in the tree and out of sight here am i  sighing robinette

floridor is as violent in love as you are melancholy you must both mend your manners or camilla and i shall look out for others  no more melancholy tycho if you love and would win me   tycho am i too melancholy for you  sighing robinette too melancholy your face seems preparing for a funeral instead of looking out for a wedding i hate melancholy and all melancholy people a cloudy face betokens a cloudy heart and i will have neither never will i sail to the port of matrimony but with a smiling sea and a clear sky  that is the way to make a good voyage of it   tycho and so it is faith he he he  my face will become smiles as well as a great deal of thinking i have studied myself fnto melancholy but i will burn my books and be as merry as you please to make me he he he   robinette now you dance about my heart and will certainly run away with it   tycho he he he  but where is faladel robinette   robinette perhaps sleeping in some tree for love of me as you did   tycho if he would do the other thing for you i should be very happy  sighing robinette melancholy and jealous too  i declare off  fie for shame a man a young man of person parts address and coversation to be jealous of an old simpering swaggering rhiming gentleman usher who is as dry as a mummy and talks of love has no strength and talks of fighting giants has no wit and thinks to gain me o fie for shame   tycho it is indeed both a sin and a shame  i will know myself better and be afraid of nobody but you robinette i would say more but it is time for me to laugh he he he is it not   robinette now you show yourself to advantage  but look at the lovers there they have had a fresh quarrel i suppose go and end it and take the hot fool home to his father to cool him   tycho i will be melancholy no more  to please

creature and yet i like him  i am a strange creature too and he likes me  he has a hundred faults  hold hold signora robinetta  have not you a little fault or two in the corner of your heart if your neighbors could come at them  o woman woman what an agreeable whimsical fanciful coy coquettish quicksighted nosighted angelical devilish jumble of agreeable matter art thou  song o the freaks of

come   tycho if you have three words the lady will have three thousand which at about two hundred and fifty words a minute will just take up  i know my time and will be with you again   exit tycho camilla pray go to your father i have told you my mind floridor why will you press me to change it dont let an illopinion of your sex mislead you and injure me  i am resolved  you have my heart i confess it  it is ungenerous to urge me farther when you know my greatest distress is to refuse you any thing   floridor my suspicions camilla are the strongest proofs of my passion   camilla can you suspect me of such falsehood as to pretend a passion for you and secretly indulge one for another   floridor nigromant though a wicked is a powerful magician and his frequent visits might alarm a heart less sensible than mine   camilla my pride will not let me answer an accusation that reflects the greatest dishonor both upon you and myself   floridor how can you suffer me to be tortured with jealousy when you might    camilla stop floridor when i might  what scorn a fathers commands given me with his last breath and blessing   floridor with his last breath and blessing   camilla upon his death bed he enjoined me with tears in his eyes not to give my hand but to him who could give me proofs of what this enchanted laurel would unfold   floridor and what are they  i conjure you tell me   camilla see and behold  the laurel unfolds and discovers the words valor constancy and honor in letters of gold you have proved your love to me by its unfolding at your request  now read what is more expected from you   floridor reading valor constancy and honor can the son of bonoro and your lover be suspected   camilla i must not hear you floridor can you love me and refuse me these proofs  marriage my father added was too great a stake to venture upon common security if your passion is a true one you will convince me by your obedience if it is a common one i am too proud to accept it and too grateful to disobey my father  song woman should be wisely kind nor give her passion scope just reveal her inclination never wed without probation nor in the lovers mind blight the sweet blossom hope youth and beauty kindle love sighs and vows will fan the fire sighs and vows may traitors prove sorrow then succeeds desire honor faith and wellearnd fame feed the sacred lasting flame  floridor you shall have the proofs from me you desire and in return i will exact but one from you   camilla if in my power you shall command it   floridor never see that cursed magician nigromant more

have valor to protect us  it is you floridor must deliver me from him valor constancy and honor may subdue all evil spirits and it is by them alone you can only reach the summit of your wishes   floridor then i will prepare for the trial  song it is beauty commands me my heart must obey it is honor that calls me and fame leads the way from nhe soft silken fetters of pleasure i fly with my love i must live or with honor will die i wake from my trance bring the sword shield and lance my name shall be famous in story now danger has charms for love sounds to arms and love is my passion and glory going camilla stay floridor i have something yet to do   exit camilla floridor amazed what can this mean  what now trial for a heart so devoted to the object of its passion that every trifling circumstance hurries the spirits to it as if alarmed by approaching danger   reenter camilla with a wreath of flowers song o take this wreath my hand has wove the pledge and emblem of my love these flowers will keep their brightest hue whilst you are constant kind and true but should you false to love and me wish from my fondness to be free foreboding that my fate is nigh each grateful flower
