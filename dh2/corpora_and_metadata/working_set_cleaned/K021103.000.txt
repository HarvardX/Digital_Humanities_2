bellum medicinale or the present state of doctors and apothecaries in london  being remarks upon a letter from a merchantdispensary physician to himself and his answer  in a letter from a chemist in the city to a country physician with the physicians answer  wherein the ancient and most effectual way of practice is proposed as the best means to put an end to the contest  siste gradum and specta non hic ludicra petuntur praemia sed vestri loculi de sanguine certant postica dum penetrat syrinx crepitantibus illinc ventis lucelli non malus odor ait london  printed for m fabian at mercerschappel in cheapside and sold by a baldwin in warwick lane   0   chap i sir having no other news i am tempted to send you with some remarks upon it a discourse that lately came to my hands subscribed from a merchant in london to a dispensary physician with the physicians answer the subject of the discourse being the present state of physic and surgery at my entrance upon it i could not judge the author less than a drugster as knowing no other merchants so nearly concerned with physic but reading on and finding him complain of the luxuriant use of medicines it was natural to conclude he had been some great sufferer but coming at length to the physicians answer and finding that so like the product of one and the same ingeny i was tempted to think the merchant broke and lately turned physician or the physician wanting business to have newly took up the trade of a merchant but i had no sooner perused the whole treatise than i found out the mystery and bottom of the business to be no less than a war proclaimed by one company of merchants against another for interloping or to be plain the apothecaries having been trading in that part which the physicians count their proper province the doctors as an act of hostility retaliate and are turned apothecaries  what may be the consequence of this breach of the peace time must manifest but i hope sir you who are known to be a disinterested person and as such a more proper and fit judge of the grounds and management of the war may insinuate something that may be a more proper medium to compose the difference or at least more advantageous to the people who must bear the charge of the war than any thing has been said or is likely to be done by either party  here are forty six doctorapothecaries against a thousand apothecarydoctors which is great odds but the apothecaries say it is the doctors fear that multiplies them beyond the true number be it so the doctors show their valor the more since they are resolved to engage and i dont know but if they can bring in the east india companies as auxiliaries as they seem to threaten by insinuating the merchants concern and acquaintance with their affairs they will be capable to ruin more than  000 clisterpipe men horse and foot the doctors themselves being all    commissionofficers tho the apothecaries say one half of them are as unfit for their profession as other folks it is only the virtue of l and m makes them the same doctors in the common cause and able to say nos poma  well the merchantphysician or doctorapothecary which he pleases exhibits diverse articles against the apothecarydoctors as a just cause of taking up arms having received them at an eveningmuster at the college after orders given concerning a large confluence of sick and maimed some merchants no doubt  in the preface to the discourse he asserts   first that the apothecaries have often reproached the physicians that the poor were left to their care and that they neglected the pharmaceutick part or preparation of remedies now lodged in themselves but the doctor is convinced that the dispensary is the greatest relief to the poor who have the best advice and best physic at very small expense the physicians are often considering the drugs carefully viewing the common preparations improving them and adding others which they think or judge more useful  remark it must be confessed that the physicians have not been reproached without cause they have not hitherto been used to give advice to large confluences of sick persons gratis having no remedies to sell to them that had no fees to give the poor have been forced to go to them that had or wholly to let nature alone to struggle with its diseases nor have the physicians only neglected but been ignorant of the pharmaceutick part neither can the apothecaries any more than the physicians pretend themselves complete herein being generally alike ignorant of the chief and most artful part pyrotechny leaving its most effectual preparations to the care of those whose care is only how they may make them not most adapted to the cure of diseases but to their best advantage professing no skill in diseases or the virtues of what they make in order to remove them  but the dispensary tho it be an acknowledgment of the faults the physicians have been reproached with is not the greatest relief to the poor nor have we more than their own words to assure us that they will yea or can afford the best advice and the best medicines cheaper than other physicians  that they can give the best advice is but their own immodest boast but that they are so soon become the best skilled in pharmaceuticks tho with the assistance of a few poor apothecaries amongst them we know it is very unlikely if not impossible or that they can consider the drugs much farther than to know them by sight since they have but lately dealt that way nor are they much more likely to improve or add to the common preparations but   secondly he says the citizens often complain to the physicians of the very chargeable bills of the apothecaries and declare their jealousy of a combination in multiplying medicines and doses needlessly but the dispensary relieves the first by selling almost at the first cost or    in  0 cheaper than the apothecaries and the dispensary physicians being under no engagements with the apothecaries cure with one or few prescriptions in less difficult cases and with no more than necessary in the more dangerous avoiding all medicines acting on nature with more or less violence the more hazardous extreme the charge under  0 or  0 s in a fever or the smallpox instead of so many pounds many require not more than three or four shillings worth which by subdividing into boles pouders and draughts come in a bill to four or five pounds  remark the apothecaries bills no doubt have been larger or smaller according to the proportion of their consciences it cannot fairly be supposed they have been all alike culpable but it is no wonder the people have complained of the dearness of the wares where the brokers have been so well paid for advising to the bargain two charges must needs look great where one had been enough and advice and medicines too might have been afforded at the charge of either a combination between doctors and apothecaries where there was a mutual dependence was but natural manus manum fricat but now it is past doubt since the dispensary physicians declare they are at present under no engagements to the apothecaries  but the dispensary physicians say they are now resolved to be honest and sell their remedies almost at the first cost almost and hard by etc but if they sell so cheap and use but few prescriptions i doubt they will not be oversparing in their visits or lower their fees which may make amends tho they give their physic unvalued but how can we be assured that they will or rather that they can cure with one few or no more than are necessary prescriptions i do not know unless they first demonstrate by their practice that their skill is greater than other physicians which is yet to be done but they discover their discretion more than their skill in avoiding the more active medicines it is dangerous meddling with edgtools by those that have not been used to handle them a bone knife is fit for children that they may not cut one another but if physicians should venture to use more active remedies distempers might terminate one way or other too soon to require many visits and consequently fewer fees would be gotten but gentlemen may have the small pox or fever cured for ten or twenty shillings which we must understand in medicines and that sometimes is very dear when as these diseaes commonly are cured by nature without assistance many diseases they say for three or four shillings but what these diseases are it were good also to know whether toothache or corns and what fees are required besides and whether the dispensary men will trust but   thirdly says he the apothecaries have kept the doctors many years under the dread of their power who they say command in all families and can bring in and turn out whom they please they govern as a tyrant his subjects making them obedient by grievous taxes so that they dare not consult a physician unless at the last extremity physicians would govern their patients by their own reason the patients have the liberty of cheap physic and of consulting at a beginning of a distemper secure from expense which shall surprise the physicians would prevent their own ruin chiefly from their best success  this has hitherto been the case of the faculty if they conquered a distemper the remedy tho not the manner of using it becomes the apothecaries nostrum and the doctor is left to invent more the dispensary complies with the two proposals of the apothecaries removes the peoples complaint and jealousy of a cheat put on them by all physicians and gives the license to him to use his own method and prescripts to his patients advantage and his own  the apothecary cannot complain he is injured for as he seizes on the advising part as a dependency he would annex to the shoptrade the other from the example brings them both together the better to serve the public if the apothecary proves an ambodexter feels the pulse with one hand and makes medicines with the other why may not the college please the people with the same dexterity unless which is reasonable in the case of life and health the apothecaries will wholly practice the judicial part and leave the ministerial of making medicines to the physician  remark it is a shame for physicians to confess that the apothecaries have kept the doctors many years under the fear of their power or that they should command in all families indeed it seems natural for the people to ask the apothecary who is the most skilful physician he being more capable to judge than the people and on this account they have had a capacity to recommend such as they thought would prescribe best either for the patients or the apothecaries disease which soever lay with most pain on his mind but how they should make them obedient by taxing hard i do not see unless one evil being less than two they choose to submit themselves wholly to the apothecarys care if not fearing the fees more than the bill yet being sure both would be much heavier so that only extremity or experience of the apothecarys insufficiency could make them see other counsel  it were certainly well if physicians could govern the patients by reason and that of their own stock as well as give em medicines of their own preparing without putting em in fear of large fees or dear physic then no doubt they would consult em sooner  and it were very well if physicians would not only prevent their own ruin but their patients also by their good success and that he that has the best success might have most business which can hardly be whilst physicians are dpendants  how apothecaries should get any certain nostrums from physicians prescripts i dont easily see since they have been so numerous and compounded in almost every case that the physician himself must needs be ignorant what did the cure but if the apothecary was so sagacious as to see what wrought the effect how could he be so dull as not to learn the manner of using it  whether the dispensary will remove the peoples complaints and jealousy does not yet appear or whether the dispensary doctors and their apothecarys will be less combined and more honest than others or more for either the physicians or patients advantage  but if the apothecary cannot complain that he is injured by the dispensary which only follows his example in bringing the advising and shoptrade together to the better service of the public certainly the dispensary physician can with as little reason complain of the apothecary for setting him the good example in better serving the public if the apothecary was the first ambodexter that the doctor thought worthy to imitate why should he be so angry at the master that gave him so fair a copy and if it be so reasonable in cases of life and death to practice only the judicial part why may not the practicing apothecary leave the making of medicines only to his man whom he himself has instructed as well as the dispensaryphysician to his apothecary at the college who perhaps must instruct his masters  but the dispensary adds he has been impeached with the barbarous design of destroying the apothecarys company but they scorn the imputation and declare the greatest esteem of those of the society who like the gentleman near the college moribus antiquis are as eminent for their care in preparing the best medicines as for their integrity and modesty in not invading the profession or abusing and destroying the people  remark if the dispensarys multiply and the people believe they are the only sure relief to the sick the apothecarys must fall unless those few who like the gentleman near the college antiqua ignorantia are the more to be trusted for good medicines because they dare not pretend to understand the use of them  but says he the apothecarys destroy themselves by their numbers multiplying from  000 to as many more in eight years without any prospect of checking the superfluous increase they must therefore accuse their own unhappy conduct who are insensible of its fatal consequences  remark if the apothecaries are so likely to be destroyed suis copiis what need of so much noise at them let them go quietly down but unless they multiply more than other men i dont see how their number can destroy them any more than the multiplying of any state or kingdom can destroy it but it is not barely the multiplying or destruction of the apothecarys that troubles the dispensary so much as what follows  that they avow with assurance that they have or will take all the practice of physic into their own hands reserving only   or   great men to take on themselves the odium of the deaths of their patients  the surgeons fare not better than the faculty they are reserved for the difficult cases robbed of the more common by which they only can acquire skill and dexterity for the more important  the poor are undone in every sickness etc  the dispensary pretends to preserve those who are more numerous than the apothecarys and it will be the alma matter to the physicians from the two universitys who will be capable to exercise the learning they have acquired there  remark this is the grand fault of the apothecaries that they undertake to practice let them have been as great knaves as they would if they had never meddled in any thing that had been to the dishonor or rather and more especially to the disadvantage of the doctors for now plurimus auro venit honos they might have ruined themselves without pity i do not question and those men that are content to take on them the odium of the deaths of the slain amongst them or to excuse their own faults by the apothecaries mistakes have the honor of being well paid no doubt tho the surgeons lose some of the small jobs by the apothecarys officiousness they do not so much complain but they fit them as well as the dispensary commonly making their own medicines and if they lose the ordinary cases yet they arc the more used to the difficult but  the poor suffer most truly in every disease corporeal or crumenal whether poor doctors apothecarys surgeons or people and poor we are first to be cared for whatever the pretense be of the dispensarys being the alma matter where the physicians from the two universities may exercise their learning with the pestle and beat out great matters in pharmacy  but the other objection of the unobserving people whose memory may not serve em well is that the apothecarys sell as cheap it is granted if they will but do they not by their own and the doctors artifices in dividing sell an electuary of    d in boles for    half crowns etc we will not quarrel at their    pence in the shilling profit but would only prevent the return of it  0 tmes in    hours when the patients advantage the least part of the design  remark the people dont remember we doubt that the doctors told them they sell cheaper than the apothecarys it is granted they may if they will but by the conjoint artifices of the doctors yet their confederates in dividing they enhance the price of an electuary from    pence to    shillings but they could never have done it if they had not sound their advantage by the doctors frequent repetaturs tho i hardly believe every half hour tertia vel quarta quaque hora being commonly the most  but the last and vilest objection is that the subscribers to the dispensary are not as eminent as the physicians the apothecaries favorites it is owned they can make famous or infamous by a few cabals and visits but is there any part of physic even poetry which these gentlemen cannot pretend to as well as the other who distrust their own merit by courting their favor putting themselves in their service and plying them as porters a shop of the largest business  remark the eminence of physicians now adays does not indeed result from real worth or accomplishment but may arise from the report of men that talk even like the apothecaries but the dispensary and the other physicians i believe are indifferently the same some wise and some otherwise but that poetry should be counted a part of physic and with a even as if it were the culmen artis would have been a strange fancy till of late i think mr colebatch and his antagonist however their acids and alkalies stood affected agreed in this that tho poetry is a very pretty accomplishment yet a poet and a physician are vastly different letter to a gentleman concerning alkaly and acid  but it must be acknowledged that to get business is a valuable part of physic and to have written a poem has not long since for some time commended some late doctors more than all their cures and other fine qualifications  but it was not till after a long discourse he says further that our doctor or merchant could penetrate into the more abstruse and secret design of the dispensary  remark now comes the mystery which he was not being but a pupil to be presently let into or capable of apprehending but twas owned at last by those the most proper judges that the people in the more common ilnesses recover easily by the strength of nature or one or two proper directions in these a great but useless expense must pay the attendance of the apothecary who has no gratuity given him but must satisfy himself by the number of things he can prevail on the sick to take  in other diseases with danger when nature is weak or raging and has only one crisis of its own choosing chiefly by which it can be saved many hot or cooling doses unhappily given or diverting the crisis by tampering brings certain destruction by this unfortunate but in vogue management twas asserted that the far greater numbers are killed by physic who would undisturbed have surely recovered without any  the dispensary practice will soon demonstrate that the remedy to this pernicious practice can be only had from it self secure from this inhumane art of growing rich etc    remark there are several things very observable in this secret and absiruse design    that in usual and common diseases people would recover by the strength of nature   that even in these diseases something must be done or there is nothing to be got   that he that takes no fees cannot be well paid for looking on the patient unless he can persuade him to take a great deal of physic   in diseases that are dangerous when nature is weak or raging it can be saved only by one crisis   that many doses of physic given whether hot or cold will divert the crisis and bring certain destruction   that great numbers are killed by physic which would have recovered without any   that the remedy of this pernicious practice can be had only from the dispensary in these particulars we have more couched than at first one would be readily aware of and the oracle that gave this abstruse account has showed an uncommon sagacity which will never permit me to think there are not men of great parts in the dispensary the grand design of these sophi is to get those patients that will recover by the strength of nature or whose diseases will terminate by a crisis without physic that is all the common and most numerous disorders with the acute diseases which is certainly the most advantageous practice and doing nothing but a small matter for a color of merit that people may not think they give fees for nothing will not quickly expend the drugs and medicines in the repository but a small stock will carry on the shoptrade tho they should sell as cheap as they pretend but this is not all there is commonly more credit got by curing those diseases that need no cure or will terminate soon by the efforts of nature for when the patient is well the disease was this or that grievous malady one or two proper directions that is what will do neither good nor hurt must be given to satisfy the patients and their friends or else the fees will hardly satisfy the doctor tho it is the opinion of one of the company that a physician in many cases especially in the small pox deserves his fees better for directing nothing than for doing so see dialogue between alkaly and acid page    but i cannot conceive why the dispensary practice of doing nothing should be the only remedy for these diseases and why an apothecary or other physician may not cure by the same method but the people being afraid of fees in small or common diseases are apt to run to apothecaries so the doctors lose the most easy speedy and advantageous business but apothecaries being as willing to grow rich as any make them pay dear for a multitude of unnecessary and pernicious medicines and so the people suffer wherever they go  incidit in scyllam qui vult vitare charybdim unless the blessing of poverty prevent but they may expect says he this will be debated between the physicians of the apothecaries party and the peoples the one side relying on the maxim si populus vult decipi decipiatur the other on the magna charta of all communities salus populi suprema lex  remark if the college of physicians are divided we may expect the house cannot stand but i think it is no just censure that the physicians that are not of the dispensary are of the apothecaries party in opposition to the good of the people for i know some that have less to do with the apothecaries than the dispensary who are only become apothecaries themselves or confederate with some apothecaries of their own nor does it appear that the welfare of the people and not their own advantage is the only thing they aim at or is more sought by them than by diverse others  when it shall become sensible adds he how the public is imposed on in the expense in sickness and in life it self the laws which now punish offenders etc will at last interpose the cure of more latent and enormous crimes the faculty will have the protection it demands after the performance of the stipulated conditions the dispensary will have the public regard or observe its enemies punished with fines more than the  00 marks or the other more severe the loss of life from medicines in the exorbitant quantities as destructive as poison  remark here the dispensary is very uppish and threatens its enemies with fines and death which i confess will be a greater argument against their enemies than any they have yet given  but what they mean by loss of life from medicines in exorbitant quantities as destructive as poison i do not know unless they design to get an act that whoever will not regard the dispensary shall be poisoned by large doses of physic but the legislators ought to be very well satisfied in the stipulated conditions that they be not only published but that they be performed ere they make laws against either the people or all other physicians  chap ii but we come now to the merchants letter where first he informs us that he had a fever which was cured by the dispensary method of giving but sew medicines and those seldom given  remark this i confess is a good method if the medicines are good but there may certainly be a fault as well in giving too little as too much and i believe many medicines prove ineffectual on this very account and the right method does not lie in giving little or much but just enough which a man may judge of without being of the dispensary but this caution gave him greater confidence in the art with the assurance he had of the medicines being faithfully prepared and dispensed at the college  remark what assurance the merchant was capable of receiving that the medicines are faithfully prepared and dispensed at the college i know not but i do not see what the people can have to satisfy them more than their words which other apothecaries also are ready to give tho it be but a small proof  but when the doctor allowed him to sit up and receive his friends they gave him an account says he of the new revolution in physic and generous design of the dispensary which they were extremely satisfied with they told him this contest between the honest physicians of the dispensary thus it seems they are distinguished tho the word has lately lost its value and the apothecaries supported by their confederates the anticollege physicians was as much the common discourse as the difference between the two companies or the great factions which divide the nation but  twas not easy for them to find out the reason and pretense of this controversy but they who had been advised by the dispensary and used their medicines could more easily discover the true causes of the separation than the citizens who yet lie under great errors and prejudices in this affair and the case according to the opinion of the whole company is according to these following particulars  remark this whole company of visitants no doubt were all merchants concerned and advised by the dispensary tho some sort of patients and not ignorant citizens or else they would not have had so great satisfaction in the generosity of the dispensary design and have seen so much into the causes of their quarrel with other physicians and apothecaries but i never heard so much i confess of their factions as of those that divide the nation or that the dispensary men are the only honest physicians and tho they assume to themselves the name of honest in opposition and distinction from all other doctors and apothecaries yet i think they cannot be very proud of it since the word honest has lately lost its value as they confess and so their honesty is of no great account  but that the apothecaries are supported by the anticollege physicians i believe is a slip of the pen it should have been antidispensary physicians for none use apothecaries so much as those of the college  but let us hear the particulars  the honest physician is obliged by the trust reposed in him by the patient and his interest in the success to take care that the medicines are effectual and faithfully dispensed if the instruments are not good the effect of the advice is lost by a mistake in weight or measure the life of the patient is destroyed  remark what the merchant says here is certainly very true but the dispensary physician cannot with any modesty assert himself the only honest physician if the word be took in its usual sense and others are as much obliged in conscience and interest as he and i have known an honest apothecary faithfully dispense an effectual medicine according to the reputed honest doctors prescript to the destruction of the patient who had he known the case would never have done according to the doctors order nor have let the deadly mistake in the dose which was merely the doctors have its effect  but the apothecary adds he neglects his duty to the physician and the sick is rarely in his shop prepares few medicines but buys them under great uncertainties trusts raw apprentices to select the ingredients and measure the proportion in the prescript  remark this cannot justly be said of the apothecaries in general some of them are as honest as any in the dispensary no doubt and not guilty of these crimes but  the people he says further who are not acquainted with the dispensary of two evils choose the least as they think by using the apothecaries believe they save the doctors fees tho the medicines brought in in little parcels etc rise to a greater sum   in   in most cases than both advice and physic in most diseases  remark this i believe is too often true but ought not to be a universal charge and it has been too often found that the doctor has taken more for fees than was necessary for physic and advice too but says he  the associate part of the college seeling the apothecarys power in families readily come in or are forced to serve under em on condition they forward the increase of the bill and raise their ability to advise to an equal pitch with their own by both which the apothecaries interest is more confirmed and improved  remark this is a very great scandal to the greatest part of the college none being excepted but the dispensary but they have one commendation these others want viz that they raise the ability of the apothecarys to advise equal with their own which shows they are not so selfish as others and if the apothecary be as able to advise i see no reason why he should not and by this the peoples interest will be confirmed and improved as well as the apothecaries  but he continues the design is therefore to revive the former practice of physic particularly that of lower and sydenham who had greater success with fewer remedies than now are forced upon the people or rather to expose the method the physicians and apothecaries use to themselves and friends of avoiding carefully the excess by which innocent things become destructive  remark the practice of lower and sydenham cannot well be called the former practice nor is the methed of practice so much altered since their time nor could i ever hear of their extraordinary success above other physicians i believe they used but few medicines for to do them justice they knew not many having none of the profoundest skill in pharmacy but having great names perhaps in some cases great expectations might alter the patients with a very small matter beside but if the design be to expose the method physicians and apothecaries use to themselves and friends of carefully avoiding the excess etc it is a commendation and they will be willing to be exposed whether dispensary doctors apothecaries or others he adds  but the dispensary designs to convince the people by their experience that the most useful and effectual remedies are of no great price  remark but then it must be taken for granted that they have the most useful and effectual remedies which we know they have not tho they offer to sale their arcanas in their bill lately dispersed nor will i grant that the most useful and effectual remedies are of small value or ought to be sold for a mean price unless the fee makes amends  he goes on saying the public will soon be sensible that the expense in almost all diseases per diem will be of one two or three shillings instead of so many pounds etc and that their distempers will sooner yield to a few well prepared collegemedicines than to the decayed vicious and adulterate of the shops and the physicians reward and remedies too come far short of the total of a long bill  remark it is a hard matter to say what the daily expense of all diseases will be but it is the usual method of traders to pretend to undersell one another to get custom but they propose advantage by it and we must understand this rate is to the poor but how any will be assured diseases will yield to collegemedicines sooner than to others or that they will be well prepared i know not or how they can say shopmedicines are decayed vicious and adulterate yet those in the collegeshops will never be so  but says he the dispensary cannot fail of universal approbation when the people reflect that they have in many cases used the method they recommend preparing in their houses the white decoction infusions of rubarb and senna etc or using the common cordial waters spirits and tinctures bought of the druggist chemist or wholesale shops  remark the dispensary or merchant for em now assures it self and that infallibly of a universal approbation when once the people reflect that they have not only imitated the apothecaries keeping shops and selling medicines but used even the peoples method which must needs be good in preparing the white decoction infusion of senna grand remedies and wisely prepared no doubt but cordial waters spirits and tinctures bought of the druggist chemist or wholesale shops they cry down in the apothecary but imitate in the people  but when its use he says further shall become more public their generous charity and regard to mankind will be loudly applauded and the advantages from it to this city allowed to be greater than all the royal munificent hospitals in europe  remark ingens gloria calcar habet i see but charity and philanthropy usually begin at home and where it appears it ought to be applauded  that the dispensary may possibly be of more advantage to the city than all the hospitals in europe except its own i readily believe but whether it will be any to it or themselves is yet doubtful  this is the short view says he i could take of the present and future state of physic obvious to every one that will confider his own interest or not be very unwilling to be informed but because it is an affair of the greatest concern of our life your friends oblige me to consult you and report to em your opinion of the grievous distemper and the most probable methods of curing it with an unanimous resolution to support and encourage a design by which all conditions of men are equally obliged  remark this is the view which that merchant and his friends could take but how this present and future state of physic is so obvious and in relation to the dispensary an affair of the greatest importance i dont see well but the merchant is obliged to consult the physician with a promise of the unanimous resolution of the merchants to support and encourage the design but i am afraid since the merchants have been lately found guilty and punished for promoting designs they will not be so free or able for the future to oblige all conditions of men  but we come to the dismal account which the merchant received from the physician of the barbarous treatment of the sick so far as his memory would serve him  that we are imposed on more than any other nation in all the arts that relate to life and health  remark we are like to be imposed on still if some other method be not established than that the dispensary proposes being no way assured we shall not be imposed on by them  that the common and most useful remedies are put upon the people at a rate in most fifty times in many one hundred times more than their intrinsic value  remark the common remedies are not the most useful nor are the most useful put upon the people but the intrinsic value of the most useful remedies are not known to the dispensary they being ignorant of them  that the exorbitant expense ruins the poor and deters them and the rich from a just care of their health to avoid oppressive treatment subsequent diseases  remark exorbitant expense if the poor can expend it will ruin em no doubt but i should think the fear of it should not deter em or the rich from but fright em to a just care of their health yet if the just care of health be to fee a doctor or go to an apothecary i am apt to think either of them will be somewhat chargeable  to hide these exactions from the people the apothecaries allow none to practice with em but who betray their profession countenance a vast quantity of physic destructive and support exorbitant rates in the bills physicians are brought into all families by them and writing well is the language for writing very long prescriptions  remark that some of the apothecaries are guilty of some of these practices i dont question but i think they charge too general indeed i have heard the term of writing well thus interpreted and have heard that   or   apothecaries have engaged with a young physician to cry him upon condition he would thus write well but such things ought to be discovered who and when and punished  the esteem of the profession is sunk by the scandal of all the deaths in the town thrown on physicians who are rarely consulted but when the case is made desperate by the apothecaries and the patient takes the prognostic of death from the change of advice and is deprived of that assurance which is the greatest support in sickness  remark the esteem of those that profess to save lives must needs sink where they are thought to do nothing or to kill and wherever the work lies between two one will blame the other i have heard the apothecary say such a one died secundum artem and the dr is not always wanting to blame or at least insinuate a fault in the apothecary but the reason why persons so rarely consult the physicians is their own fault because they will not proportion their fees to the capacities of the patients or more commonly advise freely fox a patient to be afrighted with death in some cases is very prejudicial in some beneficial a well grounded assurance much promotes some cures and the confidence of an ignorant physician many times does more than his prescripts or even than those of the more knowing  that the study of art is neglected because the diseases are by ill treatment forced into unnatural symptoms and differ from all those your authors treat of there are in the books of physic no cases managed by an apothecary by almost one common random method your writers have been careful in this to conceal the infamy of the people and your profession  remark a true account of cases duly managed no doubt is of great use and benefit to students in physic but i believe there are but few such authors  but he that cannot judge of a disease by what he sees in the patient has not made any great proficiency in natural knowledge and it is a shame that physicians should confess the study of art is neglected tho there were no books it was at first practiced without any such helps but it had been well if the late writers had been careful to discover the ill practice of those people of the profession tho to their infamy that we might know what would not succeed and what rocks and shelves to avoid and not choose to make up their observations only with cases more creditable  but he goes on it is now ten years since a committee of the honest part of the college exposed these grievances to the lord mayor and court of aldermen and had convinced em of the necessity of removing the oppression the public had long felt and it was concluded the physicians should rate the price of medicines in their prescriptions this was haughtily rejected by the company at a meeting in their hall some months after a small number of the younger apothecaries offering to comply were compelled with threats to retract their promises the committee of the aldermen and commons the apothecaries flying from that as necessary as reasonable proposal desired that the college would provide a repository of medicines which will and may have and may justly claim afr twenty thousand bills made up there their regard and protection  remark by the honest part of the college we must understand the    dispensary doctorapothecaries but how the rest will take it to be without distinction counted the dishonest part of the college we may easily judge it is now no new thing for some physicians to cry down all others even in their morals that they themselves may be better thought on but how even that honest part of the college could honestly pretend to rate the medicines they should have prescribed i dont know when they neither know the cost nor art of the preparations besides unless it were the honest part of the college they might oblige the apothecaries as well in rating as in prescribing now the apothecarys might well reject this proposal that a parcel of men that did not understand trade being not then turned merchants should rate their goods and certainly those that were willing to comply must be very young to suppose this proposal either reasonable necessary or possible but the dispensary doctors having so very much business need not be discontented or so earnestly crave protection  0000 bills one with another might well arise to  000 l and the fees make more than that sum neat profit which would protect them sufficiently from the attacks of  000 clisterpipe men  but he says further the laws of the last age saw and provided against these vile abuses but our laws are subject to the same diseases as our selves are fallen into the infirmity of old age and to be regardless of others concerns  remark if the laws are diseased twill be well if the dispensary can prepare powerful remedies to cure them but old age i doubt will be beyond their cure even in themselves tho they regard only their own concerns  you allowed adds he the faculty could not want the art of relieving it self but one party turns its force against another like a vicious composition of ingredients of opposite qualities has no virtue to subdue the epidemick malignity  remark i grant the faculty has always studied the art of relieving it self and so have the company and because these have been most expert in it the faculty complains but the faculty indeed is a vicious composition whose malignity lies upon the people it was never well compounded even the dispensary ingredients are not without vice nor will the fermentation among them amend i doubt but rather exalt the malignity or the people ever be free from vile abuses till there be a new and better prescript he further adds  the great increase of apothecaries is evidently the cause of all the present grievances to the profession of physic to themselves and the people they are become  000 ten to one physician the regulated citys abroad allow no more than can make up the physicians directions one to ten the consequence of so great a number cannot be avoided  00 cannot possibly keep good medicines in their shops most of the compositions and most of the simples often moved in little quantities are subject to evaporate their most active parts to corrupt and become vapid and sour or rotten and stinking who will believe the simple waters tinctures spirits pouders of volatile parts syrups electuaries etc can wait and keep well till they have their turn to be used when the shops are as numerous as the sick they must be thrown away and supplied anew if the customer cannot be imposed upon but that will be sooner than a new preparation  remark it now appears that it is the number of apothecarys that most grieves the honest professors of physic and their own grief is first felt the apothecaries being a great many get a great deal of the easiest business which the profession would have otherwise had but if they are ten to one physician the college are not all physicians and if they were but one to ten i believe they could not make up the physicians prescriptions which are commonly large enough but the number of apothecaries is not the chief cause that they cannot keep good remedies but that the learned doctors have given them such a large and illcompild farrago of medicines that they will not keep good they must have a great catalogue of simple waters which signify nothing but to mix things as a vehicle many of which can be made but once a year and will not keep a month without being corrupted when dr batess hydropeg or common spring or distilled water is as good likewise of syrups many of which are also made but once a year and are apt to ferment grow four or be filled with flies and which is worse are good for nothing but to clog the stomach of sick people the same may be said of the numerous classes of conserves and electuaries made up with sugar and honey pouders are of very different natures some incorruptible others soon spoiled and others never good but tinctures and spirits may be kept long enough unchangeable tho ever so volatile and if they lose any thing of strength a little larger dose will do  but a dispensatory might easily be made of fewer and more effectual remedies not easily corruptible were physicians or apothecaries well skilled in the materia medica and pharmacy but until they are were there ever so few apothecaries the sick will be abused while they are obliged to keep foolish things that one doctor in  0 or a  00 or in the whole town perhaps has a fancy to use now and then  but the numbers of the apothecaries says he like hawkers are always visiting the families and recommend the taking trade in easiest cases in others they quicken the use of boles and draughts they are rarely seen in their business of the shop the prescript of the doctor and apothecary himself is left to be made up by the raw heedless boy that has not the discretion of his master whose utmost care is required when the patients life is lost by almost every mistake  the vomitive corrosive chemical liquors or pouders may be taken instead of the cordials of the same colors can the boy bring his mind to a steadiness to number his drops of laudanum or violent acids to weigh half a grain of opium elaterium or judge the patient must die by the apozem boiled after this or that decoction or that a copper vessel shall make the preparation poisonous  remmark the number of apothecaries will not much alter the case if the numbers of doctors and other people increased alike but if they would hauk only for the doctors we should not have the numbers complained of and if they were sewer they would trust as much to boys or some other servants having more business but being many and the business divided among them they may the better attend themselves many faults are no doubt committed by boys in mistaking things and their doses and sometimes in not being able to read or understand the doctors bad hand or latin or correct his mistakes as to the dose or things prescribed together or the nature of the medicine which some masters have done ere now and thereby saved the life of the patient of which instances might be given but says he  the honest apothecaries also complain and lament the difficulties which by the exorbitant numbers are brought on the people and themselves that their medicines cannot be vented while good and fit for use  remark it seems there are some honest apothecaries then even in the opinion of the dispensarydoctors and no doubt they are alike honest to themselves and wish there were fewer of the company that they might have better trade and if they were as factious as the college they might destroy one another and the great ones devour the little ones the spoiling of their medicines is from their extravagant numbers and undurable qualities as before said not the number of their makers  he adds that they and their servants are basely used as porters to fetch and carry boles and glasses and have not leisure in their shops to prepare and compound any thing but buy abroad  remark they are porters to the doctors then and why not to the honestest who ought to send their bills to them to encourage their honesty and not take the trade out of their hands by setting up shops of their own but if they have not leisure for all their business it is a sign they have too much trade but further they are forced to advise against their conscience commanded by the nurses and people to own themselves as skilful as other apothecaries who undertake any thing that they may not forfeit their business  remark these honest apothecaries it seems are the least skilful or else it could not go against their consciences to own themselves as wise as others but it is pity they should be so forced into business by their customers commands the honest doctors would willingly take it off their honest hands a gain  that to live themselves they must endanger the life of their customer give more than they would use themselves in the same case they reflect with horror at first that they violate the laws of their country subject to fines adjudged felons if they mistake the virtue or dose of the medicines obliged to set exorbitant prices to the poor and servants that the wealthy may not discern the difference they are in the sad condition of the french king in the absurd description in king arthur who was wont to make his meals on the raw limbs of his poor subjects  remark this is a sad character of the honest apothecarys that they are such sinners against their own consciences i cannot understand how they came to be in so much favor with the dispensary as to be still termed honest unless it be for fetching or carrying or for their ignorance whereby it is supposed they will be capable of doing their duty or rather the doctors less hurt in practice or is it likenesssake but to add to their crimes they wantonly devour the people alive which if it be true it is a sign their consciences are not much concerned and what are the rest if the honest are so bad yet i can hardly believe any ever made this confession but further they say if we may believe the merchant  that the odd confusion of their business perplexes them to be one hour wiping the blistered part and clapping on melilot then giving a clyster next considering what to advise in a malignant fever then in the convulsions of a child the last must be done by the basest perfidiousness of stealing off the file this or that physicians bill they imagine to hit the case and save him the trouble of seeing the patient  remark still more commendations of the honest apothecaries sure these are some near the college perfidious in stealing bills off the files no i believe the crime lies in saving the doctor the trouble i would say profit of seeing the patient but why he must steal a bill for a convulsive child rather than any other case i dont understand unless this merchants talent lies in curing convulsions but if the confusion of the business so perplexes them why have the doctors so perplexed it why have they never called for the surgeons or butchers to take off the skins of the patients and supply them with melilot and some fitter persons to administer behind but if these things are so great and perplexing a confusion why does the dispensary undertake the same  but it is obvious he goes on the prodigious number of apothecaries will in a few years naturally increase to more than twice as many and so on will oblige them to increase the greater vent of physic and higher prices they will not be wanting in perpetual encroachments on the faculty they will be plying to raise and support their interest etc they will assume the cure of many thousands yearly that would have been sooner well without physic they will struggle first with their own fraternity then the members of the college except their confederates they will not bear or commend any method but where physic is ordered every hour etc  remark it is the number of apothecaries sticks in this tradesmans stomach more than their honesty he plainly shows not because they will be so many porters and raise the rates of drugs but because they will encroach on the faculty and get the credit of many cures which were done merely by not killing by which some doctors might have raised a considerable reputation  but whether they will have the wit to learn of the doctors to struggle with then own fraternity i question and of which this is meant the honest apothecaries or the others but if they grow so numerous and the college take no care to enter auxiliaries i fear they will be too hard for the college both honest and dishonest too if their interest engage them against all but still to inhance the crimes of the honest apothecaries they will not suffer any character of a physician to pass without an allay or antidote who will not justify his practice and all his medicines with the air and assurance of a common knight of the post and take the death of the patient on himself any citizen who will think may discern the reason of the perpetual dissensions of the college one party would raise its reputation by serving the public faithfully the other oppose all projects of that kind to merit the favor of the apothecaries  the apostates from their own profession are not to be informed that the dignity of the faculty must sink when they are forced to delude the people by applauding the unskilful or pernicious treatment and the doctor for his fee has the reproaches of the house and funeral when he dares not inform them the patient had the fatal stroke already given him that the mistake of the apprentice in substituting one thing for another or a wrong proportion was the true cause of a violent not natural death when we rarely treat a distemper at its beginning commonly the only time to interpose between nature and the disease to any purpose are called to no purpose in the end when all is in confusion the vigor of nature spent or oppressed with as many doses as hours in   or  0 days and chiefly employed in worn out and vitiated constitutions    remark all apothecaries are certainly wicked fellows if the honest ones are so bad and the word honest has indeed lost its value but they do but imitate the doctors who will not give them a good character unless they will comply with their interest but it is a great scandal to the college that they suffer such members amongst them that have no more faith or honor thin knights of the post that will justify what they dont know viz the apothecaries medicines and honesty and the doctors are imprudent too as well as wicked or else they never would take the deaths of the patients on themselves or the cure of them they know past cure but it is not so obvious to the citizens that the dispensary doctors are all such as would raise their reputation only by faithfully serving the public and that all the rest oppose all such designs to get the favor of the apothecaries that they are all base apostates from their profession etc now i think it would show but little honesty in a physician after his patients death to tell the patients friends he was killed or incurable before he undertook him or that the medicines were no good and that the boy mistook when of such things tho they too often happen the doctor is commonly ignorant but when this honest merchant was well enough to go abroad he tells us  that he was recommending the advantages of the dispensary and the integrity of the physicians subscribers but was surprised to hear many express a prejudice against it without desiring to know the design of it a notable company about a teatable had been exclaiming and said theyd go the old way till it came more in fashion since they did not know how many had been killed by the apothecaries they were easy not to find out new occasions of trouble etc  remark these were merchants no doubt of the old company that were contented to trade upon the old foundation they had settled their heads by a dish or two of tea and were willing to see others make out their pretensions they were not willing to accuse the apothecaries of murder unless they could prove it lest they should bring themselves into trouble but  in other visits he was startled at the many scandalous reports against the subscribers to the dispensary the first says he they contemned as malicious and senseless impostures they had too much poetry in them for truth the other appeared ridiculously little and very easily refuted that their physic is as dear as the apothecaries when we experience the difference of    or    in  0 shillings their goodness justified by the subscribers care in the choice of every drug which they buy at the highest prices their reputation answerable for every defect that they have not servants sufficient when they can increase their number and the want of hands supposes the growing business equal to defray the charge of more but if the subscribers want the university education or capacity for their employment they may consult the apothecaries list of the college and find better if they can if they destroy all the patients and the apothecaries and their confederates never want success the want of advocates will prevent the trial and nonsuit the debate if the remedies are not good the abused people will seasonably complain if they have no business the dispensary will have none and will be but a collection of pots and glasses and the servants sufficient to show the useless repository  remark the merchant in his further adventures meets with startling reperts against the dispensary no doubt he is concerned in supplying them with drugs i could wish he had given us the poetical ones they might have been a diversion if not by their wit yet by their folly but what is the matter poetry is so contemptible now which before he boasted of in the dispensary as a qualification with an emphasis even poetry to bring up the rear in those that commend or belong to a physician now poetical and false go together but he should have confuted these great and harder objections as well as he has the little ones to which he has answered very well if the merchant can avouch what he has said that they will always sell at the rate set down which i am sure will be less than they cost  that the dispensary always employ those that have skill mr acid or some other apothecarydoctors among them to buy the drugs and not trust their boys that they will confess every defect that their growing business shall not perplex them as it does the apothecaries that their members whether they came from the shop or the schools have university learning and as much capacity for physicians as they pretend to that they will not destroy so many patients as apothecaries and other doctors but above all that the patients will be sensible of the abuses in physic and always complain when abused  but he tells us further  that the people will in a little time apprehend that their interest as to health and expense is the subject of the controversy and that every one is both judge and party and can give a definitive sentence as far as he is concerned and here is no law to be enacted by majority of voices or restraint to be put on the liberty of any particular person he need not express a childish dread as if he were to be kidnapt away  to be plain i am afraid the people will not soon experience that their health and expense but their expenses is the subject of the controversy but we know every one is not capable of being a judge or so unhappy as to be a party the people do not see the depths of satan in these things and whence the fair invitations proceed  gentlemen we do not come to impose on you you are at your liberty you need not be afraid of us we come to seek your health and to do for you that which others cannot gentlemen take our remedies our famous orvietan and other arcanas at a very small price here you have the whole pack of    remedics for the price of one shilling which is inconsiderable to so great benefits you will receive thereby we are to be spoken with etc this is plausible and takes even upon a stage tom saffold by repeated invitations and assurances got an estate but  the apothecaries he tells us complain with no decorum and the worst grace imaginable you to please the people make your selves like the apothecaries you are become doctorapothecaries they have been these  0 years apothecarydoctors  but the doctors restore the ancient and cautious practice by providing effactual remedies and preventing deadly mistakes  the apothecary leaves his concern to the wholesale trade and his boy is always abroad giving advice can any two things be more alike in appearance can they be justly displeased with you who give your care and countenance to the trade of making medicines as the apothecary in return puts a value upon yours in pleasing himself with the practice of physic  they reply they are forced to it by the peoples importunity so you are to send your prescriptions to the college by those who like a good medicine at the intrinsic value they are afraid the dispensary will ruin the apothecaries trade who are every day industriously destroying your profession you are invaded with vast numbers like a russian army who slay without quarter reserving a few slaves to be cut off if they bear not their chains easily or scruple any work they are put upon  remark the apothecaries are graceless fellows they dont use the decorum they ought in comparing the doctors to themselves and do not handsomely distinguish between doctor apothecaries and apothecarydoctors but it is certain they both not only act after the like method but for the same ends endeavor to please the people and if the doctorapothecaries restore the ancient practice they do but imitate the apothecarydoctors in taking care of the preparation as well as the administration of medicines but whether either do enough to prevent all deadly mistakes is much to be questioned  the apothecary leaves his concern to his boy but is seldom without the oversight and assistance of his man who understands his business as well as the doctors man at the college or st martinslane the one may very well do one matters business as well as the other serves    and he himself understands pharmacy better than any of the    doctors not excepting him who was bred under the acute master at worcester but it is pity either of them are forced to so much business if i could persuade people to temperance and sobriety they should not so complain of much business forced upon them  the reason why the apothecarydoctors value the doctorapothecaries business and vice versa no doubt is because it is good to have two strings to one bow or to have customers come in at both doors  but the doctorapothecaries sell medicines at the intrinsic value which the apothecarydoctors cannot afford but if the doctorapothecaries would also sell advice at the intrinsic value they would certainly ruin their antagonists they are alike fishers but with different baits one catches by a pretense of advice at the intrinsic value viz little or nothing but makes them pay so much the more for the medicines the other the medicines almost at intrinsic value viz little or nothing but expects his gain in the fees and which bait will take best being doubtful they are between hopes and fear whose endeavors will ruin the other but the russian army of the apothecaries makes the swede tremble yet encouraged by good generals they are not without hopes of victory and resolution never to be taken prisoners  but in other conversations he says he had better success he persuaded not a few to consult those of the society at the approach of the spring and has had their thanks with large accounts of the difference of the old and new practice of physic so many converts in my neighborhood brought on me the resentments of my former apothecary  he expostulated to me the ill consequence to their trade with bitter and envenomed reflections on the dispensary and the promoters of it you shall judge from his manner of arguing we govern all the families they believe us in every thing etc when the men are abroad or not in the sickchamber we recommend whom we please and decry the opposite party do you believe we will spare any of them and hastily plucked out a scandalous list printed at the desire of the master and wardens where our honest physicians are distinguished by marks from their honest slaves which being promiscuous in the college order he blundred thrice and showed for villains those of their own confederacy but after some time he recovered and told me they were resolved to maintain the reputation of what they had done many years since there have not been more than   physicians raised but by serving us we call them topping physicians because we put them on the people as we please there are of several sortments and different abilities who pass by our artifices for the greatest men has not one risen considerably by our favor who has employed much of his time in writing   folio poems exploded by his brother poets and physicians for the vilest bombast every expression relating to physic or philosophy proved to be trifling absurd and false and judged so even by us do not several of the college come over and betray all that passes the rest are afraid and dare not be honest and just to their patients will we pardon him who cures a fever for one or two pounds when our friends will raise the bill to  0  0 or  0 pounds he that brings in the fiddler will make him play what tunes and as often as he pleases does the dispensary pretend to impose on the public that we are not useful out of our shops who give clysters dress blysters and bleed when it is easy etc i would not farther concern my self but only put him in mind that one sex was accommodated without them and the other was the business of the surgeon who attends to these and the greater cases of surgery abroad without impediment to any part of his profession besides blisters often inflamed or corroded to evacuate more freely require more than the common treatment i had been made sensible how that excellent and most useful art of surgery was invaded by these bold pretenders to every thing they do not understand they bleed without suspecting the nerve or artery may lie in the way they apply to inflammations and tumors and keep in the putrid matter till the sinuous fistula or rotten bone gives pain loud enough to call for the surgeon  remark this merchant i perceive was broker to the company or spokesman to persuade the people to buy the doctors remedies and had got as he says many promises to consult them at the time when people are persuaded they ought to take physic whether they need it or no which is certainly easy practice and no doubt the people had cause to thank him for advising them to those that would give the least people that are well had certainly better pay for advice to go to sh  t when they have need than for the directing a purge or two and they must needs find a difference in the practice that being easier than this  no wonder the apothecary like a covetous dependant preacher is angry at him that converts his flock into another fold and he has verily a great capacity to decry or recommend as the share of the fleece engages him but tho he of all men may best know the honesty and capacity of a physician yet i readily believe he is not always infallible but may mistake the marks being but small of honest physicians and may readily take some of any confederacy for villains but if there have not been more than five villains raised by the apothecaries they are not so bad as i could have believed them yet they are much to be blamed for putting any villains o top on the people or representing little fellows for great men but especially for recommending the care of the lives of the sober people to poets whose bombast fictions will never cure any considerable diseases whether arthurs the dispensaries or john juniors who tho the qualifications may recommend them all to the filly people who love conceits for ingenious men yet critics will let neither go without censure but soon discover where the muse was up too soon and fell into some supine nod or other or when his spirits stagnate like a flood or when he blazons in dread smiles his hideous form etc  but the college are sure a wretched sort of men that some betray the rest and the rest dare not be honest and just and the apothecaries are very unmerciful that they will not pardon him that cures a fever at   or   pounds they might have said guineas when i know the most fevers may be cured at half the rate and the doctor be a gainer and i believe were there nothing but the music it self to recommend these artists there would but sew dance even to the dispensary clysterpipe who i dont question have their useful men in their concern not only to give clysters dress blister and bleed when it is easy but also to accommodate even the one sex when they have a mind to a jigg i am glad to hear the merchant speaks honorably of the surgeons and with some concern for their interest and grant that they may mind business abroad without impediment to business at home it is certainly as much the surgeons concern to take care of the pharmaceutick part as it is the dispensaries since they cannot trust the apothecaries i am pleased that they are sensible the surgeons are invaded by the apothecaries as well as themselves it shows they are grown better natured since they themselves persecuted that party for interloping but the huge russian army of the apothecarys makes them willing to speak the poles fair and not pretend to turn dr surgeons too as well as dr apothecaries if they had i should have blamed them for supposing the nerves and arteries lie between the veins and the skin or that there is any need of cutting through both sides of the vein or that tumors are fistulous before they are open or that rotten bones or purulent tumors are most painful  but after various fortune abroad says he i was to meet a select company of merchants and other eminent citizens i determined to ask their assistance and counsel i showed them your papers and laid before them the informations relating to the college and our own interest some were discoursing of treaties abroad etc but at mine and our friends request we came to debate of our own immediate concern i was desired to give you a further trouble to remove the common opprobrium on the profession that it wants certainty and acts often by conjecture and that more scandalous that the apothecarys seeing the patient and you at the bed side is able to give physic himself and after our assertion or the cheapness of the best medicines and some contests about it that you would as in our papers for sale by the candle give a pretty near estimate of the value of every preparation and composition or simple now used in physic we must wait for this account on which the whole controversy depends but the company would not doubt of the easy prices of the most effectual remedies as are fit for the use of the prince now the regard of all europe many of us having used of several kinds of which the dose was of no great value  remark these were all select merchants of this new company we must suppose because their counsel and assistance was so necessary and interest the same  but this gentleman and his friends were most diligent they were for home treaties de laribus and focis but that trouble the gentleman gave em i believe will indeed be found one ere the opprobria of the profession are removed that it is uncertain and conjectural in great part is most certain and granted by all knowing and modest physicians but it is certainly asserted by none so much as the ignorant and those that are willing to deceive the people i dont see how it should be thought the greater scandal that the apothecaries by seeing the patient and doctos at the bedside can become able to give physic for were it so it would argue the artist certain and the art easy and that all that have to do with the sick should be able to give physic would certainly not only be a credit to the profession but safe to the patient for one may rectify another mistakes but i believe here lies the scandal that the apothecary being skilful sometimes is forced to discover the doctors defects in care in prognostics or in pharmacy etc in which last i think they have discovered ignorance enough and that they have not the best medicines their pharmacopeia being their standard which is one of the worst collections in the world but it is pleasant that they talk of selling their medicines by inch of candle and i believe we may wait a great while ere these merchants will give us an estimate of the value of every preparation composition and simple used in physic it will be so laborious and difficult a work they will not have time to prescribe if the whole controversy depends upon this it will never be at an end but the company have been used so kindly in many things they dont doubt of easy prices  if they are not kind to those that are to carry on the trade it would be strange but that nothing but such cheap physic should be fit for his majesty looks as if they thought him poor or not to deserve the more precious remedies or at least would have him furnished out of their stock but he goes on  after their lamenting the poor and the vile treatments of others they resolved they would make their acquaintance sensible of the generous design of the college and engage them to the most industrious publication of its use the only panacea to the sick they would not doubt to convince the most obstinate and heedless opposers  remark if these gentlemen had not made so great a noise about the poor and shown such great industry in inviting to buy their panaceas one might have believed something of their generosity but mankind now adays are not so immoderately desirous to serve one another much less those that have most need we cannot but in charity think these merchants are most willing to relieve their own poor who are not so hard to be convinced of any thing that may tend to their benefit but  he goes on to tell us what the apothecary must do he must be obliged to keep his shop that all his medicines may be made at home and dispensed with his own hand or under his careful inspection that his apprentice may be employed to learn his trade and be taken from the giddy ambition of aping a profession a little too far removed from his that our servants shall be sent for the physic and directions shall be left at our houses by the proper hands each of us sending our porters the hurry and confusion may be taken off the apothecaries and then servants by which many patients physic being conveyed at one time the deadly accidents that often happen may be avoided our messenger will find the shop sedately forwarding their affair every one will wait the mixture for his master by which the possibility of a mistake will be prevented  remark it is very hard that the apothecary should be obliged to keep his shop since the doctor is resolvd to send all his bills to the dispensary and to undersell him in medicines i know no way the apothecary can take but to undersell the doctor in advice and he may trust his man to make up his recipes as well as the doctor can his at the dispensary the case being the same the profession of physic which the apothecarys boy is so ambitious to ape i agree has been too far removed from pharmacy and the doctors do well in aping the boy that would bring them together which ought not to be separate but porters tho they may carry greater burdens of physic at once are not the fittest messengers to convey the remedies to the sick he that makes up a bill may sometimes save a lise by seeing the patient i have known one lost ere now which had the apothecarys boy seen the patient would have been saved  but if these things were done he further adds the college will be safe from the temptations they now lie under and from being in so large numbers debaucht from their virtue and indispensible duty to their patients and as the present  000  viz apothecaries have two or three apprentices each which multiplying in proportion must raise the prices of physic and the quantity and industry of giving more to the ruin of their credit with the people there is no other method to preserve themselves the families will then make choice of a physician from the visible success of his art and not with the greatest stupidness ask the apothecary to bring one since from your members you are forced to make the greatest profit of every patient which inclines him to a physician most useful in that case twas resolved after your answer of the prices to oblige the physician to rate the prescript sent to the apothecary at the fairest profit to be paid at furthest after the recovery and to prevent the sipping of cordials and pearl juleps as usquebaugh at the coffeehouses upon every little humor of taking encouraged by the mean and vile customs of going upon tick till christmas  a modest gentleman gave his assent with some doubt of success but he would propose these things to the best advantage    remark it is a thousand pities the college have so many temptations to debauch them from their duty to their patients but it seems the apothecaries as bad as they are have been the happy occasion of reforming the honest part by setting them an example of prescribing their own remedies and it is but just the doctors should have a little concern lest their increase in numbers should ruin them but yet the doctors are so sensible of the debauchery of the apothecaries as well as of their own that they dare not trust them with the recommendation of a physician lest they should not recommend one of the honest part who would send the bills to the college the visible success of his art is certainly the best character whereby one may choose a physician but if this were the only rule none would have ever been chose for no man has success either in curing or killing till he has had some experience which all our doctors at first cannot but want nor can the apothecary be sure who he shall have the best success with till he has tried him unless he had preingagd the young doctor to prescribe largely on condition he will cry him up which is a practice i must confess i have heard of but how the new company will enable or oblige the old and all interlopers to rate the prescripts i cannot see or how they can pretend to it with better reason than the apothecary might rate the doctors fees but if they could oblige the patients to pay ready money and leave the vile custom of going upon tick not only the apothecary but honest part of the doctors would be obliged yet if it were to be only at the recovery none of the merchants i believe would keep open shop long how they will be able to prevent the people from sipping other cordials or usquebaugh when they have a mind to it or the apothecary from selling of it a modest gentleman may well doubt but he gives us something considerable as sollows  another who sees through the town demanded what hope there may be of repelling the confidence of the men of the bottle wit and banter which admire only the childish wantonness of thought and pretty deviations from good sense and therefore character the men of their parts and dress into the public esteem they were left to their fortune and experience of others more discerning the signature ought to be taken from other affairs of equal concern and importance  the ablest pilot is put into the ship the gravity learning and application of a judge is observed in a cause of life and estate we shall then raise our hopes of recovery from the manner our cases shall be weighed before the judgment be given when you shall not be brought in durante beneplacito of the apothecaries assistants or physickbrokers abroad we shall know who shall merit our gratitude and applause and put down the infamous custom of accusing the physician a practice too vile to be exposed to impute the misfortune to the honest industry of the physician not consulted till the extremity after many days dosing by our selves and visitants the apothecaries not allowing a fair inquest of dissection which would discover the passages of the heart stopped the ulcers and gangrenes of the viscera we are agreed to control our families and persuade our friends to the same resolutions  remark now starts up at last a lyncean merchant that can see the men at their bottle between two stone walls and he doubts how the wit and banter of these bacchanalian phanaticks will be repelled but i think this gentlemans optics not so admirable tho he could see so far he cannot see very near for childish wantonness of thought and deviations from good sense are very uncouth characters of wit and learning and very unlikely means to bring men into esteem and the signature ought to be taken not from such qualifications or any of equal importance but something above want of sense the skilfullest pilot and most grave and learned judge is certainly to be trusted with the ship and cause and the manner of the doctors weighing the case whether with wit or none is to be considered by those that have wit enough to do it and how induced by apothecaries visitants or whether by the brokers to the old or new company which done it will be better guessed who is likely to merit applause and he that does indeed do so will most put down the infamy physicians have so often merited but  how to keep people from dosing themselves and so making work for the doctors i do not know as long as there are so many medicines exposed to sale that the apothecaries should hinder dissections to me is a mystery if the friends are willing or how the doctors are so sure to find the bolusses sticking in the passages of the heart or the viscera corrupted i dont know such things i have known as positively asserted by them as if they had been oracles or had the famed eyes of the lynx but dissection has discovered their vanity if all merchants will control their families by the direction of the dispensary and persuade their friends to their resolutions the apothecaries will soon be outed well but he goes on when we were about to part one of the society that had been silent some time expressed himself with some heat from the relation he had to some of the faculty let us not lose this only opportunity of raising the reputation of one of the most useful and learned professions when our interest is inseparable from theirs shall we look on unconcerned when the faculty and our selves are enslaved and oppressed by the number of the apothecaries originally their servants what is the mystery but a mechanic and handicraft trade they act nothing but by the ordinance and direction of the physician the medicines are all from their appointment the drugs poudered boiled distilled and mixed by their order what books or languages are understood by them but the dispensatory or receipt book the cook confectioner and perfumer have as much pretense to learning or the knowledge of the uses of what they prepare have not our servants the skill to make up our domestic receipts many of them the same as theirs the underservant to the chymists laboratory while he cleanses the glasses attends the fires speedily discerns the mechanic part tho the design and process were given by the incomparable mr boil or the faculty and the uses only known to the sagacious physician we pleased our selves at parting with the great reputation that worthy gentlemen had given to our country with the learned of all nations which will last with the late discovery of the circulation  remark the whole company of these merchants without doubt were related to the faculty or they had not been so warm in the concern but this gentleman had been long musing and he thought it necessary to add a little heat at last it being the only opportunity to raise the sinking reputation of those who have so long professed themselves one of the most useful as well as learned professions but i find the chief cause of his heat was the inseparableness of their common interest which i the rather believe because he agrees with the rest that it is the number of the apothecaries that is most dangerous and not the honesty of those rascally mechanics formerly their servants davus perturbat omnia but i must beg the doctors pardon a little the present venders of medicines were not doctors servants tho that was the original of the trade but those doctors whose servants turned apothecaries were a sort of men who very well understood pharmacy which the present dispensers did not till a few broken apothecaries came to be doctors among them but the old blades thought handy works no disgrace paracelsus the proudest of them thought the highest title he could bear was that of monarch of mechanical arcanas if the present apothecaries do nothing but by the ordinance and direction of the physician why do they complain but perhaps it is not the honest physicians orders they act by i am sure it is not the orders of the skilful they obey in their receipt book if they had there would not have been so many insignificant and foolish medicines there and so few good ones nor the secundum artem wholly left to those ignorant mechanics in which there often lies more than in the receipt it self but as to language i will engage to bring apothecaries that understand more even english than some of the learned doctors of the dispensary besides other liberal sciences many of them it must be confessed are ignorant enough both in language and cookery but what shall be said of the cook confectioner or perfumer that knows not the uses of what he prepares or of the wit that can suppose them such ignorant artists nor i believe would the gentleman esteem the mechanic part of chemistry so very easy if he understood it for i must tell him there is more art even in making a fire than he seems to imagine and the incomparable mr boil had not he and his operators too understood the mechanic part of some processes better than the faculty he would never have hid his design in them whatever the faculty might by chance have stumbled upon but the doctor proudly assuming to the faculty the sole knowledge of the uses of medicines thereby ungratefully denies it that excellent person for the pleasure he created them in the reputation be singly had given the nation by making it not wholly ignorant in experimental philosophy the chief basis of medicine  chap iii so much for the merchants letter or the doctor in disguise we come now to the unmasked physicians answer let us see if we can find any thing more like the product of a pen used to prescribe the best medicines and he answers the drugster as follows  sir i perceive you lay the greatest stress on the last enquiry of the low prices of medicines because you observe that the large bills of the apothecary are the best argument with the people of his ability to advise and while they believe the disease is treated very much by guess they are not very solicitous who throws the dice for their lives but you rather make choice of one who has made it his only business has studied and practiced all the artifices of making them run to his purpose than any common hand  remark if the large bills of the apothecaries are the best argument with the people of the apothecaries ability to advise i do not see how so much stress can be laid on the doctors selling a few medicines at low prices that which argues the ability of the apothecary should methinks also argue the skill of the doctor but the doctor here talks too much like an apothecary or something else it cannot be denied that both doctors and apothecaries use their medicines very much like dice but whether the doctor or apothecary has got more artifices to make em run to his purpose is not easy to say i believe both have more than are good he that pretends to sell cheap does it to get more customers he that sells dear does it to get the more money and both have the same design but it is very true there are some uncommon gamesters  further says he you will not deny that every art has the means to attain its end this is obvious in manufactures which are made better or worse according to the skill of the artificer there are other arts whose subject is perishable from causes above the power and control of the art which events are not imputable to the artist navigation will conduct a ship to the port but storms rocks etc may lose the ship the husbandman and gardener act with prospect of success but extreme rains drought and blasts destroy their hopes the physician pretends to know with as much certainty how animal life may be preserved and by what means endangered as they the health and growth of vegetables you may make an estimat to what proportion animal life may be prolonged by observing that the periods of the lives of many quadrupeds and birds are supposed to be distinctly known  remark the physician could have been contented to have his art thought as certain as others and he might have persuaded the merchants that so it is if he had not unluckily dropped that modest word pretends which makes some think it is indeed but a pretense but i hope he would not cunningly insinuate that the bare supposition of the knowledge of the periods of the lives of beasts and birds is the way to estimate what doctors can do let us hear what has been supposed in this matter  ter binos deciesque novem superexit in annos justa senescentumquos implet vita virorum hos novies superat vivend garrula cornix et quater egreditur cornicis secula cervus alipedem cervum ter vincit corvus at illum multiplicat novies phoenix reparabilis ales quem vos perpetuo decies praevertitis aevo nymphae hamadryades but i hope he would not have the merchants think the new dispensarydoctors can make mens lives as long as these supposed periods if they could so do they would be rare fellows but bitterly pestered with practice but yet mans he says is the longest period and from galens observation that of the britains if in navigation the vessel must be moved by the tide and winds and turned by the rudder to a certain course the powers of the body act as mechanically by the natural necessity in health so in the appearances of diseases the humors are by a natural tendency moved to be altered or separated these different methods of nature constitute so many species of distempers which are truly defined and described from the known alterations and symptoms in all the stages of their course  we have the most certain experiences of their cures from the observations of all ages even these which are the most latent sudden pestilences and malignant fevers discover the ways by which nature expels the malignity etc    remark either the doctor is mistaken or virgil a better poet than any of them whatever galen is but under all the doctors intent is to persuade us that dispensary physicians can prolong life that physicians do so truly define and describe diseases or have such certain experiences of their cures i must deny authors differ if they did not yet men of great business read but little and remember less and he is a very rare fellow indeed that has a promptuary in his noddle to serve him on all occasions but whatever may have been done by former physicians ours are quot homines tot sententiae except in some very common cases both in their definitions and prescriptions for diseases as any one will find that shall consult diverse physicians separately and compare their accounts of a disease and prescriptions for it one will say it is this another that one will prescribe one thing another another but he says farther  you cannot doubt the efficacy of the instruments in physic when in many cases the rich cordials given improperly or in large quantities act as poisons and then in a little longer time as visibly destroy when the over dosing vinous or other spirits fire and inflame the blood and spirits opiates stop the motions the bark checks the ferment of a fever which cannot be cured but by expulsion of the venom the effects of vomits purges diaphoreticks are owned by the vulgar experience the late but surer force of labor temperance rest have been formerly owned in the most obstinate diseases they are now rejected as the most nauseous physic and the most difficult to be complied with i need not acquaint you with the mineral waters which are able to cool and dilute and purify the blood after it has been heated and corrupted by modish living nature discovers to the physician its surest methods of dismissing the most common fevers by bleeding sweats etc in the more difficult it gives indications how it would be assisted or directed at least our magazines of observations cannot sail to furnish in all cases parallel to them  remark that even cordials may so easily act as poisons and destroy methinks is no inviting argument of the efficacy of medicines nor can this appear but from the errors of physicians who have found it so which is no great credit tho the effects of vulgar medicines are known the time and case where such effects should be produced is not so well perceived labor temperance and rest are certainly excellent preservatives but in many diseases cannot be used when a man cannot so much as sit up to prescribe him labor when he is delirious to order him to go to rest would be very good physic if he could take it but it is indeed difficult to be complied with barely by the doctors order it is not so certain to the merchants whether and when the mineral waters do good or hurt it was the judgment of mr boil that they do more hurt than good taking one time with another and it seems to be the opinion of one of his scholars that all the real benefit got by drinking the waters comes merely from the large quantities of water taken and not by the minerals wherewith they are impregnated and defiled and he advises persons rather to drink at some pure spring letter to a gentleman of alkaly and acids p ult but the air company diversion of those places may add very much to the health of the persons which is used to be attributed solely to the waters tho all this would not cure a man whose blood is corrupted natures indications are not always observed or understood by physicians or always followed but the mode practice prevails above them all and the magazines of observations are not always open or resorted to by physicians but while a man is looking for a parallel case the patient is often dead a physician ought to have a better rule than the running to his study to know what to do where he is not sure to find a true parallel the author might be mistaken and not give a true or faithful account authors are apt to be somewhat guilty of the crime of the petty sorcerers who make their virulent medicines all panaceas if you will believe the catalogues of cures confidently affirmed in the bills when very likely the disease never was worse or so bad as they make it if the matter of fact related had any truth in it at all he goes on  but if the patient is overheated and surfeited by too many medicines if the salutary looseness be stopped too soon the humors fix by opiates or the bark it is imputable to the adviser not to the art which has given the strictest cautions on the like conjunctures it is not a reproach to the art if there are wanting remedies equal to the rage or violence of some diseases which will not wait the effect or are above the force of any known drug that can be brought to oppose them any more than to the statesman general or counselor when he cannot always warrant success when after the steady use of liquors which give a briskness to but inflame the spirits spend the strength of the blood by heating it give life a pleasant but quicker motion the liver and other parts shall be made scirrous and abcessed the omentum rotten the fibers flaccid shall the art be accused that cannot keep the machin a going where every wheel is broken  remark if the art of medicine were so certain as the doctor would persuade his hopedfor patients the artist would not so often overheat yea or overcool or surfeit his patients by so many medicines it will certainly be the advantage of every artist to do his work with the fewest tools all the cautions that they give one another are hardly sufficient fixing of humors is what a chemist would be glad to see the doctor perform to suppose there are remedies wanting to equal the force of any disease is to reproach the author of nature as if he had not goodness enough to provide a remedy for every evil or as if his goodness were not greater than all evi and to excuse the artist who ought to be blamed that he has not found out sufficient remedies but lazily leaves them unknown  some of the doctors themselves are steady drinkers but i believe never any of them were found with scirrous livers rotten omentums or flaccid fibers caused by the briskness of the blood but if all artists may be accused of defects it signifies not much what the art is supposed it is the artist the patient must stand or fall by he farther says  that the tendences and events of the symptoms and the issue of the disease may be known and a probable prognostic given is owned by the forwardness of the common people to give their opinions how often have you believed the presumptuous valuer of himself who doubts every ones knowledge but his own when he has assured you had he come sooner the patient had not died that another would have expired the next day if his advice had been wanting the writers of government prove the maxims of state from the axioms of physic that one part overnourisht starves and enervates the others that when every part disregards the interest of the whole its dissolution is as certain as when every part is vitiated in a shattered constitution  remark the doctor would fain raise the reputation of physicians with the people particularly the credit of the new shopkeepers but he does it by unlucky arguments the forwardness of the common people to prognosticate or run to the fortuneteller to know the success of their amors lawsuits etc is no very convincing argument that their oracle is not a cheat nor is their faith in the presumptuous valuer of himself who so positively decrees what would have or not have been if this or that any assurance that he is or can be what he pretends but i believe the doctors may be certain enough in their prognostics of the body politic that if the apothecarys be over nourisht they will starve the doctors or if the dispensary be over fed a they would willingly be they will starve the apothecaries and other doctors and if every part disregard the interest of the whole the college will soon be dissolved which god grant unless they will effectually reform amen but the doctor adds  if therefore a physician is supposed to have learnt whatever has been observed of the different affections and disorders from childhood to old age of the sexes in all the circumstances how seasons and climates alter us what changes are made by all sorts of diet to have noted the use and site of all parts by anatomy the virtue of medicines by the trial chemistry affords but especially the histories of the almost innumerable diseases given by authors their causes access progress events and consequents of all methods and all medicines when he reflects on them and compares them nicely with the case under his care you will not oppose him to a rival who has not had philosophical education or the knowledge of any language in which physic is treated when you have determined what time is required to collect from many writers whatever is useful to the safe and successful practice of physic i would desire you to state the years wherein any thing certain can be acquired from the prescripts of the art without the reasons given or any register of the success when nature throws off the common disorders of it self and is able to bear any sort of physic the apothecary plies the sick with medicines he does not want to pay for attending magnifies the disease and his skill etc in these the most usual ilnesses the physician shows his art by prognosticating with integrity the assured success which is a richer cordial than the shops afford and merits his reward but when there shall be nodus vindice d gnus when dubiis trepidat victoria pennis when the experienced physician will doubt whether nature acts to its own preservation or wants the assistance of art he will examine the effects of one medicine before he risques the use of others the ignorant and less searful adviser will not lose the opportunity of filling the patient and the chamber to his own advantage these are the cases in which all the severest and most just observations of the present and former ages must be consulted the least errors make the fever deadly tho not to be discovered but by the most consummate artist they only can discern when nature attackt in all parts the spirits wasted and blood exhausted is easily overborn by an active cordial etc the people indeed are satisfied with the apothecarys skill who hears the physicians disourse upon the disease will you imagine he designs the surest instruction to his scholar who will set up for a master next hour but he makes up the note and sees the operation the instrumentmaker tho he make the knife and forceps will not pretend to use them as the surgeon i will after you have considered it desire your opinion whether you would communicate a specific efficacious medicine to the apothecary which he would instantly make up for every customer in the same or as he thinks not much differing cases will any merchant or artificer expose the secret of his business but we cannot discover our secrets to any but our own profession which is the manner of applying the medicine to the latent exigence of the disease some fevers go off being only undisturbed water is the richest cordial in others and the rich composition procures to others a certain malignity will you value the surgeon from the tipping of his instruments or from his judgment and steadiness of hand in using them the most common and simple may have a better effect than the most pompous apparatus the few of our costly ingredients have been kept in use to cover the fraud of exaction but specially because we please our selves that they are designed for the use of the grand monde while we pity the little people who we imagine cannot live without them but providence has otherwise provided in its grand hospital we are upon the level there the poor do not want so much as the rich but may have the most valued simple remedies and the best chemical or galenical preparations at an expense they or their patrons with an easy charity may bear  remark a physician that is not supposed but has indeed learned all that has been observed of the affections and disorders of the sexes in all ages etc that knows the site and use of all parts by dissections the virtues of medicines by what chemistry can do that has at his fingers ends the histories of diseases given by authors etc the consequences of all methods and medidicines and can compare them nicely on every occasion is rara avis in terra medicorum i dare say not ever seen in warwick lane any more than among the glisterpipers the gentlemen have not many of them so much as looked into some of these things particularly chymea that coy colleyhanded gentlewoman has not been courted much by them for her gifts and he that should insinuate himself to be one of her followers would not be thought likely to have had philosophical or academical education which the doctor is so willing to boast of against the apothecaries but i must needs say neither of the adversaries have been grounded as they ought in philosophy especially the experimental but as being an apothecary does not make a man incapable of it so being of the college yea of the dispensary does not necessarily include it many apothecaries have attained the latin tongue and something of greek before put apprentice and may improve in language and read the secrets which the doctors did but if none of them had so done there are english books enough written by some of the faculty that could write in no other language besides if one of the dspensary says true and they are the honest part nothing has been written of any certain truth  till be arose and with reviving light dispeld the clouds and chased away the night see the dialogue with alkaly and he himself writes in a ort of english the time to collect whatever is useful to the successful practice of physic wherein any thing certain can be acquired would be too long for one man to see the end of the process as the apothecary plies the sick with medicines he does not want so the doctor will not be wanting to write where there is no need but of a fee or to visit and advise some little thing or other that the patient may not think he sees him for nothing he will alike magnify his art and the disease tho both be little and will give that most rich cordial of assured success which is very commonly indeed the best medicine he gives and gets the willingest fee by which he knows better than to refund when time has discovered his assurance not well grounded but there are knotty and doubtful diseases he confesses even to the experienced physician when in fear he knows not whether he had best prescribe or no he wisely thinks he does best that tampers least and would have the patients think such a one deserves his fee best that has troubled them least but  says hippocrates imperitia vero malus thesaurus and malus agger timiditatis and audaciae nutrix timidit as quidem impotentiam audacia vero ignorantiam artis significat the less fearful adviser no doubt will physic them more briskly that he may have the more pretense to merit and opportunity to get especially if he may not take a fee but i believe if either the fearful dr or confident apothecary vel vice versa should consult all the severe and just observations of the present and former ages they would have neither time to prescribe or make up medicines in any acute disease and should the least errors make the fever deadly it would be an incurable distemper nor would one patient in  0000 be ever the better for a consummate artist when our age has not produced him unless the dispensary dr who says  to him alone mankinds indebted more than tall the doctors that have gone before be the man such a one perhaps may discern when he has exhausted the blood and wasted the spirits and nature will be overborn by an active cordial but the doctor is afraid the people will think the apothecaries skilful that gentleman has assured us his master was not by hearing the doctor talk and by making up his medicines and seeing their operations tho he assures us he has been careful lest he should give him any sure instructions but if his instructions by his practice be so fallacious he that designs to be skilled will take a better method to learn than the sight of the fearful or confident doctors practice can be whose instruments could he but know their use as well as the surgeon does his there were more occasion of caution who looks on there has been no great danger of apothecaries learning efficacious specificks of the doctors since they practice by the dispensatory or the sick finding the benefit since it is dishonorable to give a private medicine without writing but the manner of applying the medicine to the latent exigence of the disease he tells us is the doctors secret so not the medicine it self or its artful preparation yet it is to be applied to something latent must we think it so to the doctor or is it that which is adapted to escape only the eyes of the apothecary may not he possibly learn what fevers will go off of themselves or to give them a specific that will only do no hurt cannot he disguise a sufficient quantity of aqua simplex or dr batess hydropeg to reckon the value of two or three guineas for and so save the charge of a dispensatory costly malignant composition the judgment of the physician will never make either a bad medicine valuable or him so who has no good ones any more than the tipping of the instruments will render a surgeon skilful or the sweetness of the syrups and conserves recommend either the dr that prescribes them or the apothecary that prepares them but a surgeon that knows not whether his instruments be good cannot be thought very expert any more than a doctor that knows not the medicines he prescribes the doctors having but newly set up and not made any great returns would have us suppose common and cheap medicines the best that the less stock may serve rich active medicines we cannot expect there they so complain against them they are but to cover the fraud of the exacting apothecaries but that they may not lose the small fish the poor are promised the most valued simples and the best chemical and galenical preparations at a small expense which if they cannot pay they must endeavor to get their patrons to do for them but whatever of the most valued simples may be found in the repository i will promise neither poor nor rich shall be able to purchase the best chemical preparations thence he says further  to demonstrate this i will remove the rubbish and lay before you the simples of the greatest virtue and best preparations supported by the best trials of chemistry and constant experience gold the great idol of mankind must be rejected as useless while it makes the world restless and anxious to obtain it it has in it self no active parts or energy to procure any effect it is not dissolvable by any humor in the body nothing there can alter it or be altered by it the compact heavy sluggish parts resist the impression of every animal agent which on the other side are secure from any power it has the golden pill in the twisting of the bowels by its weight only may open the passage but it costs you only for the use of it the leas gold on boles etc divert the mind from the taste only by the pleasure of seeing it adds nothing to the virtue and only a trifle to the expense the leaf may lie on the mouths of the vessels undissolved and it prevents the dissolving of purging and alterative pills if well gilded unless to your good fortune the cover happens to be broken  remark if the doctor would be plain i suppose gold is none of the rubbish he would have removed from the dispensary tho he would not have it come too much into the apothecaries shop but for the credit of chemistry and its greatest masters i must tell him he is not supported by its best trials the greatest physicians and chemists the world has had affirm it capable of preparation into very great medicines and even in substance it has been supposed by no small men to be of considerable efficacy witness the famed cure of the kings evil where gold must not be omitted or laid aside but the disease returns doctors themselves are very anxious to obtain this rubbish or they would never quarrel with the apothecaries for getting it from them and if it makes them so restless it must needs have active parts quod agit agit is undoubtedly true but methinks any man that experiences the getting of gold may be sensible how refreshing it is and how it sets all wheels agoing but to come a little nearer if gold were not dissolvable in any of our humors it does not follow that it may not be a medicine what humor will dissolve burnt hartshorn in the decoct album sulphur some gums woods stones and other things commonly used by doctors but that gold does not resist the impression of every animal agent the doctor might have known if he had been something of a chemist that body that the strongest aqua fortis will not work upon it easily tore to pieces by the addition of a little salarmoniack and then by the addition of a little spirit of urine precipitated into a powder perhaps the most active body in nature viz aurum fulminans which in some cases is not a contemptible medicine but when it shall be opened and volatilized it will do what the doctor never saw performed whether crude gold does either good or hurt taken inwardly is not very apparent i believe the doctor never saw the guts twisted an anatomist would hardly think it possible or was sure they were untwisted by the golden pill if the leaf may stop the mouths of the vessels which the doctor is not certain of the animal would not be secure from its power to obstruct which is sometimes profitable but the doctor be sure to contradict himself if it would prevent the dissolution of the pills it might sometimes be to the patients good fortune  but bezoar says he is rejected by most physicians who think on what they advise it has the use of the philosophers stone procures gold or much silver to every thing where it is a part it adds to the dose only two pence but the very name bezoardick makes the cheapest boles and juleps pass off at any price large pearls look well on a healthy skin but history does not tell us that which cleopatra drank improved her health the pearl juleps have their value from the cordial water and white sugar they may take it for the suture   or   pence the dose  remark the virtues of bezoar have not been found so great as the value the doctor is right here it may serve as an absorbent but other things easier to be purchased by young shopkeepers will do the same must be said of pearls unless radically dissolved greater effects have not been found by them given in substance than may be procured by oyster shells or the like but i am not of the doctors opinion that the pearl juleps take any of their virtue from the sugar unless to please the taste to which tho it be so grateful it is not so to a sick stomach and a feverish blood being apt to ferment and trun sour yet if any gentleman or lady is pleased to make use of either of these it is to be had at the shop at the college in warwick lane over against frosts coffeehouse and at the two gilded spires in st martins lane the doctor assures you cheap and good he goes on  ambergrease and musk are offensive to many from the name as well as scent corrupt the blood and spirits and by altering the breath make the use in perfumes more necessary the confections and waters are more wholesome without them etc  remark that ambergrease and musk corrupt the blood and spirits the doctor has never found by any certain experiment i believe but that they refresh the spirits most authors agree with doctor experience some persons have a peculiar disgust at the most innocent thing but otherwise grateful scents are very welcome to nature and the small quantity that is given they acting only by their flavor or odor makes the use of them cheap enough the doctors need not fear the charge of keeping a little of them  our precious stones cost little continues he and are worth nothing the hyacinth smaragd etc finely poudred are as useful as glass well prepared the famous confect of hyacinth sells two pence the dose oil of cinnamon or other chemical oils given but to few drops are to be esteemed at the most inconsiderable price in so small a quantity balm of gilead to be taken in drops or mixed up in pills these drops will rise to about a farthing each cochineal promises to impart its color to the blood and dismiss the paleness of the checks but we borrow it from the dyers at much less cost than the former  remark it is true the precious stones the doctors have ordered the apothecaries to keep and abused in physic are of very little worth unless they are large they show the igonrance of those that have prescribed them in their receipts but some are to be commended for beginning to be wiser chemical oils are of a great value as to use being the essences of those herbs that yield them but are commonly given in too small a quantity or not used as they ought to produce the effects they otherwise might that cochineal promises its color to the blood i never heard till now or that any suppose it will tinge the cheeks unless outwardly used this notable body is also given in too small a quantity to discover its effects tho the price of it need not hinder its use but the doctor had rather be in the fields  i divert you says he from the more pleasant prospect of the gardens fields woods rivers which plentifully afford us the most effectual and certain relief their value in the quantities used at one time are below any coin and the cooking in small proportions will not amount to much more  the flowers fruits and seeds the leaf root wood and bark are distilled simply or with water or spirit of wine beaten with sugar into conserves boiled into syrups compound the pounders troches and pills with water or wine make the decoctions and apozems the conserves in the dose are a farthing or two the syrups not much more pouders a penny the scruple or half a dram the famous gascoin powder without bezoar or   pence the dose waters distilled from spirit of wine therefore used in small quantities not dearer than a glass of wine but the ingredients better chosen or singly infused in a proper simple distilled water would prove more alexiterial and deserve the title of high rich cordial at a less expense when you have tasted the former cordials in your friends chamber have you not felt the tumult in your stomach of such a rabble of the spices which broiled by the fire disturb you an your aster and make you pity his condition under the often repeated doses the apozems hepatick splenetick diuretic or sudorifick are made at   d   d or   d the quart in spring water which divided and sent in little glasses rise beyond the price of burgundy you may hence judge of our oils ointments and plasters that the surgeon rewarded for his skill and care does not put you in mind of the cost he has been put to through the whole cure you are well acquainted with the prices of drugs imported as they are most of a hot spicy nature their dose can be but small the price proportionable if many are absurdly joined together the quantity of each is so much the less the treacle of  0 drugs does not claim a penny the dose  remark vegetables distilled simply are for the most part simple or no medicines can serve only for vehicles but when kept a little are commonly corrupted and some way ill tasted some fair times of the year is more wholesome than most of their preparations commonly in use if the sick could but walk out and take it the distilling some of them with simple distilled water yields nothing but simple distilled water and spirit of wine raises nothing from others a good pharmaceutick must know the nature of the thing and adapt his menstrums which the learned have not well done in the london dispensatory in many receipts the huddling up a farrago of different things with honey or sugar has not shown much of their skill or the reason of the composition of their pouders much appeared but our reformed doctor is of opinion that the ingredients insusd in a simple distilled water would be more alexiterial and be richer cordials than distilled from spirit of wine but i think the doctor cannot be excused of ignorance here for spirit of wine is certainly a better cordial than simple water every porter knows the differcence between the cock and the brandybottle but those things which are ordered to be distilled with spirit of wine by those that know what they do are full of oily parts which will not be extracted and mixed with simple water and to give all things in substance would so clog the stomach with the quantities of the husks that hold the small proportion of medicinal juices that no other effect would be produced but the oppression of nature a rabble of spices cannot be conjoined by any that would have their single virtues to be seen nor will they be broiled in spirit of wine by one that knows how to work and a small glass of a pure cordial spirit i will engage shall remain more grateful to the stomach of sick or well than half a pint or a pint of a muddy loathsome infusion or decoction that will corrupt in a few days time but i hope the doctors of the dispensary will not pretend to keep oils ointments and plasters these belong to the surgeon unless they will be so kind also as to let him have them at the intrinsic value that he may no more be cheated by the apotheracy the surgeon is now become the honestest fellow of all whatever he may be for healing those sores that wontt be well without internal remedies he outdoes the dipensary men by their own confession he demands not so much as the cost he has been at but is contended to be sufficiently paid for his skill care and pains the dispensary will reckon   s a day for medicines but why may not the apothecary be as honest as either and keep a few ordinary herbs and cheap drugs and cook them in his pipkin and reckon nothing but for his skill and visits i should think what is sauce for a goose might be sauce for a gander also but says the doctor further  you may judge of the easy expense of what we advise by another view the various operations the famous vomitive is a penny tartar emetick not a farthing that of the salt no more oximel the value of the first pills for the head stomach bowels of different force the price of a penny the alterative nephritick antihysterical pills made of cheap pouders are valuable only for the success i need not inform you how easily the fillings of steel are procured if you infuse them with bitter plants or boil to a syrup you will readily estimate a quart all the ecphractisk or deobstruents and aperitives incrassating or astringents agree in their great use and almost inexpressible cheapness it must be owned the purges of rhubard etc are otherwise to be prized but it is used but once a day and not hastily repeated etc  remark the doctor sets up another inch of candle that you may have another view of the cheap pennyworths he has at his shop this famous vomit is a penny per dose his headpills stomachpills bowelpills no more cheaper than tom saffolds    for    pence although too cheap in any mans own sense but the other that are valuable only for their success the true rule of valuing all remedies will often have no value at all a few doses of iron in a quart of water you may have very cheap aperitives and astringents the keys of our bodies of such great use can hardly have any price rubard indeed that so finely opens the backdore and shuts it after it you must pay a little dearer for now and then and if you meet with one of doctor harveys medici stercorarii he perhaps will prescribe you nothing else but he tells us farther  that out of these drugs many kinds of chemical medicines are prepared at the expense of only fire and the use of the glasses in great quantities if you pay for spirit of hartshorn salarmon etc tinct of castor ambersaffron the compound elixirs the acid spirits or their antagonists the fixed salts the vitriolate tartar or other digestives one shilling or two the ounce you will with the vehicle after many days use compute your daily expense of physic the porter that drinks a cup of stronger ale instead of many of the smaller saves his time and his pocket and is at a greater charge than the patient  remark if the doctor had been used to chemistry he would have known that its preparations are not made at the mere expense of fire and use of glasses which were it so would not be a small expense in many preparations great fires are used and glasses serve but once sometimes not once but break and lose a thing of great value besides there is sometimes a large expense of time the most precious thing of all and a great deal of labor the very cheapness of the chemical spirits tinctures fixed salts etc has arose much from the sophistication and tho the doctor before disliked spirituous and active medicines he now commends them by the example of the prudent porter who saves time and pocket he might have said heart and belly too by drinking a little of the stronger ale medicines of active parts are really the most convenient like keen instruments unless they happen in the hands of fools or madmen that cut and slash they known not why but says he  if in a fever the smallpox etc the physician cools the blood and tempers the heat shall the apozem of almost the saller herbs with cheap sweetning pouders and cheaper sal prunella etc and julep of simple waters made to taste a little of a cordial water raise the cost higher than common sapports in health if the blood and spirits are oppressed in the malignant shall the treacle mithridate etc the aromaticks and alexiterials etc be esteemed but from their effects of sweating and heating the blood if the patient be not incessantly plied and the physician will have care when he has done enough for one day and will give the patient a little rest before he sets him another task if the fever truly intermits has no malignity etc you may use the bark only prepared by poudering which costs no more than the wine you drink it with i have heard you extol the wonderful force of opiates from your experience in cholick and nephritick pains it is true that plant has no equal among the vegetables nor does any metal or mineral pretend to rival it but the richest preparation of this great anodyne raises no in quietude upon any other circumstance the poor may have it as well as the richest from a small charity which will give the donor the ease it procures to the patients pain it is not therefore demonstrated that in sickness no constitution can bear the use of more than two or three shillings value in a day the dearest cordial waters and alexiterial pouders cannot in the time be used above that price without inflaming the blood and spirits into a delirium and forcing our common putrid fevers into malignant the milder diaphoreticks diuretics and alteratives dont pretend to be rated with the other but in our common fevers these assist nature the others destroy it  remark in fevers and smallpox tho the doctor seels his sallets and other coolers or his sweetning pouders with his simple juleps very cheap yet his cooling and exhausting the blood and thereby checking the motion of nature in casting off the morbifick matter often costs the patient dear even his life if in fevers more malignant treacle mithridate and aromaticks etc are to be esteemed for their virtues of sweating and heating the blood how can they be condemned so in milder fevers and why may not the cooling apozems be used here where there is more heat but why may not doctor err in cooling and fixing too much as soon as in heating and dissolving too much i should think either method may tire the patient or nature it self but if those things are given which ought to be given viz proper medicines it is natural to suppose they ought not to be any gravamen but a levamen to nature the bark is most of it faise and every doctor does not know the true or best way to give it and the false will cost a man dear sometimes opium is a thing of great force but it has a malignity in it which none of our common artists know how to separate without spoiling it if that were done a dose might deserve a doctors fee but i cannot yield to the doctor that it has not its equal among the vegetables there are many other poisons as effectual and if skilfully prepared of good use tho none so much used nor can i be persuaded but that there are many plants that have as eminent virtues for their proper ends without so much malignity as opium metals and minerals i must tell him pretend to exceed it the anodyne sulphur of venus has its virtue without its poison but the doctor will laughed at that as a chymera the ignorant will deny the being of that which is beyond their skill but i must tell him we chemists have known rest procured by a preparation of copper when opinium would not do it the doctor thinks he has demonstrated that no patient can well take more than   or   shillings a day in physic but if he had well demonstrated what they ought to expend in fees for the intrinsic value of advice we might have had more encouragement to come to their shop i wish he has shown how cordial alexiterial medicines cure in malignant fevers and destroy in the commons and that the mild assist nature only in these but not in the other but to go on says the doctor  wheres then the mystery of raising the bill to       or   pounds each day by the artifice of raising the part equal to the whole and sending the apozem or julep in little parcels the electuary is sold well at   s   d but the boles come to each as much tho it afford to children  0 boles the contrivance of giving in a parcht mouth furd throat and nauseating stomach an ill tasted bole when the languishing patient can swallow nothing but liquids has been reserved for this age the bole of fulsom conserve or treacle is to be taken every  d  th or  th hour which dispels all rest etc there is a little julep ready to wash it down and this is of the greatest consequence to the apothecary because the town has been used to pay   s   d for each bole and not much less for the draught to cleanse the mouth after it this advice was given to a physician at his first entrance on the stage to order a bole with a draught every fourth hour which however it fare with the patient would recommend him to the apothecaries  the honest physician mixes the bole and julep together that the feeble patient may drink his cordial to revive and compose him without the disturbance of taking it at twice and with difficulty the other way  remark there is now no mystery of raising the bill to so many pounds since the doctor has discovered it it is well when men begin to have some conscience and discover one another unlawful gains the contrivance of giving illtasted and fulsom either boles or any thing else muddly horrid decoctions and infusions at any time is not proper for a nauseating or well stomach a furd throat or parcht mouth and whatever they are mixed with to delude the stomach to admit them it commonly suffers for it afterward i do not wonder at the advice given to the doctor at his first entrance on the stage nor do i think the mountebank if he knew his interest did reject it but it is a strange character of an honest physician or dispensarydoctor that he is one that mixes his bole and julep together and will not let his patient have the pleasant relish of the liqor at last without the horrid taste of the bole i hope he will order hi some fine simple thing or other seeing he can afford things so cheap to wash both away in my opinion it would be the part of a more honest or at least wiser physician never to give any thing that will disturb his patient but says the doctor  i presume you will allow the corollary that by much physic divided into little parcels and rated high the apothecary has in the reward of his attendance which by the physician is often excused much greater fees often trebly or quadruply more than the faculty you will not be surprised if it be asserted that in a bill of  0 l nine are the rewards of his advice and attendance the people must accuse their own conduct who never gratifying the apothecarys visits oblige him to bring in for every   or   hours and several days as much as will answer one of the ends he proposes to himself can he thus neglected by his customers with safety to himself advise the waters milk temperance repose exercise a peculiar diet or the country air by which obstinate diseases are cured to the reproach of the compositions of the shop but what redress can be expected to these grievances there must be certain rates set to all the medicines with the greatest encouragements to the apothecaries to prepare them faithfully they must bring their number by the most proper methods to be equal to the occasion the city has for using their preparations the former antiquated methods must be revived by which the people were east without the present either suspicions or complaints the physicians lay under no temptation to impose on the public they advised at their own houses in the chronical or less dangerous disorders and distinguished in their visits the differences of the condition of the persons and diseases and arrived to a reputation not by the basest arts but their care and the merit of the success  remark the burden of this long song against the apothecaries is still that they are too numerous for the doctors and get as much or more money for their medicines than the doctors can for advice but after all this outcry against them for multiplying the numbers of themselves and medicines he confesses the peoples conduct is to be accused as the cause as these evils by not gratifying the apothecary with fees for his visits and so obliging him to bring in so many medicines as will answer one end he proposes viz a lielyhood if the people would be but so wise as to give the apothecary his fee for advice or attendance and the college would be so good as not to persecute him for taking it he might afford his wares as cheap as the shopkeepers in warwick and st martinslanes and might advise his patients the most compendious and easy method and do for them as he would for himself or own family he might keep a smaller and more select number of remedies and advise the waters milk temperance repose etc and live as well as the other tradesmen and do the people more good and less harm at less charge than he does by every   or   hours repetaturs and cure stubborn diseases by hindering the sick from taking the reproachful physic either of the new or old shops but the redress the doctor proposes of these grievances i think is ridiculous viz the apothecaries to encourage them to prepare their remedits faithfully and give but few of them must have their medicines rates at a small price by the doctors which were it reasonable could not easily be done by those gentlemen not yet well skilled in drugs and preparations yet this will not do alone their numbers must be reduced to equal the occasion the city has for their preparations how shall we know what numbers will serve or what occasions the city may have for their preparations some affected chemist would say the city has no occasion for any galenical stuff and i to be free must say for most of it but what are the proper methods to reduce them or which ought to be discarded that the remnant may live by selling a few medicines of small value shall they be condemned to be hanged and cast lots to save one in ten shall the greatest part be pressed to fight the french put in the front and be slain by the sword or the enemy for being so unfortunate as to possess the fair lady pecunia which the ruling doctors are so passionately in love with but after all i must tell him i hate this wicked monopolizing policy of men that would get a good trade into few hands this is not the way to have the people served honestly when they cannot go to him that will use them best but the commodities are engrossed and sold by a combination if the apothecaries do increase more in proportion than other people their own increase will destroy them the trade will be good for nothing and none will put their sons to it but their apprentices serving   when other trades do but   years would persuade one they cannot outgrow their trade  what the antiquated methods are the doctor talks of as desirous to have revived i dont know but such they must be that the people will not easily suspect or complain of the cheat but be easy under it while the doctors easily get their money but if such a method were ever in use or may be contrived where the physicians lie under no temptation to impose on the public that i should be for and such wherein they might arrive to reputation not by base arts but by their care and the merit of their success that i should extremely like but i think our honest doctors and merchants have not yet proposed any such method neither shall i now attempt it but rather expect it in the honest countryphysicians answer to this long and tedious epistle  chap iv the countryphysicians answer sir that i may not wholly balk your expectation or neglect any thing wherein i may possibly do my country any service i shall in as few words as i can give you my opinion of the medicinal war you sent me an account of and the best methods i can think of to bring it to an end so that the country which is the seat of the war may now and hereafter feel the least of its ill effects you know no one that can be a capable judge of these matters to be less interested than i who have not practiced these many years with apothecaries or in any confederacies who have done nothing to oblige them or disoblige them or had any dependence upon them or any others belonging to the faculty for business or medicines to use in it being by profession a clean independent in medicine and so resolve to stand on my own legs or fall  and i must tell you in the first place that i perceive the ground of the quarrel here is the very same as of that between the french and the emperor selfinterest and the strongest party i believe will never yield to any thing but for their own advantage and were i plenipotentiary in the affair no articles of reconciliation should ever be concluded between them so as to unite them into a new confederacy there are too many of them combined still and the single parties at difference are either of them potent enough to be often too hard for the people what the doctor owns in his conclusion would be very good could it but be effected viz that the physician lie under no temptation to impose upon the people and have no way to arrive to reputation but by his care and the merit of his success it would be a happy world if physicians some of the most obnoxious men in it to temptations were liable to none the rest of men would doubtless be free if they could not be tempted to impose on the public and had no way to raise a reputation but by their care and success very few i think would be of any great repute but the strengthening of parties and confederacies to oppress others or create dependencies is not the way to do this happy thing for their souls and the peoples bodies but i will tell you in few words the best policy to make them honest and secure the people is to break both the armiss that not a man of them may act but in his single capacity let there be none to command none to obey none accessory but whosoever is capable of the business of a physician let him be principal and act in his concern independent upon any but to leave allegorizing and to represent the matter to you plainly the true method to raise the reputation of physicians and to secure the people as much as may be from any damage they might sustain by them is this  that every man that undertakes to act as a physician be skilled in all things pertaining to the art and that he himself perform or at least actually see performed whatever belongs to the cure of human bodies that there be no such thing as doctor surgeon and apothecary as distinct and dependent faculties but that the one thing the physician be all of them advising preparing dispensing his own remedies and doing whatever belongs to a surgeon for his patient with his own hands here every man will stand and fall to himself having no dependency on others and himself reap the fruit of his own doings whether good or evil  the one grand design of physic is the recovery of the patients but there is a second thing which a physician may honestly intend his own advantageous reputation or if you will honorable advantage  to the attaining of these two ends as well as may be it is most necessary that the practitioner himself be so well accomplished that he might act of himself independently and so perform whatever belongs to his profession that this is the only true method of physic wherein its ends may be best attained may soon evidently appear if we consider a little whosoever would deserve the name of a physician ought not only to be very well read in physiology and pathology but to be versed in experimental philosophy the ground of all physical science to have well studied nature in its entire and sound state and then to proceed to the knowledge of its defects in order to remove them but if a man may be supposed to be never so well acquainted with the phenomena and nature of diseases yet if he be ignorant of medicine the means to remove them his other knowledge is to little purpose but he will be ignorant of the means to remove diseases if he is not skilled in pharmacy if he does not understand the materia medica the natures and properties of those bodies that are to be used in healing and the proper methods and reasons of adapting them to the use of the sick whatever he has of liberal learning is to little purpose he must be a good apothecary and especially chemist or he can never bring those bodies he would use effectually to perform their ends in nature but if he could be supposd to understand these things in any tolerable degree without practicing them he may still be at a loss the remedies he may prescribe may not be to be had may be only pretended or not duly prepared whereby he may lose the desired effect to his own discredit and the damage of his patients what authors say of remedies is not always true and their goodness often depends on a nicety of preparation which by mischance carelessness or unskilfulness in operation often become good for nothing and sometimes not only so but virulent and hurtful to trust to an author for the virtue of a remedy we have never made and dont understand the nature of to rely on an apothecary or chemist who has no other design or skill but to make and sell to the best advantage is not at all safe and will not be done by a man that duly values his patients welfare and his own reputation the preparing of remedies with ones own hand is necessary not only in order to their exact and faithful preparation but in the very operation there is often more seen of the reason and nature of the thing than can be found from all authors put together and a great part of natural philosophy is manifest and practically illustrated by the analysis and synthesis of bodies in short a physician ought to be so well versed in his business that if there were no books nor no venders of medicines he would know which way to go to work to provide himself a sufficient apparatus for the curing of all diseases he designs to meddle with again as external and internal diseases are often complicated and dependent one upon another fevers and other distempers break out into abcesses etc wounds bruises etc produce fevers deliria and the like it is as necessary that the surgeons hand should grow upon the physicians arm as that the physicians brain should move and direct it will it not be a disgrace to a physician as well as a damage to the patient that he must sit staring upon the distressed object while a surgeon who is not always to be found is sent for in a case where phlebotomy is instantaneously required is it not indeed dishonorable as well as disadvantageous to him and his patient that he is but one limb of a healer and must be beholden to another perhaps wooden leg called in distinction a surgeon to perfect the cure of a bubo carbunkle etc one who is supposed if not wished to be ignorant of the internal causes springs and effluxes of those putrid fountains or shall a surgeon not blush to be so little a physician as that his head cannot work as well as his hand must he needs call for one who perhaps has not studied the internal fomes of an ulcer to prescribe him an internal medicine without which it cannot be healed must he never let blood in the most needful case without the advice of one that cannot do it or must the patient be at the charge of   distinct operators when one may and ought to do all better at the charge of one of them besides this three legged stool has often one leg defective or shorter than another by which defect the weak patient often falls to the ground when he might have been upheld held by one solid basis till he was able to rise and walk the doctor a surgeon if ignorant of one another business will be very liable to counterwork one another or if ever so well skilled they will divide the care the surgeon will not so much value the success of what he does merely by the doctors order and the doctor will not reckon himself to blame if the surgeon does not perform his part well so the apothecary to come again to the  d noun adjective which with the other   are now adays thought convenient and able to be equivalent to a substantive the healer he will be satisfied either with health or death or long sickness of the patient if he has but supplied him with things according to the order of the doctor and he who is supposed to sit at the helm of life and death if the vessel miscarry will be apt to lay the blame upon the errors or disobedience of some one or other of the mariners but the little ship of mans body being within the reach and guidance of one only artist he will have more care to perform what is requisite to its safety because he only will have the honor the reward or the blame of his good or ill success i cannot forbear taking notice of another mistake somewhat akin to what we have been discoursing and that is this it is supposed that in the multitude of counselors there is safety when applied to physicians as for apothecaries and surgeons tho they be never so well skilled or chance to see farther into the case than the doctor or have a better remedy than he knows if they offer any thing he will take it in disdain and no way admit what they shall insinuate of which i could give instances but even in a consult of doctors there is indeed less safety the disgrace or the credit will be divided amongst them whence the care of the sick will be the less they will put the most celebrated to write tho the greatest blockhead none will much disagree with the rest and if any one has a private remedy more effectual he will not advise that or the rest admit it without discovering what it is they will easily agree not to disgrace the faculty by contradicting one another who if they were separate they would be quot homines tot sententiae but one of the doctors being more skilful than the rest if he were to act alone would act freely whenas she most knowing being commonly the most modest will be shy to be most forward or to differ from the rest but will leave the prescribing to the most proud and confident whom he will easily suffer to run away with the credit or blame of the success and content himself with his fee but if any one with a more than ordinary concern for the patient dislikes what the others advise and offers a nostrum or particular method they will be much disgusted and perhaps say as in a case i might name it is a collegecase it must not be  but it would go better with the sick if instead of a consult of doctors at the patients house the one physician he thinks fit to employ would consult in his own behalf diverse of his honest brotherhood and consider their opinions and so act according as he shall then judge but there are diverse objections i foresee may be made against this method of single and independent practice which must be answered before i can well conclude the subject and they are of two sorts either such as relate to the method it self or to the method in relation to and under the present circumstances of doctors surgeons and apothecaries  as to the first it may be said it is indecorous for a physician to be concerned with manuals dishonorable for him who must converse with the greatest personages it is enough to make a lady that is well fall sick to have her pulse felt by a rough brown hand but i say whatever may be the niceness of a beauish doctor or however a lady that is wantonly sick may like a finical fellow that is the most honorable and decorous hand that can bring the sick most help  optima si profert medicus medicamina morbis non pigeat prunis applicuisse manus a squeamish doctor cannot more nauseate any thing conducing to the health of men than the handling some chirurgical cases incident to all sorts of people but being the members of his fellow creatures his helpful hand cannot abhor with honor or honesty to do that for another he would need and think reasonable in the like case to be done for himself nor is it more honorable to shake the urinal vel stercus bacculo agitare yea or to turn over the leaves of moldy wormeaten authors to inspect the relicts of antiquity than to open the book of nature it self with ones own hands in dissections of animals and the materia medica tho there be something both like butchers and colliers work belonging to it the greatest men have done it those whom we are not ashamed to follow as masters but might with like industry outgo as far as they did those that went before them nothing but the basest pride can disdain to use those hands god has given us to the best purposes or think mechanics dishonorable which the greatest persons i may say person that ever appeared on the stage of the world disdained not to practice but  a more material objection and indeed seeming difficulty is this that it is a thing too great a task too heavy for one man to be well skilled in and to perform all things belonging to the art of healing to which i reply that as it is no way dishonorable but very much to a mans credit to have both a head and a hand capable of doing whatever belongs to his art so it is possible and with diligence attainable any boy of a genius capable of doing any thing praiseworthy in physic if he be not abused may by    have language enough to read any latin authors and also have made a considerable progress in the greek which by use and the help of translations which are annexed to most greek authors he may in time complete as for other languages they are not so necessary there being enough in these and in learning of these tongues he may have read some books of physiology or natural philosophy in   or   years more spent in diligent reading and the practice of experimental philosophy and pharmacy with the sight of cases managed by his teachers he may arrive to a capacity of doing creditably something of what he has seen others do in all the parts of healing if he will but have the modesty and honesty not to undertake all cases rare and difficult which many times puzzle men of  0 years practice he may in that time be so far expert in all that belongs to the cure of diverse diseases as that he may honestly and courageously undertake to cure em but it will still be objected by those that would be thought worthy of a large practice that the pharmaceutick and chirurgick parts of healing cannot be attended by reason of the many visits the importunity of the sick obliges em to but it may be answered in many cases visits are not necessary the patients may come home to the doctors and take the medicines home with them in some they need not be seen so often and besides an ingenious servant a pupil will quickly come to take off a great deal of the labor and care in preparation and dispensation and conveyance of medicines there are some preparations made by those that have nothing to do in medicine as common spirit of wine and diverse others in which there can be no considerable deceit which the physician need not trouble himself to make but above all if physicians would apply themselves particularly to the cure of some few diseases some to these some to others they might be therein more expert and easily provided with all things necessary for their particular practice without those defects and damages to the sick which arise from the common division of the physicians work in every disease between two or three persons each of whom is usually unskilled in some part of that which belongs to the cure of any one distemper as if some would apply themselves to the cure of all sorts of fevers others the gout and scorbute others the pox etc and would undertake nothing but what they are well provided for they might have more business perhaps or at least enough and more credit and the patients much more comfort but perhaps there may be some large souls that can neither be contented to subserve a clyster to spill the balsam of life by command nor yet to be skilled in the cure of but some particular diseases that think it little in a physician if he is not omnibus numeris completus and cannot undertake all diseases i say to these brave souls if they will but scorn to pretend they may by industry arrive to a capacity of honestly professing themselves catholic physicians provided they will not covet nor undertake more patients than they can well provide for and by their industry can be so happy as to acquire a few effectual and catholic remedies and i think they may get money enough tho they have no underworkmen and being greater credit to their profession and be a greater blessing to the age and places they live in i will profess as to my self tho i refuse no cases except lithotomy and some few that require accommodations in a physicians house i desire no more patients than i can sufficiently provide for with my own hand and eye in whatsoever belongs to inward and outward operations and if any singular case happens that i do not well see into i can be content to consult my friends of the faculty for my information not to the patients charge or refer him to any of them that he or i or any friend can judge more expert in the case and what money cannot be honestly and ingenuously got i think is too much and a burden that will but help to sink a man into misery and a mighty practice tho tolerably well performed for the real good of mankind is but a life of mighty care and perplexity not to be desired by a wise man for his own sake but rather to be prevented by teaching the rules of health communicating to other physicians his skill and a modest refusal of cases he does not yet thoroughly understand  but as to those objections that may arise against this method of practice as relating to the present state of physicians surgeons and apothecaries in the city and herewith to consider more directly the state of the controversy between the doctors and apothecaries it will be said the apothecaries are not so well skilled in physiology pathology and the use of medicines as they should be and so are incapable of single practice i answer it is granted of a great part of them and it is true of many of those that call themselves doctors but they of both sorts might be capable of practice if they would desire skill as much as money it will be likewise said the doctors are not skilled in pharmacy chemistry or surgery but it is to be answered they may be if pride covetousness and laziness do not hinder em from doing their duty but it cannot be denied that some of the apothecaries are as well skilled in all these things and so as fit to practice as some of the doctors their antagonists yea even of the dispensarymen who swell so magisterially had not some of them as mean education as any were not some of them bred apothecaries or less to the purpose was not the very acetabulum of the college bred to very little language hardly a clean englishman under a country apothecary who he himself says was very little skilled even in his own profession can a license be supposed to inspire with sufficiency in an instant or can another bred a mere scholar incapable of divine preferment by jacobitism undetermined to physic of a sudden become a doctor by a university patent and a complete artist in the medicinal faculty with whom a man of  000 l a year may trust his life and precious enjoyments i must confess i never got any skill on a sudden by such inspirations i remember what persius says as to poetry  nec font labra prolui caballino nec in bicipiti somniasse parnasso memini ut repent sic poeta prodirem so say i as to physic  i know not when sleeping in phoebus beams my heated pate was filled with physic dreams so that i waking found my self a man inspired with skill a good physician but the honest part of the college as they call themselves have set up shops where medicines shall be well and honestly prepared and those mischiefs that have arose from trusting apothecaries avoided and so the method proposed is to them needless i answer it must here be confessed that they are so far commendable as that they owning some of the faults they have been guilty of profess to do something better but what they do will not be enough they are not yet well skilled in pharmacy especially the chief part of it pyrotechny their servants are not better skilled than the apothecaries nor can they have that care of the success of their masters practice as a man would of his own the blame will not lie upon them the masters dont always see what they do nor can they always teach them what they should do neither masters nor servants have affurd the people of more skill or honesty than in the old way but if any of them were real artists and had any great things they would not communicate them but if they used them must so far act singly according to our method but the force of the objection against the method i propose lies in this that considering the doctors and apothecaries are singly defective in not understanding the whole that belongs to the art of healing they must practice some way or other dependently or not at all and if the greatest part should leave off practice   how should they live   how shall the people be supplied in their necessities i answer many of them have got enough already and may very well leave off and take care of securing their own health in another life by repentance or refuse to undertake what they cannot do as they should till they can do their duty but those that have not already laid up of the mammon of unrighteousness had better leave off quite and take to something they can more honestly perform than abuse their neighbors and ruin their own souls they can have no better plea to continue in an evil practice than bauds and whores who have not been bred to any other employment but as to the other plea how the people shall be served i answer it is a question whether the present dependent practice of physic taking one time with another does more hurt or good and to try the experiment by leaving off physic for   or   years till some ingenious men were better accomplished perhaps might be worth the peoples while but there are some that follow our method and have always done so who might be more useful than some of them are were the magisterial and haughty way of practice by prescribing out of request and were the practitioners by patent no way able to persecute or molest those that are most capable of doing the physicians duty but it will still be replied it will signify but little to persuade men against their interest the thing which all men so vigorously prosecute i answer if what i have said be not sufficient to persuade physicians that it is their interest to be honest and well accomplished in their profession i would leave them and address my self to the suffering people especially those that govern and propose to them two ways whereby physicians might be excellently accomplished for their business and so more profitable to the people for presupposing the persons be sufficiently accomplished in languages and to have a genius to philosophical and medicinal studies or not to be admitted they should either serve not ignorant apothecaries or doctors but able independent physicians as their pupils faithfully to be instructed a sufficient number of years on proper conditions as medicine was taught of old or  ly that there shall be erected at london a school of medicine wherein shall always be a sufficient number of skilful practitioners of all parts of medicine who should not only theoretically but practically teach the pupils all things that belong to the profession and none should be suffered to practice in england but such as being fit for admission had gone through all things belonging to the art by continuance in this school so many years as should be thought or rather found sufficient to qualify them which of these two methods would be the best i shall not now determine either might be preferred in different respects the last perhaps would be most liked as seeming most honorable the former might by an able master be more easily accomplished and both very well agree with what hippocrates proposes in lege  etc quisquis enim medicinae scientiam sibi vere comparare volet eum hisce iti oportet natura doctrina loco studiis apto institutione a

or natural genius to the art has been instructed from his youth in a place accommodated with all things necessary to perfect his skill who has hereto added the industry of a long time and ripened his studies to the bringing forth of plenteous fruit not every apothecary in his eight years apprenticeship has been thus completed nor have many doctors tho they have supposed themselves to come full blown out of the universities been much better accomplished nay i will affirm that there is no public method now in use in england whereby men are sufficiently instructed in all that belongs to the art of medicine but were the nation as willing to spare some thousands to promote the art of preserving men from diseases as they have been to part with millions to defend them from the french who have perhaps slain more by their pox than sword there should be a method proposed for a school of medicine every way so adapted to promote the art and perfect the artist that no reasonable man should be able to find fault with it  postscript the doctor complains much of the largeness of the apothecaries bills but i believe he cannot give us a specimen of any larger than what have been extended only by the prescriptions of some that would be thought of the honest part of the college or of any bills so large as their fees as appears in an account i lately had from an honest and worthy cityphysician that honest dr t and honest dr p while he was better friends with the apothecaries lengthened out their obsequious porters bill in a year and   quarters to   0 l a sum enough to tempt the doctors to set up shops and become ambodexters to receive fees in one hand and bills in the other but had in the time extracted  00 guineas for themselves as fees for advising the patient to purchase the large cargo of drugs which yet was not enough to cure him of his supposed disease of nocturnal pollutions he had sometimes which they frighted him with as some terrible thing when he was in perfect health abating the purgatory of physic and wanted no remedy but an honest she companion to take off the superfluity of a laudable constitution and yet the doctor complains as if the physicians had not their due proportion and share with the apothecaties  sic clodius accusat maechos catilina cethegum  finis remarks upon dr ps late bill and his postscript dr p the scribe to the company of traders that call themselves the dispensary or dr apothecaries in his late bill of sale has these few things remarkable  first that he dedicates it and addresses himself to the pagan god terminus whom whether he has chosen his peculiar deity as most likely to terminate the money of the sick at the dispensary i shall not determine or whether his religion is pagan christian medical or composita    he says nothing in it more to his purpose than what he said in his other bills    his design apparent in them all is to get patients customers and thereby money it cannot be supposed that    leeches in our corrupt times should combine to carry on the trade merely for the public good    the means he still uses is no more than all quacks use viz to cry up themselves their skill and honesty and the goodness and cheapness of their remedies their nostrums and arcanas and to tell of their great practice and at the same time to decry others    that to catch much fish it is necessary to continue casting the net one impression of bills will never bring in a trade    that he sells his bills contrary to the charitable custom of other quacks who give them gratis the shortest of which at a penny a piece may rob the people of above   l more than the intrinsic value    that if the college be the standard of what is creditable in physicians it is now no shame to put out bills to get patients    that he has spent seven lines of his half sheet in a postscript in answer to the author of bellum medicinale in which he accuses him  first of prosing an odd method of bringing physic and surgery together to which he replys  that the odness of the method is no argument against the goodness and necessity thereof but his method was not only to bring physic and surgery together but to add pharmacy also to them as a third thing without which the healer cannot be his craftsmaster    he accuses him that he has exposed all the doctors and apothecaries to which he replys  that his accuser hereby owns that they are capable of being exposed but he never designed to expose or thinks he has exposed any of either party but those that deserve it and if any particular person thinks himself touched it is the application makes the ass    for using chemical medicines only but he replys  that he never professed to do so in his book or otherwise but thinks him no very wise man that shall spend time labor and money on any chemical preparation where a more easily preparable medicine will do as well whether specific or other but yet thinks it very well worth his while to work some even tedious chemical preparations knowing that there are effects in healing to be wrought by chemical medicines which no crude simples or compounds have ever been found sufficient for but    he says he is no chemist not knowing that aqua regis dissolves gold only from the spirit of salt in the sal armoniack but he excuses him that the experiment may be too costly for him to which he answers if he that does not know that aqua regis dissolves gold only from the spirit of salt in the sal armon is no chemist then dr p is the man by his own argument will be proved to be no chemist for that which is not true is not known to be so but it is not true that aqua regis dissolves gold only from the spirit of salt in the sal ammoniac for all that know the nature and uses of spirit of salt know it is no apt menstrum to dissolve gold without the association of spirit of niter which of it self will not do it but by both in conjunction it is readily done but the spirit of niter being the greatest part of the dissolvent has undoubtedly the greatest share in the action so it cannot be only from that part which of it self or only is not sufficient whatever will not do alone can never be the only thing that does but suppose dr p should be told that tho there is materially yet there is formally no spirit of salt in sal ammoniac that salt is not spirit of salt and that he never saw a true spirit of salt in his life i dont know how he would be able to make out the contrary but the author of bellum medicinale to prove against the doctor the action or passion of an animal substance with gold did not say that common salt is properly an animal substance tho it is hardly ever wanting in mans body or that the volatile salt in the sal ammoniac was the efficient of the solution of gold in aqua regis whatever it may confer toward the effect but added what the doctor did not care to take notice of in his postcript viz that spirit of urin which certainly is an animal substance precipitates the dissolved gold into aurum flminans in which operation the spirit of urin has without all doubt some action or passion with gold the calx of gold made only with aqua regis having no fulminating property  as for the costliness of the experiment whether the spirit of salt only dissolves gold in aqua regis if the doctor supposes   or  00 guineas must be spent or that the gold must be dissolved by pounds it is confessed the experiment might be so costly twere better being ignorant in the matter and skilled only in some slight whereby one might finger so much of the metal but the doctor i must needs say talks here as if he were no chemist and could never spare his gold to make the trial for chemists know how to reduce their gold again with very little loss but farther i will engage to teach any man how he may make ten experiments of this matter for five pence charge tho he should not recover the gold used in the trial but the  fifth and last thing laid to the charge of the author of bellum medicinale is  that in his postscript he makes the dotors sum   0 l too much and probably  0 or  0 l concluded the apothecarys bill to which he answers he will tell the doctor a story and so leave him  there was a gentleman on a time traveling on the rode and he fell among thieves who robbed him as he testified before a justice of      l  0 s but whereas he was foolishly decoyed into their hands and very cowardly suffered himself to be robbed by persons not so well armed as himself he was ashamed like a man cheated by an alchymist or a whore to prosecute the felons and so never stirred in the matter or sought to apprehend them but after some time it happened that they were discovered by another person hating villainy and accused of the theft but when they came to answer for themselves they pleaded that they were very honest men and were abused by their accuser for they took but     l from the gentleman you silly rogues says the judge you have condemned your selves by acknowledging the fact and a robbery great enough there is now no need of farther evidence or of the gentlemans testimony for the larger sum yet if he can be prevailed with to appear against you the fact shall be made out in all its circumstances to your greater shame but what you own you took is enough to make you rogues that deserve to be hanged with other villains god give you repentance and so lord have mercy upon you but  the cheater under friendships guise is worse than he that bids me stand and give my purse this hero plainly tells me what he would have and gives me leave to fight my coin to save against the other i have no defense the sneaking rogue hides under feigned pretense perhaps he frights me with supposed disease in embryo swears he seeks my health and ease pretends to purge the latent matter forth while he imbezles strength and money both and brings me down unto a tabid state then asses milk prescribes to make me fat when raised again the humors reabound then i am advised to take another round this is my doctors friendly discipline i lose my strength and health he gets my coin finis
