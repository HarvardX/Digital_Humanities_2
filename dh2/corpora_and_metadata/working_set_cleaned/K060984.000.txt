a fifth essay at removing national prejudices with a reply to some authors who have printed their objections against an union with england  printed in the year mdcvii  the preface i confess the occasions of my appearing in print again upon this subject are unexpected and as the writing a fifth essay is contrary to my real design and more so to my inclination i cannot but say something by way of introduction to it  the management of this present treaty i mean without doors has something in it peculiarly odd and to me very surprising reason and argument nay even demonstration cannot reach it men will argue against nay banter and be witty upon the several branches and yet at the end of the discourse profess they do not understand them  they will be silenct and yet not at all convinced they wont believe when they cannot reply when they own they gain by it they are not pleased when they fancy they are losers they are fond of complaining and when they cannot make it out rail on those that endeavor to confute them  words can have no effect on such persons no argument can touch them either they cannot or will not understand any thing but what they like bitterness possesses their souls and breaks out too much at their tongues and i must tell them i think i bear more than my share of this from them too and that without cause  it is hard gentlemen that an attempt calmly to remove prejudices and i am sure i have done it both calmly and cautiously should fill any body with prejudices at the author scotland has been in some reputation for courtesy to strangers and i should be very sorry you should break in upon that part of your character only with a reconciler an attempt to remove prejudices can have nothing in it unless that the truths spoken move the spleen of some who would not be reconciled and therefore cannot bear the demonstration  nor would i be mistaken here i am far from being concerned at the ribauldry of the street calling my name about to every ballad making me the author of papers i never saw when gentlemen lampoon one another calling it mine and the like this is an old method taken with me and i am used to it  my muse must be the whore of poetry and all apollos bastards laid to me   the gentlemen are welcome and the mob of writers by all their witticisms shall only provoke me to silence i remember and i wish some other gentlemen here would take the hint as i do  my lord rochester advising my lord  not to reply to satyr and lampoon has these two merry lines fellows that never were heard or read of if thou writst on will write thy head off   others i am told are furnishing themselves with scandal and design to answer my arguments with personal reflection  i thank god my life however mixed with misfortunes has not been such that i am ashamed to see it in print nor shall i offer any capitulations with such gentlemen only entreat them for their own sakes to say nothing but what is true  and then to add at the bottom of their story what mighty signification it has to the argument in hand  when our savior had healed the man born blind and he appearing before the elders answered them with a testimony to the divinity of the healer which they could not reply to viz that he must be god since nothing of a man could have wrought such a cure  to answer the conviction of his reasoning they fall upon the poor man thou were altogether born in sin and do thon teach us  and they cast him out  and yet after all what the poor man said was very true   now gentlemen if what i say be true why will you not hear it if not true why will ye not answer it  let the author be never so despicable or mean in your eyes he is in no mans meaner than in his own but truth in the meanest hand deserves your regard accept the truth and use the author as you like he is perfectly unconcerned about that  but all this does not yet reach the matter which i complain of but i think it hardest when gentlemen who pretend to answer what pinches them in fact charge me with falsities wrong representing things and the like and to make it out give their own assertions only without the least proof either to make good their own or detect mine  when gentlemen reflect on what i have wrote as not true and use me ill on that head at the same time contradicting it with nothing but what is manifestly false imposing upon the world their own affirmative without proof against arguments which are and can be proved by undoubted and undeniable authority this i must own is using a stranger very ill  i shall give but two or three instances of this here and shall meet with the rest as i go    st here is a gentleman tells me in print that the small beer in england does pay more than   sh   d per barrel if sold for above   sh per barrel that the foreign salt pays  0 sh per busbel custom that there are duties and restrictions on the export of the english woollen manufacture and the like and this the gentleman calls a confuting my fourth essay  now as this wants but a short answer so that answer will detect the gentlemans ignorance first and then his forwardness of charging me without proof  it is true the act of parliament in england prescribes the excise to only two denominations of beer small and strong and that the small beer is strictly called   sh beer and i suppose in charity to him that he looked no further than the letter of the act  but if he thinks fit to examine the practice in england and the nature of the thing he will find three things    that there is no small beer sold in england at   shillings per barrel   that the household beer sold in london and parts adjacent at  0 sh per barrel and some at    sh per barrel pays no more excise than as small beer viz   sh   d per barrel and of this i can bring him several witnesses of people of both nations now here   that by the nature of the act it can be no otherwise since the act does not say all beer above   ss shall pay as strong beer but the word strong beer is governed by the usage of excise and is all sold as ale from    sh per barrel to above  0 sh if it is asked me why the act calls it   sh beer i answer because that act having been made above  0 year ago the small beer in those days was sold at that price and this excise being but in two heads or denominations as before the term needed no alteration though the price of sale was risen since it followed by the name of small beer that nothing could pay as strong that had not the first runnings of the malt  i need enlarge no further to prove the justice of my calculation or the unfairness of being charged here with imposing on the world  the second case is in the same gentlemans paper who tells me the duty on foreign salt is  0 ss per bushel and to insult me the more adds that it is by them that know it as well as i  now as this shows the gentlemans heat to run before his discretion i must tell him there can be no just comparison between any mans knowledge here since the acts of parl are plain in which the taxes upon salt are settled and that there may be no dispute on the difference of measure the bushel is determined to weigh    l weight avoir du pois and if he pleases to search the said acts and the english book of rates he will find the duty stands thus by the act   and   will and mary cap     d per gallon on foreign salt   and   william iii cap    the duty continued   and  0 william iii cap      d per gallon added  0 d per gallon  0 d per gallon    gallon to the bushel is  0 d or   sh   per bushel the subsidies and impost formerly laid amount to    d per bushel       0 or thereabout  either i am right or wrong if wrong let the acts of parliament decide that controversy if i am right  then this gentleman and his author who he says knows it as well as i have something more to account for to the world than an homest man cares to be charged with and if i had used him so i would frankly ask his pardon  as to the duties and restrictions on the woollen manufacture in england on export the    minute of parliament has answered and confuted it for me  i need say nothing in my own vindication after such an authority only recommend it to the gentleman himself to consider whether he has used either me or his country honestly  a fifth essay etc in the last essay i went through a great many branches of the popular objections raised in scotland against the union  i wish i could exactly distinguish between those that men raise only to oppose the thing in general and prevent the uniting the nations on any terms whatever and those which are really offered from honest scruple at the particulars  however whether i can distinguish them in their arguments or no i shall distinguish them as well as i can in the following discourse in which i shall have all due regard to honest reasoning and fair argument but not so much to cavil and frivolous or malicious opposition  i little thought it had been possible that any scotsman at least such as understand the affairs here could say that scotland does not gain by england in trade much less that you do or can trade abroad with equal advantages to other nations  i could not imagine any man would offer that it is your advantage to trade with france where you bring back nothing but what drains you of money and send little thither but what you ought to keep at home  less was it to be expected that men should publish in print that your trade will be ruined by an union with england  wherefore to all these heads i shall say something as plain and concise as i can if possible to remove the prejudices which are formed in the heads of the ignorant as if on purpose to set them in the light of your future advantages  but before i come to this i must say a word or two to a mighty champion that has undertaken from my own writing in another case to overthrow the very foundation of the present treaty and setting d f against d f demonstrates as he thinks that the parliament of scotland has no power to enter upon this treaty nor go on with it without the consent of their constituents that choose them  and to do this he quotes a long part of a book wrote some time since in england entitled the original right of the collective body of the people of england vindicated and asserted in answer to sir humphra mackworths book called a vindication of the commons of england etc  in this book i lay down four maxims of government which this gentleman quotes at large  now it is so strange a thing notwithstanding all this that these gentlemen should bring this quotation to prove the want of power in the present parliament of scotland to enter upon the union that i must own i never saw any thing fetched so remote in argument in my life  if any man therefore please but to examine two things he will see through all this cloud of cavil and soon distinguish the case  all that this long quotation amounts to is sumd up in this that ail government being constituted for the public good all the parts of government ceasing to act for the public good cease from the same public capacity in which they were constituted the end of their authority being destroyed  this only then leads us to examine whether the present parliament of scotland are acting for the public good or no and i shall be very glad to join issue with any body on that head  the other case quoted refers to parliaments making laws against reason nature or the divine law  and had the author here quoted me fairly he would have gone on and showed an instance i gave to explain the rest  viz if the people of england find their representatives going about to betray the religion and liberties of their country what the said people by the laws of reason nature and religion ought to do and to illustrate this i gave instances of the parliament in england alternately reestablishing to day popery to morrow the protestant religion to day one king to morrow another to day declaring queen mary legitimate and queen elisabeth a bastard to morrow queen elisabeth a legitimate and queen mary a bastard and from thence i argued to the subversion of justice and corruption of the laws in these cases i think all i have advanced there very just and plain and i never yet heard it objected against  but with submission to this gentlemans understanding all this proves nothing in the case before us unless it be also made appear that the parliament of scotland is acting something against the laws of god nature or reason subverting the laws corrupting justice oppressing the people whom they should protect and betraying the trust reposed in them by their country and thus we are just where we were before  indeed the drift of my author appearing plainly at last to declare it self for a league with france and consequently a restoring some body who this nation i believe had much better be without it requires no further reply than this and therefore i leave it  i frankly own the positions this person quotes viz of the people collectively considered having a right to oppose any constituted body of government suppressing and betraying their fundamental right  but i do not see any thing inferred from hence unless it be first proved that the treaty now on foot is a betraying the fundamentals of their country overthrowing and subverting the laws perverting and corrupting justice and a general enslaving the people  much i know has been talked of to prove these things but with so little reason and on such weak fundations that i think i need say no more to it till mr h  s or some body for him refutes the scheme of the national right of parliament asserted in the last tract  wherein i have to the best of my judgment described it and shall willingly recant it when i find it not able to consist with justice and reason  but before i dismiss this article and that i may give this gentleman full scope for his argument i offer to prove that though the fundation he lays down were just which it is plain is otherwise yet the inference would not hold in this case  for example suppose which yet i by no means grant that the people who are the constituents of parliament were so far judges of the actions of parliament as to have a right to give them instructions and as a worthy author has it among the rest of his wise sayings to address the parliament commanding them not to proceed etc  two things must necessarily follow upon this most important supposition    that these people so limiting the parliament must be such and only such as have a right of election for they only can direct their representatives who have a right to be represented and they only have a right to be represented who have a voice in the election of a representative thus there are all your glasgow armies disbanded and turned rebels at once and all your dumfries protestors with their troops of horse and armies of foot such only excepted as have a right to vote in an election    of those who have a right of voting in election the right of contraveening the actions of the members must depend at least on the majority of them some are of the opinion it must have every individual in an action of such moment but this is certain it must have a majority and this majority must include the nobility too who are not represented but sit in person and how shall it appear that this majority are in the persons now addressing let us examine the probability of it for a certain examination i believe impracticable now but as to probability when shall we see it  some of the addresses have been signed by   some    0    hands only to assist in the clamor are these the majority of the electors in the shires or towns some have more but it is where the proportion is much greater  let us take it in the address of the burghs which has been often calculated and take the burghs that refused to address and these that did not think it worth while to appear and the majority against the addressers is by the proportion of their cess as    to    nay suppose all those that did not appear to be affirmatives though that be altogether improbable and that they would have been for the address yet the proportion had been as    to      but if the rate of the cess be not a just estimate of the value of the burghs tho i can prove it was the original of their right of being burghs then i refer to any man to calculate the inhabitants and number of freemen in each burgh and he will find the  0 burghs that refused to address have more inhabitants in them than both the    that addressed and the    that were absent the city of edinburgh excepted  and where now is the majority and how shall a parliament regulate themselves by this method for here a majority of the shires suppose it was so addressed against the union and a majority of the burghs are for it now take the minor part of the freeholders and the major part of the buroughs and draw a just proportion of members in the house i mean of representatives and add these to the great number of the lords who are for the union and who are not represented at all and i dare say the majority would appear for the union  to take it another way divide the freeholders in scotland and place the numbers of either the representing or the represented by the value of their estates for the original of all depends upon the freehold i dare say including the nobility two thirds of the freehold of scotland belong to such as are for the union  i care not to enter into inviduous comparisons as the more exact calculating such things as these must necessarily come to i leave it to those that please to examine further into the majority i am persuaded if these people will have the majority of the freeholders of scotland be against the union they must as mr hodges does draw the ladies into the party and if they are against it as some say the reasons they give are too light for this discourse  i think this estimate of probable majorities as just as may support my arguments i will submit them to any man that can confute them  as to all the rest of the people of scotland who have no right to elect representatives i affirm and think the nature of the thing demonstrates it they can have no right to direct those who they have no part in constituting  and here all the people drawn in to sign addresses to the parliament against the union so far as the members are to be bound by these addresses are meddling with what they have no right to be meddling with nor are any way concerned in  but besides all this suppose some right of limiting the proceedings of parliament by their constituents and the majority in one place addresses them against an union and the majority of other places addressed for it or acquiesced which is the same thing what confusions what intolerable exigencies and labyrinths must this run the parliament into and when should any thing be resolved which tho of never so great concern had so much difficulty in it  i leave this here with this short remark on it that i do not see tho the constituent had power to restrain the house that by any estimate which can be yet made a majority has yet appeared willing to do so if there was a majority it does not appear they had a right to do it unless what the parliament was doing was in it self destructive of the laws liberties religion or property of the people or subverting their essential privileges and therefore hitherto the parliament have been regular in their proceedings and wiser than to regard the clamours of tumultuous people not qualified to interrupt them  the further designs of this author discovers the more naked part of the design viz uniting or at least confederating with popish and french tyranny  and i cannot but observe here how those people are pleasing themselves with that small advantage of trade to france and magnifying them to unusual hights tho it is plain the returns from thence are all to your damage in general and at the same time the trade to england the returns of which now are chiefly in money and after the union must be more so are disparaged lessened and reduced to nothing  the author of this book is honest in this whatever he is in other things and owns his drift is a treaty not with england but with france  i should have entered further into his disputes of the much better treaty with france than england if i had not been happily prevented by a book which appears just while i am writing this entitled the advantages of scotland by an incorporate union etc in which he is so fairly confuted and the argument handled so clearly that it would be an injustice to the gentleman that wrote it tho i know not who he is not to acknowledge that he has done his country justice and the argument too and i believe will not be replied to in haste  after what has been there said i shall not so much as think my self able to say any thing fit to be added and shall always let the world see that whether i know when to speak or no i always know when to hold my tongue  but i cannot quit this discourse without drawing one inference from all these things viz that in all these debates and however different the opinions of some people are from others in that matter of the union  i know not by what concurrence of causes it happens but this seems to be the general concession of all the contending parties viz that scotland is not in a condition to subsist or at least to flourish by her self  that she seems under some necessity to unite or confederate some where  and so the debate is not whether she shall unite with some body or no but whether she shall unite with this or that with england france holland or who  if i were a scots man or if you could bear with plainness and truth from a stranger that strives to speak impartial truth and has not one shilling to gain or lose let it go which way it will  i would ask some of these gentlemen whether they have considered their national circumstances as to england and examined not how they could break with england for i am not a going to insult scotland  but in what posture as to trade scotland would be upon an universal prohibition between england ireland and scotland  it is true there is a kind of prohibition already as to england you have prohibited almost all the manufactures and take nothing from them you can well be without  but they have not yet treated you so they have not returned you in kind i would ask these gentlemen how they would look and in what condition as to trade and ready money scotland would be if there were equal prohibitions and an universal stop of trade between the nations that neither your cattle nor linen was admitted there the return of which is now wholly in cash  some gentlemen have said you can do without it and perhaps you may come gentlemen let us examine how  why first these gentlemen say france will take off your wool lead salmond and herring  well gentlemen and what will they give you for it  wine brandy fruit silk toys and trinkets i will not engage here with the gentlemen and disoblige the men of the bottle so far as to make a calculation of the wondrous advantages of wine and brandy and how much they contribute to the wealth of the nation and therefore i leave that debate only this i must say that your import every year exceeds your export and if this trade is to increase your wealth and people it will still increase your consumption and you must pay france the overplus in specie and so promote the manufacture of drunkenness at the price of the consumption of your bullion  but then as to wool it is owned france will take little wool if any of your own growth at least not without english wool with it  and if effectual care is taken to prevent the export of that wool from england i suppose you will find a decay there  and if you oblige france to take your fish and cannot supply them with wool you must make them amends some other way as perhaps by filling their armies with scots troops and sending your gentlemen into their service so exporting your scots blood by their gallantry and courage help france to pull down the protestant religion and enslave europe of which bondage you must at last come in for a share  but next to this says another gentleman we may export our linen to spain and our beef to the canaries and madera  for the first so you may if you please with an union as well as now so that whatever you gain of export to england is all as clear as it was before for you may make enough for both trades if you please and consequently employ more people in the work more land in the planting and so the trade to spain is just as it was and receives no manner of alteration  for the sending beef to the canaries etc i suppose the gentlemen that have been so forward in that argument have never been at or have never traded to those islands otherwise they would not offer such odd kind of proposals and to shorten them i discreetly would revise their calculations and compare them with the following circumstances and then i persuade my self they will have honor enough to change their sentiments   st england in the year      took from scotland in trade and for which they paid ready money    0  head of black cattle     0 sheep over and besides the number of both sorts which are secretly convoyed over the borders and which is impossible the tract of land being so great can by any vigilance of officers be prevented which some say amounts to as many more but all agree are a very great quantity  now i would be glad to know where the gentlemen would export this quantity of cattle    as to the canaries and madera the inhabitants are few the flesh they eat little and if they were to have all the beef they buy from scotland they would not take off  000 bullocks or beeves a year    they have new england and new york from whence they are supplied with pipestaves which ly so much nearer to them and from whom they are supplied with beef and pork so cheap that i wonder how these gentlemen could think of those places to sell thirty thousand black cattle a year in  if they could sell those cattle where would they sell the returns madera wine they could not dispose of any where and of canary but a small quantity without help of england and silver is not to be had in those islands which way they would either make their returns or get loading back for their ships is a mystery past any mans understanding    but were all these difficulties over had those islands no flesh from the continent of america had scotland a vent at home for  0 ships load of canary and modera wine to secure their ships a back freight  yet at last i say they could not sell ten barrels of beef a year in either canaries or madera  and i think the reason is plain  the irish beef is so much better so much cheaper and their shipping and sailing so much easier that they would be able to outsell them there reckoning value and price above a hundred per cent  now to make this out i shall not give the reader the trouble of calculations only let him know that the best irish beef large and fat not to make comparison has been to be had at kinsale cork or galloway for under   sh per hundred weight for some years past that is to say for very little more than half penny sterling per lib and i leave the calcule to any body that please to make it  while this is so i must take leave to say neither england or scotland nay nor new england or new york can come into that trade  then the irish selling their beef to english merchants and sending it in english bottoms can carry the madera wines to the islands or bring the canarie wines to england in the same ship this the scots can never come up to without an union and i appeal to all the world for the truth of fact in this particular  where the gentlemen then will dispose of  0000 to  0000 of black cattle to balance the english trade i know not  i recommend this thought to those gentlemen who are so very warm for drawbacks upon beef exported for sale and i would be glad they would tell us to what place of the world the whole island of britain sends  0 last of beef in seven year for sale and if so why they will clog the treaty with such demands   i come next to the linen you have in the public account of the exports of linen to england and other parts above   00000 else of linen carried out of scotland in one year  this may be all sent to spain they say suppose that were true though as to quantity i question it yet since the english as every body knows have sent none of this to spain the war having stopped that trade then if the scots can send so much to spain they yet lose the sale of so much more in england  so that here is above  00000 else of linen    0  black cattle and     0 sheep left on your hands by rejecting the english trade and all the ready money they bring with them now kept out of the kingdom upon a breach with england  i would be glad to see these gentlemen offer some of their equivalents for this for an equivalent as much as they banter that poor word must be had some where or else it will be worse  above all i wait for their french equivalent and the account of the return they would make from france for their fish lead and wool  i suppose they will not expect to send linen to france   while i am writing this i am presented with a book entitled a letter concerning the consequences of an incorporating union in relation to trade  i confess it is a wonderful book and partakes of the rest of the miracles of this age wherein arguments are raised out of contradicting systems to prove and disprove what men please i must own i think the author of this book seems to be in a plot for the union and that by laying down arguments that even the gentlemen who have declared against the union have too much sense than to make use of he would confound the debate with absurdities and contradictions and argue people into it by showing them a heap of ridiculous arguments against it  i can not satisfy my self to waste either my own time or the readers with entering into his manifold weighty reasons but i will repeat a few of them    he tells us that all trade is exchanging one commodity for another for the convenience of life and the supplying nations with what their neighbors have which they want  in prosecuting this he is merry on the english trade and thinks he banters those who say it is advantageous to scotland since says he we shall only get one commodity for another  without running his length i shall bring it to a short head his notion of trade by exchanges is right enough only that he forgot to say that where any nation has more want of foreign goods than she has goods of her own to purchase them with she must make up the value in money  on this turns the whole state of the question and the gentleman was in the right to forget it for it would have overthrown all his system  money is an intrinsic placed as a medium in the center of trade to supply the differences in value between the export and import of one nation to and from another  this is what we call balance of trade a thing many people talk of though few understand  that nation only can be said to gain by another who send more value in its own product to that other nation than is received from it because the balance must be made good in this intrinsic called specie  from hence it is a certain maxim in trade that what ever any country can part with of its own growth and product is so much clear gain to the public stock of that nation  whatever any nation wants of the growth and product of another nation is so much dead loss to the public stock of that nation  and the consequence is natural that which a nation partswith or wants most in those terms gains or loses just so much in the general balance of trade  these are things too plain to need repetition and had not this gentleman forgot this whether wilfully or no i do not determine he would have never said at first that scotland does not want the english money etc i say every nation wants to export all the product of their country they can spare and all the product of their peoples labor they can spare and every nation wants their neighbors money for their product because every nation wants in the language of trade to be gainers  and therefore to export the people instead of the labor of the people is by the way letting out the lifeblood of a nation but of that by it self  it remains therefore for this gentleman to tell us on a fair examination not whether you want the english trade or no now or after the union but whether you gain money by it or no let any one tell me whether you gain by it or no i will tell him whether you want it or no   to find out this i shall come to his own worthy argument page     we shall import into england says he all our commodities as to the word free of duttes i ll speak to it by it self  but he goes on we send linen cloth into england what shall we get in return why woollen cloth or what else the persons that sell the linen think they can get most by at home  and from hence this worthy gentleman concludes here can be no gain to scotland  now i will only state the case on a supposition which i think no man can deny me  suppose scotland sends linen cloth to england to the vaue of  00000 per annum and the persons that sell it there can sell but  00000 l in the woollen return  what must the merchant bring home and how must england pay for the linen  must it not be in money and who is the gainer  from hence i leave it to the reader to calculate scotland has sent         else of linen to england    0  black cattle     0 sheep in one year pray what returns have they fetched for this trade not vvoollen goods i believe any body will grant who then has been the gainer in that year of trade scotland or england  the objection that this is before the union is not to the purpose for after the union your export may be double in coal salt corn and wool your linen double and the like  then it will remain to ask how is it possible scotland should consume a quantity of woollen goods from england equal to this you having both wool and manufactures of your own proportioned it is impracticable and where then all the rest of your export must be supplied is another of this authors vnaccountables  but says he it is pretended scotland must export the english goods again to the plantations this makes good what i said before that he offers this to banter the opposers of the union and bring them in talking ridiculously on purpose to expose them  for no body ever but himself pretended that scotland should trade to the colonies with english goods that were to make it a trade and no trade to them turn them into mere pedlars or secondhand chapmen and to put a banter upon the colonies to think they should send to scotland for english manufacture when at the same time they trade to england directly  and why pray cannot scotland trade to the colonies with her own product and the labor of her own people her linnens her low prized woollens are as vendible and as much wanted there as any english goods what ever and she wants no quantity  her returns for these are first the employment of her shipping and seamen secondly the product of the plantations which she now buys in england and bringing which from the colonies will increase the balance between england and scotland still higher  but says the author you cannot dispose of the sugars and tobacco and if you send them abroad you get nothing but linen from holland or lace from flanders or naval stores from the east  very good do you want these things or no if you do not you wont import them if you do you will import them and unless you can pay for them in goods you must in money so that still the advantage of exporting your tobacco and sugar is equal to exporting your own product because it either returns you directly in money or saves you sending your own money abroad which is letting the nation blood in the vitals  thus with submission to this gentleman bringing things back to first principles will unravel all this clue of knotty argument and if i mistake not will discover the nakedness of it more than sufficiently to the world  the same author to answer an objection of the scots working cheaper than the english has this further deep consideration that either the english must come down to our low wages or the scots must come up to their high wages and therefore the scots manufactures cannot be cheaper than the english  now to make this out i desire he would be pleased then to reconcile the following heads to his maxim that scotland shall not get by the trade  first he says the workmen will certainly live where they can get most for their labor that i grant him readily  now if the english should be forced to be brought down to the low wages in scotland it must be that they see the scots fall so heartily into their manufactures vndersel and and underwork them that if they do not sink the price too they shall lose their trade or  secondly if the scots come up to the high wages of england the poor people will live here as well as they do in england and the trade will be in proportion greater and i will be content to hear which of these consequences will be a damnage to scotland  but now gentlemen more wonders are arrived and the strangeness to me is very great i confess except that it is true that miracles are not ceased and this is very particular  first he says and introduces it with an i affirm the scots can be no gainers by the freedom of their trade to the plantations nay if the english would give the scots all their plantations they would be no advantage to them secondly the english gain nothing by the plantations themselves nor have they been ever any gain to them this wretched stuff is followed by another that bringing home naval stores can be no advantage to you because building or employing ships will be no advantage only dispeopleing your country  i need but name these things to the world they are certainly done to banter the case the man is certainly pleading for the union it cannot be otherwise  but mark the foundation on which all this is built is england gains by no foreign trade only gains by her manufactures  and how could we gain by our manufactures if there was not a foreign trade to vent them  but we gain nothing but what is returned in unperishable commodities  allow that now  why then we have gained all the ready money in england all the plate all the bullion all the iron brass steel or metals imported  all the moveable stock of the nation is clear gain to it be it in ships buildings furniture stores wares etc how have they gained all this it must be by trade and the personal estates in england such as houses ships goods cattle plate jewels money etc are computed at much more than the value of the fee simple of all the land at  00 years purchase  but i will tire you no more with this miserable stuff pray gentlemen pardon me the freedom i take with this author and do not think i imagine scotland can be capable of such nonsense i am very well assured this is another english author and that this book came from england it tastes both of the spirit the temper and understanding of some gentlemen there who set up to instruct you here in what you know better than they  but now gentlemen to come home to your own trade with england either as it is or as it may be with or without an union  if an union go on it is alleged you shall have higher customs than you have now  to this the resolution of your committee is a full reply in which they tell you how all the customs of england which shall expire at    0 being deducted your customs rated on the present export and import of scotland shall be less than they are now by   0000 l scots per annum besides upwards of   0000 l scots taken off from your manufactures when exported to england  this i think has in a manner silenced the gentlemen that thronged the town with their calculs of customs rising upon you as something else has done about the repayment of the equivalent  the trade lying thus let me state it two ways  it is evident by the report of the persons employed by the government to calculate this that your exports to england now without an union amount to  00000 lib sterling per annum  no man has yet ventured to say that you make any returns from thence that bear a proportion to this  all their manufactures being prohibit but because i would give all reasonable allowance i am content to suppose that you receive from england in goods  0000 li per annum i will suppose that the noblemen and gentlemen of scotland in their expenses and the fine things they buy there spend  0000 lib more tho both these sums exceedingly outdo the probability of the thing  but this being allowed then it is yet true that scotland gets  00000 lib per annum in money from england by trade how she would make her self amends for that loss by a trade to france i can see no room to find out and for a trade to spain she has it with the trade to england and may enlarge it as she thinks fit and england will help not hinder her to enlarge it  if then you get  00000 lib per annum by england it is a good trade without an union let us now examine if the union will make it greater or less and upon this the whole state of the case will turn  first we are told here that after the union the english woollen manufactures will throng in upon scotland  and though i think it is your own fault if you do not make all the same you do now and both better and cheaper yet for discourse sake suppose you to buy the english woollen goods pray what goods shall you send to england then more than you do now  if then after the union you shall send more goods to england over and above the quantity you now send than you shall receive from thence over and above what you now receive you are still more gainers than you were before  and first i am to suppose that all the import of tobacco sugar ginger dye stuffs etc which come from the west indies shall be taken off from the debit of your import from england since either you will have them directly from thence and in return for your own manufactures and money to boot or you must be much weaker in your pursuing your own advantages than i take ye to he  if you imported  0000 lib per annum in goods from england i believe a full half of that sum is made up by those kinds of goods with which we are supplied from england  to increase this trade to england i come to ask a few questions which i would be glad to hear any body answer    how many coals shall go away yearly from the firth of edinburgh to england when   sh and   d duty is taken off by the union and they as cheap here as at new castle and   sh per chalder always above them at london i assure you when i have said it shall amount to  00000 chalder i have been blamed as not guessing above half the quantity   how many weigh of salt of which some say  0000 wey i am content to say half that quantity and i dare say it shall not fall short of that   what quantity of corn shall go to england yearly especially that we call horsecorn such as oats beans and pease which always yield a good price at london and much more than in scotland if this article does not amount to  00000 l per annum more then i have no guess at what scotland can part with of those sorts for i am free to say if they will send them to england they will always buy them there and at a good price   the wool and now we come to a great question what amends will be made to scotland for the loss of the wool trade and the difference of price between the wool after the prohibition and what it is now when we export it abroad to this i answer sinking the price indeed is the immediate consequence but the present exporting it has several attending circumstances which i conceive are not sufficiently considered by those who are so angry at this head    the present price of wool for which the sheepmasters claim a satisfaction is not an original the first exporting the wool raised it and stopping that export is only checking the exorbitant gain they make now at the price of their countrys ruin and bringing them back where they were before    it is a trade destructive to industry ruinous to manufactures and tends to robbing the poor of their employment as is evident in your exporting it to the baltic and the north where if they had not your wool they must buy your course manufactures and certainly buy the less of the one by how much the more they get of the other    if you will not work your wool at home though that is certainly your advantage especially when you may then have english wool freely to mix with it  still you may send it all to england who opens their doors to all the wool the whole world thinks fit to send them  if it be objected they will not give the price you get for it abroad i answer they will give what you had better take than the foreign price and what you shall get as much by  suppose i have  00 packs of wool at edinburgh  0 packs i will send to france or to sweden or where you like and for that i will get  0 s per stone  0 i send to england and for that i get but   s per stone yet i say i had better send to england than abroad for example  first i run the risque of the sea onward bound next the risque of factors and buyers abroad   i pay freight and commission abroad   the risque is repeated back again on the sea  and lastly all this at least imploys the stock six months in time  if i think fit to trade to england for wool i can always sell it and always sell it for ready money and may if i please make    returns of my money in that   months time which i take in one voyage the other way and in doing this i run no risque at all and have my money in my hand every time  if it be objected the price to the woolmaster is low i answer england will give as much for yours as for their own in proportion to its goodness  if yours is not so good as some of theirs it is better than others and still you have neighbors fair and right dealing  i could run out here and not unprofitably perhaps tell you that the badness of your wool in scotland is not owing either to the climate the soil the nature of the grass or any of those circumstances the phlegmatic fancies of some people suggest which some though they care not to hear other folks mention are forward enough to mention themselves  i could take the liberty to tell these gentlemen and perhaps make it out too that the courseness of the wool here is owing to the ill husbandry of the people not the inclemencies of nature and that they are too forward to injure their own country and load her with the effects of their own inexcusable negligence and this both in the missusing the sheep that breed this wool and spoiling the wool with tar grease and horrible foolish applications to it when it is on the sheeps back  indeed i avoid entering on this matter here because i am preparing an essay upon the improvement of scotland by it self which i design for the public service in this very case but this i undertake to say before hand with respect to the wool that whether by better management your wool might be made as good as english i do not affirm though i believe it  but certainly by your management there the english wool might be brought to be every whit as bad as yours  negligence and ill husbandry will spoil the best country in the world and the best product in the world and though i am not for finding fault yet i must own the conduct of the gentlemen in scotland with their sheep and not a little with their land too is one of the most unaccountable things in the world  and if i have the honor to dictate some methods of rectification in these cases to their advantage whether they make the experiment or no i hope no man will be angry with me or count me an enemy to scotland for showing the way to its improvement  but i proceed to the trade of scotland and i cannot but enter a little here into a short trifle of trade called the trade to america or the west indies and it is very remarkable and well worth observation what pains has been taken to render this as the most contemptible thing in the world a thing not worth englands granting or scotlands accepting much less a thing that england ought to value her self upon or so much as suggest that scotland is beholding to her for  one author has the face to say england never got any thing by the trade of the colonies her self and if she would give them to scotland it was not a gift worth receiving nor could scotland be ever the better for it  i confess these are strange things and it is hard to have to do with some kind of gentlemen in trade who give themselves a liberty to say what they please without being encumbred with or any way subjecting themselves to the bondage of speaking truth  and yet this monstrous story as i am told comes from england from whence i only draw one inference viz that this ignorance is not for want of an opportunity of knowing better  but there are some gentlemen there who have all along carefully furnished the town here with something which no man durst say but such as are out of sight as to blushing and out of hearing as to reproach  the short scale of the trade from scotland to the west indies consists in these heads which when they are right stated i shall think it is easy for any body to determine whether that trade is to be carried on to the advantage of scotland yea or no  first what you carry out is entirely if you please the product of your own land and the labor of your own people   what you bring home may at least parts of it be again exported by you to foreign parts and the product by consequence return to you in money and if the remaining part is expended at home it is expended in the room of those goods of the same kind which you now buy with your money in england or with your goods at a short advance and which would otherwise return you money   what goods you carry out to the colonies are generally sold there at the extravagant advance of  00 per cent profit on the continent and if for loss on the islands then great quantities of bullion are returned home for them in the return of which the loss is less in proportion   all this trade shall be carried on in your own ships furnished with your own provisions built if you please in your own ports and manned with your own seamen here is published a letter from some merchants of the scots nation residing at london where this trade is estimated to  00000 per annum profit to the traders of scotland and the guinea trade to  0000 l per annum i confess in the length of the particulars they outdo me and it must be some time before scotland can carry it on to that hight  indeed i forbear compting the advantages of these things because i do not affect talking of millions and great sums  but look into these things gentlemen you that are to be convinced by demonstrations take them to pieces your selves see if you can avoid confessing the advantages see if such a trade can be driven without a prodigious gain without incredible fluxes of wealth to the nation in general as well as to the merchants in particular  to say you have no manufactures fit for the colonies or that you must buy them from england is to say you have no  no wool no flax  or to say you will not make use of them and certainly if you will not stir you shall always be poor he that will not eat must be starved there is no remedy  but why should the gentlemen that talk you up so high on one hand and threaten the great things you can do another way talk you down so low in this as if you were a nation that had netheir hands to work heads to direct or understandings to close with advantages of commerce and improvement when they were put into your hands  i allow scotland is and has been under discouragement both as to foreign trade and manufactures i allow your poor are very low and your rich men backward to launch out  and any man that takes me in the general scope will easily see this was the intent and meaning of my arguing in england when i wrote the second of these essays and argued that you should be exempted for some years from the taxes on malt and salt  and i cannot but think that noble lord asking his lord ships pardon for this freedom who quoted my arguments on this head in parliament will do me that justice that they were all concluded in this very thing and had his lordship thought fit to have quoted but one paragraph further it would have appeared essay ii p    that scotland being very low and the poor unable to pay taxes at all should be exempted from the taxes of malt and salt for a certain term of years  now if i first concluded the poor unable to bear the burden of the salt and malt tax at all why should i argue for limited exemption  but on this supposition that by the increase of trade shipping manufactures and labor the increase of wages and bettering the way of the poors living would be the consequence and then the taxes would not be equally burdensome as now  in this if i may be allowed to plead any merit with scotland who am a stranger was then in england and yet moved earnestly for ease and exemption for the poor of this kingdom till they should be enabled to pay taxes i think i acted a part no man here ought to blame me for and it is a little hard to draw an argument from thence that therefore they must never be charged at all  without doubt if trade in scotland increases labor will increase if labor increases wages will increase for a demand of work makes a demand of wages of course  so that i think there remains only to prove that there will be an increase of trade i think i have performed that in part i shall be glad to see some other more able hand perfect my generals into particulars by schemes of profit and advantage on the returns to scotland on the advantages of building ships and consequently a great norway and baltic trade for fish out and naval stores home again on the number of families employed at home in building fitting and furnishing ships and lastly the nursery of sea men and employing them in your own ships with the consequences of such a trade  were due and just schemes of these things laid down i cannot but believe the mouths of those people would for ever be stopped who lessen and misrepresent the advantages of trade which scotland shall obtain  it is enough however to my purpose having not room here for particulars to have laid down this general scheme of a profitable trade   that trade only can be profitable which employing their own people carries out their own growth or product and does not consume all the returns but draws in the surplus to it self in bullion and this you do here exactly to explain this  i would be glad any man would state me the following voyage suppose a thousand pound sterling in scots linen and in woollen goods sent to new england new york or virginia in a scots ship and is there vested in sugars mellasses or tobacco at the usual rate of advance in those places which is too per cent sometimes much more  if these returns come safe home to scotland and being not consumed here are again exported to amsterdam in a scots vessel also and at last the effects produce    0 lib sterling clear of all charges which is no unusual nor extraordinary thing  what profit does scotland gain by this voyage i say scotland because we are to examine the increase to the public stock as well as to the private merchant in the discourse we are now upon  first scotland gains all the profit of the labor of the people in the manufactures that were exported for all the wages any person earns in scotland by his labor over and above what his subsistence cost him during his labor is clear gain to the general stock  secondly scotland gains all the profit of the labor of every person employed on board the ship for that voyage and of the labor of all the artificers laborers etc employed in furnishing that ship for that voyage  thirdly all the provisions expended in the voyage and all the stores carried out and not brought home are clear gain to the stock of the nation  fourthly scotland gains all the particulars of the same kinds again on the ship that carries the goods away to holland  lastly scotland gains the profit on the foot of the voyage to the merchant and owners  so that if the merchant here clears but   0 lib by his voyage the national public advantage may be   00 lib more in the freights and furniture of the ship and cargo  from hence it is also worth note that if  0 such ships a year went out from scotland it might very well be possible that the merchant should not get a farthing nay might lose by the voyage and yet the public national stock be gainer at least   000 lib sterling per annum  if any man will after this tell me that scotland shall get nothing by the plantation trade  i must own he is no man for me to talk with i must leave him to his own delusions  i shall conclude this essay with only one note about the popular objection that after the union all your places preferments and offices in the customs excises taxes army and navy will be at the disposal of the english and englishmen will be put upon you in all those cases  it is not for me to determine who shall or shall not be put into places of trust in this nation i make no question the government will regard the recommendation of the council and of honest men here as it does now in england  but i would have these gentlemen consider two or three things    why should the government be more partial to england as to places here than at home in their own country where a scotsman notwithstanding the separate posture of the nations is as capable of preferment as an englishman and promiscously preferred on all occasions   would these gentlemen be content to retain that mark of distinction between the nations that scotsmen only should be preferred in scotland and englishmen in england and would not scotland be vastly a loser by it while many of her nation are now in places of the greatest honor and trust in england   is it any mark of englands partiality to scotland much less of any distrust of the nation that the only three strong places in england the keys of her wealth of her trade and of her navy have for above    years past been committed to three natives of scotland viz tilbury fort the guard of the river thames and city of london to colonel saint clare sheerness fort the key of chatam river and guard of the royal navy to colonel crawford and portsmouth the greatest fortification and magazin on the south of britain to sir john gibson besides innumerable gentlemen of the scots nation now in trust in the service admiral mitchel wishart and comodore ker in the navy with   or   captains in the fleet besides lieutenant general steuart murray and collier the lord portmore his grace the duke of argyle and several others i willingly omit in the army  these trusts gentlemen do not favor of partiality and are as good arguments to ward against the suggestion as i think need to be made use of on the other hand there is no question but the merit of the scots gentlemen will alwise render them valuable and useful to britain and as they have alwise had their share of advancement in all public business so there is no question they will be more likely to obtain it now  i foresee the debate in the parliament will have run its length before the printer will be pleased to let these sheets come into the world which makes me lay by what i had prepared to say about the keeping up or dissolving the scots caledonia company  i confess it is my opinion as i have said already that your company as it was at first established could never have been of any use to scotland unless by force you had been able to have reduced spain to a necessity of establishing a trade with your colony in america and all the prospect of a trade to india by the southseas or any other way without the help of england could never have answered for want of a market for goods the dutch and french being otherwise supplied  but i wave entering on those things here the present enquiry is why must we lose our company why must we give up all the privileges of the company  if i may be allowed without offense to speak a little plainly here perhaps it may touch the point nearly enough  first who is this we for it is necessary to distinguish who speaks if it be we the company or we the nation  if you mean we the company the reason is direct you ought to part with your company and be thankful and take your money and say you have made a good voyage since you recover what you had lost  you get principal and interest in a case where i know several of the members would have been content to have lost all they had paid in to have been secured against paying in any more  of all people in the world these are the most unacountable who have stocks there and can give very little account what other things they could ever expect but the loss of these stocks and yet are not for parting with their company  all such people can say is that if an union was to come on and the company to stand they might fill it with english subscriptions and make it a rival company in the trade with the english  and what would scotland gain by that the trade would be entirely in england the whole returns there and all the consequence would be the pleasure of ruining both companies as would have been the certain case with the two companies in england if the plain prospect of it had not made them both wise enough to unite  but   dly let us come to the other case we the people of scotland why should we part with the company  first gentlemen any wise people will part with what would be their destruction to keep secondly you cannot unite with england without parting with it two companies being intolerable in britain as to the first  an east india company abstracted from your trade to england would be the destruction of all your commerce for two reasons    you could export nothing but your ready money   you would import what you could neither sell in scotland nor carry abroad to any advantage the first of these needs no explication it is the complaint in england and a complaint not very easily answered and from whence some pretend to say the east india trade is a grievance to england tho i do not say i am of that mind neither but i am certain of this that scotland could not bear the export of their bullion at least not now  as to the second it is evident the import could not be vended here and as for foreign markets the dutch are the great staple  and what can be imagined you can get by them some particulars indeed might be sold in spain and a little at hamburgh but far short of enough to support the trade the english uphold their trade by the strength of their home consumpt which is a vast gulf of trade and the export again is but upon circumstances and trifles compared to the gross and scotland having no home consumpt an east india trade would be ruinous to them a west india trade would involve them in a war and a war which i think without reflecting at all upon scotland she is very unfit to carry on having no naval force to cope with the spaniards  thus either way she is in no national capacity to carry on the trade or to keep up the company why then should she not part with it when good conditions are to be had for the exchange and all her merchants are at liberty to trade in the general stock in england as much as any merchant there    you cannot unite with england without parting with this company  the reason for this is very plain two companies in england had not only almost destroyed one another but they bid fair for ruining the whole nation by dividing all the parties to one side or other and influencing all public affairs to their favor they became the very center of all the national divisions and all the factions seemed to be incorporated into the two companies  thus the nation began to be stock jobbd into bargain and sale and the power of two such rivals made even the king himself concern himself to bring them to conditions and the whole nation was made uneasy by the agreement which by this time had the breach continued might have embroiled us all this is a reason sufficient why england cannot unite while two east india companies subsist  well say some gentlemen with all our hearts we dont desire they should let them let it alone  why truly there i believe much of the case lies they that argue for the having the african company kept up do it chiefly that if possible it might be a cheque to the union and so it is the union not the company they are debating  as to the union gentlemen i avoid mentioning it as much as i can because some people are so chary they will not bear to have it mentioned and i am loath to give any body offense  but in this case it cannot be helped england cannot unite with an open trade to india she cannot come into the same confusion as she was in under two companies before it is inconsistent with her peace and with her trade and in the end would be so to yours too  as to them that would not have her unite and therefore argues about keeping the company i have nothing to say to their uniting but never let them bring this as a difficulty for let it go what way it will the company can never be of any benefit to scotland nor shall it be ever true that by the union scotland shall not be vastly gainer  well but says another gentleman what if all this be true must we needs unite with you if we do get  00000 per annum and all the things you talk of  we have not a mind to unite and what then why should we be forced to it  no by no means say i i abhor force i am laying out the advantages to persuade if force was to be used there could be no need of persuading  god forbid i should think much less talk of englands forcing scotland to unite  and i have said my mind on that head to your advantage long before i thought of coming to these parts  nor should i expect any good from such a compulsion  but it is a compulsion of reasoning argument constrains and such a force there will be indeed and you will notwithstanding all this struggle whether you unite or no come to stoop your reason to the force of the thing and hereafter not too late i hope own your selves mistaken  if you wont unite gentlemen i cannot help that but in the mean time do not pretend to reason it out of your sight for all manner of argument is against you and you can reject an union upon no foot but that of acting against your own light and the invincible power of your own reason  finis advertisement these are to give notice that the fourth essay is to be had at the caledonia coffeehouse over against the cross in edinburgh where also will be had the first and second essays of the london impression
