the tutor of truth by the author of the pupil of pleasure etc etc in two volumes  vol i  however hypocrisy may flourish for a time even its happiest moments are clouded and truth shall at last prevail  london printed for richardson and urquhart under the royal exchange  m dcc lxxix  to lady miller of batheaston villa these volumes are inscribed by her most obedient and obliged humble servant  the author  preface a work which is in the world under the title of the pupil of pleasure exemplified that part of a late celebrated system which led immediately to voluptuousness hypocrisy and seduction it was therefore a faint mark for literary ridicule the peculiar success of my undertaking and the general esteem it still maintains notwithstanding the wilful or the ignorant perversions of a few individuals who affected to have their scruples concerning the character of sedley convince me that i did not write in vain  but methinks something very essential yet remains to be done there is a much better as well as a much more brilliant system still to be illustrated the system of integrity and truth  this is attempted in the present performance where the reader will see in contrast to the pupil of pleasure a character of a very different coloring figure before him one who though even more accomplished than sedley with all his fire spirit and opportunity as well as every personal advantage employs each in the cause not of ruin but sincerity  it has been endeavored also that the scenes in which this new personage is engaged should be so disposed as to give full scope for all that is just affecting and ennobled without departing from human nature the hero of this production like that of the other has many struggles and many anxieties for virtue with respect to ordinary successes and rewards is not always fortunate but between the two heroes there is throughout their adventures this distinguishing difference the one has the pangs of remorse superadded to those of shame and despair and the sufferings of the other like the agonies of a messiah are always for the truth and for the happiness of others all that the best men in the world can say to themselves is comprised in this couplet of the poet  it is not in mortals to command success but well do more sempronius well deserve it there have been those whether in the spirit of criticism or from principle i cannot tell who have warned the young and sober against the warmth of character in the pupil of pleasure surely a little thinking might reconcile to them as to the rest of the world the propriety of painting vice in strong colors in order to bring it into contempt that very sedley who sets out with all the graces of chesterfield in his train soon loses his credit with the reader he fades toward the conclusion more and more in every page and at last he becomes a desperate detested man on whose grave even pity herself can scarce be prevailed on to shed a tear  if however this objection in the breast of any one still subsists against me it would be a piece of justice not unworthy the true critic if he would take upon him to recommend the character of captain carlisle in this work as officiously as he has discommended that of mr sedley in the other in real fact sedley is the shade which will set carlisle in the proper light and although the stories through which i have conveyed the moral are utterly different yet those who are candid enough to conceive a book of this kind may be made systematic and who may read the two performances together will i flatter myself perceive a connection with regard to system not wholly inapposite  in fine sedley is a monster and carlisle is a man let them be accurately compared and read only with this view whenever they are in the hands of the young as sedley is the object of escape and abhorrence carlisle is that of intimacy and imitation he is much embarrassed but he has honor to bear him up he is purposely plunged in difficulty that his truth might be the more tried and that being tried it might like fine gold from the fire come forth the purer he is sedleys opposite in every particular except the attractions of form which were given to sedley also only to render chesterfieldism more exact carlisle protects the innocence that he might have destroyed he spares the chastity that he might have violated he endeavors to preserve the wife whom he might have ruined he has all the policy of prudence without deviating from truth he is graced with every polishing ornament of character instead of corrupting he enriches society  that the hero of the present work might have every ultimate advantage so as to bring the moral which his adventures convey more forcibly home to the business and bosom of the reader he appears at different times in all the amiable lights of which his picture is susceptible amongst these the honor of his friendships the tendernesses of his love the delicacy of his sufferings his discretion under embarrassments and his courage in exigencies will not escape the attentive reader it should be noted also that the contrast of the present with the former performance receives still greater force by the introduction of other sketches which will be found here particularly the short scenes that belong to mr henry hewson and his brother these characters are interwoven not so much to enliven and relieve the deepness of the pathetic in the other parts as to give greater elucidation to the system with the like view the characters of the fighting medway and the fearful frolicksome sir andrew flight have been admitted as have those of mr lascelles the marchioness of n and lucia de gray it is hoped these all promote the moral as much as they contribute to the interests of the fable for example sedley the pupil of pleasure was uniformly vicious deceitful and reprobate and therefore died captain carlisle the tutor of truth is invariably just ingenuous and good and therefore lives sedley often felt the stroke of ill success but consoled himself in the worst of times with the hope of accomplishing his wicked wishes at last carlisle is sensible of disappointment too but is kept from paroxisms of despair by a silent appeal to his conscience lascelles is at once rakish false dissolute and therefore meets with punishment the marchioness of n though pitiable is also an object of terror to be held up to the female world since the same imprudence will naturally lead to the same mifortunes the earl and countess of blessingbourne are brought into this work to show that true politeness and the graces are charms independent of mere rank titles or estate the family of the hewsons are here to prove that true politeness and the graces are not to be bought as mere marketable commodities whenever a man happens to have money to spare and to prove likewise that neither rustic manners on the one hand nor bookish pedantry on the other will enable men to leave the farmhouse and the cloister to figure more respectably in a state of refinement in full opposition to ll these therefore the hero of this work is produced he is as truly polite as he is truly generous and agreeable to the title given to him at setting out  he is a tutor of truth  the tutor of truth letter i helter skelter hall mr henry hewson to mr gabriel hewson brother gab according to custom i am to send you joy upon the cassion of grandfathers stealing off as you and i were in at the death and got such a swinging edition to our fortune it would be the most ungratefullest thing in the world not to pray for the peace of the old fellows soul seeing too that his body is now out of the way our parson says it behooves us to direct a bit of a monument to his memory for my part i see no matter in these same monuments none of the folk of our county need to be told what concerns old heidedger hewson and so what is the use of making a long preachment and flourishing away upon a marble slab about a dead man parson prates so much about gratitude that i begin to think he magines we ought to tell it on tombstone about our fortune as it is a strange affair altogether i have a good mine to do this  nay i have already drawn up a piece of writing which i send you let me know in your answer by nicholas the carrier whether twill do and whether you will be half the money toward the direction of the monument seeing as how gold letters and church masonry and indeed all business about dead corpsesses comes heavy but yet i think we ought to touch off the old fellow with a few flourishes seeing that somebody may do the same for us one day or another let me know how you feel yourself since you became a man of fortune do you eat sleep talk walk as you did  for my part  but i will not tell you a sillabel till you answer me i shall only say at present that i find i am no more the man i was since my fortune than a hare is like a handsaw nevertheless  i am as much as ever your loving brother to command harry hewson ps  i have not the gift of writing so maybe you will not easily hit of my letter besides my head aches with thinking about my fortune and then i am as stupid as a hound wife is turned a madcap so i dont mention her only just to tell you she ant the woman she was  the enclosed epitaph intended by mr h hewson for his grandfather heidedgers monument  here or hereabouts lies mr heidedger hewson who having no son nor daughter to come ater did when he was but bone and skin leave all to us his next of kin wherefore this marble slab out of respect to show we dont neglect was built by i and gab henry hewson    letter ii mr gabriel to mr henry hewson sombre hedges brother henry if any thing which relates to that aweful period to which all human beings are precipitating and to which all that has vivification must soon arrive  that period whereto every thing that is now sporting in the jollities of sanity must sooner or later come  i say brother were it possible for any thing so aweful so moral so moving so  all that  to suffer the face to be upon the smile i could border upon the simper at certain turns in your epistle there are some few words in your favor misspelled for instance the words cassion preachment magines corpsesses etc have not yet come under those eyes which have from first to last dipped into twenty thousand compositions neither is your epitaph devoid of inaccuracies there being neither pathos in your poetry nor chastity in your rhyme all which is absolutely necessary to the present times no son does not echo very melodiously to hewson daughter and ater might be improved kin and skin are so very near my dear henry that they absolutely seem one flesh their sounds are too similar respect and neglect may do but slab and gab are the most preposterous words that ever terminated in the way of verse since rhyming began nor is a tombstone with any propriety called a marble slab  no harry no  your meaning is as it ought to be but for your poetry the less you have to do with the muses the better at least wait a little till my dictionary comes out and then if you have but a ray of apollo it will have it out of you for i will take on me to say no work extant that is or that shall be will give a man such a knack or kindle in him such a furor phoebi as i may call it as my dictionary  as to the monument i cherish your parsons idea and will readily pay my quota pray submit to your clerical friend who doubtless is a judge of these matters the following inscription it is written calamo currente and therefore its purities are questionable but the idea is perhaps as competent as it should be  inscription the tenderness of consanguinity warmed by benefaction in the bosom of two brothers henry and gabriel has caused to be indented upon the unconscious marble these letters of gratitude to the memory of heidedger hewson esquire who though basking in the benignance of fortune was venerated by the poor and whose longevity though it brought on imbecility was not burdensome to his family i will reply brother henry by post to the other parts of your letter nicholas waits for this so that i cannot be explicit and besides which i am as little as you the man i was though i am always  your affectionate brother gabriel hewson  letter iii mr henry to mr gabriel in answer it is a lie gab it is all a confounded lie you are just the man you ever was to a t or if there is any alteration it is ninety times nine out of a hundred for the worse you was always a feller who run rambling round about a story and never come to the end on it you know you was you always talked forty times more than needs must and the devil a word did you say to the pint ater all thof you are a fine scholar i will make five words go better to a bargain than you can ten at any time cuss me if i believe you understand half you say yourself dont you remember once at skelter wake when a lady your partner fainted away with dancing and lost her handkerchief you said  i shall never forget it  the sudorifical drops stood on azure forehead when the poor wench might have sweated for that it seems was your meaning her heart out for you for the devil an inch will you stir when that flea bites till all that is in your cussd crinkumcrankum cranium comes out and pray wise sir who is obliged to understand your grecum latinum lingo do you think i was not crambd with such conundrums when i was young and i ant sorry for it now i am turned of thirty  with regard to the answer you have made me it is no answer at all instead of talking of your old grandfathers monument you have been plaguing yourself with my noson and hewson daughter and ater kin and skin gab and slab though if the truth were known they are as good as your cillity and gevity nignance and guinity and the like and as to your dictionary it may go for harry to cut the matter short brother i wrote you a very civil reasonable letter and in return you have sent me a cussed thing of which i can make neither head nor tail only i can see plain enough that you think yourself a very clever fellow and i no wiser than i should be for that matter gab none of your family were conjurors and i dont believe you are the senfiblest oum neither but to come to the point do you choose to answer my letter saying i write like a fool is saying nothing i want to know whether setting aside your greek and latin you are the man you was i have reasons good for axing this and if you dont like to make answer why you have only to say so and you never shall be troubled again by  henry hewson  letter iv robert de gray esquire to mr gabriel hewson prudence green dear ward you did ill to reply so severely as you seem to have done to your brother henry literature you know is not his province and besides if it were you should not touch him on a part where every man upon earth is susceptible of smart a person may ever receive a wound if you aim at his understanding my dear and amiable ward mr carlisle is so aware of this that though he is never guilty of a falsehood i do not think he ever hurt a man in his own esteem in his life i expect you will pay so much honor to an old friends advice as to make all up with henry directly he is a very honest odd man you have read and lived to little effect if you do not believe there are some things to pardon in yourself  adieu robert de gray  letter v mr gabriel to henry hewson i meant no ill nature to my dear henry by my last  fraternal tranquillity is the first wish of my heart and i write this hasty note to crave pardon for having unintentionally offended him whom the feelings of a brother as well as the sovereign laws of nature our imperial mistress conjoin to render dear as the ruddy drops that animate the pulse of  gabriel hewson p s  i will reply to your first letter sully tomorrow and deposit with you all the secrets that are in the recesses of my soul    letter vi mr henry to mr gabriel hewson dear gabby enough said i wish i had hold of your hand that i might shake it if it was not for those cursed fellows ocrates ophacles trully and omare who sometimes put you almost beside yourself i know we should never exchange a warm word i loved you when you was not worth a coat off and a coat on i like you neither more nor less now you are worth ten thousand pound so write me all about what i desire and i will then tell you why  i am in good will your loving brother henry hewson  letter vii mrs henrietta hewson to miss de gray madam the pleasure i expected in your company this season at helter skelter hall must of necessity be postponed till the summer following every thing is at sixes and sevens besides which the large addition to my fortune makes it very improper i should see my friends in the huggermugger manner i did while i was as poor as my neighbors i have positively found out my dear de gray that there is not a single room in this up and down old mansion fit to sit in much less to receive the most delicate of her sex but since i am deprived of the pleasure i expected in having you with me as usual i propose to commence a correspondence with you that i may tell you from time to time how we go on in those alterations that i am resolved immediately to make i design to fit up the sweetest retreat in the universe your fathers not excepted  i say retreat because i shall occasionally retreat to it for i certainly shall not pass my winters for the future out of pall mall  that is i think i have heard you say the best quarter of the town besides its having the double recommendation of being the winter residence of miss de gray  just as i writ your name i happened to look at the chimneypiece and i absolutely thought it had undergone a perfect change within this week as indeed in my opinion has every thing about the house i cannot look at an object in the hall or the great garden that does not disgust me heaven have mercy on me how they wanted taste in building formerly such huge horrid outward doors studded with such monstrous nobs of non such dreadful arches to every entrance like the porches of ugly stonework before a church such corners lanes entries and alleys running like laby rinths through every room the fireplaces so large the windows so little the glass of them so diminutive the wainscotings so figured the beams so bulky and the passages so dark and dirty that they seem built rather to be the dens for beasts of prey than for such harmless little creatures as men and women then the gardens are as hideous as the habitations only to think lucia of a consumed great mote divided only by a nasty drawbridge running quite round the mansion most gloriously cropped with duckweed and inviting all the fowls of the air to flap their wings and feed about us to the great annoyance of sleep and every other comfort add to this the gardens themselves  i am now lifting up my head from the vulgar old table on which i am writing and i am taking  i declare to you almost with tears in my eyes  a view of our precious platform i behold in prospect about three acres of ground as completely murdered in the disposition as a modern gardener could wish eightandtwenty yewtrees interspersed with an equal number of boxes and hollies rise before me to whose flourishing shades i am to attribute half the vermin that swarm like a pestilence about us let not the abominable walls that surround our dwelling and its environs be forgotten high above all height brown above every thing embrowned  but i have not patience to proceed and shall i invite the lovely lucia to this gothic scene no lucia no now that kind fortune has put it into my power i will level with the dust this ruinous pile of building and raise up in its stead so different a structure that the very ground shall thank me for dressing it out so charmingly the moment i have completed my design you shall come and confess i have a relish for improvements i have this moment the exact image of my intentions where there are now mountains will i make valleys where there are at present crops of nettles or vulgar flowers that are to me worse than nettles will i set rows of lillies and beds of roses roses i mean of moss that scarce burst forth from the bearded bud elegant small odoriferous and not such flaring flashing oldfashioned things as figure away in our garden that look as if the seeds were sown and the trees planted immediately after the fall just when all the beautiful in nature first felt the curse upon it as to the yewtrees i will not leave one of them alive no not even that which is cut into the form of a sugar loaf and so inveterate is my vengeance in regard to these that i will yea even after they are felled  make the infected wretches perform quarantine at a miles distance in open air before i will allow them the honor of being burned in my presence as to my old friend the mote with whom i have exchanged watery looks ever since i saw him i will cause all his channels to be dried up and terra firma as brother gab calls it to flourish about him the drawbridge will i also remove and to show my dislike and ridicule of such an antique i will substitute by way of mockery and the mode an ha ha in his stead neither shall any part of our house furniture fare better for there shall be a general clearance stags heads shall give place to hogarths prints family pictures notwithstanding the large ruffs on my grandmothers neck the whiskers on my great uncles upper lip and the profusion of chitterlin on my godpapas bosom must all yield to politer decorations  in short i will create a paradise about me and that without delay in the mean time i will commence the woman of fashion by giving orders never to be seen by any body but tradesmen till i am all torights  not even by lucia de gray how i shall bring mr hewson over to this genteel way of thinking i dont know particularly as he is not you know the best bred man in the world however done it must be  that is flat for i cannot breathe any longer in such a place oh heavens how have i breathed so long it is equally an affront to my person my understanding and my fortune if any little ornaments strike you that may assist my scheme of embellishing pray think of them in your next i design to call one of my new rooms lucias saloon pray therefore let lucias fancy assist me in fitting it up  adieu adieu henrietta hewson p s  have you had any news yet of captain carlisle    letter viii mr gabriel to mr henry hewson sombre hedges yes brother yes thou beloved branch of the same family thou dear scyon of the same stock i again confess i am not in any degree the man i was this sudden gale of gay prosperity whose beams are so burnished to the eyes of fragile mortals has i confess a good deal interrupted the economy of my former affairs which were too scanty to distract attention and too abstract from all circumvolutions to require much mathematical diligence two days before the sudden exit of him to whom i am indebted for this weight of wealth i was as still and studious a man as bachelorship and neat    l    s per annum could make me i had a decent collection of classics i had homer in honest sheepskin binding horace with a little edging of gold and cicero my dear cicero with his name upon the back of every volume i had besides just such a household as suited well the propensities of my sequestered notions i had an old creature who prepared my beverage and was so used to my humor that she always went out to cough when i was at my studies i had a toothless dog that slept away his leisure and was too feeble to disturb me by barking and my cat was the quietest animal that ever purred at the elbow of a scholar in a cloister sombre hedges were exactly to my passion the two prodigious trees whose overshadowing ramifications spread the sublime of darkness visible over my cottage gave such a setoff to my study that i was absolutely the hero of an hermitage i sat and read till i fancied myself in the fervor of the intellectual feelings a philosopher in the shades in the dim hour of evening i used to be the companion of the sootypinioned bat and walked forth to meditate on the readings i had made in the day i rejoiced in the name that the people of the village gave me and i had a secret pride in seeing them in the twilight stealing a look at the learned gentleman in the dark house in the midst of sombre hedges i was just lighting up my lamp and setting down to a chapter of cicero with grimalkin by my side when news of my new honors broke like too mighty a flood of light upon the serenity of my darkness i was dazzled and knew not what to do for want of habitude wealth like a robe first put on and made not consonant to our usual fashion sat uneasy upon me as my soul was not fitted to my fortune neither was my fortune fitted to my soul i hit upon a passage where tully the prince of latian eloquence recommended an equal mind in all revolutions an hour before i should have given to the very printed page an holy kiss of approbation but at present it was no such matter  i was now to consider myself as master of ten thousand pounds and i was taken so unawares that i trimmed my lamp in order to see the will clearer and when i had the misfortune to find the thing was certain i was much agitated and crept at length into the closet which contained the wholesome bed of a scholar upon the surface of which i laid down with a heart that throbbed and a head that achd till the morning  i rose early brother but not to my accustomed satisfaction for i found my feelings were altered those small but dear attentions which the day before belonged to an estate of  0 l per year were over i could not any longer think i was the proprietor of a snug box when the load of ten thousand pounds sell abruptly upon my shoulders in the lump i never looked into a book that whole day and to say truth i hardly thought there was a cover in my study fit to come into the hand of a man of fortune was it not some demon think you that put it into my head to take down three days after the only coxcomb volume in my whole library and the scope of this was to recommend taste elegance fashion and commerce with men on purpose to give a finishing to the man of speculation with an avidity for which i despise myself did i peruse this work quite through and from that moment i became a profane excentric dissipated fellow i said unto the woodman fell me those horrid trees that hide me from the blooming face of phoebus down instantly with these children of darkness that there may be light i am ashamed to tell you that i directed my windows to be cleaned yea even the little lattice that emitted scarce half a sunbeam into my library and which was almost vegetable with the overgrowth of ivy did i order to be laid bare to all the splendors of day  why should i conceal the most egregious of my follies i have at this minute two artificers in my house and perhaps the passion may gain such sway in a few hours that by tomorrow the cornerstone of the building may not be suffered to stand i am already not the dark gentleman of sombre hedges but the poor fellow who has like a swallow in the winter emerged unseasonably from his corner to blind himself with light upon the whole my heart like my house is totally disarranged i pray heaven yours may be more composed and i hope to hear that your hopes and happiness stand just where they did before the death of our kinsman heidedger  i am dear brother yours gabriel hewson  letter ix mr henry hewson to mr gabriel in answer i like you ten times better than ever for i finds you are as much altered as i am there never was a more miserable dog than either of us i dare not say this before for fear you should laugh at me but now that i find you are as strange a fellow as myself i tell you without farther permable that i hant shot a partridge this three weeks and my dogs are yelping in the kennel for fresh air and their sport people now give me so much joy when i go about that i am quite miserable my wife hetty too has been at me about pliteness and bids me look in the glass to see if it is not a sin and a shame for such a parsonable man as i to go such a figure and shut myself up in an old timber house among hounds and horses guns and game traps she says i should be a very sightly man if beard was smoothed oftener and ruffles put on wristbands after the fashion of young captain carlisle she says too we might now alter our course of life and live upon our wealth like mr and mrs somebody in a different guess place than helter skelter hall upon this i clapped me on a clean shirt and a pair of silken stockings after i had doft leathern hunting breeches and without shamming i verily thought what with the powder in my hair and ribbon behind in beauknot not forgetting black crevat which the jade tied so as to make me look  i dont know how  i was one of your bettermost persons as i was walking along the large hall thus quippd old dashgrove the setting bitch barked at me as if she did not known master henry through his finery upon which i lent her a douze to teach her how to behave to man of pliteness after this tippler the spaniel came and fawned on me leaving the track of her paws on my silken stockings upon which i favored her also with such a flick that the poor thing howled for a quarter of an hour in short i cannot help speaking hash and taking a little upon me more than usual and this was partly the casion of my writing you such a rough letter for i finds i am grown devilish touchey since i came to be a great man and susan the maid says i am not like to be much the better for my riches seeing that i have got them and lost my goodnature i am most consumedly troubled to know what to do and mayhap that makes me growl more than i otherwise should sometimes i think of giving up my farm at skelter sometimes of buying racing horses sometimes of making myself cussed gay in the pareil way sometimes i have a mind to crackle it away in a coach sometimes to put worsted of different colors on joe jobsons coat and clap a cue to his head  but then again i cannot help telling hetty this would be damned nonsense for a feller like i who have as good a pair of legs as ever worked under a man and who has gone rough as he run this many  day i wish grandfather had thought fit to let us know what he meant to do for us about four or five years agone that we might have prepared ourselves to be gentlemen against he died with such warning i dont doubt but i should have been scholar enough to deck myself off to strut forth with a little black bag at the end of me and to have poppd in and out of a carriage very decently for damn it i know how the thing should go though i cannot so neatly do it as to captain carlisle neither you nor i can ever expect to cut the dash he cuts case why he was pappd in pliteness and sucked civility in his cradle besides which he has traveled for it far and near so that all the difference in that there matter lies only in the alteration you know but for all that if we could when he comes from broad which is to be soon get intos company now and then and take notice how he carries himself how he talks opens his lips and the like i dont doubt but we could make ourselves no small fools in the way of haviour when he is not by at present as i cannot think of doing as i did because hetty says that would be very unnatural i am horridly out of sorts and know not what will be the end on it i think as you are the best scholard you ought to write to mr de gray bout it cause he had once the care of us and as the world says made captain carlisle what he is  to live thus is out of the question so pray think of mending the matter hetty is airing me another ruffled shirt and says i must shift every day now i am a man of property the linen is rare and hot so i must ene put it on have only time therefore to say that  i am your afflicted brother hal hewson  letter x mrs hewson to miss de gray congratulate me sing songs of triumph to me my dear de gray i have brought mr hewson over to my politest wishes a little flattery and a lookingglass have completed the business all the fine things i design may be put in practice assist me therefore i beg of you that i may be perfectly elegant every hint of your taste will be now welcome to the impatient  henrietta hewson  letter xi captain carlisle to robert de gray esquire london my dear guardian the spirit of affection and duty made me hasten to leave the gardens of italy that i might be in time to enjoy the pleasures of prudence green at this beautiful period of the year that which was rome herself had no charms to attract me when the lure of such a society as that which your letter describes to me was thrown out for my heart and is it possible that i am so soon to return again to all those bewitching scenes wherein i first received those admirable precepts which have hitherto enabled me to resist temptation in almost every form i am in london nothing can seduce me to continue here beyond the time that is absolutely necessary to my journey so that i shall be at prudence green almost as soon as this short letter which announces me to you yet if there should be a moments advantage on the side of the letter pray employ it to tell miss de gray and the rest of your party how lingeringly i shall think the time till i salute them  i am sir your ever saithful servant and indulged friend clement carlisle  letter xii from the same to mr lascelles in london london dear lascelles i am in the most distressing state of mind in the world  the lady of the marquis of n with whom i was on friendly terms in italy has very inadvertently and under color of an attachment which i never before discovered followed me to england to my utter astonishment she is now before me too beautiful to be denied protection and yet in a situation on all hands too sacred for me long to bestow it she set off in a packet that sailed it seems at the same time mine did she is in the habit of a boy her husband doats upon her she looks with the brightest eyes into my face while with the most persuading voice she tells me she is in a strange land where she knows not a single friend what is to be done she came in upon me just after i had sent mr de greys letter to the post so that it cannot be recalled and truth requires my promises should be fulfilled  but the lady must be some way accommodated at least till she can be persuaded to return to the marquis  to your care therefore i commit her for a little time and i shall in the evening when i have reconciled her to this mode bring the fair fugitive to your house where in the mean time you will prepare your sister to receive her tell her at once the truth and depend on it that will ever in the end turn out for the best  farewell i am yours c carlisle  letter xiii from the same to the same after delivering the lady to the latter i write this to my dear lascelles with a hand that trembles for the situation of your fair charge she discovered methought as i delivered her to you an impatience of temper that may be fatal she talks of her husband with an ardour of resentment that i believe it is impossible so accomplished a man should have deserved i feel a compunction not very unlike reproach at being obliged to refuse her my address do you not agree with me that strong marks of disapprobation were painted in her countenance when i observed that all her sentiments would reach me by enclosing them either sealed or unsealed to you i did propose to have set out this day for mr de greys but i must apologize for a little delay because i judge it best to see how she settles with your family and to write to the marquis before i venture into the country where i had flattered my imagination with enjoying the most uninterrupted happiness as she is a native of england you know it is possible you may by some means trace out her relations some of whom are as i have been informed in london and yet till we have the marquiss answer it may perhaps be a more delicate piece of integrity to keep the matter out of every bodys mouth but the worthy family to whom it was necessary to entrust it on second thoughts therefore i beg matter may rest where it is in your faithful bosom and in that of miss lascelles in the mean time if augusta remains prudent and composed the whole indiscretion may be done away every thing may be hushed and the marquis be again made happy without the confusion of being congratulated by people who turn accidents into tabletalk for my own part i dare say it will be easy for me to convince the husband that i dealt honorably at best the dilemma is very displeasing and the only way lest is to act in it and to struggle through it as becomes a man of prudence and principle  i have the great satisfaction to be dear lascelles yours c c  letter xiv the marchioness of n to signora d at rome i followed him my viola i practiced to the very utmost my more than romantic resolution  i eluded even the vigilance of the marquis  i never lost sight of the exquisite carlisle  i surmounted every fatigue  i passed every where as a beardless youth of the italian soil and i am now returned to those shores from whence i drew my first breath and from whence i was so early carried to that part of your country where he who is now my husband first saw me  yes viola i am here  i am in london  i am within a short mile of the house of carlisle  but alas to what purpose my passion is in despair my mode of gratifying it has been irregular  i blush at my weakness  but i am still weak enough to love  to love viola with a fervor that is equally my shame and my agony yet i propose only to be within his view  a sight of him  a touch of his hand  his conversation  his smile  these were my ambition violent as i am i tell you the extent of my guilt  but these are already denied me he has left me in charge of his friends who are brother and sister  they treat my misfortune with tenderness  the sister speaks warmly of mr carlisles virtues i perceive that the words honorable attachment are favorites  confusion viola perhaps she is  yet that is not likely  i will not have it so i could not bear it at a village on the borders of italy my speed brought me near enough to see him salute a female acquaintance and though modesty and reason all concurred to sanctify the civility yet i wanted dignity enough in my nature to restrain the execration which i uttered against her beauty no no it is some comfort yet even were i never more to behold him which would kill me  it is some comfort yet that his heart is without other attachments  my condition calls for ten thousand comforts and i foresee not one will be allowed me  i have numberless circumstances to tell you but i want ease and composure to write the marquis has i suppose left rome in a rage for the first time in my life although i have long despised him have i taken advantage of his confidence but it was only to escape from the object of my aversion to that of my fondness  of my adoration  perhaps the marquis may suspect every thing i was so cautious to conceal if so my dear carlisle is in danger i am not ignorant of the marquiss temper i have felt its violence  he struck me viola the villain in his meanness struck me i never shall either forget or forgive it  carlisle in danger  in danger  for what  for his unparallelled integrity  for his dignity  for his truth ah signora were he the most guilty instead of being the most innocent of men my romantic soul would take fire at the prospect of his peril and set life fame hope and heaven itself at a hazard to defend him i am interrupted  let my secret be yours  adieu for a little time to the wretched augusta n  letter xv george lascelles esquire to captain carlisle about two hours ago augusta very earnestly requested the use of pen and paper which you may be sure was directly brought her she has since had wax and a candle and i suppose will presently desire a letter to be put into the post office  it may very possibly my friend be addressed to some friend of here is or yours in one case we might perhaps were we in possession of the facts escape danger and in the other we might it is likely get a clue to those circumstances which would bring this disagreeable affair the sooner to an issue either way it may serve our purposes i shall therefore instead of putting this letter into the post enclose it for you that no opportunity of assisting us may escape  adieu i am yours george lascelles  letter xvi captain carlisle in answer your zeal to serve a friend must have thrown you from your guard my dear lascelles for i am certain it could not require more than a moments recollection to convince you of the impropriety of breaking a seal for any private purpose whatsoever neither you nor i have certainly any farther control over the lady than just to entertain her as her condition may require till she is invited home by the marquis to whom i was preparing to write just as your favor came to hand i lay aside this business however for a minute just to entreat you will suffer your servants to obey her wishes as you would i know order them to obey the wishes of  yours c carlisle  letter xvii captain carlisle to the marquis of n at signor  s in rome or elsewhere london sir were it not that your situation called rather for condolence than mirth i could acquaint you in very jocular language of a circumstance that carries with it the air of an adventure in the days of chivalry  the heroine or rather the ladyerrant of this enterprise is your augusta who taking advantage of your journey about the time of my departure was resolved to be even with you for the anxieties of separation and so paid you in kind by taking a trip to england i dare say she intended at first only to amuse herself with a short excursion to deceive the time till your return but the spirited creature with all that ardor which you know belongs to her character laid her plan of operation in such a manner that when she was once embarked it was absolutely impossible to retreat she contrived the matter so as to pass upon every body for an italian stripling traveling to england properly equipped for the opera house the better to support which she was provided with suitable habiliments and above all a distinguishing kind of headdress that masked her from every thing but the most critical inspection it will demand all your best opinion of my veracity to credit me when i protest to you that she escaped my notice through the whole journey nor was i acquainted with any part of the circumstance till in completing the project she discovered herself to me in my own apartments in london it was not for me to upbraid her upon the principle of the pain you was suffering nor was it proper she should remain with one who has not the honor to be in the married state i therefore advised her to be as easy as her reflections would allow at the house of a particular friend of mine who has a sister that will preserve her safe till she is once more in the arms of her marquis the step she has taken was certainly carrying the joke too far and no doubt she herself thinks so but when you consider her youth her high spirits her wellknown fidelity to you and above all the perils she has safely passed without a single soul to protect her you have i think on the whole rather more reason to laugh it off as a frolic than to chide her for it as an impropriety  whatever mode of receiving her you propose shall be attended to and if you cannot come all the way yourself i will see that she is reconducted to the borders of italy or even to your very house in rome or to that in paris if you judge it necessary your answer will determine me in every thing that relates to the lady whom i have the honor in the mean time to have in protection be assured sir the trust is as safe as it is sacred and that i am with all a friends anxiety your  most obedient humble servant clement carlisle p s  your lady sir is at the house of mr lascelles in bondstreet london whither you will please to direct your reply and where should you on the present or any future occasion choose to visit london i take the liberty of friendship to say you will be cordially received    letter xviii the marchioness of n to mr carlisle enclosed by mr lascelles  i must see you though it be but for five moments but since it is so very irksome to you i give you a whole week to prepare yourself for a visit in the mean time your repose shall not be invaded by  your augusta n  letter xix mr gabriel hewson to robert de gray esquire sir my brother dear to me by affinity of blood and by the coadjoining bonds of a settled friendship my brother and i sir have lately been much inveloped in the deep abyss of meditation the additions to our fortunes have as is but too generally the case brought with them additions of carking care and perturbed reflection  we find it impossible to enjoy ourselves as we used to do before the benevolence of fate distinguished us by her splendid favors my brother is unable to take the salutary exercises of the fields and forests crowned with leafy honors and i for my part can find neither gaiety in horace nor argument in tully we conceive something should be done to make riches sit easy on us we believe books will not do this for me nor hounds for him  in fine we are sollicitous even to a considerable degree of anxiety to acquire a relish of those exterior ornamentals which so particularly mark you and captain carlisle from all men of our acquaintance we understand the captain is shortly to be at the green and therefore as your indulging nature has very often pressed upon us an invitation we could conjointly wish it might be agreeable to your leisure and consonant to your convenience to permit us to pass a few days under the sanctification of your hospitality while the captain is with you that we may have the advantage of making ourselves very passable copies from the reiterated imitation of so admirable an original my brother henry and i sir are very impatient for the honor of your answer to this our consequential request  sir i am yours reverentially gabriel hewson  letter xx mr henry hewson to robert de gray esquire hon guardian that was i understands that gab has formd you of our resolution to be bettermost persons whereof the reasons good and natural seeing that we are not the folks we was seeing we are richer our ideerers are no more the same they was than any thing and i have put it intos head to see what hand may be made on us supposin we had a good sightly moral before us for certain the captain is as fine a pattern as need to be taken for any mans sample and you are no small fool at making a bow yourself you and he therefore are the men we mean to cut out by and my hetty would have no jection to make a sample of your daughter who every body must own has more the jig of a gentlewoman than any body within ten miles oher i send these few lines by joe just to clap brother gabs letter as it were on the back and do the thing more plitely for certainly the more parsons write to a man out of one family the more respectful we understands also that you are to have visitors go lore over and above the captain that we have no sort of rejection to case why we are sure for sartain none are harbored at prudence green but your tiptop specie so much the better for we case why as we go on purpose to make a hand on it and get as much as we can out of every body why we can take one bit of haviour from one another bit from another and so on till we are up to the whole gig of the thing hetty is ene almost ready to fly over the moon upon casion of this  she is a duced cute one at taking any thing in hand she has a mind to and i surspect she will pull the feathers out of the fine ones till she is as pretty a bird as the best of them i would lay two of my teeth to a teester that she bridles and briggles to a nicety in less time than i shall want to make me doff hat with decency for to tell you the truth i have a cussed way of being covered in company and i think it is a pity you was not guardian of my manners as well as my money  but i have said enough to show you what i would be at and therefore i have no casion to make a long affair ont like master gab who i dont doubt has muddled his brains never so long to write to you a fine long rigmerol and pick and choose words out of diksonnerry mayhap i may be one of your better sort as soon as he for all his scholarship not that i would have you magine squire i dont think gab knows how to handle a pen but i think a man may talk a little plainer than gab aye and write a little plainer too for i do sure you parson of our parish who put on his gown at varsity has sometimes enough to do to make him out when he writes his flourididdles to me and hetty says he is no more fit for pliteness than my dog dashgrove but this is atween ourselves squire i have written my paper all through purpose case you should not be fended and if it had been more i would have gone to the end on it i sure you for you are just the sort of man i like and after all i dont know when i come to set this over against that whether i shant take more of the bettermost person from you than from the captain himself i am with hettys love to miss de gray  your dutiful friend to command henry hewson p s  i think i would not have you say to any of the folks at the green what lay gab and i are upon for it is natural to think gentlemen and ladies who have bought breeding and pliteness dear may not choose to have as it were their pockets picked on it by a couple of chaps who come a purpose to carry off the best part of em i should not like it myself    letter xxi miss de gray to mrs hewson dear madam my father is writing billets of invitation to your husband and brother and he has assigned to me the pleasing task of requesting you will not forget to join our society which is to meet on the  0th instant when it is expected the green will be exceedingly gay besides captain carlisle there will be a lord and lady blessingbourne and sir andrew flight their nephew they are all persons who are able to form the taste as far as it depends on fashionable carriage at the same time if you will take my advice it would rather recommend to you the perpetuation of your original content than any attempts at copied splendour but this is a sentiment out of the line of my commission and the letter you favored me with will better be answered in conversation than upon paper do not forget the  0th and remember in the mean time  your most obedient servant lucia de gray p s  mr medway is already with us    letter xxii oliver medway esquire to mr townsend i had scarce set my foot on prudence green when de gray put into my hand a letter which not only mentions the arrival of carlisle in england but his coming post into the country this news was confirmed by the charming lucia with a smile upon her face in my opinion townsend a better intentioned smile than she ever bestowed upon me to be sure an old friend has a claim upon ones cordiality and no man deserves so large a share as captain carlisle  no man better loves him and his virtues than i do  and certainly a smile upon the subject of expecting him was not wrong  but why so very kind a formation of the features why must the eyes sparkle so brilliantly on the occasion why this rapture so directly upon the very front of his arrival  i have the tenderest regard for carlisle in the world but if  confusion  i must not be sported with  my passion is too nice too noble and too near my heart for that i must look about me a little  adieu yours oliver medway  letter xxiii from the same to captain carlisle in london dear carlisle after having told you in a few words that you are as welcome to me as ever was friend to friend i must ask you a question which if you have time as your last billet to mr de gray mentioned a short delay i entreat you will answer by the post even before you come amongst us you are not ignorant of my regard for lucia i have sent you from time to time fifty sheets of paper on the subject i have reason to think you are as great a favorite as myself no woman should dare to divide her heart i insist upon an entire passion or none you know my humor i love you above all men but if you have even in thought supplanted me let the needful be done without noise seconds are out of the question when combatants know each other you are as brave as heaven i am not apt to retreat myself there was a sort of satisfaction in lucias face i must absolutely have explained i have in de greys green paddock the best and fleetest horse in england at this time grazing  he knows when i travel upon life and death  you understand me  farewell till i see you  your sincere friend o medway p s  the rest of de greys party come to night our laughing philosopher and whimsical wag sir andrew is in the groupe    letter xxiv captain carlisles answer how can you my dear medway still continue your cruel humor how few moments thinking would have been necessary to set your fluttering heart to rest on every subject that concerns lucia de gray the vehemence with which you first disclosed your passion to me and the large strides you said you had made toward gaining her affections put an entire end to all attempts which perhaps might otherwise have been made by me upon the subject neither by look nor letter have i ever since that time addressed any thing to lucia that aimed at her heart and your three latest letters which came to my hands in italy wherein you assure me your tenderness for that lady is fully returned put such an additional check upon my conduct that i looked upon the business as too far gone for any third person except mr de gray who it seems approves the match to interfere without infamy besides that i shall embrace you shortly i have just now such a kind of engagement to fulfill that i must apologize for having replied to your letter so hastily i am as for many years i have been  dear medways affectionate friend clement carlisle  letter xxv captain carlisle to george lascelles esquire what is to be done now my dear lascelles  a circumstance has fallen out even worse than the affair of augusta mr de gray forgot to inform me that the only person whom i should not meet at prudence green would make a distinguished member of his summer society but yet how should he imagine it was necessary to apprize me of it knowing as he does of our long friendship and not knowing there is any delicate matter on which it depends the nature of my difficulty will appear to you better when i tell you medway is of the party  medway the most generous positive goodhumoured quarrelsome man in the universe  medway whose sensibility of honor and jealous misconceptions expose him every hour to a hazard of his life if you have forgot my situation with this flaming hero the enclosures will revive the whole track of the story in your memory had i not apprehended that he was to pass the summer in oxfordshire i should by no means have accepted of an invitation even from mr de gray nor indeed should i by right have left italy till the secret cause of my going thither became mrs medway and had retired with her husband from prudence green as the good of society is no way concerned in the communication of this my private bosom secret no man but mr lascelles is trusted with it  as to augusta i am glad to find she is so well reconciled to our last conversation your sister will certainly by her enchanting treatment make a thorough convert of her and at least keep her quiet without more interviews till i get the marquiss answer were it not therefore for medways affair i should now go down to the green in high spirits with regard to lucia i consider her so much the property of another that i could certainly meet her unalarmed were not that other under the same roof  the enclosures being letters received formerly from medway letter  dear carlisle you know many of my secrets so now take the greatest i ever had i love your guardians friend lucia de gray to this secret add one more she loves me i have the best of reasons for saying so my fortune is good pray help me in this affair with her father  yours o medway   letter  from mr c  in answer dear medway as the affection betwixt you and miss de gray is you say mutual it shall never be interrupted but on the other hand promoted by  yours c carlisle   letter  dear captain i have more and more cause to interpret lucias conduct in my favor de gray i know leaves all these points to his daughters prudence so that although my notion of such a transaction is to keep it quite private till the day of marriage even though that marriage should not take place for several years i desire you as a friend to consider lucia as the contracted spouse of  yours o medway   the answer dear medway as you have doubtless the most solid foundations for speaking with such strength and certainty of the subject in question i take it for granted the ladys heart is wholly set upon the match i do not therefore see that your happiness depends upon secrecy however since you enjoin me to privacy i will humor your singularity so far as to obey you  adieu clement carlisle     letter xxvi miss de gray to miss lascelles prudence green he comes he comes  this night he will be here  yes my dear lascelles  carlisle will this very night be here but perhaps your brother his old friend may have already heard from him we all wish for him with the fondest impatience even the impetuous medway acknowledges him to be a man of the finest honor in the world by the bye caroline that medway is a strange being i know not what to make of him  he is always begging me to smile upon him and when i do smile he whispers in my ear hush hush my dear soul hush dont speak about it  a smile is enough a smile is enough he came to me yesterday evening in the garden and must needs change flowers  i agreed to his humor and he cried out in a transport that almost frightened me such a little transaction as this with those who act upon terms of honor binds the bargain as firmly as the bonds of hymen he may be a very gallant man my dear but he is the strangest creature i know for all that and though our acquaintance is of two years standing he is as much a riddle to me as ever the best part of him is that he is the friend of carlisle  i am carlisles friend too but i still enjoin you not to hint this to any creature breathing a little before i first saw medway i really thought carlisle had an affection for me but many things have concurred since to persuade me that i am not only indifferent but disagreeable to him his excursion to italy above all other things confirms this  ah caroline how can so gentle and susceptible a heart as his be insensible to  but i have done  adieu lucia de gray  letter xxvii mr de gray to captain carlisle prudence green welcome thrice welcome to your native shore welcome to those shades which are now blooming at your arrival i have this minute attended lord and lady blessingbourne and their nephew the antic sir andrew from their carriage medway also is with us and your old neighbors mr and mrs hewson with the studious mr gabriel lucia says when you are come down we shall have quite a company of contrasts there may be for ought i know some truth in the observation at least there is a pretty opposition in some of the characters i am sure mr gabriel is no bad contrast to mr henry lord blessingbourne and his lady are not amiss in the same way lucia and mrs hewson have a marking difference and i very well know how and where the distinction is to be made betwixt mr medway and captain carlisle i hope by the time this reaches you all impediments to your journey will be past and that i shall have it in my power personally to assure you with what unalterable truth i am  your friend and servant r de gray  letter xxviii sir andrew flight to mr heathcoate oh joy joy give me joy without end my dear heathcoate such game such fun such a summer is before me that neither you or i can possibly want amusement prudence place is absolutely crammed with the entertainment which of all others you and i most adore even with the pleasures of ridicule there are no less than three originals in the house besides my uncle and aunt who even yet are not entirely out of date here is a farmer who would be a gentleman his wife beautiful as venus who would be a lady the farmers brother who though neither fish flesh nor fowl designs to be a scholar and my dear aunt and uncle who are magnificent superb highbred  nothings at all with such a groupe not forgetting that son of the seven furies olly medway if i dont have some precious sport and send you from time to time some sheets full of fun why then i have lost my knack and nature tries to entertain me in vain this summer that is all i say on the subject  as to lucia de gray and her dad they are quite upon the grave order you know and a man may look at their tempers for twelve months together without finding a tittle that is ludicrous so that i fear we can scarce rank any of these amongst our sources no matter ridicule is pregnant in every mothers child of the others and you may expect to have a dish of the dear dear ridiculous to me more palatable than ortolans at least every second postday but heightyteighty who have we here what figure comes prancing down yon avenue majestic as the oaks which shade and debonnair as the skies which encanopy it it gains upon me as i survey it from the window those little animals called men when mounted upon the backs of those larger animals called horses are proper objects for the sportings of such spirits as ours my heathcoate but in this particular instance in this most brilliant exception there is no hinge whereon to fasten a joke this object looks like a man even while he is bestriding a beast his hair is caught by the gale  his proportions charm away the very genius of burlesque i have not a jest in my imagination to throw at him no fun in this visitor neither  he alights  zounds heathcoate this fellow has found out the art of displaying the graces in getting from his stirrup the very horse seems conscious of his burden he gives a paw of reluctance at quitting him the family are all flocking about the stranger  what prince  what deity is it who can thus attract universal attention and turn my descriptions out of their accustomed channel  i must lay down the pen to enquire  in continuation heathcoate could you possibly believe it  the very image of one of my oldest acquaintances yea even of my schoolfellow who was a clever fellow when i was a dunce had quite left me  yes heathcoate such improvements are made in every part of captain carlisles everhandsome person that i knew him not till another of his ornaments melting from his captivating voice brought him again into my memory one would think there could be no great matter of attraction for such a ludicrous being as i in seeing a young man pay compliments to a parcel of people who were prepared for such civility and yet by my soul i stood gaping at this salutation as if i was as young a beginner as the hewsons i question whether the god of breeding himself could have pulled off his hat with such an air  then his attention was so properly distributed  zounds heathcoate his bows went through the very souls of the women  but what have i to do with such a subject  carlisle is come to make us all look ugly in the eyes of the wenches and so there is an end of it   however for this disappointment one way i am resolved to have full measure of revenge another since a brighter sun appears and i can only be in shadow i am determined not to be disgraced without vengeance as i cannot shine i will laugh most inordinately and i here swear by the rubied lips of lucia de gray that i will enjoy every thing that ridicule can fairly catch at throughout all the flowery regions of prudence place neither man nor beast shall escape me if either leans yea but ever so little to the ludicrous this vow is sealed by the sanction of jupiter i nod and knit my brows upon it  yours andrew flight  letter xxix captain carlisle to george lascelles esquire from prudence place i am arrived safe my dear friend but fresh embarrassments rise before me i was more affected at the sight of lucia de gray than i ought to be amidst all the air of general gaiety the eyes of medway were intently fixed on me the whole evening much of what is commonly called fun passed at the supper table at the expense of two or three foolish people who are out of their element  neither medway nor lucia partook of this the night however closed harmoniously and my return to prudence place was honored by a general bumper of burgundy but about ten minutes after the company separated for the night medways valet tapped at my door and presented the enclosed billet  to captain carlisle i cannot sleep dear carlisle without assuring you that i am now fully satisfied of your conduct i looked at you for more than two hours and i dont think you addressed to lucia  my lucia any glances of concupiscence this is the greatest obligation in the whole world to  yours o m n b hush  hush     if this prospect of being perpetually tormented by the vigilant jealousies of this hotheaded man continues and if i cannot so far master my own sensibilities on a certain occasion my stay in this quarter will certainly not be long it is living under a double imprisonment both of soul and body nor till the marchioness is gone can i with propriety repair again to your house the rule of my life has ever been not to throw myself unnecessarily into the path of temptation it is to my feelings which are always poignantly wounded by the least shaft of selfreproach as well as to my sense of religion that i owe escape from many a mischief into which i otherwise might fall i pique myself a little upon the virtue of making a seasonable retreat my sensibility tells me now that i am here in danger i should be by no means in a road absolutely safe if i were with you it will require some adroitness to disentangle myself if matters do not mend i must alter my present address although were my heart quite easy i could be well enough amused with this motley groupe at prudence place and enter into every inoffensive levity with the most serious spirit imaginable you see by the air of my letter that at present i can neither write or speak with certainty of any thing i can only say in general terms that the joys i anticipated like most things forestalled do not sparkle in the cup so briskly as i expected they are dashed by some bitter disappointments i have a passion fretting my heart which has no lawful right to lie in my bosom i feel it to be the tyrannizing serpent  i smart under the sharpness of its tooth and yet like the man in the fable i foster it do you not think my lascelles that lucias passion for the boisterous medway is a little inconsistent with that uncommon delicacy and gentleness which seem to mark her own mind but there is nothing so idle as an attempt to decypher the hieroglyphics of love mr medway is the man of her choice mr medway is therefore not to be questioned upon the subject of his success  i am yours c carlisle  letter xxx george lascelles esquire to captain carlisle previous to receiving the above it touches me very nearly to be so soon under a necessity of transmitting to you a letter from our fair lady which if i may judge from the air of anger with which it was given does not contain the sentiments of a quiet disposition previous to your coming here the other night i saw through the little artifice of her dressing at you in full taste it brought to my mind that sweet line of the poet now aweful beauty puts on all her charms notwithstanding this you had fortitude of resistance superior even to her beauty how you are able to do these things is wonderful for my part i fairly confess if i knew any lady of any country half so lovely and half so longing i certainly should suffer any little scruples i might have to be soon overruled and were it in my power to make such a woman happy happy she should be as to the marchioness she has fire enough in her eyes even to talk down the continence of an anchorite not that i blame your virtue or accuse your taste no my dear carlisle i admire both i look up to the one with envy to the other with despair but this is no time either for comment or compliment the marchionesss letters to you ought instantly to be forwarded since from the peculiar violence of her temper a moments delay might produce the most disagreeable consequences my sister wishes every hour for the marquiss letter although it is impossible he should get yours for some time the two ladies parted from each other yesterday in tears i am not yet master of the meaning carolines confidence is impregnable unless she thinks it right to disclose any matter her dearest friends would not be let into the secret  farewell george lascelles  letter xxxi the marchioness to captain carlisle have i not sufficient cause to curse my fate that has left me without one solid reason to sanctify my affection have i not reason too to curse that barbarous father who sacrificed me to the most hateful man upon earth  who sold me for a title which i despise and to embraces which are bitter to me as the bonds of death the great the counterbalancing arguments mr carlisle are all on your side and therefore my pleadings are all against the tide but i see all that is to happen  you will never see me more  you refuse me your direction  you will have your london apartments  your friends will grow weary of me and i shall be in utter despair ah what a foundation have i for such suspicions how cuttingly cold was the air with which you last addressed me how cautiously cruel your civility  you took my hand but it trembled as if at the touch of infection while mine on the contrary throbbed with a violence that denoted the agitations of my heart your whole discourse was general or if it ever became particular it turned upon my husband  the most detested of all subjects but this was not enough you dare not trust yourself with me alone i am reduced to such infamy that it was necessary to converse with me in the presence of a third person that third person too must needs be a woman but you were deceived i did not in that complotted interview show myself so abandoned as you expected i was conscious of the deepness of the triumph and i fell before it my situation is not even yet perhaps quite erased from your memory you recollect some part of my confusion i conjure you however mr carlisle by love and i charge you by what is due to distress not to insult her whom you cannot redress pity is at least my due and when you are not disposed to bestow that for honors sake do not substiture contempt pray what is to become of the unfortunate  augusta n  letter xxxii miss de gray to miss lascelles oh my beloved caroline mr carlisle is at our house and yet i am more wretched than i was before his arrival he certainly detests me he speaks in form and though he can never lose his politeness which is a part of his very nature yet he has wholly lost his friendship how can i possibly have forfeited this we were bred up together you know caroline always in the same house for some time in the same cradle it is to carlisle i owe my early relish for reading and every better ornament nothing could possibly be more cordial or more familiar than we were formerly wherefore has he robbed me of his attention  of his brotherly attention  but i suppose he has been fortunate in his italian attachments  the friendships of a warmer clime are doubtless more attracting and more animated i know not what to think certainly mr carlisle never gave me reason to imagine i was more in his esteem than  than  than  but why do i talk caroline he absolutely does every thing but flatly shun me  to increase my vexation that tiresome wretch medway becomes more strange than ever half an hour ago he put into my hand the nonsense i enclose  to the fairest and faithfullest if it was necessary for people of honor to make speeches i could make many about your good sense etc  but enough upon that subject  let not the telltale gossips of the air talk of my whereabout silence has the most meaning i hate noise i write this to tell you that i had no objection to your laughing last night at the hewsons  though had any man breathing laughed half so much at me i would have sent him upon a message to the moon  but no matter  hush  it is to my content that you should be as pleasant as you please  burn this  walls have ears  worms have eyes  you understand me  o m   surely the man is a fool but i am in no humor to comment on his absurdity  for heavens sake write caroline to  your very unhappy lucia de gray  letter xxxiii sir andrew flight to mr heathcoate ha ha ha ha  oh laugh thou divine cure for every care thou celestial convulsion let me enjoy thee and let me at the same time show my generosity by sharing thee with my friend  i have laid a plot my friend such a plot as will ensure thy felicity for a month you are to have two new correspondents such as before never honored thee and i beg thou will pay proper respect and make thy responses in due and decent form not a word more till thou hear farther of this matter from another quarter in the mean time let me end as i began with one of those everdelicious bursts of the soul which mark the constitution of  your andrew flight  letter xxxiv mr gabriel hewson to mr heathcoate sir i have just been informed that you take a liberal delight and a generous joy in being a witness to the progress of any gentlemans instruction and the worthy sir andrew with affability ineffable and complaisance corresponding has assured me that you are of opinion the talents will receive a quicker polish from letterwriting or the art epistolary than even by reading or conversing he adds that although my improvements have been considerable they would make double impression by being communicated in writing to an ingenious absent person now sir it happens that i am thought to be the most enlightened man of my acquaintance which i should account unlucky was i not comforted by the idea given me by sir andrew of finding in you sir a person who will kindly receive my sentiments upon breeding as i am enabled to pick them up from time to time i shall enjoy by these means a double honor and advantage and i wait only for your kind permission to commence  i am sir most profoundly your obedient gabriel hewson p s  my brother is setting pen to paper or at least designs so to do soon for a similar honor    letter xxxv mr henry hewson to lord blessingbourne my very good lord i have a mind to try my hand at a  pistle nearer home before i venture abroad just as your lordship may have seen a parcel of young birds fly a few yards back wards and forwards upon the neighboring hedges before they are so bold as to lose sight of their nest this i find by your nephew is a simularius so that you see i have got something already but the meaning of my writing to your lordship is as i have got a corrsen  that i may  get one for my hetty who is so much improved since she came to prudunce pleace that she would be hanged as soon as write to any thing under a gentlewoman of the bettermost specie now i think your lady is of this genii so i write unknown to hett that i may get your leave for she to write to she whereof the honor would be clear as the noontide pray put your reply to this privately into my hand when we next walk for sake of the genteel thing up and down the garden mean time know me to be what i am  yours h hewson  letter xxxvi sir andrew flight to mr heathcoate better and better still the gudgeons bite this warm weather at prudence place most gloriously every minute teems with ridicule i have played off that heaviest of the hewson lump mr henry upon my uncle yea even upon the pompous muscles of lord blessingbourne to whom the farmer has written in form just to get intos fist as he elegantly phrases it i spirited him up to this and so contrived it that the letter should be given to his lordship exactly at the proper crisis  even while he was at a magnificent teteatete with my lady upon that constant subject of theirs the dignity of rank and family i took care also to enter his room by the way of morning devoir just as the epistle was delivered  no coronet at the top of the seal  and yet  the scrawling and genteel upanddown of the superscription is politely illegible enough to come from somebody of rank says the earl  do thou know the hand my lady  no indeed my lord  it is not in my list of hands  if it approaches toward any of my correspondents  continues my lady  it is the countess of cannotspell in my opinion my lady said i it bears strong marks of the duchess of letterblot that copious command of capitals in the lord looks astonishingly like the finger and thumb of her grace  whew says my uncle there is no postmarks i cannot possibly account for this my lady ten to one uncle replied i the contents will unravel the mystery in a moment that is to say if the writing is not too fashionable  his lordship broke the seal which mr henry told me he once valued much it being the exact effigy of the finest greyhound bitch that ever nabbled the scut of a bare  none of my friends fasten letters nephew with the engraving of a dog   heaven and familyhonours exclaims my nevertobeforgotten uncle what have we here with my very good lord at the top and your h hewson at the bottom h hewson pray who is this familiar mr h hewson i suffer no freedoms from such pens as these  no indeed dont you said my lady  suffer me to read it to you my lord said i i cannot possibly conceive the meaning of it  i read it heathcoate and gave it all its graces it was not without great difficulty the angry earl sat it out his comments were exquisite i enclose the original on purpose that you may compare a few of them  a simularius cried his lordship what does the fellow mean by that prudunce pleace and pray how could mr de gray at his grave time of life admit such a creature as this to prudunce pleace prudunce pleace rejoined my lady oh the illiterate  ha ha ha  i went on but was soon stopped again a woman of the bettermost specie a lady of this genii and for she to write to she  did you ever hear such impudence said i my lord  impudence replied my lady pray nephew order my coach this very day does mr de gray who though a very worthy man is only a mr imagine we are to be insulted by rifraff whom he thinks fit to make our equals they may perhaps be equals for a mr but they are no proper company for persons whose names move upon a different construction  that is very true aunt said i and it is perfectly unpardonable in that little lowminded monosyllable mr to behave thus rudely to names of a nobler sound and a different construction mr indeed i should not have thought of it  dont be witty andrew neither says my aunt  madam your ladyship does me wrong said i i despise mr as cordially as your ladyship and i even bought sir andrew that i might never have any thing more to do with him mr quotha  be that as it may nephew rejoined my lord rising upon his toes and swelling out his breast as is usual with him when he feels the might of any sentiment be that i say as it may  you very well know the stock from whence our family sprung you very very well know that we have not a plebeian particle about us and though it is very true you bought sir andrew with my money on account of my abhorrence of mr yet you have the best of blood in your veins  yes nephew i will take upon me to say with very little exaltation of voice you have the best blood heaven and familyhonours here is usage indeed  thank heaven and my nobleblooded ancestors my lord nobody better said i  the veins of your aunt are not less dignified   sensible of that my lord said i her ladyships fine blood shines beside her fair complexion like the violet that grows among the lillies of the valley  not amiss said my uncle simpering   pshaw you madcap cried my aunt patting my shoulder and looking at the back of her hand after gently rubbing it  hang it rejoined my uncle forgetting for a moment his dignity this poor h hewson means no harm after all he is a poor simple thing  an unfortunate fish out of water you may see by all his actions said i and i dare say thinks he has lived upon shore long enough since he has had the honor to write a letter to lord and lady blessingbourne  do you think so nephew cried my uncle and aunt tickled by the flattery well then let us not be offended let the affair drop  i do really think my lord rejoined i if you were to write him an answer you would make the poor fellow feel as if he were in heaven  answer him said my lord what can i say to such a being  say something however said my lady to the poor devil  my uncle ordered the writing apparatus and after as much writing as might have been necessary to lay the plot of a comedy he wrote upon a large gilt card in a hand very little better than hewsons the following sentiments  to h hewson the earl and countess of blessingbourne received h hewsons letter containing a simularius and several other curiosities worthy the pen of such a genii as h hewson as h hewsons hett is it seems a person of the bettermost specie the earl and countess have no objection to she writing to she as often as she chooses as sir andrew flight who is it appears h hewsons friend conveys this card there is no occasion to watch any slyer opportunity to get it to h hewsons hand the earl and countess have only to desire h hewson will not boast of this honor received from them and to address them in public as little as possible at least till he and his hett are bettermost persons   this card heathcoate penned so exactly to my wish after being sealed with a flourish of the best wax and stamped with the broad blessingbourne arms capped with a coronet and decorated with supporters was delivered to my care  i carried it to the farmergentleman whom i found disputing the point of politeness with that beautiful piece of ignorance his wife  she was pleased to be hugely offended by the contents of his lordships card and declared that mr hewson writ without her knowledge  as to acquaintances she had plenty  that she wrote every night to miss de gray and chose to owe her improvements to her own ingenuity  then it is not my fault cried the husband you will bear me witness sir andrew i have done my duty it is none of my seeking that she will not horrespond with a ladyship and a countess as for my part i am not above getting all i can out of high and low so i shall write just as i see cassion either to my lord or master heathcoate and now you talk othat i must go scheme out a letter for the lastnamed borrespondent directly  away he went and i enjoyed the society of his hett all alone she is absolutely a more charming woman in my eyes heathcoate even than lucia de gray nor does she want sense if she was not so consumedly addicted to admire every thing which you and i despise but her beauty  her lips  eyes  neck  chest  waist  arm  cheek  bosom  ancle   i am yours andrew flight  letter xxxvii captain carlisle to george lascelles esquire i have had a very foolish accident happen to aggravate the uneasiness of the marchionesss last letter it is in itself a trifle yet the consequence to my peace will make it important to you sir andrew flight was playing off his witticisms and waggeries upon the ignorance of some country simpletons that are now at the place when i became so weary of his vociferous amusement for where is the pleasure of sporting with inexperience  that i withdrew to mr de greys garden unobserved or at least uninterrupted by the company medway was watching his fishingrod lord blessingbourne was withdrawn to his chamber for his afternoons nap mr de greys garden is exceedingly large and part of it is disposed into a wilderness whose zigzag is so intricate that you may sometimes have your whole prospect terminated by a yards distance the surrounding foliage too is of the thickest growth being suffered to expand for several years receiving from the gardener from time to time only such cares and loppings as to render the beautiful confusion more agreeable seats and bowers apparently artificial with here and there a dripping grotto are distributed irregularly and the shades are every where so abundant that the sunbeams rather cheer you by stealth than by permission i have for my own part an attachment  a sort of sentimental friendship and good will for every bench and for every tree they were all favorites of my infancy i sat upon the benches and i caught instruction from the lips of mr de gray under the trees this therefore was the first time of my hailing them since my return believe me i felt sensations that thrilled me as i revisited the places of my accustomed contemplation i bade them welcome with as much ardour as if they were animate i walked along the green meander recognizing my old acquaintances i listened to birds whose notes i affected to be intimate with my ear as if they issued from the same warblers i had heard formerly i complimented the cascades upon an improved melody in their cadence every breeze that played upon every leaf revived the balmy pleasures of infancy even intercourse with other countries not odorous italy herself had not been able to supplant the tenderness i bore to the vernal beauties of prudence place  ah lascelles what could be the reason of this presently i came to an alcove which was originally the architecture of two children who grew up together it was a whole weeks labor divided betwixt miss de gray and your carlisle our little hands twisted the twigs formed the archings and subdued the obstinate shrubs with inconceivable industry many a time we rested from the toil and as often being delighted with our progress we renewed it when it was completed we gave  oh i shall never forget it  a kiss of tenderest congratulation as at having finished a work of infinite importance big with this innocent flattery we ran hand in hand to our guardian and with elated hearts bade him survey well our workmanship the gravity with which he commended and his affected astonishment at our ingenuity gave the last and fullest stroke of our pride and vanity over the entrance our guardian caused to be imprinted upon a label in golden letters this soothing intelligence to the stranger  this bower was raised by clement and lucia  the robinredbreast built in it the next the very next year and we had then you know the best reason in the world to think that heaven itself was pleased with our amusement the nest you may be sure was preserved for both piety and pity were concerned in its protection we trod with caution while the sacred bird was hatching the whole feathered family presently took wing and i do verily believe i hear one of them now whistling near my window  oh lascelles how soon is the heart that wishes to be inoffensive lulled by little circumstances smile not then if i tell you that i saw with transport the names of lucia and clement still legible on their bower  the branches of sweetbriar on either side were eagerly extending as if to embrace  and i beheld the initials of my name very recently cut in the rind of a hawthorn that formed one of the supports of our alcove  what sweet circumstances  how they melt the heart cried i  at that moment the softesttuned voice in the world repeated distinctly the following verses from her favorite poet  in these deep solitudes and aweful cells where heavenly pensive contemplation dwells and evermusing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyon this last retreat why feels my heart it is longforgotten heat yet yet i love from abelard it came and eloisa yet must kiss the name you are not to be told it was lucia de gray in the next instant she passed within sight of me the book still in her hand unprepared on both sides for the surprise we were inexpressibly confused beautiful lines miss de gray said i yes indeed replied she i think miss de gray in a former part of our life we used frequently to read the charming mr pope together  in this very garden mr carlisle do you recollect your old bower said she if i mistake not madam said i  madam clement madam mr carlisle replied she as if a little offended i say continued i miss de gray if i remember right this is that bower you had almost forgot it then mr carlisle had you i suppose italy the garden of the universe has put all our english roses quite out of countenance prudence place is to be sure a mere nettlebed  ah no madam said i upon the edge of an explanation but happily checking myself in time though certainly italy has its charms oh no doubt of it replied lucia but i believe sir the company will have lost their chief felicity by your absence i hear mr medway coming i know his rapid random step and i dare say his errand is from the deserted society to the runaway captain carlisle if you please miss de gray we will retire then i will just finish my poem and follow you sir we parted it is evident she loves medway to distraction lascelles  she knows his step  he was then in search of her doubtless by her appointment  i wish them happy  very very happy but my head aches my heart is not quite well and i must wish you a good night  c carlisle  letter xxxviii mr medway to mr townsend confusion townsend i have discovered the plot  i have got a clue to the whole matter i am i perceive a very catspaw i am made the convenient cloak to conceal the passion of another yes townsend i saw carlisle at the very farthest end of de greys garden in earnest conversation with lucia at my approach he turned into a different walk and went into the house i overtook the guilty fair one and caught her in the very act of reading eloisa to abelard which is as much as to say if i cannot talk with him i can at least write a letter to him and i dare say they do correspond every body in this family scribbles and i dont at all doubt but there is fine flourishing penwork going forward between lucia and carlisle as to the first i only walked quickly by her without deigning to speak and i pulled off my hat with unusual respect as much as to say  oh oh my young lady have i caught you i shall repeat the same behavior when i meet her again and then it is impossible she should mistake my meaning with respect to the captain whom i honor as a friend and gentleman in every other matter his life is not worth sixpence for he must as surely die this night as that he insulted me this day or else he must injure me still more by taking me off i only write this to you townsend just to account for any delay in my correspondence should it be my fate instead of his in that case i desire you will be at the breaking open my will because you are mentioned therein by  your old friend oliver medway  letter xxxix from the same to captain carlisle not a word more than is necessary shall be used i suppose you know the little green lane at the south side of de greys paddock  the farthest end of it is out of the report of a pistols getting to the ear of the family  six yards the distance  twelve the hour  lucia the word  you understand me  mum  good evening hush  o medway  letter xl captain carlisle in answer i shall certainly give you the meeting medway in the hope of convincing you that the chance of duelling might be poor satisfaction to a man who has as you have all the reason in the world to think himself most tenderly beloved by such a woman as miss de gray however if you choose to hazard the continuance of this blessing which at present you so fully enjoy why take your own way and do not blame  your obedient servant c carlisle  letter xli mr medway to captain carlisle my dear captain i would not now die for the world nor would i have you die it is plain then to you that i am tenderly beloved and since you are as well as i convinced i fully enjoy this blessing what in the devils name should i run my neck into danger for so she told you as much how shy all the sex to the men they love when they have a mind to it but it is nature pray my dear boy go to bed  sleep heartily  dont come near me  i will not be met  i shall go to bed myself  i am a jealous fool  whew whew  there there the fits over good night  o medway  letter xlii miss lascelles to miss de gray i sympathize most tenderly with my dearest miss de gray yet surely she makes to herself more misery than is necessary it is impossible for captain carlisle to be so intimately acquainted with lucias charms and virtues without admiring them and as to any italian attachments i think i can take upon me to say he is bound by none of those perhaps some uneasiness may look like disrespect in him at present depend upon it all will in a little time be happy in which assurance it is that i venture to say you are much happier than some women it is with pleasure i subscribe the name of  your affectionate caroline lascelles  letter xliii sir andrew flight to mr heathcoate triumph more triumph heathcoate i have got a treasure in a close lane as i pursued my walk i found the paper which i enclose it is evidently the property of the pretty wouldbe bred mrs hewson and is so much in the true taste of that burlesque we love although so seriously intended that i esteem it the most invaluable essay upon the elements of high life in the world read and reinclose it for it will serve a purpose now forming in the bosom of  your ever happy andrew flight the enclosed my notebook of manners to be read by me every evening going to bed henrietta hewson  memorandums and notes etc mem  miss de gray always sips her wine softly note  it is unlike a lady to drink heartily as if one were adry mem  miss d g inclines the head a little tiny bit on one side when she returns thanks it is charming mem  lady blessingbourne half closes her eyelids and does not choose to see too plainly strong eyes vulgar note  very like a gentlewoman to be shortsighted mem  miss d g never lets her hands drop down note  it makes them red so to do hands should not sink below the bottom of the waist mem  miss d g speaks low and sweet note  very rude for any thing under a countess to talk at the top of the voice a duchess may use a great bad word mem  lady b takes snuff  miss d g does not countesses may snuff note  horrid for any body under a title or under forty years of age to indulge in snuff but they may hold it up to the nose in order to show a pretty hand and affect to take it mem  miss d g steps modestly and with an easy motion lady b wriggles and totters  lovely weaknesses note  inconceivably polite to totter and wriggle i can hardly hold my pen lord how i will totter how i will wriggle mem  knife and fork sweetly held by miss d g note  i attend too much to the victuals and not enough to the manner of cutting and putting it into my mouth mem  lady b passed yesterday by a tradesman of here is and did not see him note  highly polite to overlook an inferior mem  a young person saluted her ladyship this morning with a curtesy down to the ground the person had formerly been waiting woman to her ladyship her ladyship had not the faintest recollection of ever having seen her before the words bless me who should that thing be very proper on such occasions note  exceedingly genteel not to recollect obscure creatures mem  i actually heard the countess hawk spit into her handkerchief and then look at it  mis d g never gives more than a gentle hem and then half turns away her head so that when you again see her face you see it tinged with a blush note  very fashionable for persons of quality to do that which would ill become misses i believe i must never venture to spit but i do more than hem now mem  lady bs countenance always encourages certain innuendoes  wellbred indecencies note  charmingly polite to be above shyness  a great defect in miss d g who is always serious holds down her head and will not hear on these occasions mem  the countess frequently cants one leg over the other and sits in that posture miss d g scarce shows her ancle although it is finely turned she has not yet got the better of prejudices note  fashion gives a freedom to the limbs mem  miss d g sits upright and attends too much to her shape the countess lolls carelessly and leans upon her arm note  nothing shows breeding more than a loll etc   letter xliv mr henry hewson to mr heathcoate esquire esquire heathcoate give every man his title and dignification as lord blessingbourne says therefore i begin my horrespondunce with you at the instigation of sir andrew with calling you esquire which is certainly your due seeing you are out of trade and do nothing at all for your livelihood i am to write what i get in the way of breedin it seems to you which is a thing pleasing seeing that you must without doubt be a master of the business  but i believe i shall have a wearisome spell owork on it before i am as i should be case why there goes more to the making an honest man a gentleman than i had at first any ideerer of i have been ithway on it only three or four days and i can see already tant to be run up as a man would run up a rick of hay ods woundlikins esquire heathcoate there is no end on it but howsomever to show you that i am not quite a numscull i will just mention a few matters that i have got in memory which is as thof one were to call it a storehouse to lay by things for future use in the first place you must understand that i see plain enough that the first rule of your bettermost person is to make a bit of a pleasant grin come intos phisihog whenever he first meets any one as much as to signify that he knows how to carry his head in the next place i find it is proper to make up this bit of a grin at first sight whether you like the man or not case why a gentleman should not show that he is cussd angry cept upon cassion of interest seeing that pliteness knows how to smile in the face while it puts finger in pocket  dly i have noticed that the less a man puts bat ons head the better case why it is the sooner doffd without pinching out the corners besides which its plite to carry powder and pummadum enough to keep the cranium comfortable without it i find a strange difculty esquire in getting my foot into the right slide of pliteness for i perceives head and foot dive together  out goes foot down goes head this is a cussd crankum piece of business saving your presence i cannot see the fun of bowing and scraping too nay ifack what do i talk of that some here at prudunce pleace must needs kiss their hands and then swing em out at the same time the young captain does this aye esquire young carlisles hands head and heels all work at once as smooth and cutely as a bird in the air i would give almost more than i am worth if i could but wriggle out the hinder part of me just like lord blessingbourne when he first comes into room i warrant me he does nothing but treat and vance shuffle and cut and go backwards and forwards sticking out his rump and craning his fine thin long meagre ninehaired head which i find is the plitest head a man can have yet he knows who is to have a wriggle of the bum and who not too i warrant you he is a cute one he dont gig and drop his fine plite head to every body alike no believe me he has the measure of what is every mans due from the duke to the stableboy down goes his genteel head quite ons breast to captain carlisle but when i puts in for a bit of civility i cannot get his neck to move downward half so civilly  case why i am but a poor fellow just come among plite specie but i dont allow myself any vantages for though i have put on the best suit to my back tant at all the thing sir andrew says my wig is enough to ruin me for ever if there were nothing else in the way it is as good a bob as ever was bought and sits as snugly to feace but alas what is a bob where you shall not see any thing under a bag and that flourididdled with ribbons and tossicums young carlisle indeed lets his hair fly to and fro just as he and the wind can settle it case why he has so much on it and it is so well colored and twirls itself off into such ringlets that he is plite any way i have bespoke a bag though i know aforehand twill make a devil of me and so i told gab who is to have the fellow on it comfort though that i cannot look worse than gab when i am bagd bag me when they will for at any rate i have gotten flesh on my feace and a little jot of color imy cheeks to set it off as well as a stout pair of shoulders whereas gab has werretted all the flesh offs bones by larning without a word of a joke esquire i dont believe gab has a pound of substance ons whole carkiss and as tos jaws has no more meat upon them than upon the bill of chicken his back is quite a skelitum and though his hair is no bad ravencolour yet it grows so cussd odd ons head and is so lankum rateatenum as a body might say if they were mind to talk larned that i would not gee frap of a finger fors whole growth but now i am upon good breeding esquire i desire to know whether a trick i saw lord blessingbourne who is ever acold do today before men women and children is the common practice of your bettermost specie that is standing with bumfiddle to fire with coat up and now and then popping hand below waistband mayhap my lord may not be quite so well as he would be thereabouts just at present and it may be a comfort toun to feel now and then how matters go for which reason i will not venture upon this action till i know whether it is a general thing or not not that i dislike it but that just yet it seems awkward to such an ignorant feller as i  nothing ithway of breeding more at present  but i have filled my paper which i take to be always the plite thing so i rest at the bottom of the sheet  your henry hewson  letter xlv mr de gray to mr carlisle prudence place my best and dearest carlisle must pardon the formality of receiving an old friends letter dated written and directed from the same house that contains both the writer and reader of it the reason is prudence place is at this time so crowded with different sorts of people and one has so little opportunity to steal leisure for conversation of the higher kind that i do not imagine a subject which is at this crisis so very warm at my heart can be so well or so explicitly handled as upon paper so much for the apology i come now to the matter  the days the months the years of tuition are now past  those seasons my clement in which i had the honor and the happiness for it was both to point out to you the paths of propriety and of virtue are over for the pupil is even already at the most early age of twentyone become the preceptor he is the tutor of truth he has already got orphans and widows under his guardianship  the noblest of all guardianship my clement  the guardianship of sensibility i thank you sir for doing me so much honor when you left this country for italy i did not imagine there was room for improvements you were amiable polite and prudent as free from pedantry on the one hand as from dissipation and the distracted joys of an overgrown boy on the other yet on my first beholding you the other day i was struck with an additional finishing an elegant compleatness which though not before seeming to be wanted was as it now appears absolutely necessary forgive the garrulous vanity of an old man sir forgive me if i lodge with all the narrative tediousness of age a little longer on this part of the subject there are circumstances which allow us to swell out the heart without making it ridiculous you sir occasion in me a pride of this nature some mens ambition in the last state of life is gratified by walking or rather hobbling into their fields and gardens to recognize those flourishing shades which are the produce of their own cultivation i have heard a veteran neighbor of mine a thousand times exclaim  see mr de gray how industrious i have been that long and lusty range of oaks extending from this pasture even to the farthermost avenue in the next did i plant with my own hand  i remember the day when the whole row containing perhaps two hundred sticks of timber were so many petty acorns not so big as a walnut and see only see how they have sped i could raise a little navy  verily neighbor i could fit out a fleet with a wood of my own raising  such ideas i own are not displeasing clement but they are far from being expanded enough for my emulation my emulation chooses a nobler object and takes a wider course my object sir is not circumscribed by any thing within the scope of inanimate nature and though i could be able to look out upon whole forests of my own cultivation it would not satisfy me no mr carlisle i have a far finer pleasure i have it to say that the politest gentleman and the best man of his age was once the child of my instruction he was left by that heaven which took to itself his natural parents at an age when gentle treatment makes a parent of any one i received this dear and delicate trust from the trembling arm of a dying man and i value it as a legacy given me in the moment that the soul of a friend was departing yes at such a tender period was you bequeathed to me mr carlisle my child lucia was exactly of the same age and you grew together the beauty of your forms like the power of your minds was similar i can only say farther that nature points out to me none of her nice distinctions or partialities in the hour of your childhood i caressed you both with the same sensibility and now that you are mature i divide my heart evenly between you but this touch of transport has seduced me into a digression old folks are i perceive on their favorite subject as tiresome in their writing as in their talking and therefore they have as few correspondents as hearers it is time however to return to my subject  on looking back at my accountbook my dear mr carlisle i find that your birthday has gone by almost a month you seem to have forgot that it entitles you to the command and sole disposition of an immense fortune money was i am proud to say never a disputable point with us except when coercive measures were obliged to be taken in order to force upon you a remittance this however by no means exculpates me for detaining what ought to be in more amiable as well as more able hands i reproach myself when i consider how many cruelties my delay may have been guilty of mr carlisle to those whose fortunes you have in trust methinks i hear the curse of the widow the languishing sigh of sickness and the murmur of merit in the darksome vale i see too the tears stream from the eyes of the fatherless  oh for heavens sake my friend relieve me  rescue me instantly from continuing the injury to that part of your family which providence has put under your care  i shall most readily be prepared to render up an ample account of my agency whenever and the sooner the better you will honor me with your appointment  thus much for fortune i had it in my mind clement to venture a few sentiments upon happiness which are by no means things incompatible although they are not often inseparable but any thing i could advance on this head is unnecessary to such a mind as yours with respect to your heart i own i meditated a few words upon that subject also but i am in great doubt whether this is the proper point of time to speak to it yet my propensity is so warm and the prattling or rather at present scribbling old man is so strong or to speak more truly so feeble in me that i can scarce resist  the interest of your heart must naturally my dear clement be of more concern to me than any other that belongs to you you are exactly at the age when tenderness falls with the fullest force upon our nature as you have a form to command love so have you feeling to return it that sensibility which makes you a parent to the poor and those accomplishments which endear you to society in general will assist and even lead to connexions of a softer kind i am afraid it would border a little upon that impertinence which i would avoid else i should ask you in the cordiality of my good wishes whether it is possible for so amiable a man to have passed through italy and to have resided in the capital of england the very court of female beauty with an inclination unattached and passions unalarmed this is too great a paradox for me to credit even in imagination and yet i am mightily interested in the question and its answer perhaps you will humor an old friends caprices and for once trust him who can be no rival with a lovesecret suppose you were to steal an hour from the strange mixture of our present family and scribble a line or two on this matter i dispatch this by your trusty greyheaded geoffrey who you know may be the confident of every message that can come from such a master  i am my dear mr carlisle your most perfect friend and most obedient servant robert de gray p s  the hewsons are just what you call them honest imprudent people who have had the great misfortune to come in for ten thousand pounds a piece at a very unlucky crisis i had the management of their affairs when their whole expectations were bounded by a small annuity and they still call me guardian i wish i had influence enough over se random wards to persuade each o them to remain quiet and be happy in despite of this unseasonable winl they are here upon a polite scheme i heartily wish they would go home upon a prudent one this may be the case by and by    letter xlvi the marchioness of n to captain carlisle cruel carlisle you confess then that you have written to the detested marquis you even avow the sentiments of your letter to him you own that they are to hasten him to england but do you think sir i am to be thus treated like a child and threatened with being chid by that bugbear my husband or do you imagine i will ever allow myself to be reunited to him preposterous expectation no mr carlisle though i am a slave to my own passions i will never more be a slave to those of another you argue in vain about rights and laws and duties  in vain you urge the maxims of the world and the custom of nations i have lived so long under the italian heavens that i have forgot  utterly forgot  the colder atmophere of cloudy england i have learned to follow my feelings and to abhor chains that were forced upon me by paternal authority you direct me to the sacred circle of gold upon my fingers you call it the caestus of fidelity i grew enraged to consider a man scarce more than twenty thus coldly argue upon a tender offer of no contemptible passion my pride took the alarm and i tore your epistle and threw the ring from my finger at the same time i stamped upon it with indignation miss lascelles appeared and as if you had preinstructed her she acted upon the occasion as the very priestess of piety fie my dear marchioness said she folding her palms together in the true conventicle manner these outrages are ever dreadful but when they arise from so bad a cause what strength of terms can sufficiently reprobate them consider the reserve and decorum of your sex  consider the consequences  consider your character  ah frigid insolent is this the mode of british hospitality do you lesson those whom you protect and do you nevertheless boast of your island as an asylum for the wretched and for the stranger where are your sanctuaries for an unhappy woman  where is your courtesy for tenderness and the wounded heart in despair but you northern islanders grow upon too frozen a soil to feel the power of sentiment which glows nearer to the sun  the subject must be hateful to you and i will quit it but still mr carlisle something is due to my pride whatever is denied to my passion i will not stay here to  the triumph of those who have chaty because they have not hearts miss lascelles has of late assumed a language of lofty advice to which i am not accustomed she pities me  she is sorry  she wishes me well  she will do every thing warranted by discretion  she wishes captain carlisle and i had met sooner the affair is delicate  she hopes that prudence will prevail  ah carlisle that my extravagance of affection should have reduced me to this oh that i could change  oh that i could reverse the passion  i would sacrifice fifty years of my life to hate you  ah what have i said to what violation of the truth has my passion led me no my carlisle no i would not wish to hate you  wretched as i am i would not even wish to love you less though the agony is extreme there are moments of transport known only to bosoms like mine that repay me for it hate you  o heavens what a word what an idea to mix with that which dresses up the irresistible carlisle pardon the blottings which are staining this part of my paper they are made by tears that show at least some tincture of virtue in other circumstances you say it would have been your pride to have courted the softness which is now so pressingly offered how then is it possible my eyes should be dry when i perceive those circumstances so unlikely ever to happen yet i cannot lose the idea  i cannot disengage myself from the delusion though i know it to be no more persist then in your virtue sir but deny me not the little gale of pleasure that blows from fancy continue to let me hope  continue to correspond  only condescend to allow me the flattery of thinking i am not hated by the loveliest of men and i will sustain any thing for his sake i will remain quiet where i am and sit composed under the frown of virtue without temptation i will bear the thought of even seeing again the marquis i will do any thing you would have me if you will still continue to say you do not utterly execrate me for a guilt occasioned by tenderness  the most unfortunate marchioness of n  letter xlvii captain carlisle to mr lascelles my dilemma is even greater than before the enclosed from mr de gray is even more perplexing than that which you transmitted from the marchioness both perplex my imagination in what manner to answer them mr de greys reason for inquiring into the state of my affections is evidently for fear my return to prudence place now that his daughter is in the full bloom of her sense and beauty there should inspire me with a passion that he knows would terminate in despair apprised too as he is of her engagement to mr medway it is very natural for him to imagine i should fall into this charming temptation so that this is a little generous stratagem under the guise of ordinary curiosity to prevent the mortification and the misery in time mr medway is so singular a man that if he did not constantly assure me almost every time he sees me that his passion runs before the wind i should scarce credit that a person whom i hardly ever saw speak to miss de gray should have made such a progress in her affections it is plain however now from her own conduct that she is fervently attached for her address air manner and whole deportment to me are utterly changed i am no longer delighted by that lovely affability which though playful was ever corrected by modesty she no longer consults my taste which she was wont to flatter about her dress her ornaments and ten thousand innocent trifles that nevertheless trifles as they are make up the chief endearment of domestic society she speaks in form her eye is averted her sentiments sound studied we are no longer like clement and lucia who employed their infant cares in rearing the same bower mr de greys letter therefore joined to mr medways assurances and miss de greys behavior point out to me pretty plainly what kind of an answer it is proper for me to make to the former i am somewhat consoled to reflect that even in my most familiar moments i never entered flatly into overtures with lucia so that i cannot create any uneasiness in her bosom upon my account for had that been the case her sensibility is so uncommon lascelles she would have felt for my disappointment amidst all the gaity of her own successes since her heart is happily engaged if she thinks it so it certainly is so it now becomes a duty more than ever in me to conceal the feelings of mine whatever be the violence of my passion it has no right to be troublesome to any other bosom and i was never able to account for that cowardly conduct which induces us to embitter the joy of a rival and a mistress because they were more fortunate or happy than ourselves beside that such complaints never awaken more than compassion which is not desirable they aggravate disappointment till it rushes upon disgrace but methinks i hear you retort upon me why trouble me with your misery then clement ah lascelles we are not such abstracted beings as to lock up our sentiments either of joy or sorrow in absolute solitude the very thoughts would stagnate by such means on some generous breast every man must by the very gravitation of his nature lean for support in  misery every man culls from  species his congenial counterp and it is as necessary to have a  our confidence as a mistress  tenderness away with those  minds which feel an avarice  their noblest feelings plurali of friendships may perhaps like pluaity of lovers be admissible but surely it is very possiole to be fond of one mistress and faithful to one friend at the same time oh mr lascelles what hourly occasion is there for one or other of these blessings as joys and sorrows alternately prevail how soothing is the congratulating hand and cheerful voice to the one and the gentle tear or sympathizing sigh to the other ah enchanting communication without which even transport must lie languishing at the heart and in misfortune the wretch who is separated from his species and sits loose to the kindness of an individual shall like a wounded deer lament his disaster without pity and die forlorn  with respect to the marchioness i am every way so circumstanced that i am puzzled even to reply to her it would be too much like affectation and a kind of male prudery in me to say that if matters were in another channel i should not be flattered by this overbearing tide of tenderness in so beautiful an object heaven knows i am not insensible to the charms of beauty something that at this moment presses hard upon my heart convinces me i am not but situated as i am how is it possible to receive such a letter as her last without distress believe me lascelles i feel no elation at the compliment of so distinguished a preference although i acknowledge the marchioness to be as you say with your favorite yorick amongst the first order of fine forms i acknowledge too her command over the passions her fire her eloquence the delicacy of her shape the dignity of her deportment yet i feel nothing but anxiety at her present conduct the reason you will say is my secret attachment to another be it so yet were even that barrier removed i should i am positive still be unhappy and not flattered by the attentions of the charming marchioness you are an animated man and no doubt call me a coldblooded creature by no means my passions are as lively as they generally are in any bosom at my age but perhaps my taste of voluptuousness differs a little from the general juvenile idea i have a great pleasure in pleasing my own mind nay i have a great interest in so doing whenever i have done wrong i have always found that the pain resulting from it is too heavy to be counterbalanced by the pleasure which produced it i have my wayward propensities as well as another a whim has often seized me by the heart and i have at all events indulged it for the time it was ecstasy and for ought i can tell the ecstasy was heightened by a sense of the venture at which the deed was done presently and indeed close upon the heel of it comes the per contra of the action if you will suffer me to borrow a term from trade my frolic being over memory is commanded by a power we cannot resist to retrace it and if in going through the mazes of the past i met any thing wrong or uneven against the cause of that integrity which i profess to love the thorns are from that moment in my bosom and for so much mirth i am rewarded sevenfold in misery i am so constructed that i can no more stand against the rebuff of a blush on my own cheek than against the thunder of a cannon the sigh which my weakness may at any time have extorted from another bosom agonizes my own and a tear which i once very undesignedly drew from an innocent creature haunts me from place to place and the precious drop for it was wrung from the eyes of lucia is still trembling in my imagination  i have enlarged upon this subject because my behavior might want to your fancy an apology that people do not all act on the same principle is because they do not all analyze the real cause of that anguish which so often treads upon pleasure there is methinks one simple law that comprizes all the wisdom of the prophets and all the sagacity of philosophers i feel it better than i can describe it but to give you some idea of it i shall just lay it down as a note that whenever a man is upon the edge of an enjoyment let it relate to whatever part of indulgence it may he has only to consider whether it will not sooner or latter be returned by more than an equal misery if however even the prospect of greater pain does not deter let him hazard the joy then while the actual agony is full upon him let him again compare the actual pleasure after this his heart must be very perverse and his head very much intoxicated if for the future his pleasures are not such as will not burt him after they are over innocent pleasures are indeed never over they spring directly from the soul and like that they are immortal like mercy too they are twice blessed they delight us while they are acting and conscience makes them sacred in reflection  it is upon this principle i am proceeding with regard to augusta she is the wife of a man to whom i had the honor to tender what he reckoned an obligation this makes his property more especially sacred to me she is also the wife of a man whom notwithstanding the roughness of his manners i believe to be valuable she is in trust  in short she is every thing that she should not be to make a mistress of and as i told you before my taste of voluptuousness must have the present circumstances wholly inverted  that is to say  she must be unmarried and averse to marriage unconnected and unclaimed in the way of connection and i unattached too  before i could congratulate myself upon the conquest of this flower of italy  yet till the marquis comes for heavens sake use every method to soothe and quiet her do not advise your sister to oppose her in the heat of her sentiments she is too furious for admonition her imagination is too much in its hey dey her passions will die of themselves and she will consolidate perhaps after all into a regular character her situation with you is so very delicate that i know your sister is in a dilemma but still augusta has many virtues i have seen a thousand instances of her benevolence the italian peasants bless her door and kiss the very threshold of it because imprinted by her footsteps she is at this time under the influence of fancy it is a sort of feverish fit that attacks smartly at first and will away again the handsome creature is but just touching nineteen she is a child my dear lascelles and this truant disposition is a trick of the leading string without parents and of a vigorous imagination she is yet as to human life in the nursery no more my friend  think not of her as of one abandoned that is not the case as to her glowing language let not that displease your sister though unaccustomed to her ear the italian women know nothing of that reserve and pathetic bashfulness which guards the expressions of the british fair they speak freely and flowingly  the marchioness adds to the custom even the ardours of constitution but indeed she is not a base character  once it is said the marquis in his violence struck her her pride was hurt she thought it beneath the dignity of the man who had figured at the front of an army  she never forgave it  twas wrong but who has not a fault to be forgiven farewell i have written myself into some composure and that will plead my excuse for having so long intruded  i am yours c carlisle  letter xlviii miss de gray to miss lascelles surely every day is commissioned to present some new mystery and no hour decreed to unfold or explain it my father whispered as i sat at dinner yesterday that he had a little private conversation for me and would contrive an opportunity very soon to chat with me you know his method of treating his children caroline toward the close of the evening when lord and lady blessingbourne were airing mrs hewson at her lookingglass where she is practicing breeding mr medway at the river with his fishingrod and mr carlisle at his writingdesk we found the leisure we wanted and walked into the garden together we will settle a little while in this very bower my dear says my father it is as pretty and cooling as any in the garden  oh caroline it was the bower of clement and lucia  yes sir replied i it is very pretty and cooling indeed  i suppose lucia your fellow laborer who helped to make it has not paid it a visit since his return such humble shades must yield to the spices of italy he has to be sure forgot an arbor of mere english hawthorns and woodbines  i  i  believe he has sir  apropos lucia do you hold in the same mind still do you still think him the incomparable carlisle prudence place can boast just at present several brilliant men we have the laughterloving sir andrew of a very agreeable person we have the manly mr medway odd but amiable putting these both against mr carlisle is he still the superlative degree there are two to one lucia what say you  i believe they have all their merit sir  but is their merit perfectly equal in your opinion my dear  as to that sir i  should suppose  no doubt  that is  in short sir as i have not known them all the same time  as one can judge more of intimates than casual acquaintances   you prefer clement i suppose  i have known him the longest sir  medway my dear has great connexions  sir  sir andrew has good humor and will be heir to lord blessingbourne  sir   but carlisle is the more accomplished gentleman  most certainly he is sir beyond comparison  do you think beyond comparison lucia  sir   i say my dear lucia do you really think  that  that  bless me sir how faint the air gets when the breeze falls at this season of the year   yonder comes geoffry  from mr carlisle perhaps upon private business  i will if you please withdraw sir  if the heat is troublesome pray do my dear  very troublesome indeed sir  lord bless me there is not a breath of wind as sure as can be there is a tempest in the skies  thus ended our dialogue  what does it mean caroline i never was more confused in my life what could old geoffry be coming for the old fellow who only wishes himself young again to dispatch with more haste the commands of his master quite ran on the occasion  on my return into the house i met mr medway with an handkerchief full of fish and in the highest degree pleased with his success by way of courtesy en passant i told him he must certainly carry a charm about him to attract so many fish out of the water in so little a time upon which he caught hold of my wrist and after looking round the room to see if any body was present  hush  hush  for gods sake child  walls have eyes  and worms have ears as i always told you  from this and some other strange things i have seen in this man i am convinced his head is not exactly as it should be  not a view of carlisle all this morning since breakfast no solicitation to sing to touch the guittar to walk in the garden to count the fruit to read pope to  to  to   it is very barbarous he should all at once take such a dislike to me  i wish italy had been far enough before he had seen it pray my dear are the ladies so very beautiful in that country toward rome for instance i have been looking into my fathers library for a sort of history and manners of that country not indeed that i am concerned in the matter but yet if any thing of this kind happens to fall in your way you may purchase and send it me by the first conveyance  lucia de gray p s  lord b sets out this evening from our place to his seat in shropshire sir andrew continues with us on purpose to teaze the silly hewsons medway is to be mad with us all the season    letter xlix lord blessingbourne to mr de gray blessingbourne abbey sir we got without mischance to the abbey i beg to know whether you have considered the subject we discoursed upon sir andrew is no mean match mr de gray he will one day be earl of blessingbourne for which change of his name i have a peremptory command in my will if you send me word you are satisfied as to the matter i will transmit directions for him to think more particularly of the young lady whose good qualities my lady and i have determined within ourselves to be equivalent to want of title and that is certainly saying a great deal sir andrew is worthy though he is too great a laugher and he will make a good husband your offer of forty thousand pounds with miss de gray is liberal half that with a coronet would be sufficient however if there are honors on one side it reflects dignity on both if she marries sir andrew she stands a chance of being a countess to which brilliant probability i will add the fellow sum to yours down two thousand pounds worth of diamonds a thousand pounds for a wedding dinner and the handsomest set of creamcolours with silver trappings and the blessingbourne crest engraven thereon i have the honor to enclose for you the salutations of the countess and to be  sir your most obedient very humble servant blessingbourne  letter l captain carlisle to r de gray esquire my fatherly guardian to show my esteem for your mode of conveying your last sentiments i adopt it to imitate is to admire many parts of your favor went quite home to the seat of the tenderest sensations particularly where you discover to me in a style peculiar to your pen that regard which has ever been the most distinguished honor and blessing of my life  all your questions have a claim upon my answer and upon my sincerity you address me on a delicate subject i see plainly how much my happiness in every state of my life is at your heart of the conjugal connection i think with veneration and sensibility but i am exceedingly young and shall in all probability gain a little more domestic knowledge and of that prudence which belongs to family before i change my condition whenever there is the smallest prospect of this happening it cannot be long a secret out of mr de greys bosom  i am ever his own clement carlisle p s  i had almost forgotten to mention the moneyaffair it is not possible for the poor to want a friend or an instructor while mr de gray is at prudence place and if the charge of my fortune is not absolutely troublesome to him there is no bank wherein it can lie with so much satisfaction to me    letter li mr lascelles to captain carlisle how pitiable it is my dear carlisle that you should be so circumstanced as to find it utterly impossible to return the extatic fondness of this bewitching woman she is absolutely an angel some new dresses have lately been put on and she sets them off with such an elegance such a taste such a naivete it is impossible to look at her without an ejaculation of pleasure and admiration allowing all your arguments their full force i must still confess there is a something cold and icy about your heart that cannot be melted by such a blaze of beauty  especially as the lady is so perfectly willing and not at all unreasonably nice she loves your person well enough to take it on your own terms she does not pretend to capitulate the citadel is your own and you may do what you will with it oh  said she the other day while the tears were streaming from her lovely eyes  oh that i could see him but one moment in every day i would be content with annihilation for the rest of the twentyfour hours by heavens carlisle if any woman half so beautiful had avowed such a sentiment in my favor i would have shown my gratitude for it at the price of my existence  but you on the contrary though as virtuous as a saint are as frigid as a freezelander i question whether you ever approached the lips of this lovely one since they first declared a passion for you it requires i confess all the elaborate excuses you have made to wipe off the imputation of an insensible and even after all your pains i freely tell you that i think you are too scrupulous upon this occasion i speak frankly out of pity to the marchioness and for your pleasure admitting your passion for miss de gray to be ever so great what i wonder has that to do with a snug convenient beauty by way of my friend in a corner at another quarter of the world your notions are absolutely antediluvian i do not know another man in the world who would not leap at your situation in the name of pleasure then make the best of it i thought at first as you do but i speak now upon mature deliberation there is no doubt but the marchioness would change her name live quietly in the place you provide for her be happy as if in heaven to get a sight of you once a fortnight and there would be an end of the thing do then let me advise you put a period to these complaints open the cage of the beautiful prisoner and set the pretty little heart that is now beating as it were at the wires till it pants again perfectly at ease it is with great difficulty i keep her from writing to you every day the idea of the marquis sets her already raving but i cannot by any means draw from her nor can my sister any account of her family supposed to be in town she says they would force her again to the arms of the detested marquis but i have proposed a proper salvo for all those sores and if you have the least lively spark of the young man or of merry human nature in you you will not neglect it compliments to our friend sir andrew  adieu g lascelles  letter lii captain carlisle to g lascelles esquire your letter has not been an hour in my hand and although my heart was full of other matter i have now neither ear nor pen for any thing but an answer to it do you know in the first place that i looked at your seal and at your superscription and at the very cut of your letters before i would credit the thing to be yours in this age of forgery i was in good hope somebody had made free with my friend but as it appears that the letter did absolutely proceed from you i must proceed to an explicit reply  make a prostitute of the poor girl mr lascelles seek out a convenient apartment and compel the charming eyes which you say now weep with love grow wild with the sparklings of rage and despair what sir would you wish me to seclude her from all valuable society and to sink her from a marchioness of the first figure and fashion to a mere mistress  from a young elegant woman to a scorned abandoned daughter of the brothel is this the method in which you would have me return my compliment for a long a weary an hapless and an unfortunate journey of a thousand miles however misplaced the affection she is pleased to bestow upon me and however impossible it is for me to reward it i am still bound to her even for her very misfortune it is my fate and not me that declines what in some cases might have been my greatest blessing surely mr lascelles i owe her gratitude of a very different complexion from that blushless one you recommend my heart bleeds for her from me she should claim an attentive anxiety how to recompense the throbbings in her bosom the most industrious care to reconcile her again to her husband to contrive means of healing up any breach which my unfortunate acquaintance with that gentleman may have occasioned these are the services she should expect from me and to offer these is at once my study and my effort but i will not believe you serious or if you are your compassion has hurried you into a precipitancy that only wants showing you to be repented of  this my dear lascelles is assuredly the case besides which depend upon it you have mistaken the marchioness she could not stoop to the ignominious terms you have proposed to me for her if she really loves there must be some degree of refinement in the partiality and believe me lascelles many a woman has felt a secret predilection in favor of a man who would start with horror from an act of predetermined perfidy if it were not for the appearance of an implied compliment to myself i should not at all scruple to say i believe any partiality augusta may have unluckily conceived in my favor proceeds wholly from some imaginary virtues which she is pleased to think i possess i dare swear she is taken by certain qualities in your friend which as she has enriched and magnified them appear to her deserving esteem upon this principle you have indeed proposed an effectual plan for making her detest me to discolor the image she has flatteringly dressed up by placing in its stead a seducer and ingrate might perhaps prove a successful remedy but this my dear lascelles would be purchasing aversion more fatally than any thing that can reasonably arise out of the partiality itself no no my friend  enough however has been urged you are convinced and therefore you are dear as you ever were to  clement carlisle p s  sir andrew returns your devoir he is as merry as ridicule can make him his present objects now his uncle is gone are two foolish bumpkin brothers and a handsome simpleton of a wife to one of them    end of the first volume
