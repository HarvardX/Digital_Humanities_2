can go on go on  let me know all   easy you are in a passion child so i dont regard what you say but i think i should have been out of my wits to have refused mr steady the rich quaker   lubin what is it he then   easy it is   lubin what he that you are steward to he that does so much good all about and he that gives a portion every may day to a damsel as a reward for her sweethearts ingenuity   easy the same you have seen the nature of it  that villager who can boast of having done the most ingenuous thing claims a right to demand a farm containing sixty acres rent free for seven years and a hundred pounds to stock it together with whatever maiden he chooses provided he gains her consent and it is a good custom for the young men who formerly used to vie with one another in the feats of strength now as i may say vie with one another in feats of understanding   lubin and so he is to marry your daughter   easy things are as i tell you and for that purpose he has taken gillian into his own house had her taught music and to say the truth she is a different thing to what she was when you saw her last   lubin she is indeed for when i saw her last she told me that all the riches in the world should never make her forget me   easy but since she has changed her mind and it so falls out that tomorrow is may day you would do well to study some ingenuous thing and get this portion for a more deserving damsel   lubin no farmer easy her using me ill is no reason why i should do any thing to make me angry with myself i swore to love her for ever and i will keep my word though i see she has broke hers   easy do what you please i must be gone   lubin nay but tell me one thing  did gillian herself consent to this   easy you will know all in good time exit   scene iv lubin air women are

they are not badly compared to the sea which is calm and tempestuous within the same hour some say they are sirens but take it from me they are a sweet race of angels over man that have power his person his heart nay his reason to seize and lead the poor creature wherever they please  exit   scene v a room in the quakers house with glass doors in the back enter floretta and gillian floretta pooh pooh you must forget lubin   gillian how can you talk so floretta i will not though and none of them shall make me they all frightened me by saying it was a bad thing not to obey my parents and so i consented to marry this quakerman but there is a wide difference between marrying him and forgetting lubin   floretta and so you would be silly enough to prefer being the homely wife of a clown to rolling about in your own coach having your own servants to wait on you and in short leading the life of a fine lady   gillian oh lord i am sick at the thoughts of being a fine lady but what is the reason floretta that my friends want to make me so unhappy i am sure i would do any thing rather than vex them   floretta why you know that mr steadys will is a law to us all and as he had desired your friends to consent to this marriage how could they refuse   gillian well but you know he is a very goodnatured man and i dare say if i was to tell him how disagreeable he is and that i cannot bear the sight of him he would let me marry lubin   floretta suppose you try   gillian so i will   floretta but how are you sure this lubin you are so fond of is as fond of you   gillian i have tried

likest thou not me   gillian i should like you very well if you were my father but i dont like you at all for a husband   steady and wherefore i pray thee   gillian oh there are reasons enough
