recommended to me by our old friend scrutiny canvass of lincolns end who tells me the curmudgeon rolls in wealth and though covetous as a miser in any laudable pursuit is lavish as a prodigal in the

believe me mr alderman   lomb indeed doctor i cannot but no compliments  i dont come to bath this time to be made such a fool of as i was the last   min aside it will be well for you if you are not made a worse considering how much better hands you have fallen into   lomb would you think it squire furnival when i was here two years ago this worthy physician and his associates had the conscience to take above a hundred guineas of me only for coaxing the cramp out of my great toe   min a violent paroxysm of the gout   lomb you gave it that formidable name indeed to enhance the merit of your prescriptions but what did you administer but a dozen or two of innocent slip slops and as many gallons of insipid warm water   furn nothing more   min oh sir mr lombards was a bad case a very bad case indeed we had frequent consultations of the faculty upon it   lomb yes yes my case was a bad one sure enough for while you and your accomplices had your hand in my purse and merited the discipline of the horsepond you hurried me without mercy to be duckd and pumped like a pickpocket   min you are pleased to be sarcastical mr lombard but when the sit returns i shall find you of a different opinion so till then your most obsequious humble servant  exit lomb oh good day to you sir   furn i am sorry mr alderman you were so severe on my friend mineral the doctor has more interest in the borough of gluttonbury than you imagine   lomb has he   furn he cures the mayor and aldermen of at least a dozen surfeits in a year they cannot possibly live without him   lomb odso i am sorry for that and yet i am partly glad of it too as you say he is your friend you may easily excuse my raillery  tell him it is my way  that is an excuse for any thing you know or egad for the matter of that if i thought twoud secure him in our interest i would be taken with a slight touch of the gout tomorrow morning   furn not just now mr alderman if you please electioneering is bustling work and if we should be hard run you may have a use for your feet you know   lomb ha ha ha  well  i have been to gluttonbury   furn i hope to good purpose mr alderman   lomb egad i am afraid to very little you shall judge as i was quite a stranger in the place i naturally inquired you know for the mayor of the corporation who received me kindly enough for a stranger and civilly offered to call a meeting of the principal townspeople the next day accordingly i got a speech ready for them at my inn over night and met his worship with mr recorder and the rest in the town hall in the morning   furn good   lomb ay so far so good but you shall hear  i assured them as usual on these occasions of my firm attachment to my king and country in general and of my regard for gluttonbury in particular  then i talked to them a good deal about the constitution and the revolution and the protestant succession and all that  giving them now and then a little liberty and property trade and prosperity and so forth and egad upon the whole i thought i acquitted myself with energy   furn and what effect had it   lomb no effect at all sir   furn no   lomb no   furn you surprise me   lomb no effect at all in the world sir i assure you you may well be surprised indeed   furn and yet its not so very surprising neither oratory like every thing else has its day we have seen some of our greatest speakers talk themselves out of breath till they talked themselves out of credit for after all words are but wind you know mr alderman  had you no bankpape rabout you a written plea has sometimes a better effect than one delivered viva voce not all the rhetorical flourishes of cicero and demosthenes put together have half the pathos of the plain handwriting of three or four petty clerks in threadneedlestreet  banknotes banknotes mr lombard are now adays the only prevailing arguments   lomb egad mr furnival i begin to think we citizens dont rightly understand these matters  you gentlemen of the law know how to go about them much better for my part i own it is a little out of my way all i can say therefore is that if you will undertake the canvass you shall want no materials that i can furnish  but  pray what is my rival candidate he is a man of war i find  does he carry any weight of metal  has he the summum bonum about him ha   furn it seems he has a good estate sir besides his commission  he bears a very great character in the neighborhood they tell me he is a patriot a man of public spirit one whose motto is dulce e decorum    lomb  pro patria morum ha mr furnival ay i remember the passage  i have construed it formerly at merchanttaylors  though by the way i remember i thought it mighty silly even in those days die for ones country ha ha ha  that might be patriotism among the ancient romans but we modern patriots live upon our country mr furnival ha ha ha   furn ha ha ha very well very well indeed mr lombard  but as to men of your antagonists profession they are bound in honor you know to die at the word of command without grumbling   lomb right counselor right  but what  he has a regiment  he is a colonel i think   furn a bloodyminded colonel i assure you mr lombard one who makes it his boast that he is ready to spill the last drop in his veins in defense of his constituents he will bleed for em mr lombard   lomb bleed for them ha ha ha yes yes he must bleed for them and that pretty freely too let me tell him if he intends to stand the poll with me  but stay here is company coming suppose we adjourn to my lodgings and there settle our plan of business   furn or to mine sir which are nearer   lomb with all my heart  exeunt scene ii mrs mildmays lodgings enter narcissa and sophia narc so cousin sophy your papa i find is arrived at bath we shall now see what account you will give of yourself for having contracted a violent inclination for a man without his knowledge and that too for a man whom he never saw   soph i contract a violent inclination for a man narcissa what i suppose because colonel camply has repeated his visits pretty frequently of late   narc nay nay it is too late to retract now it is to no purpose to play the prude with me or the coquet with him any longer have not you said an hundred times that you preferred colonel camply to all the men in the world   soph i must have talked in my sleep then narcissa for i am certain my tongue never so betrayed my heart while i was waking   narc oho you confess then it would have betrayed your heart if it had talked so ah cousin sophy   soph pshaw that is provoking now   narc ha ha ha a little slip of that same tongue my dear  but make yourself easy for waking or sleeping i believe it is very innocent of betraying your regard for colonel camply my information is founded on better authority i assure you those speaking eyes of yours sophy are apter telltales  what you reckon nothing it seems on the significant nods expressive smiles and languishing looks the colonel and you have been reciprocally exchanging these three months past    soph go go you are a giddy girl narcissa   narc and you a sober stayed prudent unmarried gentlewoman just turned of twenty prithee cast off this formality of countenance and leave it to the wear of mincing abigails and maiden aunts with their other weatherbeaten remnants of antiquity i tell you it does not at all become a girl hardly out of her teens and little older than myself believe me those who affect to be grave when they are young will be glad to be merry when they are old excuse me my dear but i am a little in spirits this morning   soph indeed you have always an astonishing flow of them   narc have not i  well but come how is it to be the colonel will break the matter i suppose to your father the bargain will be struck the match hustled up clothes bought jewels presented and the day fixed immediately i shall be all impatience till it be settled and we stand up to dance at your wedding i have not had a country dance no not this half century as lady pedigree says   soph and yet this business which you seem to have dispatched so expeditiously may be longer in settling than you imagine if indeed it be ever settled at all   narc hey day what is the matter now your lover and you are i am sure so far agreed that you need only tell each other your minds if you have not done it already he has a fine fortune of his own and is satisfied with yours though not a penny be added to your grandfathers legacy and then your papa who loves you so tenderly as to see you once a year and write to you by some of his clerks once a quarter will hardly plead paternal fondness to keep you longer on his hands   soph i dont know how it will be there is like to be a strange revolution in my fathers affairs i learn he is going to be married himself   narc himself well but i hope he will be so good as to see you married first   soph at the same time i suppose my dear to save charges for i hear he has partly made up a match for me with some noble lord   sighs narc and do you sigh for that sophy now for my part were i in your case i should think it mighty clever that is on a supposition the lord were deserving of the lady for as you have no violent inclination you know for colonel camply it is an easy matter to break through a slight one for a private gentleman in favor of a peer  o gad that i had but an independent fortune of thirty thousand pounds as you have and that two or three of these lords would pay their court to me   soph why what would you do would you have one of them   narc yes if i liked them well enough otherwise i should be apt to show myself a daughter of eve and repeat the first sin of disobedience if any father of mine should take upon him to know what i liked better than i did myself but why do i talk  poor i that am dependent and can expect barely half that sum    soph have yet a viscount for one admirer and a commoner for another worth ever a lord of them all   narc i dont say that  i have not the vanity to compare mr melmoth my sir frederic that may be to the flower of the british nobility though i own i would not exchange him for the best of the bunch of baronets  but yonder comes the colonel in his usual sorrowful saunter with his hands in his bosom and such a penitential countenance what in the name of wonder can be the matter with him now had you a quarrel with him last night did he win of you at cards tear the mount of your fan tread upon the train of your new sack or make a loud whisper of a secret that has been publicly talked of among your acquaintance for these four months   soph prithee what can that be narcissa   narc oh the old story mans constancy and womans caprice the subject of half the love songs and halfpenny ballads that has been chanted since cupid was an arch wag and his mother an errant jilt upon my word sophy you sometimes treat that poor gentleman very ill and if you dont behave more consistently i will as surely tell him as it is true that your cruelty is all affected that you are as much in love with him as he is with you and in short that you dote on him to absurdity  therefore look to it sophy look to it  exit soph go thy ways my cheerful chatty agreeable cousin   enter colonel camply soph good morrow colonel   camp my dearest sophia good morrow   soph you look grave mr camply  aside but i guess the reason and will for once divert myself with it   camp it is impossible i should not be concerned at every accident that throws an obstacle in the way between me and my sophia   soph oh sir obstacles are to be surmounted  the more difficulty the more honor   camp yes madam and the more danger too   soph o fie colonel a soldier and apprehensive of danger   camp of whatever i may be apprehensive madam i fear none but that of losing you   soph and is there any danger of that methinks i should be glad of an accident of that kind that i might see how gallantly you would behave on the occasion for to say the truth i have been so sparing of giving you trouble colonel that if i should yield so i am afraid you would hardly set any store by what cost you so very very little pains in the acquisition   came how can you take a delight sophia in giving pain to a heart so entirely devoted to your pleasure   soph poor heart well come tell us its grievance what is the matter with it what are these dreadful obstacles you talk of are they of my raising   came no my dearest sophia i have so much confidence in your generosity that i believe i should not  uneasy at any difficulties of your    soph  is olerably presuming however  and confident enough in all conscience yet whatever you may think sir those obstacles would be the hardest for you to remove i assure you and you may depend on it twill be your own fault if any difficulties thrown in the way by others prove either formidable or dangerous   camp kind generous sophia a thousand times let me thank thee for that assurance seizes her hand and eagerly kisses it oh how this declaration revives me   soph well then colonel as you are now come to yourself again tell me plainly what is the matter you have been already with my father i suppose   camp no madam but i purpose to do myself that honor tomorrow though it is probable from what i have heard today it will be to no manner of purpose   soph what you have heard i suppose that he intends to marry me to a title   camp i have sophia and this piece of intelligence is attended with that of another unlucky circumstance mr lombard is come down to canvass in the borough for which i have declared myself a candidate   soph call you that an unlucky circumstance if you have a mind to take any advantage of it it may on the contrary prove a lucky one for if i know any thing of my father he will certainly give up to you all his authority over his daughter sophy if you will give up to him all your interest in the borough of gluttonbury  and indeed now i think on it you are rather too young colonel for a senator  besides i should not choose to have a husband taken up with the business of the nation when he should be employed in mine   camp sophia   soph it seems as if you intended to be no longer my humble servant when you are so ready to enter into the service of your constituents   camp by heavens madam if you require it    soph you would give up your country for your mistress i suppose  i thank you sir  no no colonel i did but jest with you i am not so unreasonable as that comes to neither here is my hand i have made my election do you go and do your best to make sure of yours  or stay i was just going to take my chocolate will you drink a dish before you go   camp with pleasure madam  my dearest sophia   exeunt enter mrs mildmay and narcissa narc bless me mama what harm can there be in the indulgence of a little harmless mirth is it possible my cheerfulness can give any body offense   mrs mild i am fearful my dear lest it should offend nobody so much as yourself when i was of your age i was just such another wild unthinking thing as you are careless of censure and presumptuous that while i preserved my innocence i might laugh at decorum as mere formality but the world is come to such a pass narcissa that virtue itself is often of less consequence to the peace and happiness of our lives than the appearance of it it is not enough to be innocent unless we seem so   narc and in what do i appear so heinously guilty madam in laughing at the rueful dejection of the poor colonel or in giving encouragement to the addresses of mr melmoth to whom you have never before made any objection   mrs mild it is true my dear i have hitherto made none because i would not assume too great an influence over you in making a choice of so much importance to the future happiness of your life but i should but ill discharge the duty of a mother narcissa if i did not confess and that without any particular objection to mr melmoth that i think you would be much happier with my lord courtly who has made the fairest offers and of whose regard for you i am now more than ever convinced   narc i am obliged to lord courtly madam for his good opinion of me and under other circumstances he might possibly have had less reason to complain of my indifference   mrs mild well my dear i only speak my sentiments i have no objection to your engaging the affections or encouraging the addresses of any deserving lover but i must insist on your indulging yourself less in raillery at the expense of your friends   narc but i should think madam ones friends would be the least apt to take offense and that the behavior you complain of might be a good method to put their friendship to the proof   mrs mild then you think wrong narcissa i know by woeful experience the danger of trifling with a heart that loves one it was this fatal indiscretion in me that gave rise to a groundless jealousy in the breast of the fondest of husbands and deprived you of the tender affections of a father   narc i am happy madam in having that loss so well supplied by yours that i never felt it but my dear mama why do you so often touch of late on this subject you know it always makes you melancholy  if my father were living indeed  but that is surely impossible   mrs mild and yet i know not of a certainty that he is dead though i own it is most probable as i learned he embarked for india near twelve years ago and as i before have told you i have not once heard of him since   narc what pity madam you did not retain his name for now if even living and anxious for reconciliation his patience might be exhausted in fruitless inquiries after you   mrs mild under the forgotten name of wildman true narcissa but your rigid uncle to whose kindness we are nevertheless indebted for our whole fortune so highly resented your fathers injurious usage of me that he insisted on my renouncing the name and if possible even the memory of a man who had so cruelly wronged me   narc and yet i have heard you say my father was not altogether to blame   mrs mild no my dear narcissa it is the recollection of the share i had in contributing to that fatal separation that distresses me it is that which makes me look upon your union with frederic melmoth under the most fearful apprehensions lest a similar disposition to mine should make you fall into the same errors  good heaven what would have become of us if my relations satisfied of the innocence of my conduct had not forgiven its absurdity and continued their protection to me after the departure of mr wildman  unhappy wildman fond frantic man  and yet favored as i have been ever by them how have i since lived in the eye of the world  in a state of solitary neglected doubtful widowhood  i had once a son too and you a brother but whether he be living or lost to us for ever with his father heaven only knows   narc nay my dear mama you now carry your surmises too far you certainly do us wrong to indulge your melancholy as i my cheerfulness   mrs mild i cannot help it narcissa in you my hopes are now all centered let me not be deprived of the only comfort left me in the prospect of your happiness   narc be assured mama that if it depend on me you shall not i will check the vivacity of my temper and be more on the reserve   mrs mild do my dear and in return be assured that i shall be no farther an advocate for lord courtly than his merit will justify but you must excuse my still indulging a wish that you had less partiality for young melmoth   narc indeed madam he is possessed of so much goodness of heart that i should hope it out of his power to make a bad husband   mrs mild i hope so too but the goodness of a mans heart narcissa is not always a sufficient guard against the impetuosity of his passions witness your unhappy father   narc pray mama no more i beg of you  let us join the colonel and my cousin sophy    mrs mild i have done my dear  lead the way  exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i young melmoths lodgings enter lombard followed by a servant in livery lombard  as he enters not know whether your master be at home   serve mr syllogism his gentleman is

fellow   syllog sir my godfathers gave me a name and you see i wear my own livery   lamb but you have a master notwithstanding such a one as he is   syllog true sir such as he is talis qualis herus non magister nec preceptor he learned more of me than of his tutor and is too grateful to treat me as a menial   lomb zounds sir was not you at my lodgings an hour ago with a draught from frederic melmoth  dont you serve him   syllog faithfully and all his secrets keep   lomb is it a secret then if he be within   syllog none sir unless he were within and then there might be a doubt whether he was within or no but when he is actually gone out sir there is no mystery in the case it is clear as daylight that he is not at home    lomb what pedantic puppy are you some catchpenny casuist that our young spendthrist picked up among the starving bookworms at college i suppose   syllog i was indeed a servitor at brazennose when mr melmoth was matriculated   lomb and was expelled for a pimp when he was rusticated for a rake ha   syllog i cannot deny sir that i took more to him than either of us did to our books and being thought too disorderly to enter into orders i determined to abandon short commons and the classicks to follow the fortunes of my young master that sir is my history   lomb and so you may now deservedly starve together tell your master that from me   syllog i hope sir you are not going  it is so very civil a message that i should take it as a particular favor if you might be prevailed on to stay a minute or two and tell him yourself  i expect him in every moment to dress so that if your worship pleases to step into the next room and just sit down a little    lomb i think i will as i have something to say to him  aside  that may prevent his troubling me with any more of his draughts  exit syllog now if any thing should have touched the heart of this old turk and sent him hither with the money for the bill he refused to accept just now  but  oh here comes my master   enter young melmoth y melm well syllogism have you presented the draught with my compliments to alderman lombard as i ordered you   syllog yes sir and he accepted the compliments civilly enough but the draught itself he has churlishly protested   y melm protested how   syllog why sir he protested he would not pay it and though there was no notary by i am afraid he will be as good as his word   y melm impertinent this covetous old fellow cannot bear the thoughts of my spending my fathers money though he gets so much per cent for its remittance did you tell him i was under an immediate necessity for it   syllog i did sir and for that reason he said if he had no other he would not accept it   y melm what can the penurious old scoundrel mean   syllog so i thought to myself sir exactly what cap this penurious old scoundrel mean thought i  but to save us both the trouble of guessing sir suppose we ask him he is but in the next room waiting your honors return    y melm why did you not tell me that before go and let him know i am here exit syllogism what can have brought the churl hither good manners or ill nature it must be the latter for of the former he has not a single grain    reenter lombard and syllogism lomb well young gentleman    y melm i think not quite so well old gentleman you refused it seems to pay the bill i drew upon you this morning   lomb i did so and shall refuse to pay any other you may draw in the afternoon   y melm come come mr alderman you may think you are acting the part of my fathers friend in these indirect endeavors to restrain what you are pleased to call my extravagance but if i know any thing of his disposition from the tenor of his correspondence with me he will not think himself obliged to you for reducing me to the necessity of applying elsewhere for the supplies requisite to support the character of a gentleman   lomb your fathers friend no sir i act as my own friend as you ought to do and as every wise man will do  the character of a gentleman i should be glad to know how many cent perannum your modesty thinks necessary to the support of this fine character it is not a month since you drew for the last five hundred and now you are pressed for another by the exigence of the present demand indeed this should seem destined to stop some gaming gap to pay some debt of honor that right or wrong must be instantly discharged to support the character of a gentleman   y melm it is in part sir therefore without any more words let me have the money or a bill upon your house in london may do as well   lomb may it sir but for the future you will please to discharge your debts of honor with your own bills of credit  to be plain with you young man i am very sorry your father did not take my advice in having you bred up to some creditable employment  had you condescended to have been one of my clerks you might by constantly fingering of money for seven years together have learned the value of it  or had you been bound apprentice to    y melm sir    lomb i say sir had you been brought up to any profession but that idle and unprofitable one of a gentleman as you call it you might have had a proper resource when any sinister accident had befallen you   y melm what accident then has befallen me   lamb oh none but what is very natural  sir john melmoth your father is dead   y melm my father dead  i am sorry for it   lomb you have reason for he has with great justice cut you off with a shilling   y melm you astonish me  but it cannot be  i will not believe it   syllog aside nor i  for it does not seem to be orthodox   lomb you may sir i have seen the copy of his will which has been duly authenticated and by which he has bequeathed his whole fortune to the lady his second wife to whom he was married some time before his decease   y melm married again bequeathed his whole fortune to his wife and forgot his son   lomb forgot him no no did not i tell you he had remembered him in a very moderate bequest which is expressly justified by the mention of his profligate character   y melm profligate so then i am reduced to beggary by your malicious misrepresentations of my conduct what a wicked vile incendiary   lomb nay nay young man dont be abusive and call names dont put yourself in a passion  to convince you i am more your friend than you are disposed to think me i will recommend you to the favor of lady melmoth your motherinlaw who is returned to england and has put the management of her affairs into my hands nay with her ladyships good leave i may probably soon stand in a nearer relation to you myself than you are aware of in which case i shall take proper care of you on your good behavior  in the mean time as you are short of cash there  there is a note for

relation of your fathers just now arrived from india i learn that sir john is dead but nothing more   y melm sir i have learned much more it seems the late sir john melmoth no long before his death

carried so far between you that this accident will prove any obstacle to your marriage   y melm it is there there my dear colonel i feel this reverse of fortune the most severely for though narcissa should be too generous to reject me merely from mercenary motives ought i to have less generosity than she ought i to take the advantage of her partiality for me to make a prey of her fortune and permit her to throw herself away on a young fellow without a penny in his pocket or a profession by which he might have the prospect of getting one no colonel till i am master of a competency at least equal to hers i will relinquish my pretensions  but when that may be or what may happen in the interval o colonel    camp prithee frederic    t melm what a cruel disappointment is this when narcissa

she never was to hear of it at all i should think it might be better still narcissa is undoubtedly a worthy young lady but i would not have you place too great a confidence on the generosity of the sex if you have lost your fortune abroad sir it is probable you will not find your mistress at home   y melm then shall i know the utmost rigor of my fate and that at once   syllog but to what purpose

has merit enough to engage you so warmly in his favor a young fellow capable of making such valuable friendships can never be so bad as he has been represented i own we had but very sorry accounts of my wild kinsman transmitted us to india   camp my friend frederic sir is young and volatile but having sense and principle is in the way of reformation for he has not only good qualites enough to make himself friends among the men but to engage the esteem of a young lady of the first distinction for personal merit   g melm i am pleased to hear it an amiable and virtuous monitor of the other sex is certainly the best reformer of ours   camp and i am no less pleased for the sake of both to find his father has not left him destitute as he has been informed   g melm and yet if lady melmoth his new motherinlaw had not set out for england before sir johns decease that would probably have been the case her ladyship having taken advantage of the boys irregularities to get her husband to make his will entirely in her favor being no stranger however to her art and avarice i prevailed on him to make a subsequent testament just before his death by which the lady is more moderately provided for and the bulk of his fortune more equitably left to his son i am myself executor to this last will and shall take a proper opportunity to undeceive the young man as well as his fathers agent on whom i find the widow has greatly imposed by means of the former will   camp this will be most agreeable news to my young friend  i am impatient to communicate it   g melm with your leave colonel i had rather that were deferred i could not hope indeed to find a youth of his education and fortune as grave and prudential as a rigid moralist yet having received such an indifferent impression of his character i could wish to put his disposition a little to the proof his present mistake affords a favorable opportunity i would therefore have him kept a while in the dark as to his real circumstances   camp will not that be cruel general  consider the young gentlemans anxiety   g melm i do but he will be so much the happier for it when he comes to be undeceived  besides i have my reasons and you may depend on it if he has real merit the required delay will turn out to his advantage it may be the means also of trying the disposition of his mistress whom i should wish to have a disinterested regard for him  if she loves him in spite of his supposed poverty her constancy may be rewarded with a better fortune   camp nay sir i shall be ruled by you since you seem so much concerned for his welfare   g melm i am indeed greatly concerned for it colonel for though i am but a distant relation to him he is perhaps the nearest now living to me  besides i am bound to it in gratitude to his father to whose friendship i was much indebted for my own success in life nay i am not only obliged to sir john melmoth for my fortune but even for his name which i long ago assumed on my departure from europe   camp assumed his name was yours not always melmoth   g melm no camply many years before you knew me it was wildman which on the supposition of having killed my antagonist in a duel i changed and wished might be forgotten   camp you raise my curiosity general   g melm another time i may be more explicit for oh my campley i have a painful secret laboring here that needs a friendly ear and heart like thine to ease me of its burden  good heaven or have or have i not a wife or daughter  aside camp i am sorry to see you thus affected general but i hope at nothing very essential to

daughter sophy for as i am also going to marry again a daughter by a first wife will be a kind of encumbrance on the family you know i had partly agreed indeed with lord sweepstakes to take her off my hands for sixty thousand pounds  the girl has thirty of her own left her by her grandfather    furn lord sweepstakes   lomb ay  in going to market for titles i thought one lord as good as another   furn of the same rank i grant you but a viscount is as much preferable to a baron as seven pearls on a coronet are to four which is almost two to one so that the odds in a match with lord courtly will be greatly in your favor   lomb then i will be off with the baron   furn by all means  i will take the first opportunity of making the proposal to my lord courtly and depend on it you shall be returned member for gluttonbury  but here his lordship comes i will introduce you to him   enter lord courtly introduced by a servant furn my lord courtly you lordships most obedient servant   court

morning with a few oats and a whisp of hay and set going along a turnpikeroad with a boy on their backs all day till like a dutch clock they run themselves down at night why  why  some of our heathen philosophers say we are not much better ourselves my lord ha ha ha   court it is mr aldermans way i presume to be jocular   lomb nay my lord i hope no offense i use no ceremony to be sure and indeed as mr deputy purseproud says a man that has the revenue of a subah in his pocket need not stand upon ceremony with any body but the great mogul   court true mr alderman therefore stand upon no ceremony with me   lomb i will not my lord i will not for though your lordship may be a great man at court i am a great man in the city and the courtiers and citizens have always been upon a footing to carry on a smuggling trade together it has been the custom time out of mind to make an exchange between your manners and our money my lord and egad you generally have had the better of the bargain too let me tell you that   court your friend is quite a wit barrister i did not think the spirit of raillery had been so prevalent within temple bar   furn oh my lord there have been strange revolutions of late in the city the citizens have their wits and men of letters among them now a days as well as the courtiers   lomb men of letters ay and letters of credit too my lord which is more than can be said by most of the literati at your end of the town yes my lord and we have made great improvements in the arts too   court nay i thought the city was always famous for the arts   lomb what the arts of pinmaking and the manufacturing of thimbles ha ha ha no my lad no these have been long ago trundled down in the broadwheeled wagons to birmingham to make room for architecture painting paving and sculpture   court sculpture mr alderman sure the grim savages at st dunstans still stand sentinel to strike the hours on the clock  then the giants in guildhall look as tremendous as ever gog and magog are but bad proofs of your improved taste in sculpture mr alderman those monuments of gothic barbarism should be demolished before you set up for virtu   lomb egad that is true i thank your lordship for the hint they must come down but you know my lord rome was not built in a day  but when i come to be lord mayor or get into parliament   court how sir not in parliament   furn it is indeed a loss to our country my lord a man of mr lombards abilities could not fail of making a shining figure   lomb you are very obliging mr furnival but though i am not at present in the house i hope with yours and his lordships assistance i shall not be long out of it   court with my assistance mr alderman   furn yes my lord mr lombard has offered himself a candidate for the borough of gluttonbury in which i know your lordship has great interest   court then you are better acquainted with my interest than i am barrister  i hope mr lombard does not mean to solicit my influence   furn  to lombard aside you see his lordship is on the reverse mr lombard it would be better perhaps you were out of the way while i break the ice for you   lomb egad like enough i will leave you  aside to furnival  why my lord to be sure i have but small pretensions but as a man who would exert his utmost abilities in the service of his country if your lordship should think favorably of me i shall be ready to fulfill any engagements mr furnival may enter into in my behalf  and so my lord your lordships most obedient  going returns and depend on it my lord that as soon as ever i come to the chair or get into the house i will attack the giants  exit court ha ha ha what a mixture of wit and absurdity prithee barrister what do you mean by bringing me acquainted with this heterogeneous animal you know i have no interest in his dirty borough of gluttonbury   furn that is true my lord but he does not know it and as i am likely to reap some emolument from him myself my regard for your lordship suggested a thought may possibly be agreeable to you   court take care furnival of making my honor a cloak for your knavery you have done it too often even to the wearing it so threadbare that if i were not kept in countenance by the example of other persons of rank i should be really ashamed of myself   furn nay but the present expedient is an honorable one my lord   court for the first then of your suggesting pray let us know what it is   furn you will excuse me my lord if i am mistaken as i dont mean to be impertinent but i own i conceived that either your lordships constitution or estate might by this time have suggested the expediency of your entering again into the state of matrimony i took the liberty therefore to give a hint of your having such an intention to mr lombard who has a marriageable daughter with whom he seems disposed to give at least sixty thousand pounds   court i understand you and so you would have me impose on him as having influence enough to get him returned member in order to prevail on him to accept me for a soninlaw a very honorable expedient truly   furn why not my lord as i dare say we shall be sure of carrying our election  but i beg pardon if your lordship does not choose    court i own barrister there are prudential reasons for my repairing my fortune with that of a wife but so long as narcissa keeps such hold of my heart i cannot resolve on making my addresses to any other women   furn i thought my lord that her avowed preference of a rival had determined you to think no more of her   court i thought so too but i find my passion to be insuperable at the same time her mother gives me encouragement so that till her hand be actually given to another i cannot think of putting it out of my power to receive it   furn i am sorry my lord my intention to oblige you is frustrated   court and yet furnival i stand in present need of your assistance i want money ready money to supply the common exigences of public places my cursed ill luck has made a beggar of me   furn alderman lombard will furnish you with any sum you require   court i am afraid not he knows better than to lend his money to a losing gamester without more substantial security than i can easily give him   furn never sear my lord i will so manage him that he shall be your spaniel to fetch and carry and lay down his bankbills at your feet dont your lordship see that mr lombard is a wit   court and do you urge that as a proof of his folly   furn i do my lord  when animals are once out of their element their very strength degenerates into weakness a mans forte becomes his foible now probity and plain common sense i take to be the proper element of worthy citizens and worshipful commoncouncilmen if any one of them soars therefore after artificial qualifications beyond those he becomes like a bladderblown fish that floats on the surface of the water till he is snapped up by a sea gull   court well he is in good hands but be sparing of him as

lord maam men are often so much alike in appearance that we might be sadly deceived indeed if we trusted to our eyes  besides maam if he looks the same as he did twelve years ago he must either be a ghost or a sad cheat for there must be a prodigious difference in him in reality   mrs mild did you take notice of the gentleman who got into his coach at colonel camplys door as we came by   sift in

doctor mineral tells me his name is really melmoth   sift i told you maam you know how easily you might be deceived  and so maam it was not the person you imagined and you were frighted for nothing   mrs mild the doctor tells me the gentleman we saw is young melmoths father   sift as i guessed maam i have a remarkable good guess   mrs mild but could not you sift enquire a little into particulars mr melmoth you know passes for an only son but if his father should marry again or be married already  or    mrs mild true maam but entrust me with the commission and i will inform you of every thing you want to know i warrant you   mrs mild well then attend me presently at my toilet and i will give you more particular instructions   sift and if i dont fulfill them if the gentleman has either man woman or child about him with a tongue in their heads say my name is not    mrs mild but you will mind sift to be no less cautious than curious in your enquiries and communicate nothing of what you hear to any one but me  at the same time you may caution susan and the rest of the servants to say nothing to the young ladies when they return of my sudden indisposition it is not expedient they should know any thing of the matter  aside till i know my own fate narcissa shall be kept ignorant of hers   sift you may depend upon sift maam but i see a chair coming into the hall i fancy one of them is come home  exit mrs mild poor narcissa if i were less anxious for myself i should be strangely concerned for her it may not be improper however to take some step to abate the ardour of her passion for mr melmoth as a lover   enter narcissa narc i see you are returned before me madam   mrs mild yes my dear i seldom make my morning visits so long as yours i suppose you have been whiling away your time some where with mr melmoth   narc nay i have not once set eyes on him today though to say the truth mamma i believe i waited for him half an hour or so at lady pedigrees for as i expected he would call there i did not find myself hastily disposed to come away   mrs mild and you promised to meet him there   narc he promised to meet me there   mrs mild fie narcissa  is this keeping your promise with me is this being more on the reserve   narc i did not think madam you required me to alter my behavior to mr melmoth   mrs mild indeed indeed narcissa i do require it and if you have that sense of duty a fond mother could wish you to entertain you will not think i lay you under any severe restraint   nar does this new injunction proceed madam from the generally supposed want of discretion in me or from any particular reason you may have to change your good opinion of mr melmoth   mrs mild perhaps both you must have heard that frederic has been very wild he left the university at best but abruptly then he plays deep and it is very natural to suppose he may have intrigues enough to make it imprudent for a young woman to place too great a confidence in his professions of love   narc bless us madam you shock me intrigues   mrs mild nay my dear dont be too much alarmed mr melmoth may be as deserving as most young gentlemen of the age but for all that i would not have you set your heart upon him i have my reasons and those prevailing ones therefore reflect narcissa and be well advised exit   narc reflect and be well advised what need of so much reflection and advice my mamma has surely met with something to ruffle her temper this morning i protest she is quite peevish  not set my heart on mr melmoth  that advice comes now too late yet still she seems to allow him as much merit as any young gentleman of the age  how unreasonable is this if i am to be married at all can i expect a better husband than the market affords and if i am satisfied with my bargain what is that to my mamma i wonder  oh here he comes i will rattle him off for not being where he promised and thence exposing me to this lecture   enter young melmoth so sir frederic and lover of mine you are punctual to your appointments i see  y melm aside sir frederic and with such formality too she has heard of my loss then already   turning to narcissa yet i could not have thought my narcissa would have triumphed over my misfortune i could not have thought she would so soon begin to upbraid and receive me coldly oh woman woman   narc hoity toity what is the matter now the mans seriously sorrowful as i live   y melm cruel narcissa what can i think of this   narc think of it upon my word i am full as much at loss what to think of it as you are sure the people are all at crosspurposes or are eat up with the vapors this morning my mama was here just now and peevishly chid me forsooth for being too kind to you and now you come in woeful sadness to complain of my cruelty what in the name of consistency am i to do with you both   y melm i dont wonder narcissa that your mama has changed her thoughts of me a reverse of fortune is with fathers and mothers a sufficient motive for a reverse of sentiments but can they whose vows have been reciprocally exchanged whose hearts have been once united can they my narcissa be ever divided from motives of sordid interest what though my father be dead and through dotard fondness has reduced his son to beggary i have still friends real friends able and willing to serve me   narc your father dead reduced to beggary i now understand you sir aside disingenuous mama these then were your reasons for depreciating the character of my lover to frederic indeed sir i beg your pardon i had heard nothing of your fathers death nor of any change in your circumstances but i own the conversation i had just now with my mama a good deal surprised me   y melm then she must have heard it   narc no doubt of it and that accouuts for her behavior  aside she may find however that people may sometimes be as much too reserved as too open  to frederic but can it really be sir as you say   y melm too certainly though i received the news myself from my fathers agent but this morning and came directly to impart it to you   narc was that prudent to yourself at least was it impossible to conceal it from me till after our marriage   y melm it was narcissa though no human being had known it but myself thoughtless and indiscreet as i am my heart is too faithful to you and too just to the world to suffer me to act the part of an impostor a single moment nay i come now with a design to relinquish my pretensions till the happier circumstances of some future day might entitle me to aspire to the height from which i am fallen   narc to give up your pretensions mr melmoth and was that so easy a task as to be readily resolved on   y melm however rashly resolved you have seen it was not so easy to be executed for what have i done but solicit for that which i came to resign   narc and you would now marry me notwithstanding i may have fifteen thousand pounds to my fortune and you as you say not a farthing   y melm narcissa    narc oh you hesitate do you  to he sure there is some little inequality of condition in the case but to let you see that i am more aspiring i am ready to venture with you on the same terms   y melm and is it possible you can be so good as to rate my merit above your fortune   narc nay dont give me time to weigh one against the other money is heavy and worth is light you know if you take me at my word i shall keep it but if i am left to cool and ponderate i will not answer for myself  grave faces and good advice may have a strange effect upon me at present i say i will venture with you   y melm generous narcissa but whether will you venture   narc any where  to scotland if you are so rash as to insist upon it   y melm spirited girl charming narcissa but when   narc now this very day as soon as you please my mama has dealt disingenuously by me i will therefore beg leave of duty to stand aside a little till i pay the debt i owe to love and honor if it be a fault i shall trust to her forgiveness this one time  it is a fault one cannot make a practice of you know  so come let us go in and concert proper measures for our expedition   y melm charming creature i will accompany you to the worlds end   narc o yes i intend you shall if we should live to the end of the world  exeunt scene iii young melmoths lodgings enter syllogism so so so i have been playing with a seeming dead coal that has been all the while burning my fingers a plague of these potential cauteries say i  sir john melmoth it seems is really dead my young master is a beggar and i may carry his wallet sic transit gloria mundi had i thought the old baronet really defunct i should not have been so pleasant with the young ones circumstances but he is a deserving youth and though i am horribly disappointed in my own expectations i declare i am iess sorry for myself than for him  what will become of him  for my own part i am qualified to struggle with the world  oh here comes sir frederic  in a mighty good humor too what the devil sure his fathers not come to life again  enter young melmoth y melm well syllogism who has called since i have been out    syllog nobody sir  i expected to have been able to present your honor with at least a hundred visiting cards full of compliments of condolance but i find the world is not so impertinent it civily chooses to leave people under misfortunes to comfort themselves   y melm it is the improved mode of good manners syllogism not to be troublesome you seem however to stand in need of consolation what is the meaning of this it is not above an hour or two ago since you braved the storns of fortune with the fortitude of a stoic and recommended patience to me with the eloquence of a seneca   syllog yes sir but like seneca too i find i could preach that to others which i cannot practice myself but surely sir i may conclude from the pleasantry of your present disposition that what you heard in the morning cannot be true   y melm true syllogism how should it be true when you know you observed it to be impossible   syllog nay but sir joking apart if your father be dead how do you intend to live now he has disinherited you   y melm i shall do the best to supply my wants by industry i shall find friends to put me in a way and am only sorry it will be out of my power to reward your sidelity as it deserves   syllog nay sir make yourself easy about me a philosopher is easily provided for jacta est alea sir when i have the misfortune to leave your service i devote myself immediately to that of the muses   y melm what turn poet then art thou condemned to be poor as long as thou live why the poverty of poets man is notorious it has been a hackneyed jest for ages   syllog yes sir it has been hackneyed so long that it is fairly worn out when poets had no patrons but the great the poor devils sure enough were obliged to live upon little but since the public have taken them under their protection a bard like another man may have two coats to his back and every thing handsome about him   y melm and yet syllogism till the lawyers can decide the dispute about literary property   syllog i grant you sir that a freehold on parnassus does not entitle the possessor to vote for member of parliament but let a man of genius once merit the favor of the town and he may levy contributions on it whenever his affairs require it   y melm levy contributions is not that too arbitrary i thought the convocation of critics had something to do in the system of literary legislation   syllog yes sir they are the lower house and have the privilege of deciding in all moneymatters they hold their sessions in the pit at the representation of every new play and proceed directly to the consideration of ways and means  to be sure sir we cannot raise a shilling without the consent of the house  but if they approve the bill they pass it with a plaudit and their generosity is boundless   y melm well syllogism if you are obliged to go upon the town i can only wish you success but perhaps you may be better provided for yet in the mean time you must not leave me abruptly  i shall want your service for some time at least i am going a journey of three hundred miles an end will you go with me if i should have occasion for you   syllog te duce teucro to the antipodes sir   y melm come this way then you must take a let er for me to narcissa   syllog of leave i suppose ah poor girl she will be disappointed too oh it is a bitter business  exeunt scene iv colonel camplys lodgings enter general melmoth and colonel camply g melm so then i find colonel you are engaged in a matrimonial expedition as well as my kinsman  well i wish you success and if you need my assistance command me   camp i thank you general and hope ere long to be able to return the compliment come come when you have recovered your spirits a little we shall have you looking out for a wife as well as we younger folks   g melm ah my dear colonel  sighs camp ah my dear colonel with a sigh too i have hit the mark then general what did you leave your heart in india or has a sudden conquest been made of it since your arrival in europe   g melm neither camply i was married many years ago and was too unhappy in that state ever to think of entering into it again even if i knew myself at liberty   camp i never heard you had been married general   g mel yes colonel when i went over to india i left a wife and infant daughter in england behind me   camp and are they living   g melm alas heaven knows i have heard nothing of them for years except from the very man of whom being absurdly jealous i thought i had killed  he came over with our troops some time ago to bengal and convinced me by a number of corroborating circumstances that i had injured both him and my wife but to my sorrow he could give me no farther information of her   camp how fruitless then was that   g melm fruitless as unhappy for though my heart was something lighter from knowing he had recovered of the wounds i had given him yet i should have much easier supported the reflection of having killed an adulterer than that of having injured abandoned and perhaps ultimately destroyed am innocent wife and daughter   camp but why destroyed from this relation it is not impossible they may still be living   g melm i dare not flatter myself with such a suggestion nay i hardly know whether i ought to wish it true for if she lives must she not long since have transferred that heart to anothet which i so unjustly suspected so cruelly slighted   camp but what success has attended your enquiries since   g melm none though i have made every enquiry the distance of time and place would admit   camp perhaps in your long absence thinking you were dead she may have married again and thus by her change of name have eluded your researches   g melm if it be so i will be no intruder on her happiness  i will therefore carry on my future search in person that if i should succeed in it i may be enabled to act as circumstances shall determine but what a task how dreadful is it to seek that which we hope and yet we fear to find though to be certain even of what we fear is better far than laboring still in doubt   enter servant ser mr melmoth sir desires to know if your honor is alone   camp your kinsman general  shall he come up   g melm by all means he may have some business with you i will retire into your study till you have done with him you know i have my reasons for declining to see him at present  exit camp how unlucky is this  i must not tell melmoth who is so near and yet if i dont it is ten to one he will say some extravagant thing or other which if overheard may give the general no good opinion of him i wish my old friend were at bengal again only for one half hour with all my heart   enter young melmoth y melm my dear colonel how is it   camp nay how is it with you you seem in raptures and it is not three hours ago since i left you in a state of despondency   y melm ay you grave rogue you  you stare to see a young fellow dejected at his ill luck in the morning intoxicated with his good fortune before noon but narcissas my own my boy   camp who doubted it   y melm no it would have been a sacrilege to doubt it  so that as to my father    camp nay but mr melmoth nothing against your father i beg of you  aside the general will certainly overhear him  to melmoth well but you did not tell narcissa of your being disinherited   y melm did not i  but i did i told her the whole story   camp the deuce you did   y melm without omitting a single circumstance   camp and  and  and  aside egad i believe i had better ask him no more questions  he seems in a humor to say any thing   y melm and  and  and  what a plague do you mean by your and  and  and  why do you look so confoundedly serious what the devil is the matter with you  ah colonel colonel if you did but know all   camp nay but i dont desire to know all  aside this sparks going to say some wild thing or other now   y nay but you shall know all for i came on purpose to tell you   camp well then some other time   y melm no no other time will do for i intend to be in scotland by to morrow night if possible   camp in scotland   y melm ay i am going off with narcissa to scotland and am come to borrow your chaise if you will lend it me   camp and what are you going to do there   y melm ha ha ha there is a question i thought every body knew what pennyless young fellows took girls of fortune to scotland for    camp well but    y melm nay nay will you lend me your chaise i will tell you more of the affair by and by  i shall want a couple of your servants too as for reasons of state i shall take none of my own with me   camp yes if i am to see you again  aside any thing to get rid of you now  to melmoth but i shall certainly see you again before you go    y melm certainly  certainly  exit colonel camply solus to scotland egad narcissa has an enterprizing spirit if the general has overheard nothing of our conversation i must communicate this piece of intelligence to him it may perhaps induce him to vary his plan of operation and save them the trouble of the journey   reenter general melmoth g mel so colonel your young friend has soon left you  i thought i heard high words within  i hope no new cause of discontent   camp oh no sir quite the reverse your lively kinsman is now as much elated with joy as he was in the morning depressed with sorrow   g mel how so he can have heard nothing sure of the real state of his circumstances   came nothing at all but it seems he has informed his mistress of his supposed loss of his fathers fortune and she like a generous girl has agreed to give him her own instead of it   g melm indeed   camp they are just going to set off for scotland he came to borrow my chaise   g melm and you shall lend it them or i will clap six horses to my own traveling coach and that shall convey them i like their spirit and would encourage their expedition were the young lady even my own daughter   camp nay but general why let them take so unnecessary a step  they will certainly be better pleased if you should discover mr melmoths real situation and prevent them   g melm i know not that no let them a while enjoy the satisfaction they feel in their mutual love and gratitude there is more pleasure in the display of true generosity than in the possession of mines of wealth let them proceed therefore on their journey  i warrant it will be a pleasant one  in the mean time however if it be necessary i will endeavor to reconcile the young ladys relations to the consequences of it  but come i called to take you home to dinner with me we will there toast the young couple and drink success to their spirited enterprise  exeunt end of the third act act iv scene i mrs mildmays lodgings enter syllogism and sift meeting sift so mr syllogism you are going to have old doings at your house i suppose   syllog no no mrs sift our old doings will not do any longer we must have new doings now if we intend to keep doing at all   sift what do you mean mr syllogism   syllog nay what do you mean mrs sift if you come to that   sift mean why rejoicings entertainments to be sure   syllog rejoicings entertainments  aside  o the jade has heard of our misfortune i find and has a mind to be merry with it  to

months   syllog oh yes and he set out from thence it seems near a twelve month ago but which road he took or whether he is arrived at his journeys end is at present a little problematical   sift problematical i am sure you scholars mr syllogism are very pragmatical will you persuade me i did not hear the bells ring for him this morning   syllog the bells ring for him o lud only think of tolling the bell at bath for a man who died at bengal   sift dead sir what would you insinuate   syllog what you know i find as well as i and therefore i may venture to tell you  my old master is dead and has left my young one nothing to live upon   sift nay nay mr syllogism i see you have a mind to banter me now but come to business you have brought something for narcissa i suppose   syllog yes i have got a letter for her   sift  takes the letter turns it about and holds it up to the light  why there is no reading this letter without opening it   syllog what do you think it is sealed up for but to hinder you   sift pooh i would not give a farthing to carry such letters sealed what did you never open a letter without breaking the seal did you never take off the impression on wax nor coax it with a hot tobacco pipe   syllog no mrs sift they are arts i have not been bred to   sift well i have done it an hundred times who was never bred to the arts at all though i remember i once lost the best place i ever had in my life for breaking open a letter and sealing it up again with my thimble   syllog and deservedly   sift yes i paid for my peeping that time it is true but i should have done it had i been to die for it i am astonished to think how any body can have so little curiosity as not to long to know every thing that other people want to keep from them   syllog i would as soon put my hand into my masters purse as pry into his secrets and think a servant deserves to be hanged as much for the one as the other   sift that is if it be done with intent to betray them mr syllogism but otherwise  and yet to be sure one does sometimes do a deal of mischief by getting into secrets by halves but that is the fault of ones masters and mistresses you know in not trusting us with the whole  you will not pretend to tell me however that you have no curiosity to know your masters business   syllog faith i have no curiosity to know more than he thinks proper to entrust me with i have plague and trouble enough with that if i knew less i should live a much easier life for what between his moneymatters and those of his mistress which you know sift are both ticklish affairs i have but a very troublesome time on it  while syllogism is speaking sift is looking at the letter and turning it about in her hand sift there must be something very curious syllogism in this letter it is doubled into so many pleats and folded up as carefully as the welchmans guinea  there is certainly something choice in it   syllog ay all love i suppose sift   sift love eh  that is choice stuff to be sure  well i see the direction   syllog and you will deliver it safely  you understand me  you need not be at the trouble of quartering my masters coat of arms with the milliners   sift o the thimble no upon my honor    syllog you see the crest is a lion rampant beware of the top of your middle finger   sift nay but when i say upon my honor mr syllogism   syllog i beg your

however i would as soon leave it with the printer of the public advertiser  exit sift solus they think they are mighty close here  it is written with lemon juice surely  well i have a trick for that my mistress shall not set me upon the enquiry for nothing i am too good a servant for that too  ha our young ladies coming this way  i am determined to have another peep at it be the consequence what it will exit   enter narcissa and sophia narc well really sophia this is something extraordinary that you should affect to tutor me for disobedience to my mama in the preference i give to mr melmoth has not she till this very day always approved of his addresses   soph therefore i am afraid narcissa she has some better reasons for her sudden change of behavior than you are aware of at least i should be for coming to a farther explanation with her before i took so irretrievable a step as you are going inconsiderately to do   narc oh my dear we shall take a great many steps before we get to scotland we shall not be across the tweed so soon as we might be at the next parish church i shall have time to consider of it again and again therefore before the business is done yet  nay i can assure you that even when we get there if i should not happen to be perfectly of the opinion i am in at present we may come back again no wiser than we set out if the matrimonial apparatus does not wear a very agreeable aspect  if messjohn does not put on one of his best faces and his cleanest band  or    soph nay but be serious   narc well i am and say as i did before that if there were really any thing wrong in what i am going to do you should be the last person in the world my dear sophy to dissuade me from it   sopht why so   narc because i should never listen to a lecture on disobedience from one as disobedient as myself   soph how cannot i entertain a proper regard for colonel camply without incurring the guilt of disobedience i dont intend to run away with him or even to marry him without my fathers consent   narc not unless he refuses to give it you there is no occasion for it my dear but if by a proper regard you mean that the colonel is in possession of your heart i warrant your hand will soon follow and though you may want courage to scamper away to the north before you come of age you may only have just patience enough to stay in the south till you do when we shall find you sneaking into the backdoor of walbrookchurch or st swithins to commit the like horrid sin of disobedience   soph i find my dear there is no talking to you on this subject so like a naughty girl you must go on your own way   narc and you like a naughty girl sophy would go my way too if you dared   enter sift sift the devil take the inventors of sealingwax and invisible ink  i can pick nothing out of this letter  so i think may as well give it to my young mistress if she can read it i may possibly pick something of it out of her and that will do as well  a letter for you madam  gives narcissa the letter narc from mr melmoth   sift yes madam   narc you will excuse me sophy i must go and read my billetdoux it may possibly require an answer  exit sift speaking aside as she follows narcissa so  now for a peep over the left shoulder  let the writing be but any how visible and if young madam reads any more of it than i why then i am grown shortsighted  that is all  exit sophia solus was ever any thing so determinedly inconsiderate  and yet narcissa does not want for prudence when the vivacity of her temper will suffer her to make use of it  i wish i could any how prevent this rash expedition without betraying the confidence she has placed in me exit   scene ii the parade enter lord courtly and furnival court urge this affair no farther furnival i can be of no service to you in it  i have consulted my heart and find it repugnant to all my sentiments the love i bear narcissa and the regard due to my own honor both forbid it   furn give me leave to say my lord your scruples are too refined for a man so well acquainted with the world   court yes barrister i know the world too well to sacrifice so much of my own happiness either to its pleasures or opinions as i have done   furn but if your lordship has no hopes of narcissa what objection can be made to your repairing your fortune by marrying another surely my lord neither the laws of love or honor forbid this   court perhaps not  but i feel an invincible reluctance to the making my addresses elsewhere it is true narcissa herself gives me no encouragement but her mother is still my friend and affords me hopes that something may turn out in my favor i have even just now received a message from her desiring to see me in the evening on particular business  who knows what may have happened but be it as it may i cannot resolve to devote myself to another till it be impossible for narcissa to be mine   furn and your lordship is determined to decline the obliging offers of mr alderman lombard with regard to the money matters i was speaking of   court if they are made on a presumption that i shall serve him where i have neither the power nor inclination   furn i am heartily sorry for it my lord as this is not the way to pay off the mortgage on your estate   court then it must remain unpaid barrister till a more honorable method offers for its discharge  exit furnival solus his lordship is in one of his moral moods to day  i must resume the subject at a gayer moment  and yet i am half afraid he is lost  these partial attachments to the sex are the ruin of many a noble spirit while he was only a general lover he was the most enterprizing genius on the turf  but now  it is strange but we sometimes find it in the power of one virtuous woman to reform in a few months what the libertine part of both sexes have been laboring to corrupt for years  these modest wenches make as many converts as the methodist parsons  whom have we here  the very ladies in question as i live  and engaged in earnest discourse  it may be worth listening to  i have an excellent knack of hearing at a distance retires   enter narcissa and sophia soph and you are really determined narcissa to put this wild scheme in execution   narc positively my dear sophia  i shall not break my word with mr melmoth if he keep his with me we are to have your colonels chaise waiting for us at the towns end i shall just go to the rooms with you for forms sake and see you set in for cards and then vanish slip into a chair and be with my spark in a twinkling leaving you my dear or your colonel to make the best apology you can for me to my mama  i have left a short one indeed myself in a letter she will find on her return in the evening   soph as you have made me your confident my dear i shall not betray you but i cannot say i approve of this step indeed i really think it unnecessary i am certain your mama might be brought to give her consent to your marriage   narc nay then there is the less harm my dear in going to be married without it if she has no objections you know but what might be removed by solicitation the solicitation would be merely a matter of form a piece of childish ceremony  besides my dear sophy to answer all your petty scruples about disobedience at once i am determined on the thing precisely because i would not be disobedient   soph ay make that out narcissa   narc very plainly  my mama has not yet positively told me she would not have me marry mr melmoth  on the contrary she has hitherto encouraged his addresses but as i shrewdly suspect she might tell me so in plain terms the next time we converse on the subject i dont intend to give her an opportunity of laying me under any such injunction  because in that case you know it would be downright disobedience to act directly against her positive commands   soph well for such a madcap thou art certainly a very extraordinary casuist  so joy go with you   narc i warrant it will i only wish we may bring it back again and make it last as long as the wedding ring and the parsons benizon hold us together  so come along  exeunt reenter mr furnival so so so  here is an affair broke out  what will

flight and leave us yet neither  what if i worked by stratagem and entrapped my little lapwing in her own snare  her chairmen may possibly be prevailed on to mistake the place of rendezvous  if i can

walked a chalk after it as still as a mouse all the way   y melm but you knew whither it was going why did not you make the fellows keep strait forward   syllog upon my word sir i found it a little difficult to keep quite strait forward myself besides sir i thought these fellows must know their way about the town better than i did   y melm what can be the meaning of this sure narcissa does not intend to jilt me to give her hand to lord courtly after all o no that is impossible   goes out at the side of the scene looking up at the house syllog impossible ah sir so you said you know when you heard of your fathers death but under correction sir it is just as possible for a young lady to give away her heart as for an old gentleman to give up the ghost  inconstancy and intemperance are both fatal in their consequences  hicups  but then those consequences are so very common that there are matches broke off and funerals performed to every part of england daily and for that matter sir under correction    y melm returning ha the door opens stand back syllogism somebody is coming   they retire to the back of the scenes narcissa and furnival  narc  speaking entering  i insist upon going sir let go my hand sir what is the meaning of this insolence   furn you must not risk the danger madam of going at this time of night alone   narc i can be no where in so much danger as in staying with you   furn nay but mr melmoth will be here immediately madam   y melm coming forward he is here already sir   furn ha   narc oh mr melmoth what a villainous trick has been played us   y melm pray sir how came this lady here and to what purpose   furn you should ask the one of the chairmen who brought her sir and the other of the lady who doubtless directed them   y melm come sir no shuffling how came you to mention my name as a pretense for detaining her  expect to be called to a severe account for this piece of treachery   furn faith sir my design was merely to oblige my friend lord courtly in preventing the ladys elopement   y melm and what right had either you or he sir to pry into or control her actions   furn nay sir i shall not enter into the matter of right as the lady has nothing to complain of but being prevented committing an act of disobedience  but yonder i see comes my lord himself with the servants of the family to conduct the young lady home   y melm confusion how could we be thus betrayed   narc betrayed indeed and by what infamous means i did not think my lord courtly could have descended to such baseness or my mama have abetted it but they shall reap no advantage from the success of it  lead the way mr melmoth and i will follow you through all opposition   y melm syllogism stand to your arms    syllog yes sir and i will make any body else stand too or fall that offers to molest you   brandishing a cudgel enter lord courtly with servants court ha narcissa and mr melmoth fortunate encounter  to the servants stand back till you are called for  servants retire y melm perhaps not so fortunate as you imagine my lord    court for you i am sure it is and as for myself the service i may do you both will at least entitle me to your gratitude   narc if you are serious my lord your absurdity borders on impertinence if you mean to be ironical you are extremely ridiculous   court i flatter myself madam you will soon think otherwise and that however unsuccessful i have hitherto been i shall for my assiduity to night be rewarded with your good opinion   narc indeed my lord you are egregiously mistaken what extravagance to employ your base parasite to decoy me to your house and flatter yourself to obtain my good opinion of it indeed indeed my lord this is one of the grossest instances of selfadulation i ever met with   court decoy you to my house madam i dont understand you   furn indeed madam  to narcissa i can answer for his lordships innocence in that particular   narc yes yes we shall certainly take your word for his innocence   y melm be prepared sir to answer for your own  but come narcissa  offering to go we lose time   court interposing let me entreat you not to be too precipitate mrs mildmay entreats nay insists that you will proceed no farther without consulting your friends    y melm one of which i presume is to be your lordship no no my lord we have lost too much time by your contrivance already  therefore stand aside if you please    court nay but for your own sakes    narc for our own sakes my lord or yours ha ha ha   court this is no place to enforce my own pretenions i act now only in obedience to mrs mildmay who charged me to say that all laws human and divine oppose your union   y melm very pathetic indeed my lord ha ha ha   furn aside i must second this motion  to young melmoth yes sir and as the lady is a minor the laws of england too    ymelm oh sir we shall not venture to break the laws of england till we get into scotland so that you may spare your rhetoric   court on my honor madam you cannot be the wife of mr melmoth   narc but i suppose i might be yours my lord if i aspired to that dignity and so in return for your extraordinary friendship i promise you that when i find i cannot be mr melmoths i will give my hand to your lordship   court if i should take you at your word madam   narc i will certainly keep it and so now i hope you are satisfied  going court but narcissa   narc your humble servant my lord   court mr melmoth   y melm my lord your most obedient  come narcissa well take this way  poor lord courtly ha ha ha exit young melmoth and narcissa   court madness

pericraniums  brandishing his endgel the sevents make a show of resisting with their sticks   furn what does the fellow mean   syllog i will show you that mr lawyer throwing open his great coat and showing a blunderbuss slung over his shoulders do you see this curious piece of casuistry it contains very weighty reasons against you i assure you   furn a blunderbuss loaded with slugs i suppose a powerful way of arguing indeed   syllog this sir is the ultima ratio dialectici and and is the most effectual argumentum ad hominem in the whole system of logic   presents the piece to the servants who start back furn is the man mad or drunk   serve be which he will sir we had better retire for fear of mischief   syllog yes sir you had better take good advice and retire for fear of mischief   furn would the wretch commit murder   syllog not downright murdrum mr barrister as you would call it but being a little inebriated ones hand is liable to shake and this damned trigger here has no catch plays with the lock of the piece with the mouth turned toward furnival besides sir i am placed here upon duty and by all the rules of war and logic if you proceed vi et armis i must oppose you by the same mode of ratiocination therefore give up the point ye scoundrels turning round and presenting the piece at the servants or i will let fly such a shower of majors and minors among you that shall make you tremble for the consequences   the servants run off furn what all gone then i think i may as well withdraw my plea too his lordship will certainly be nonsuited sneaks off   syllogism solus so the enemy has made his retreat and the days my own egad i think i have displayed my prowiss pretty well here  i hope by this time my general has carried off the spoils of the field and then i

flight   g camp by the ladys mother sir who being early informed of their intention was by the aid and advice of lord courtly at the place of rendezvous before they set off for my own part apprehensive that my assistance would be called for i purposely kept out of the way   g mel and how takes my kinsman his rivals interposition in this affair have you seen him to day   c came just now and horribly mortified at his disappointment i assure you he had just dispatched a note to lord courtly   g mel a challenge ha colonel  a mettled spark but we must have no fighting if it can be decently prevented the consequences may be fatal   c came i dont see how mr melmoth can recede general he must call his lordship to account for his last nights misbehaviour   g mel well but you may be his second colonel and prolong the ceremonials till i have had some talk with the young ladys mother i promised yesterday to endeavor to conciliate matters with her relations had she gone off with my kinsman to scotland i can do no less than try how far my influence may extend now if mrs mildmays objections to young melmoth be merely founded on his supposed want of fortune they are readily obviated and if lord courtly be as you say a man of sense and principle he will give up the point and no longer endeavor to divide two young people whose hearts seem formed for each other o here comes mr alderman lombard   g mel i had a meeting with him last night to settle the affair of my executorship when i took an opportunity to mention yours with his daughter sophia as also your electioneering business in which he does not meet with the encouragement he expected so that you may not find him so refractory as you imagined  i have taken some steps toward your reconciliation   c came this is so kind and obliging in you general    g mel nay no compliments my dear colonel while dead to family connexions myself i live but for the service of my friends enter alderman lombard good morrow mr

you can dispose of her to advantage and make her happy in a good husband mr lombard no no i dare say you are too good a father for that   lomb why to be sure general if i could promote her happiness and my influence in the borough at the same time    g mel both which i dare say you will in conciliating matters with my friend the colonel you own mr lombard the force of the arguments i made use of last night  i shall now therefore leave the discussion of the matter to yourselves having some business of consequence to dispatch elsewhere mr lombard your most obedient   exit lomb general your

story mr melmoth has told narcissa be true   sift o lord madam it is exactly as i guessed yesterday what mr melmoth told narcissa mr syllogism told me but i knew it was a sib the moment i heard it   mrs mild but how are you assured of it today   sift from colonel camplys own mouth madam who called me into the parlour this morning and began to catechize me like a schoolmaster mrs sift says he what makes you abroad so early what your ladies have sent you out upon the enquiry i suppose i know they are curious and inquisitive  indeed sir says i you know no lady in our house half so inquisitive as myself well says he what is the news then at home why sir says i we hear that mr melmoths father is dead and has disinherited him  disinherited him says he an idle story sift an idle story there is nothing in it  so i thought an please your honor said i for i understood mr melmoth was son to the strange gentleman who visited you yesterday ay sift says he while that gentleman lives mr melmoths fortunes are in the hands of a father  oh maam i am positively certain it is as i first suggested    mrs mild then so far all is well but did you learn nothing more   sift oh yes maam you wanted to know if the gentleman was married or not but that seems to be a doubt   mrs mild a doubt did colonel camply say it was a doubt   sift no madam i did not think that a proper question to put to the colonel but mrs tiptoe his honors housekeeper with whom i had a little confab afterward overheard the gentleman tell her master yesterday that he was married   mrs mild how then is it a doubt  aside oh no my fears are true and i must still be wretched   sift why it seems madam the gentleman has lost his wife   mrs mild lost her how   sift nay maam i know nothing more than that he cannot find her so that at least she is lost to him he has not seen her i find these twelve years past though by his own account which is a little extraordinary he has been looking for her almost from one end of the world to the other   mrs mild good heavens my hopes revive   sift the colonel advises him if he dont find her soon to look out for another but he is one of your constant swains it seems and declares that if his first love cannot be found she shall certainly be his last  whether the gentleman will keep his word or not is another affair but this is all i could learn of the matter madam as it stands at present   mrs mild i am satisfied aside is he then true to one he thought unfaithful and can he still remember me with tenderness to sift go leave me sift i see narcissa coming   exit sift enter narcissa well narcissa i hope that on reflection you are convinced of the danger and impropriety of your behavior think my dear into what frightful perils your indiscretion had betrayed you believe me child such unadvised proceeding differs little from wilful disobedience   narc indeed madam i shudder at the reflection and am hardly recovered from the terror into which your relation had thrown me  but with regard to mr melmoths affinity how was it possible for me to have any suspicion of it   mrs mild it certainly was not but in a matter of so much importance you should not have acted so precipitately   narc nor should i mama had not you been so much on the reserve and spoken of mr melmoth so disrespectfully yesterday morning  but for the future i am all obedience  how would you have me behave to him now  as you said so little to him last night he will undoubtedly make me a visit this morning  how am i to resist his solicitations without giving him my reasons for it   mrs mild cannot you turn the conversation on another subject i shall now very soon come to an explanation with your father   narc my father madam   mrs mild yes narcissa that longlost father whom you have heard me so often lament is now in bath i saw him yesterday by accident and today intend to procure an interview which should have been over before i had imparted this circumstance had not your last nights adventure anticipated the discovery of mr melmoths being your brother   narc but is it not strange madam that he should say nothing to me of his fathers arrival but on the contrary should tell me he was dead and had disinherited him   mrs mild i cannot divine his reasons for such behavior but men in love narcissa are strange creatures he might do it possibly to make a trial of your regard for him    nar it must have been a scheme sure to mislead me into that dangerous project of elopement which might have proved so fatal   mrs mild it might be so and therefore it would not be amiss my dear if you affect to resent it as such nay i would have yon do it were it only to give a preparatory check to his passion before he knows that youre his sister it will be improper for me to see him yet as well in regard to what has passed as to the danger of betraying a mothers affection too soon i must speak first with your father   narc in what a situation then madam do you leave your narcissa is it for me to act so hard a part can i affect to treat with disregard the man so late i loved alas i find his image wanting here the void it left no brother can supply  oh my poor heart   mrs mild i share my dear narcissa your distress and would not task you with a mothers weakness but for this once call up your resolution an explanation yet were premature  but here he comes  i must retire  exit narc then let my duty teach me to dissemble   enter young melmoth as he enters narcissa and alone i feared this happiness had been denied me  my dear narcissa i am glad to see you look so charmingly today  i was afraid the ill success of our last nights adventure might have had an effect upon your spirits narc in a trembling voice being greatly disturbed not at all sir i never was in better spirit in my life   y mel indeed i wish i could say so  but our unlucky disappointment   narc still in perturbation unlucky   y mel cruelly so we might ere this have been halfway on our journey and in a few hours more at the end of it  where we might have put it out of the power of accident to part us   narc for that very reason mr melmoth may it not be as well we were prevented  what to be tied together for life never to be parted might we not in time have been tired of one another and after that have been most disagreeable companions   y mel glad we were prevented tired of one another disagreeable companions how different is this language and this behavior narcissa to that of yesterday   narc what if i should have changed my mind since yesterday sir   y mel changed your mind narcissa   narc is it impossible sir  did you never hear of a womans changing her mind   y mel yes madam i have heard of wonderful changes in womens minds  but you are not in earnest narcissa   narc indeed sir i am at present in no disposition for jesting   very gravely and confused as through the whole scene y mel and you are really glad we were prevented going to scotland to be married surely you dissemble with me   narc not in that believe me sir  i would not have gone off with you to scotland and been married to you for the world   y mel nay then there is a change indeed  but for heavens sake why what can have worked this astonishing alteration what have i done or said or thought how am i changed that such a change should have happened in you some villain envious of my happiness must have unjustly traduced and blackened my reputation   narc why something has been said of you it must be confessed but it was so far from being to your disadvantage that had i never had any knowledge of you before it would have induced me to love and esteem you as a brother  but with regard to your own behavior to me mr melmoth i must own it has been very exceptionable how could you tell me sir that your father was dead   y mel he is narcissa    narc fie fie mr melmoth  i am well assured your father is still living and must freely declare that were there not another man in the world i would not give my hand to his son  aside bursting into tears  now i hope my mama will be satisfied  exit y mel do i live am i awake  looking after her with astonishment  was that narcissa or am i frederic

as you are principally concerned in it i shall with your leave impart it to you   nar if it be of immediate consequencc sir  otherwise i should rather    g mel nay but young lady it is of consequence and to you too i am not to learn with regard to your late generous behavior to mr melmoth  i am a relation of his and apprehending your last nights disappointment might have some disagreeable consequences which i am able to remove i have taken the liberty of the present intrusion   narc this openness of behavior on your part sir would be a reproach to any mean reserve on mine but i am only at liberty to say that the disappointment as you call it was a fortunate one   g mel is it possible you can think so then must i have been misinformed   narc you will excuse me sir but my mama has fully convinced me that my intended marriage with mr melmoth would have been highly improper   g mel improper   narc dreadful    g mel you astonish me madam  dreadful what new folly has he committed then to what baseness descended that should make an alliance with him deserving such an epithet   narc dont mistake me sir  i have still the highest esteem for mr melmoth but my mama    g mel objects to his want of fortune i know it but if i convince her she is mistaken    narc yet even then sir notwithstanding the sincere regard i still entertain for mr melmoth and the great respect which though a stranger i feel for yon i could not be induced to listen to the solicitations of either  no sir i never can marry any man who calls you father  but i can explain myself no farther my mama is by this
