the pleasures of melancholy a poem   praecipe lugubres cantus melpomene  hor london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pall mall and sold by m cooper at the globe in paternoster row      price one shilling  the pleasures of melancholy mother of musings contemplation sage whose mansion is upon the topmost cliff of cloudcapt teneriff in secret bower where ever wrapped in meditation high thou hearst unmoved in dark tempestuous night the loud winds howl around the beating rain and the big hail in mingling storm descend upon his horrid brow but when the skies unclouded shine and through the blue serene pale cynthia rolls her silveraxled car then ever looking on the spangled vault raptured thou sitst while murmurs indistinct of distant billows sooth thy pensive ear with hoarse and hollow sounds secure selfblest often too thou listenst to the wild uproar of fleets encountring that in whispers low ascends the rocky summit where thou dwellst remote from man conversing with the spheres o lead me blackbrowd  to solemn glooms cogenial with my soul to chearless shades to ruined seats to twilight cells and bowers where thoughtful melancholy loves to muse her favorite midnight haunts the laughing scenes of purple spring where all the wanton train of smiles and graces seem to lead the dance in sportive round while from their hands they shower ambrosial blooms and flowers no longer charm tempe no more i court thy balmy breeze adieu green vales embroidered meads adieu beneath yon ruined abbeys mossgrown piles often let me sit at twilight hour of eve where through some western window the pale moon pours her longlevelld rule of streaming light while sullen sacred silence reigns around save the lone screechowls note whose bower is built amid the mouldering caverns dark and damp and the calm breeze that rustles in the leaves of flaunting ivy that with mantle green invests some sacred tower or let me tread it is neighboring walk of pines where strayed of old the cloistered brothers through the gloomy void that far extends beneath their ample arch as on i tread religious horror wraps my soul in dread repose but when the world is clad in midnights ravencolourd robe in hollow charnel let me watch the flame of taper dim while airy voices talk along the glimmering walls or ghostly shape at distance seen invites with beckning hand my lonesome steps through the farwinding vaults nor undelightful is the solemn noon of night when happily wakeful from my couch i start lo all is motionless around roars not the rushing wind the sons of men and every beast in mute oblivion lie all natures hushed in silence and in sleep o then how fearful is it to reflect that through the solitude of the still globe no being wakes but me till stealing sleep my drooping temples baths in opiate dews nor then let dreams of wanton folly born my senses lead through flowery paths of joy but let the sacred genius of the night such mystic visions send as spenser saw when through bewildring fancys magic maze to the bright regions of the fairy world soared his creative mind or milton knew when in abstracted thought he first conceived all heaven in tumult and the seraphim come towering armed in adamant and gold let others love the summerevnings smiles as listening to some distant waterfall they mark the blushes of the streaky west i choose the pale decembers foggy glooms then when the sullen shades of evening close where through the room a blindlyglimmring gleam the dying embers scatter far remote from mirths mad shouts that through the lighted roof resound with festive echo let me sit blessed with the lowly crickets drowsy dirge then let my contemplative thought explore this fleeting state of things the vain delights the fruitless toils that still elude our search as through the wilderness of life we rove this sober hour of silence will unmask false follys smiles that like the dazzling spells of wily comus cheat the unweeting eye with blear illusion and persuade to drink the charmed cup that reasons mintage fair unmoulds and stamps the monster on the man eager we taste but in the luscious draught forget the poisonous dregs that lurk beneath few know that elegance of soul refined whose soft sensation feels a quicker joy from melancholys scenes than the dull pride of tasteless splendour and magnificence can ever afford thus eloise whose mind had languishd to the pangs of melting love more secret transport found as on some tomb reclined she watched the tapers of the dead or through the pillard isles amid the shrines of imagd saints and intermingled graves which scarce the storyd windows dim disclosed musing she wandered than cosmelia finds as through the mall in silken pomp arrayed she floats amid the gilded sons of dress and shines the fairest of the assembled belles when azure noontide chears the daedal globe and the glad regent of the golden day rejoices in his bright meridian bower how often my wishes ask the nights return that best befriends the melancholy mind hail sacred night to thee my song i raise sister of ebonscepterd hecat hail whether in congregated clouds thou wrapst thy viewless chariot or with silver crown thy beaming head encirclest ever hail what though beneath thy gloom the lapland witch often celebrates her mooneclipsing rites though murder wan beneath thy shrouding shade often calls her silent votries to devise of blood and slaughter while by one blue lamp in secret confrence sits the listening band and start at each low wind or wakeful sound what though thy stay the pilgrim curses often as all benighted in arabian wastes he hears the howling wilderness resound with roaming monsters while on his hoar head the blackdescending tempest ceaseless beats yet more delightful to my pensive mind is thy return than bloomy morns approach when from the portals of the saffron east she sheds fresh roses and ambrosial dews yet not ungrateful is the morns approach when dropping wet she comes and clad in clouds while through the damp air scowls the peevish south and the dusk landschape rises dim to view the afflicted songsters of the saddend groves hail not the sullen gloom but silent droop the waving elms that ranged in thick array enclose with stately row some rural hall are mute nor echo with the clamors hoarse of rooks rejoicing on their hoary boughs while to the shed the dripping poultry crowd a mournful train secure the villagehind hangs over the crackling blaze nor tempts the storm rings not the high wood with enlivening shouts of early hunter all is silence drear and deepest sadness wraps the face of things through popes soft song though all the graces breath and happiest art adorn his attic page yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow as at the foot of some hoar oak reclined in magic spensers wildlywarbled song i see deserted una wander wide through wasteful solitudes and lurid heaths weary forlorn than when the belinda vid rape of the lock fated fair upon the bosom bright of silver thames launches in all the luster of brocade amid the splendors of the laughing sun the gay description palls upon the sense and coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss o wrap me then in shades of darksom pine bear me to caves by desolation brown to dusky vales and hermithaunted rocks and hark methinks resounding from the gloom the voice of melancholy strikes mine ear come leave the busy trifles of vain life and let these twilight mansions teach thy mind the joys of musing and of solemn thought ye youths of albions beautyblooming isle whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love is there a pleasure like the pensive mood whose magic wont to sooth your softened souls o tell how rapturous is the deepfelt bliss to melt to melodys assuasive voice careless to stray the midnight mead along and pour your sorrows to the pitying moon often interrupted by the bird of woe to muse by margin of romantic stream to fly to solitudes and there forget the solemn dullness of the tedious world till in abstracted dreams of fancy lost eager you snatch the visionary fair and on the phantom feast your cheated gaze sudden you start  the imagined joys recede the same sad prospect opens on your sense and naught is seen but deepextended trees in hollow rows and your awakened ear again attends the neighboring fountains sound these are delights that absence drear has made familiar to my soul ere since the form of young sapphira beauteous as the spring when from her viletwoven couch awaked by frolic zephyrs hand her tender cheek graceful she lifts and blushing from her bower issues to cloth in gladsomeglistring green the genial globe first met my dazzled sight these are delights unknown to minds profane and which alone the pensive soul can taste the taperd choir at midnight hour of prayer often let me tread while to the according voice the manysounding organ peals on high in fullvoicd chorus through the embowed roof till all my soul is bathed in ecstasies and lapd in paradise or let me sit far in some distant isle of the deep dome there lonesome listen to the solemn sounds which as they lengthen through the gothic vaults in hollow murmurs reach my ravished ear nor let me fail to cultivate my mind with the soft thrillings of the tragic muse divine melpomene sweet pitys nurse queen of the stately step and flowing pall now let monimia mourn with streaming eyes her joys incestuous and polluted love now let calista dye the desperate steel within her bosom for lost innocence unable to behold a father weep or jaffeir kneel for one forgiving look nor seldom let the moor on desdemone pour the misguided threats of jealous rage by soft degrees the manly torrent steals from my swollen eyes and at a brothers woe my big heart melts in sympathizing tears what are the splendors of the gaudy court it is tinsel trappings and it is pageant pomps to me far happier seems the banished lord amid siberias unrejoycing wilds who pines all lonesome in the chambers hoar of some high castle shut whose windows dim in distant ken discover trackless plains where winter ever drives his icy car while still repeated objects of his view the gloomy battlements and ivied towers that crown the solitary dome arise while from the topmost turret the slow clock far heard along the inhospitable wastes with sadreturning chime awakes new grief than is the satrap whom he left behind in moscows regal palaces to drown in ease and luxury the laughing hours illustrious objects strike the gazers mind with feeble bliss and but allure the sight nor rouse with impulse quick the feeling heart thus seen by shepherd from hymettus brow what painted landschapes spread their charms beneath here palmy groves amid whose umbrage green the unfading olive lifts her silver head resounding once with platos voice arise here vineclad hills unfold their purple stores here fertile vales their level lap expand amid whose beauties glistering athens towers though through the graceful seats ilissus roll his sageinspiring flood whose fabled banks the spreading laurel shades though roseate morn pour all her splendors on the empurpled scene yet feels the musing hermit truer joys as from the cliff that over his cavern hangs he views the piles of fallen persepolis in deep arrangement hide the darksome plain unbounded waste the mouldering obelisc here like a blasted oak ascends the clouds here parian domes their vaulted halls disclose horrid with thorn where lurks the secret thief whence flits the twilightloving bat at eve and the deaf adder wreaths her spotted train the dwellings once of elegance and art here temples rise amid whose hallowed bounds spires the black pine while through the naked street haunt of the tradeful merchant springs the grass here columns heaped on prostrate columns torn from their firm base increase the mouldering mass far as the sight can pierce appear the spoils of sunk magnificence a blended scene of moles fanes arches domes and palaces where with his brother horror ruin sits o come then melancholy queen of thought o come with saintly look and steadfast step from forth thy cave embowerd with mournful yew where ever to the cu  sound listening thou sittst and  ress bind thy votarys hair and seal him sy son but never let euphrosyne beguile with toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind nor with her primrose garlands strew my paths what though with her the dimpled hebe dwells with youngeyd pleasure and the looserobd joy though venus mother of the smiles and loves and bacchus ivycrownd in myrtle bower with her in dance fantastic beat the ground what though it is here is to calm the blue serene and at her presence mild the lowering clouds disperse in air and over the face of heaven new day diffusive glows at her approach yet are these joys that melancholy gives by contemplation taught her sister sage than all her witless revels happier far then ever beauteous contemplation hail from thee began auspicious maid my song with thee shall end for thou art fairer far than are the nymphs of cirrhas mossy grot to loftier rapture thou can wake the thought than all the fabling poets boasted powers hail queen divine whom as tradition tells once in his evningwalk a druid found far in a hollow glade of monas woods and piteous bore with hospitable hand to the close shelter of his oaken bower there soon the sage admiring marked the dawn of solemn musing in thy pensive thought for when a smiling babe you loved to lie often deeply listening to the rapid roar of woodhung meinai stream of druids old that lavd his hallowed haunt with dashing wave finis
