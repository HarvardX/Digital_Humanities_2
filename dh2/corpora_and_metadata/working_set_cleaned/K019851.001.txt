conquisitoris de pacis publica cap    printed in the year   0   price three pence  the preface the end of satyr is reformation and the author though he doubts the work of conversion is at a general stop has put his hand to the plow  i expect a storm of ill language from the fury of the town and especially from those whose english talent it is to rail and without being taken for a conjurer i may venure to foretell that i shall be cavild at about my mean style rough verse and incorrect language things i might indeed have taken more care in but the book is printed and though i see some faults it is too late to mend them and this is all i think needful to say to them  possibly somebody may take me for a dutchman in which hey are mistaken but i am one that would be glad to see englishmen behave themselves better to strangers and to governors also that one might not be reproached in foreign countries for belonging to a nation that wants manners  i assure you gentlemen strangers use us better abroad and we can give no reason but our ill nature for the contray here  methinks an englishman who is so proud of being called  goodfellow should be civil and it cannot be denied but e are in many cases and particularly to strangers the hurlishest people alive  as to vices who can dispute our intemperance while an honest drunken fellow is a character in a mans praise ll our reformations are banters and will be so till our magistrates and gentry reform themselves by way of example then and not till then they may be expected to punish others without blushing  as to our ingratitude i desire to be understood of that particular people who pretending to be protestants have all along endeavored to reduce the liberties and religion of this nation into the hands of king james and his popish powers together with such who enjoy the peace and protection of the present government and yet abuse and affront the king who procured it and openly profess their uneasiness under him these by whatsoever names or titles they are dignified or distinguished are the people aimed at nor do i disown but that it is so much the temper of an englishman to abuse his benefactor that i could be glad to see it rectified  they who think i have been guilty of any error in exposing the crimes of my own countrymen to themselves may among many honest instances of the like nature find the same thing in mr cowly in his imitation of the second olympic ode of pindar his words are these but in this thankless world the givers are envied even by the receivers it is now the cheap and frugal fashion rather to hide than pay an obligation nay it is much worse than so it now an artifice does grow wrongs and outrages to do lest men should think we owe   the introduction speak satyr for there is none can tell like thee whether it is folly pride or knavery that makes this discontented land appear less happy now in times of peace than war why civil feuds disturb the nation more than all our bloody wars have done before fools out of favor grudge at knaves in place and men are always honest in disgrace the courtpreferments make men knaves in course but they which would be in them would be worse it is not at foreigners that we repine would foreigners their perquisites resign the grand contentions plainly to be seen to get some men put out and some put in or this our s  rs make long harangues and florid m  rs whet their polished tongues tatesmen are always sick of one disease and a good pension gives them present ease hats the specific makes them all content ith any king and any government ood patriots at courtabuses rail and all the nations grievances bewail t when the sovereign balsams once applied he zealot never fails to change his side and when he must the golden key resign e railing spirit comes about again who shall this bubbld nation disabuse while they their own felicities refuse who at the wars have made such mighty pother and now are falling out with one another with needless fears the jealous nation fill and always have been saved against their will who fifty millions sterling have disbursd to be with peace and too much plenty cursed who their old monarch eagerly undo and yet uneasily obey the new search satyr search a deep incision make the poysons strong the antidotes too weak it is pointed truth must manage this dispute and downright english englishmen confute whet thy just anger at the nations pride and with keen phrase repel the vicious tide to englishmen their own beginning show and ask them why they slight their neighbors so go back to elder times and ages past and nations into long oblivion cast to old britannias youthful days retire and there for trueborn englishmen enquire britannia freely will disown the name and hardly knows her self from whence they came wonders that they of all men should pretend to birth and blood and for a name contend go back to causes where our follies dwell and fetch the dark original from hell speak satyr

duly divided to debauch mankind and plant infernal dictates in his mind pride the first peer and president of hell to his share spain the largest province fell the subtle prince thought fittest to bestow on these the golden mines of mexico with all the silver mountains of peru wealth which would in wise hands the world undo because he knew their genius was such too lazy and too haughty to be

before so very rich and yet so very poor lust chose the torrid zone of italy where blood ferments in rapes and sodomy where swelling veins overflow with livid streams with heat impregnate from

been a prey her open harbors and her fertile plains the merchants glory these and those the swains to every barbarous nation have betrayed her who conquer her as often as they invade her so beauty guarded but by innocence that ruins her which should be her defense ingratitude a devil of black renown possessed her very early for his own an ugly surly sullen selfish spirit who satans worst perfections does inherit second to him in malice and in force all devil without and all within him worse he made her firstborn race to be so rude and suffered her to be so often subdued by several crowds of wandering thieves oerrun often unpeopld and as often undone while every nation that her powers reduced their languages and manners introduced from whose mixed relics our compounded breed by spurious generation does succeed making a race uncertain and unevn derived from all the nations under heaven the romans first with julius caesar came including all the nations of that name gauls

he called them lords to please their upstart pride with newmade words and doomsdaybook his tyranny records and here begins the ancient pedigree that so exalts our poor nobility it is that from some french trooper they derive who with the norman bastard did arrive the trophies of the families appear some show the sword the bow and some the spear which their great ancestor forsooth did wear these in the heralds register remain their noble mean extraction to explain yet who the hero was no man can tell whether a drummer or a colonel the silent record blushes to reveal their undescended dark original but grant the best how came the change to pass a trueborn englishman of norman race a turkish horse can show more history to prove his welldescended family conquest as by the dr sherl de

banter made to be a test of fools which those that use it justly ridicules a metaphor invented to express a man akin to all the universe for as the scots as learned men have said throughout the world their wandering seed have spread so openhanded england it is believed has all the gleanings of the world received some think of england twas our savior meant the gospel should to all the world be sent since when the blessed sound did hither reach they to all nations might be said to preach it is well that virtue gives nobility else god knows where we had our gentry since scarce one family is left

grow old begins to leave them the climate makes them terrible and bold and english beef their courage does uphold no danger can their daring spirit pall always provided that their bellys full in close intriegues their facultys but weak for genrally whatever they know they speak and often their own councils undermine by their infirmity and not design from whence the learned say it does proceed that english treasons never can succeed or they are so openhearted you may know their own most secret thoughts and others too the laboring poor in spite of double pay re saucy mutinous and beggarly o lavish of their money and their time that want of forecast is the nations crime ood drunken company is their delight and what they get by day they spend by night ull thinking seldom does their heads engage but drink their youth away and hurry on old age empty of all good husbandry and sense and void of manners most when void of pence their strong aversion to behaviours such hey always talk too

wise men think there is some cause to doubt ill purge good manners and religion out nor do the poor alone their liquor prize he sages join in this great sacrifice he learned men who study aristotle orrect him with an explanation bottle aise epicurus rather than lysander d the drunkards name for canary aristippus more than alexander the doctors too their galen here resign and genrally prescribe specific wine the graduates studys grown an easier task while for the urinal they toss the flask the surgeons art grows plainer every hour and wines the balm which into wounds they pour poets long since parnassus have forsaken and say the ancient bards were all mistaken apollos lately abdicate and fled and good king bacchus governs in his stead he does the chaos of the head refine and atomthoughts jump into words by wine the inspirations of a finer nature as wine must needs excel parnassus water statesmen their weighty politics refine as soldiers raise their courages by wine caecilia gives her choristers their choice and lets them all drink wine to clear the voice some think the clergy first found out the way and wines the only spirit by which they pray but others less profane than so agree it clears the lungs and helps the memory and therefore all of them divinely think instead of study it is as well to drink and here i would be very glad to know whether our asgilites may drink or no the enlightening fumes of wine would certainly assist them much when they begin to fly or if a fiery chariot should appear inflamed by wine they would have the less to fear even the gods themselves as mortals say were they on earth would be as drunk as they nectar would be no more celestial drink they would all take wine to teach them how to think but english drunkards gods and men outdo drink their estates away and senses too colons in debt and if his friends should fail to help him out must dye at last in gaol his wealthy uncle sent a hundred nobles to pay his trifles off and rid him of his troubles ut colon like a trueborn englishman rank all the money out in bright champaign and colon does in custody remain runkness has been the darling of the realm er since a drunken pilot had the helm in their religion they are so unevn that each man goes his own byway to heaven tenacious of mistakes to that degree that every man pursues it seprately and fancies none can find the way but he  shy of one another they are grown s if they strove to get to heaven alone igid and zealous positive and grave and every grace but charity they have his makes them so illnatured and uncivil that all men think an englishman the devil surly to strangers froward to their friend ubmit to love with a reluctant mind esolvd to be ungrateful and unkind  by necessity reduced to ask he giver has the difficultest task or what is bestowed they aukwardly receive and always take less freely than they give he obligation is their highest grief and never love where they accept relief  sullen in their sorrows that it is known heyll rather dye than their afflictions own and if relieved it is too often true that they will abuse their benefactors too or in distress their haughty stomachs such hey hate to see themselves obliged too much ldom contented often in the wrong ard to be pleased at all and never long if your mistakes their ill opinion gain o merit can their favor reobtain and if they are not vindictive in their fury it is their unconstant temper does secure ye their brains so cool their passion seldom burns for all is condensed before the flame returns the fermentations of so weak a matter the humid damps the fume and runs it all to water so though the inclination may be strong they are pleased by fits and never angry long then if good nature shows some slender proof they never think they have reward enough but like our modern quakers of the town expect your manners and return you none friendship the abstracted union of the mind which all men seek but very few can find of all the nations in the universe none talk on it more or understand it less for if it does the property annoy their properry their friendship will destroy as you discourse them you shall hear them tell all things in which they think they do excel no panegyric needs their praise record an englishman never wants his own good word his long discourses genrally appear prologud with his own wondrous character but first to illustrate his own good name he never fails his neighbor to defame and yet he really designs no wrong his malice goes no further than his tongue but pleased to tattle he delights to rail to satisfy the lechry of a tale his own dear praises close the ample speech tells you how wise he is that is how rich for wealth is wisdom he that is rich is wise and all men learned poverty despise his generosity comes next and then concludes that he is a trueborn englishman and they it is known are generous and free forgetting and forgiving injury which may be true thus rightly understood orgiving ill turns and forgetting good cheerful in labor when they have undertook it ut out of humor when they are out of pocket ut if their belly and their pockets full they may be phlegmatic but never dull and if a bottle does their brains refine  makes their wit as sparkling as their wine as for the general vices which we find they are guilty of in common with mankind atyr forbear and silently endure e must conceal the crimes we cannot cure or shall my verse the brighter sex defame or english beauty will preserve her name eyond dispute agreeable and fair and modester than other nations are or where the vice prevails the great temptation s want of money more than inclination n general this only is allowed they are something noisy and a little proud an englishman is gentlest in command obedience is a stranger in the land hardly subjected to the magistrate or englishmen do all subjection hate humblest when rich but peevish when they are poor and think whatever they have they merit more the meanest english plowman studies law and keeps thereby the magistrates in awe will boldly tell them what they ought to do and sometimes punish their omissions too their liberty and propertys so dear they scorn their laws or governors to fear o bugbeard with the name of slavery they cannot submit to their own liberty estraint from ill is freedom to the wise ut englishmen do all restraint despise laves to the liquor drudges to the pots the mob are statesmen and their statesman sots their governors they count such dangerous things that it is their custom to affront their kings so jealous of the power their kings possessed they suffer neither power nor kings to rest the bad with force they eagerly subdue the good with constant clamours they pursue and did king jesus reign they would murmur too a discontented nation and by far harder to rule in times of peace than war easily set together by the ears and full of causeless jealousies and fears apt to revolt and willing to rebel and never are contented when they are well no government could ever please them long could tie their hands or rectify their tongue in this to ancient israel well compared eternal murmurs are among them heard it was but lately that they were oppressed their rights invaded and their laws suppressed when nicely tender of their liberty lord what a noise they made of slavery in daily tumults showed their discontent lampoond their king and mocked his government and if in arms they did not first appear twas want of force and not for want of fear in humbler tone than english used to do at foreign hands for foreign aid they sue william the great successor of nassau their prayers heard and their oppressions saw he saw and saved them god and him they praised to this their thanks to that their trophies raised but glutted with their own felicities they soon their new deliverer despise say all their prayers back their joy disown unsing their thanks and pull their trophies down their harps of praise are on the willows hung for englishmen are never contented long the reverend clergy too and whod have thought that they who had such nonresistance taught should ever to arms against their prince be brought who up to heaven did regal power advance subjecting english laws to modes of france twisting religion so with loyalty s one could never live and the other dye and yet no sooner did their prince design their glebes and perquisites to undermine ut all their passive doctrines laid aside the clergy their own principles denied npreachd their nonresisting cant and prayed to heaven for help and to the dutch for aid the church chymd all her doctrines back again and pulpitchampions did the cause maintain lew in the face of all their former zeal and nonresistance did at once repeal the rabbis say it would be too prolix to tie religion up to politics the churchs safety is suprema lex and so by a new figure of their own their former doctrines all at once disown s laws post facto in the parliament  urgent cases have obtained assent ut are as dangerous presidents laid by made lawful only by necessity the reverend fathers then in arms appear and men of god became the men of war he nation fired by them to arms apply ssault their antichristian monarchy to their due channel all our laws restore and made things what they should have been before ut when they came to fill the vacant throne and the pale priests looked back on what they would done ow english liberty began to thrive and church of england loyalty outlive ow all their persecuting days were done d their delivrer placed upon the throne the priests as priests are wont to do turned tail they are englishmen and nature will prevail now they deplore the ruins they have made and murmur for the master they betrayed excuse those crimes they could not make him mend and suffer for the cause they cannot defend pretend they would not have carried things so high and protomartyrs make for popery had the prince done as they designed the thing have set the clergy up to rule the king taken a donative for coming hither and so have left their king and them together we had say they been now a happy nation no doubt we had seen a blessed reformation for wise men say ts as dangerous a thing a ruling priesthood as a priestrid king and of all plagues with which mankind are cursed ecclesiastic tyrannys the worst if all our former grievances were feigned king james has been abused and we trepanned bugbeard with popery and power despotick tyrannick government and leagues exotic the revolutions a phanatick plot w  a tyrant s  a sot a factious army and a poisoned nation unjustly forced king jamess abdication but if he did the subjects rights invade then he was punished only not betrayed and punishing of kings is no such crime but englishmen have done it many a time when kings the sword of justice first lay down they are no kings though they possess the crown titles are shadows crowns are empty things the good of subjects is the end of kings to guide in war and to protect in peace where tyrants once commence the kings do cease for arbitrary powers so strange a thing it makes the tyrant and unmakes the king if kings by foreign priests and armies reign and lawless power against their oaths maintain hen subjects must have reason to complain if oaths must bind us when our kings do ill o call in foreign aid is to rebel y force to circumscribe our lawful prince  wilful treason in the largest sense and they who once rebel most certainly their god and king and former oaths defy  we allow no maladministration ould cancel the allegiance of the nation et all our learned sons of levi try his ecclesastick riddle to unty ow they could make a step to call the prince and yet pretend to oaths and innocence by the first address they made beyond the seas heyre perjured in the most intense degrees and without scruple for the time to come may swear to all the kings in christendom and truly did our kings consider all heyd never let the clergy swear at all their politic allegiance they would refuse or whores and priests will never want excuse but if the mutual contract was dissolved the doubtss explained the difficulty solved that kings when they descend to tyranny dissolve the bond and leave the subject free the governments ungirt when justice dies and constitutions are nonentities the nations all a mob there is no such thing as lords or commons parliament or king a great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies till laws revive and mutual contract ties a chaos free to choose for their own share what case of government they please to wear f to a king they do the reins commit all men are bound in conscience to submit but then that king must by his oath assent to postulatas of the government which if he breaks he cuts off the entail and power retreats to its qriginal this doctrine has the sanction of assent from natures universal parliament the voice of nations and the course of things allow that laws superior are to kings none but delinquents would have justice cease knaves rail at laws as soldiers rail at peace for justice is the end of government as reason is the test of argument no man was ever yet so void of sense as to debate the right of selfdefence a principle so grafted in the mind with nature born and does like nature bind twisted with reason and with nature too as neither one nor the other can undo nor can this right be less when national reason which governs one should govern all whatever the dialect of courts may tell he that his right demands can never rebel which right if it is by governors denied may be procured by force or foreign aid for tyrannys a nations term for grief as folks cry fire to hasten in relief and when the hated word is heard about all men should come to help the people out thus england groaned britannias voice was heard and great nassau to rescue her appeared called by the universal

hope for help from man would be too much mankind would always tell em of the dutch how they came here our freedoms to maintain were paid and cursed and hurried home again how by their aid we first dissolved our fears and then our helpers damned for foreigners it is not our english temper to do better for englishmen think every man their debtor it is worth observing that we never complained of foreigners nor of the wealth they gained till all their services were at an end wise men affirm it is the english way never to grumble till they come to pay and then they always think their temper such the work too little and the pay too much as frighted patients when they want a cure bid any price and any pain endure but when the doctors remedies appear the cures too easy and the price too dear great portland never was banterd when he strove for us his masters kindest thoughts to move we never lampoond his conduct when employed king jamess secret councils to divide then we caressed him as the only man which could the doubtful oracle explain the only hushai able to repel the dark designs of our achitophel compared his masters courage to his sense the ablest statesman and the bravest prince on his wise conduct we depended much and liked him never the worse for being dutch nor was he valued more than he deserved freely he ventured faithfully he served in all king williams dangers he has shared in englands quarrels always he appeared the revolution first and then the boyne  both his counsels and his conduct shine is martial valor flanders will confess and france regrets his managing the peace aithful to englands interest and her king he greatest reason of our murmuring en years in english service he appeared and gained his masters and the worlds regard t it is not englands custom to reward he wars are over england needs him not ow he is a dutchman and the lord knows what  schonbergh the ablest soldier of his age with great nassau did in our cause engage oth joined for englands rescue and defense the greatest captain and the greatest prince with what applause his stories did we tell ories which europes volumes largely swell we counted him an army in our aid where he commanded no man was afraid is actions with a constant conquest shine from villavitiosa to the rhine rance flanders germany his fame confess and all the world was fond of him but us ur turn first served we grudged him the command itness the grateful temper of the land we blame the k  that he relies too much n strangers germans hugonots and dutch and seldom does his great affairs of state o english counselors communicate he fact might very well be answered thus e has so often been betrayed by us e must have been a madman to rely n english g  ns fidelity or laying other arguments aside his thought might mortify our english pride that foreigners have faithfully obeyed him and none but englishmen have ever betrayed him they have our ships and merchants bought and sold and bartered english blood for foreign gold first to the french they sold our turkyfleet and injured talmarsh next at camaret the king himself is sheltered from their snares not by his merit but the crown he wears experience tells us it is the english way their benefactors always to betray and lest examples should be too remote a modern magistrate of famous note shall give you his own history by rote i will make it out deny it he that can his worship is a trueborn englishman in all the latitude that empty word by modern acceptations understood the parishbooks his great descent record and now he hopes ever long to be a lord and truly as things go it would be pity but such as he should represent the city while robbry for burntoffering he brings and gives to god what he has stole from kings great monuments of charity he raises and good st magnus whistles out his praises to citygoals he grants a jubilee and hires huzzas from his own mobilee lately he wore the golden chain and gown with which equipped he thus harangud the town his fine speech etc with clouted iron shoes and sheepskin breech more rags than manners and more dirt than rich from driving cows and calves to laytonmarket while of my greatness there appeared no spark yet behold i come to let you see the pride with which exalted beggars always ride born to the needful labors of the plow he cartwhip graced me as the chain does now nature and fate in doubt what course to take whether i should a lord or plough boy make indly at last resolved they would promote me and first a knave and then a knight they vote me that fate appointed nature did prepare and furnished me with an exceeding care o it me for what they designed to have me and every gift but honesty they gave me and thus equipt to this proud town i came  quest of bread and not in quest of fame ind to my future fate an humble boy ree from the guilt and glory i enjoy the hopes which my ambition entertained ere in the name of footboy all contained the greatest heights from small beginnings rise the gods were great on earth before they reached the skies b  well the generous temper of whose mind as always to be bountiful inclined hether by his ill fate or fancy led first took me up and furnished me with bread the little services he put me to eemd labors rather than were truly so ut always my advancement be designed or twas his very nature to be kind arge was his soul his temper ever free the best of masters and of men to me and i who was before decreed by fate o be made infamous as well as great with an obsequious diligence obeyed him ill trusted with his all and then betrayed him all his past kindnesses i trampled on uind his fortunes to erect my own o vipers in the bosom bred begin to hiss at that hand first which took them in with eager treachry i his fall pursued and my first trophies were ingratitude ingratitudes the worst of humane guilt the basest action mankind can commit which like the sin against the holy ghost has least of honor and of guilt the most distinguished from other crimes by this that it is a crime which no man will confess that sin alone which should not be forgiven on earth although perhaps it may in heaven thus my first benefactor i oerthrew and how should be to a second true the public trust came next into my care and i to use them scurvily prepare my needy sovereign lord i played upon and lent him many a thousand of his own for which great interests i took care to charge and so my illgot wealth became so large my predecessor judas was a fool fitter to have been whipped and sent to school than sell a savior had i been at hand his master had not been so cheap trepanned i would have made the eager jews have found for thirty pieces thirty thousand pound my cousin ziba of immortal fame  ziba and i shall never want a name firstborn of treason nobly did advance his masters fall for his inheritance by whose keen arts old david first began to break his sacred oath to jonathan the good old king it is thought was very loath to break his word and therefore br  ke his oath  zibas a traitor of some quality yet ziba might have been informed by me had i been there he never had been content with half the estate nor half the government in our late revolution twas thought strange that i of all mankind should like the change but they who wondered at it never knew that in it i did my old game pursue or had they heard of twenty thousand pound which never was lost nor never yet was found thus all things in their turn to sale i bring od and my master first and then the king ill by successful villainies made bold thought to turn the nation into gold and so to forg  ry my hand i bent ot doubting i could gull the government ut there was ruffld by the parliament and if i escaped the unhappy tree to climb it was want of law and not for want of crime but my the devil old friend who printed in my face  needful competence of english brass aving more business yet for me to do and loath to lose his trusty servant so managed the matter with such art and skill s saved his hero and threw out the b  l and now i am graced with unexpected honors or which i will certainly abuse the

just reward in print my panegyricks fill the street and hired gaolbirds their huzzas repeat some charities contrived to make a show have taught the needy rabble to do so whose empty noise is a mechanic fame since for sir beelzebub they would do the same the conclusion then let us boast of ancestors no more or deeds of heroes done in days of yore in latent records of the ages past behind the rear of time in long oblivion placed for if our virtues must in lines descend the merit with the families would end and intermixtures would most fatal grow for vice would be hereditary too the tainted blood would of necessity involuntary wickedness convey vice like ill nature for an age or two may seem a generation to pursue but virtue seldom does regard the breed fools do the wise and wise men fools succeed what is it to us what ancestors we had if good what better or what worse if bad amples are for imitation set et all men follow virtue with regret could but our ancestors retrieve their fate and see their offspring thus degenerate ow we contend for birth and names unknown and build on their past actions not our own heyd cancel records and their tombs deface and openly disown the vile degenerate race or fame of families is all a cheat it is personal virtue only makes us great finis a catalogue of poems etc printed and sold by h hill in blackfryars near the waterside where seven

the preface though these sheets have been wrote several months and in a time that seemed to make them something more suitable than now yet the occasion renewing it self every day who can refrain from speaking  had the scribbling world been pleased to leave me where they found me i had left them and newgate both together and as i am metaphorically dead had been effectually so as to satyrs and pamphlets  it is really something hard that after all the mortification they think they have put upon a poor abdicated author in their scurrilous street ribaldry and bear garden usage some in prose and some in those terrible lines they call verse they cannot yet be quiet but whenever any thing comes out that does not please them i come in for a share in the answer whatever i did in the question every thing they think an author deserves to be abused for must be mine  several plentiful showers of railery i have quietly submitted to an thought i had a talent of patience as large as might serve me in common with my neighbors but there is a time when a man can bear n longer and if the man is in a little passion he thinks he ought to b born with  i tried retirement and banished my self from the town i thought as the boys used to say twas but fair they should let me alone while did not meddle with them  but neither a country recess any more than a stone doublet on secure a man from the clamor of the pen  in the following sheets i endeavor to state the case in order to truce for shame gentlemen let him alone why the mans dead t a cowardly trick to beat a man when he is down but to fight a dea man is the devil  and with submission gentlemen the allegory is just for if beitied under sureties and penalties not to write at least not to write wh some people may not like be not equivalent to being dead as to the p i know not what is  but how do these people treat mankind that they pretend to indict man for every thing they please as if they had power to read his countenance in letters and swear to a style as they would to his face  it is easy to prove the authors of books and no man can be conceal in such cases but for a man to be charged with other mens faults w has too many of his own is a method newly practiced and more up me than any body and yet the grief of this usage does not stick so  upon me but that i may tell my antagonists if any think themselv deserving that name that they are very welcome to go on their own w and use me as they please i shall always be ready to reply or by mylence let them see i do not think it worth my while  an elegy on the author of the trueborn englishman satyr sing lachrime you are dead in law thy fatal hour draws on the lines of thine own exit draw and tell how you are undone end for the priest and ask advice reflect upon thy time misspent when wit upon its deathbd lies it is high time to repent what can thou say old pluto to appease hy hymns in that dark world will never please ilence eternal slence is thy lot and all thy rhymes and all thy hymns forgot uryd in dark oblivion there thou wilt lie or seven long years a wits eternity little thou thought in verses past those songs of thine would be thy last it is hard thy vigorous muse should lie  all her strength of thought condemned to dye it is hard to have her perish in her prime and most men think she died before her time with patience satyr to thy fate submit and show thy courage can outdo thy wit with calmness meet the sentence of thy death and yield with temper thy poetic breath that though to silence they condemn thy rhymes en that silence shall condemn the times the world shall blush when ever they read and thou be still a satyr though you are dead when malefactors come to dye they claim uncommon liberty freedom of speech gives no distaste hey let them talk at large because they talk their last it is hard thy dying words should give offense and neither please in language nor in sense he that must never open more dearly attones for what he said before departed satyr let thy ghost appear to keep the vicious town in fear verses shall from thy injured ashes rise and satyrs always pointed at their vice no man shall sin in peace and virtue only shall thy shade appease but since dear satyr it is thy lot thus to dye upon the spot in softest notes sing thine own elegy be silent dead but never silent dye the elegy circled in newgates cold embrace and reconciled to death by such a place i from the horrid mansion fled and as concerning poetry am dead to seven long years of silence i betake perhaps by then i may forget to speak and thus i died and yield satyrick breath for to be dumb in poetry is death if you demand a reason of my fate whether it came too soon or came too late whether wise heaven did this permit for want of manners or else for want of wit whether i said too little or too much or loaded any with too just reproach if you would know the latent cause go search the hidden secret in the laws let not my verse my verses crimes debate go ask the powerful engines of the state besides he must be void of sense who dare stand up in my defense behold that power which men call law can keep even innocence in awe let it suffice this elegy to read and though you see the man all his poetic fancys dead nothing but carcass can remain the shadow of the poet may appear no substance can be there a walking spectrum with his fancy fled and he that raised the devil the devil has laid yet i have reason to complain i can not quiet in my grave remain the worlds disturbed about my memory they will neither let me live nor let me dye if an illnatured muse attempts the nation to abuse if some unhappy truths they tell which might have been concealed as well my ghosts arraigned and i am said ready to be risen from the dead the mob of wretched writers stand with storms of wit in every hand hey bait my memory in the street and charge me with the credit of their wit i bear the scandal of their crimes y names the hackney title of the times  some new wit in satyr lies concealed and lately in lampoon revealed y silent ashes are disturbed to know whether it is dated from below whether it is mine or no  some in pasquinades affront the state d tempt their yet unpitied fate  willing to be cautious till too late e subtle mimicks to this shadow fly conceal their guilt and say it is i  man can satyrize a man of fame t daily curses rise against my name mn song lampoon ballad and pasquinade my recent memory invade  muse must be the whore of poetry d all apollos bastards laid to me if any poet has but writ with an exuberance of spite s he the mighty vices of the age d mighty men too brought upon the stage as who can with his pen forbear  dress the s  s m  n in the robes they are fond to wear ey search the deep recesses of my grave en to hear the sleeping genius rave such is the folly of their hate at death cannot their jealousies abate such is the force of guilt they see h reason to expect reproach from me their fancy harbors the mistake eam in death and send my ghost to speak yet undisturbed i safely sleep and calm as death my silence keep gh at all the anger of mankind  loath to bear the t  my pen confined  smile at human policy o always stop that mouth whose words they cannot deny yet let them not their crimes conceal new satyrs will their crimes reveal more poets from my monument shall rise who shall like me their power despise who shall condemn a vicious court and make the nations knaves the nations sport naked as natures first original vice shall before the bar of truth appear keen satyrs shall to judgment call and power shall not protect them there satyr shall mighty crimes rehearse no rogues above the quality of verse satyr shall keep those knaves in awe who are too cunning for the law and shall at least expose the cheat of those that think themselves too great fleets shall not spend a seventeen months advance to take the air upon the coast of france no sham descents shall ever be made the money spent and majesty betrayed but lasting verse shall make the matter clear and what the nation feels the world shall hear nor will there ever be wanting to this age poets to spread their errors on the stage oppression makes a poet spleen endites and makes men write by force as g  n fights was ever such broken voyages made was ever war so much a trade if fleets to italy shall go and hardly tell the foe whether they have been there or no come back to let us know the monys spent and hardly knew for what they went the nation never can want a poet long to turn such juggling into song when traitors creep into the affairs of state poets will always prophecy their fate when villains serve the queen by halves and fleece the nation to enrich themselves her majesty may strive in vain make peace with portugal and war with spain fit armies out send fleets to sea the monys all but thrown away unless the heroes who command would learn to do as well as understand when the new leagues with portugal appear all honest men rejoice ut had they been secured before the war t had been at half the price had not the nation been betrayed isbon had long ago embraced madrid he bourbon laurels had abandoned spain and anjous triumphs been in vain were i alive again and could but hear he hopes we have of this algarvian war my satyr could no more forbear o pay the due to williams character he early measures of this war he laid but twas his fate to be betrayed e formed the league the queen has now retrieved and had he been believed he queen had not been now embroiled with spain and forced to purchase portugal again ain had long since an austrian monarch known d rightful princes had possessed their own if some bold satyr does not soon revive  let them know that poetrys alive  we must always be embraced by knaves and all the nations work be done by halves  every year endeavoring to be poor  always mending what we marred before ave always something to retrieve and always doing something to deceive vast navies fitted out to fight a foe that is always out of fight and yet the french in flying squadrons reign sult our trade and bully all the main and bravely dare our ships to fight in vain if our sea captains when they run away shall only forfeit three months pay if no new genius rises up to show and let the injured nation know by whom they are thus betrayed and how  fear in spite of all that has been said shall be forced to speak although i am dead ean while let mercenary poets strive o make their malice my decease outlive let them reproach my memory and write for now they are sure of no reply et them their trueborn english temper show en in distress are always treated so et them with wretched satyrs glut the town xpose my morals and forget their own this shall my quiet never discompose contempts a cure which present help bestows silence shall answer their reproach for silence is a debt to such but if some satyrs shall assault my hearse and raise my frighted ghost with their more frightful verse let such revengeful wretches understand i will answer when they will satisfy my bond if they my pledges will defend i will from this grave arise i will reassume my satyrs and leave off those elegies the world shall have their errors plainly shown i will blast their vices and reform my own of all the men that ever died before mine is the severest case the grave till now was always taken for a place of peace but i as if some secret power i had give bond to be at quiet when i am dead my enemies are not content to kill but take security that i will lie still jealous it seems my busy head should make me talk when i am dead here is all the reason i can make them give that though the poets dead the mans alive to which as gravely i have said that though the mans alive the poets dead he is bad indeed who when he dies has none to mourn his obsequies and of the virtuous find me one but some rejoices when he is gone so i have mourners who lament my verse and some triumph upon the satyrs hearse some think i die without a crime some like my fate and think twas time but this just calculation i can make and there i think i cannot mistake the wise and virtuous sorrows tribute pay and vice alone keeps holy day this does my judgment satisfy for so would every wise man die so let the censure of my works be past so let me die when i must die my last let wise mens sorrow be my choice and let the knaves and fools rejoice it is true there is some reason in the case vice now has room to show her face or now my walking ghost is laid the grand contagion may the nation spread reproofs may cease and all men be as wicked as they please cities may magistrates elect that may the crimes they practice there protect that all their d  men may outswear and with exalted drunkness grace the chair no more departed satyr can reproach no more the crimes or persons touch s  may blast the root from whence he came and load his family with pride and shame the high exalted wretch untouched may live ide in his coach and make his father drive and lest his insolence should ever fail as laid his own progenitor in jail let future poets blame the law that keeps less villains more in awe ut suffers such a wretch to brave the state and sin above the reach of magistrate my satyr silenced by the times ill cease to check the most unnatural crimes degenerate m  may now disown is mothers sense in hopes to show his own ut sure the devil must be in the cheer o tell him he could make it pass for wit and make him prove with such excessive pains is want of manners by his want of brains he young unnatural fop has strove too long ith empty head and inconsistent tongue nature to make amends for want of sense as thronged his head with clear impertinence is gay outsides a satyr on the fair and let us know what is most obliging there the ladies who in beaus delight ake shift by day so they are but pleased at night the charms which please a vicious bed lie somewhere else than in the head and if the suited blockheads parts will hit they will always bear with want of wit is own dear jest he labors to enjoy and studies how to live and die a boy nature that left the unfinished fop too soon st lent him sense enough to be undone and now he keeps a mighty pother and for hereditary wit indicts his mother rails that he is of his brains bereft and yet pretends that she has little left bedlam some title to him had but fools they say are never mad were not my satyr lately dead his juster character should here be read mean time would but his mother take advice the vile unnatural monster to despise nature the viperous wretch would soon discard and in his vices show him his reward g  may his weighty sense prepare g  s an elbow of the city chair he boasts himself the churches chief support i think the church her self should thank him for it though most suppose his notions were but wild to fetch the jew to gospellize his child the hebrew rake from synagogue dismissed came in to circumcise the feast and made the godfather but spoiled the jest some say twas looked upon as a reproach and interloping on the church but others say the jew was rathet a better christian than the d  father and all agree the babe well taught may be the best of all the three let the uncircumsised alone the israelite and he are much at one both their religions now they show the hebrew christian and the christian jew some say my former satyrs show the ebb of vicious characters run low but if they will please to think again they will find i never tythd the men nor never thronged my verse with one in ten why else should s and t escape this for his parricide that his incestuous rape how came prodigious d  to be unnamd for crimes unheard of lately famed of all the beaus and brutes that crowd the town my modest satyr chose but one and he to all men but himself unknown i never touched great m  whose follies have not been a few nor told the world of half the crimes which a fine house can harbor from the times l  and w  t in spite of me ave been as lewd as r  and d  i spared them for their modesty because their vice was something new and made one whore between them serve the two old lying b  never met with my reproof though he gave always room enough my satyr strove to whet her pen against the crimes and spared the men but now the fashion of the times makes poets damn the men without the crimes if i have been too backward here to make the vices of the times appear if ever i come to rise again i will make ye all amends and name the men young s  t shall not the house of god debauch and meet with neither censure nor reproach if ever my satyr should revive they shall reform or be ashamed to live but now my sleeping satyr quits the stage and leaves untouched the vicious age the eager rakes may unreprovd sin on there is time enough to be undone no more my satyr shall those follies touch no more the crimes no more the men reproach m  may hug the shortest way and for its execution pray next to the sacred books he placed the scheme and loved the practice better than the theme he always for his sovereign prayed but twas to have her be a tyrant made to have her dip her hands in blood and ruin all the nation for their good but when the hairbrained zealot found the plot lay deeper under ground when he first felt the satyr bite and found twas writ to expose and not excite he changed his ecclesiastic look and damned the author though he loved the book my satyr has the hardest fate her books the contradiction of the state riddle aenigma double speech dark answers doubtful scriptures which puzzle the poor and pose the rich are plain explicit things to these who punish authors when the subjects please nothing but this can such dark steps explain they like the doctrine but they hate the man grave authors now may write essays that with one face look several ways of peace at home and war abroad and damn the subject which they would applaud banter the queen with dedications and call that peace which will embroil three nations s  may new harangues endite to set conformity in clearer light learned quotations bring by rote wise as the nations he thought fit to quote whose laws he knew but had their names forgot twas his strong forecast which foresaw to damn dissenting by a law would make our fatal quarrel cease and bring the nations all to peace ye sons of vice advance your wit it is now your turn to reign satyrs subdued and must submit and never like to raise again my fate will dictate to the rest in me they know how they shall be oppressed my doom will learn em to be wise and never attempt impossibilities the magistrate may now be lewd the saucy satyr shall no more intrude a vicious clergy may the church supply debauch the gown and give their text the lie smother their morals in the vine and prove the bottles origin divine religion may be in a blanket tossed from hand to hand till it is as good as lost till fate restore some justice to the times satyr shall leave em to grow old in crimes atheists may unmolested now blaspheme slight human power and banter the supreme allmighty drunkenness bear imperial sway and mankind be debauched the shortest way the poor alone find in their crimes their fate and mock the duty of the magistrate they suffer for the crimes the rich commit for want of money not for want of wit guilt may in splendour through the city ride with all the court of elders by her side those true reformers need not fear a silent satyr can do nothing here their sham of reformation they may print with much of canting nonsense in it cajole the people to believe they care what lewder scenes are drawn in smithfield fair for having damned profaneness first then they proclaim the fair and bid them do their worst in grand procession to the place they go was ever god almighty banterd so let em go on absurdly act first vice condemn then vice protect my buried satyr can no more reprove leave them to justice from above refer them to their orders for the fair profaneness sinks beneath the city chair but raised by proclamation lives again and every booths a libel on the men yet let young poets reverence the chair or gods vicegerents deputy sits there with annual pomp and majesty enthroned but how does vice connived his seat surround what though no personal crimes there could appear to soil the brightness of his character his weak pursuit of vice the law defeats for negatives are crimes in magistrates yet from my ghost take this prophetic curse the next the city chooses shall be worse let em expect those days to come when vice shall be embraced and satyr dumb my verse beneath this tomb contented lies eproofs a blessing none but fools despise and they that hate it never will be wise ye men of might and muckle power who rule mankind and all mankind devour f you would have my quiet ghost remain locked in the laws too mighty chain obey the nations interest and your own learn to protect and not betray the throne witness ye powers i promise now for ever sacred be the vow as long as magistrates forbear in crimes they punish to appear while parsons cease to drink and whore p  s to be proud debauched and poor while lawyers cease to talk mankind to death and murder men with mercenary breath while c  rs promises regard and princes men of faith reward my satyr shall in quiet sleep her sentenced silence keep withold her rage no more disturb the age no more the mighty vices of the mighty men engage when soldiers hasten to dispatch the war their countrys service to their pay prefer cease to give thanks for victory when they fly and give almighty truth the lie as long as navies fleets and men come shattered home and hasten out again while they protect our trade defend our coast and bravely fight what ever it cost while actions good or ill have due regard the coward punishment the brave reward while all our publicans are just and faithfully discharge the peoples trust receivers due accounts give in and duly pay it out again while needful charges are defraid the navy manned as well as paid and no commission officers presume to take the nations pay and stay at home when ever these happy articles appear therell be no business for a satyr here i may lie still without security there can be no occasion then for me i shall have nothing left to say for this would stop my mouth the shortest way i was in hopes with this poetic death slander would die and let me take some breath but envy never sleeps report begins to charge my memory with my neighbors sins as if they had not known i have too many of my own they tell me how the party did combine to bear my charges and to pay my fine malice is always retrograde to sense and judges things without their consequence willing her mischievous intent to show she always goes too fast or else too slow they that this empty notion raised not me but all the party satyrizd since all men that know how to judge by rules know that the men they mean were never fools and their worst enemies would never try to brand them with the blame of generosity but to remove this modern doubt ll give five hundred pound they will make it out thus like old strephens virtuous miss who foolishly too coy died with the scandal of a whore and never knew the joy so i by whigs abandoned bear the satyrs unjust lash dye with the scandal of their help but never saw their cash no man of crime that suffered death was ever used like me n thefts and treasons rapes and blood all men have leave to die no sentence sure was half so hard as mine that could not die till i had paid my fine methinks to make me poor had been enough for when they had my pelf perhaps if they had given me time i might have hanged my self but this and i should think they needs must know it s not the shortest way to kill a poet in vain they spend their time and breath to make me starve and die a poets death butlers garret i shall never appear neither his merit nor his fate i fear heavens keep me but from bullet sword and gun i am not afraid of being undone m satisfied it never shall be said but he that gave me brains will give me bread some people ask if i was fairly stain though i think not i shall not complain till i have slept my time and rise again but they that are concerned at this are freely left to guess why i am doomed to write no more f something want too true i wrote before why should they thus deny to let me write my truer history why seven long years of silence now impose f i had nothing to disclose nothing to make appear nothing to say they cannot bear to hear but it is enough i lost my life by law and still by rules am kept in awe the manner all exact and regular whatever the consequences are never demand if it were just for if the forms are right the matter must law is a great machine of state with hooks and screws to make it operate which as they are wound up by art with ease perform the fatal part exactly answer to the workmans skill this way twill work to save or that to kill crime in this management has no concern no man can right from wrong discern the movement is so subtle and so sure and does such certain fate procure the mathematics are in vain defensive study useless must remain this monster whom it pleases will devour for law is but a heathen word for power a metaphor invented to confess the methods by which men oppress by which with safety they destroy mankind while justice stands before and fraud behind thousands of little wheels and unseen parts of perjured promises and wheedling arts this mighty thing compose and no man half its crooked turnings knows the wild meanders none can trace nor no man knows it by its face it learns to change with every turn of times and rings the tune it is set to like the chimes it is by this engine i thought fit to die and so has many a wiser man than i and by their broken promises betrayed satyr is thus upon its deathbed laid if ever i come to life again coleman for that i will put no faith in man i that did on fair quarter yield laid down my arms and left the field did from my own defense withdraw thinking that honesty was law have lost my rhiming life by this deceit and i deserve it for my want of wit had i remembered days of yore when we complained of arbitrary power when lawyers were the tools of state and hurried men to hasty fate when the great engine was screwed up too high and men were hanged they knew not why had i remembered scroggs fame and known that lawyers are in every reign the same i never had ventured to believe men whose professions to deceive memento mori here i stand with silent lips but speaking hand a walking shadow of a poet but bound to hold my tongue and never show it a monument of injury a sacrifice to legal t  y i beckon to mankind to have a care and pointing tell how i was lost and where i show the dangerous shore where i have suffered shipwreck just before if among poets there remains a fool that scorns to take this notice for a rule but ventures the fidelity of those whose trade and custom it is to l  let men no pity to him show let him to bedlam not to newgate go the storm an essay i am told for we have news among the dead heaven lately spoke but few knew what it said the voice in loudest tempests spoke and storms which natures strong foundation shook felt it hither and i would have you know eard the voice and knew the language too think it not strange i heard it here  place is so remote but when he speaks they hear besides though i am dead in fame i never told you where i am though i have lost poetic breath i am not in perfect state of death m whence this popish consequence i draw i am in the limbus of the law  me be where i will i heard the storm m every blast it echoed thus reform t the mighty shock and saw the night hen guilt looked pale and owned he fright and every time the raging element ok londons lofty towers at every rent e falling timbers gave they cried repent i saw when all the stormy crew newly commissioned from on high newly instructed what to do in lowering cloudy troops drew nigh they hovered over the guilty land as if they had been backward to obey as if they wondered at the sad command and pitied those those they should destroy but heaven that long had gentler methods tried and saw those gentler methods all defied had now resolved to be obeyed the queen an emblem of the soft still voice had told the nation how to make their choice told them the only way to happiness was by the blessed door of peace but the unhappy genius of the land deaf to the blessing as to the command scorn to the high caution and contemn the news and all the blessed thoughts of peace refuse since storms are then the nations choice be storms their portion said the heavenly voice he said and i could hear no more so soon the obedient troops began to roar so soon the blackning clouds drew near and filled with loudest storms the trembling air i thought i felt the worlds foundation shake and looked when all the wondrous frame would break i trembled as the winds grew high and so did many a braver man than i for he whose valor scorns his sense has changed his courage into impudence man may to man his valor show and it is his virtue to do so but if he is of his maker nor afraid he is not courageous then but mad soon as i heard the horrid blast and understood how long twould last viewed all the fury of the element considered well by whom twas sent and unto whom for punishment it brought my hero to my mind william the glorious great and good and kind short epithets to his just memory the first he was to all the world the last to me the mighty genius to my thought appeared just in the same concern he used to show when private tempests used to blow storms which the monarch more than death or battle feared hen party fury shook his throne d made their mighty malice known i have heard the sighing monarch say the public peace so near him lay it took the pleasure of his crown away it filled with cares his royal breast ten he has those cares prophetickly expressed that when he should the reins let go aven would some token of its anger show to let the thankless nation see w they despised their own felicity this robbed the hero of his rest sturbd the calm of his serener breast when to the queen his scepter he resigned with a resolved and steady mind o he rejoiced to lay the trifle down  pitied her to whom he left the crown foreseeing long and vigorous wars reseeing endless private party jarrs would always interrupt her rest d fill with anxious cares her royal breast for storms of court ambition rage as high almost as tempests in the sky could i my hasty doom retrieve d once more in the land of poets live i would now the men of flags and fortune greet and write an elegy upon the fleet st those that on the shore were idly found whom other fate protects while better men were drowned ey may thank god for being knaves on shore t sure the q  will never trust them more they who rid out the storm and lived t saw not whence it was derived sless of danger or the mighty hand at could to cease as well as blow command let such unthinking creatures have a care for some worse end prepare let them look out for some such day hen what the sea would not the gallows may ose that in former dangers shunned the fight  met their ends in this disastrous night have left this caution though too late that all events are known to fate wards avoid no danger when they run d cowards scapes the death it would not shun the nonsense from our fate to fly men must once have heart enough to die those sons of plunder are below my pen because they are below the names of men who from the shores presenting to their eyes the fatal goodwin where the wreck of navies lies a thousand dying saylors talking to the skies from the sad shores they saw the wretches walk by signals of distress they talk there with one tide of life they are vexed for all were sure to die the next the barbarous shores with men and boats abound the men more barbarous than the shores are found off to the shattered ships they go and for the floating purchase row they spare no hazard or no pain but it is to save the goods and not the men within the sinking supplaints reach appear as if they would mock their dying fear then for some trifle all their hopes supplant with cruelty would make a turk relent if i had any satyr left to write could i with suited spleen indite my vrse should blast that fatal town and drowned saylors widows pull it down no footsteps of it should appear and ships no more cast anchor there the barbarous hated name of deal should die or be a term of infamy and till that is done the town will stand a just reproach to all the land the ships come next to be my theme the mens the loss i am not concerned for them for had they perished ever they went where to no purpose they were sent the ships might have been built again and we had saved the money and the men there the mighty wrecks appear hic jacent useless things of war graves of men and tools of state there you lie too soon there you lie too late but o ye mighty ships of war what in winter did you there wild november should our ships restore to chatham portsmouth and the nore so it was always heretofore for heaven it self is not unkind if winter storms he will sometimes send since it is supposed the men of war are all laid up and left secure nor did our navy feel alone the dreadful desolation it shook the walls of flesh as well as stone and ruffld all the nation the universal fright made guilty h  expect his fatal night his hardened soul began to doubt and storms grew high within as they grew high without flaming meteors filled the air but asgil missed his fiery chariot there recalled his black blaspheming breath and trembling paid his homage unto death terror appeared in every face even vile blackbourn felt some shocks of grace began to feel the hated truth appear began to fear after he had burlesqud a god so long he should at last be in the wrong some power he plainly saw and seeing felt a strange unusual awe some secret hand he plainly found was bringing some strange thing to pass and he that neither god nor devil owned must needs be at a loss to guess fain he would not have guest the worst but guilt will always be with terror cursed hell shook for devils dread almighty power at every shock they feared the fatal hour the adamantine pillars moved and satans pandemonium trembled too the tottering seraphs wildly roved doubtful what the almighty meant to do for in the darkest of the black abode there is not a devil but believes a god old lucifer has sometimes tried to have himself be deifyd but devil nor men the being of god denied till men of late found out new ways to sin and turned the devil out to let the atheist in but when the mighty element began and storms the weighty truth explain almighty power upon the whirlwind rode and every blast proclaimed aloud there is there is there is a god plague famine pestilence and war are in their causes seen the true originals appear before the effects begin but storms and tempests are above our rules here our philosophers are fools the stagyrite himself could never show from whence nor how they blow it is all sublime it is all a mystery they see no manner how nor reason why all sovereign being is the amazing theme it is all resolved to power supreme from this first cause our tempest came and let the atheists spite of sense blaspheme they can no room for banter find till they produce another father for the wind satyr thy sense of sovereign being declare he made the mighty prince of the air and devils recognize him by their fear ancient as time and elder than the light ever the first day or antecedent night ever matter into settled form became and long before existence had a name before the expance of indigested space while the vast no where filled the room of place lived the first cause the first great where and why existing to and from eternity of his great self and of necessity this i call god that one great word of fear at whose great sound when from his mighty breath it is ecchosd round nature pays homage with a trembling bow and conscious men would faintly disallow the secret trepidation racks the soul and while he says no god replies thou fool but call it what we will first being it had does space and substance fill eternal selfexisting power enjoyed and whatsoever is so that same is god if then it should fall out as who can tell but that there is a heaven and hell mankind had best consider well for fear t should be too late when their mistakes appear such may in vain reform unless they do it before another storm they tell us scotland escaped the blast no nation else have been without a taste all europe sure have felt the mighty shock t has been a universal stroke but heaven has other ways to plague the scots as poverty and plots her majesty confirms it what she said i plainly heard it though i am dead the dangerous so and has raised me from my sleep i can no longer silence keep here satyrs thy deliverance a plot in scotland hatched in france and liberty the old pretense prelatick power with popish join the queens just government to undermine this is enough to wake the dead the calls too loud it never shall be said the lazy satyr slept too long when all the nations danger claimed his song rise satyr from thy sleep of legal death and reassume satyrick breath what though to seven years sleep thou art confined thou well may wake with such a wind such blasts as these can seldom blow but they are both formed above and heard below then wake and warn us now the storms are past lest heaven return with a severer blast wake and inform mankind of storms that still remain behind if from this grave thou lift thy head they will surely mind one risen from the dead though moses and the prophets cannot prevail a speaking satyr cannot fail tell em while secret discontents appear therell never be peace and union here they that for trifles so contend have something farther in their end but let those hasty people know the storms above reprove the storms below and it is too often known that storms below do storms above forerun they say this was a highchurch storm sent out the nation to reform but the emblem left the moral in the lurch for it blew the steeple down upon the church from whence we now inform the people the danger of the church is from the steeple and we have had many a bitter stroke from pinnacle and weathercock from whence the learned do relate that to secure the church and state the time will come when all the town to save the church will pull the steeple down two tempests are blown over now prepare for storm of treason and intestine war the highchurch fury to the north extends in haste to ruin all their friends occasional conforming led the way and now occasional rebellion comes in play to let the wondering nation know that highchurch honestys an empty show a phantosm of delusive air that as occasion serves can disappear and loyaltys a senseless phrase an empty nothing which our interest sways and as that suffers this decays who dare the dangerous secret tell that churchmen can rebel faction we thought was by the whigs engrossed and forty one was banterd till the jest was lost bothwel and pentlandhills were famed and gillycranky hardly named if living poets dare not speak we that are dead must silence break and boldly let them know the times at hand when ecclesiastic tempests shake the land prelatick treason from the crown divides and now rebellion changes sides their volumes with their loyalty may swell but in their turns too they rebel can plot contrive assassinate and spite of passive laws disturb the state let fair pretenses fill the mouths of men no fair pretense shall blind my pen they that in such a reign as this rebel must needs be in confederacy with hell oppressions tyranny and pride may give some reason to divide but where the laws with open justice rule he that rebels must be both knave and fool may heaven the growing mischief soon prevent and traitors meet reward in punishment finis a hymn to the pillory  london printed

sort i shall be sure of an h party and in all probability of the best judges for the least ccernd are commonly the least corrupt and i confess i have laid for those by relating the satyr where justice would allow it from carying too sharp an edge they who can criticize so weakly as to imgine i have done my worst may be convinced at their own cost that can write severely with more ease than i can gently i have but laugh at some mens follies when i could have declaimed against their vice and other mens virtues i have commended as freely as i have taxed the crimes and now if you are a malicious reader i expect you should turn upon me that i affect to be thought more impartial than i am b if men are not to be judged by their professions god forgive you commwealthsmen for professing so plausible for the government you ca be so unconscionable as to charge me for not subscribing of my name  that would reflect too grossly upon your own party who never dare then they have the advantage of a jury to secure them if you like not poem the fault may possibly by in my writing though it is hard an author to judge against himself but more probably it is in y morals which cannot bear the truth of it the violent on both si will condemn the character of absalom as either too favorably or ardly drawn but they are not the violent whom i desire to please he fault on the right hand is to extenuate palliate and indulge d to confess freely i have endeavored to commit it besides the resct which i owe his birth i have a greater for his heroic virtues d david himself could not be more tender of the young mans life an i would be of his reputation but since the most excellent natures e almost the most easy and as being such are the soonest perverted  ill counsels especially when baited with fame and glory it is no ore a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of achitophel than was for adam not to have resisted the two devils the serpent and the oman the conclusion of the story i purposely forbore to prosecute cause i could not obtain from my self to show absalom unfortunate e frame of it was cut out but for a picture to the waste and if  draught be so far true it is as much as i designed  were i the inventor who am only the historian i should certainly nclude the piece with the reconcilement of absalom to david and ho knows but this may come to pass things were not brought to an xtremity where i left the story there seems yet to be room left for a mposure hereafter there may be only be for pity i have not so ch as an uncharitable wish against achitophel but am content to be cusd of a good natured error and to hope with origin that the vil himself may at last be saved for which reason in this poem  is neither brought to set his house in order nor to dispose of his person terwards as he in wisdom shall think fit god is infinitely merciful d his vicegerent is only not so because he is not infinite  the true end of satyr is the amendment of vices by correction and  who writes honestly is no more an enemy to the offender than the hysician to the patient when he prescribes harsh remedies to an inverate disease for those are only in order to prevent the chyrurgeons rk of an ense rescindendum which i wish not to my very enemies to nclude all if the body politic have any analogy to the natural  my weak judgment an act of oblivion were as necessary

ungrateful to the tillers care not so the rest for several mothers bore to godlike david several sons before but since like slaves his bed they did ascend no true succession could their seed attend of all the numerous progeny was none so beautiful so brave as absalom whether inspired by some diviner lust his father got him with a greater gust or that his conscious destiny made way by manly beauty to imperial sway early in foreign fields be won renown with kings and states allied to israels crown in peace the thoughts of war he could remove and seemed as he were only born for love what ever he did was done with so much ease in him alone twas natural to please his motions all accompanied with grace and paradise was opened in his face with secret joy indulgent david viewed his youthful image in his son renewed to all his wishes nothing he denied and made the charming annabel his bride what faults he had for who from faults is free his father could not or he would not see some warm excesses which the law forbore were constind youth that purged by boiling over and amnons mother by a specious name was called a just revenge for injured fame thus praised and loved the noble youth

taste such savry deities must needs be good as served at once for worship and for food by force they could not introduce these gods for ten to one in former days was odds so fraud was used the

because the fleece accompanies the flock some thought they gods anointed meant to slay by guns invented since full many a day our author swears it not but who can know how far the devil and jebusites may go this plot which failed for want of common sense had yet a deep and dangerous consequence for as when raging fevers boil the blood the standing lakes soon floats into a flood and every hostile

might have claimed a throne and blessed all other countries but his own but charming greatness since so few refuse it is juster to lament him than accuse strong were his hopes a rival to remove with blandishments to gain the public love to head the faction while their zeal was hot and popularly prosecute the plot to further this achitophel unites the malcontents of all the israelites whose differing parties he could wisely join for several ends to serve the same design the best and of the princes some were such who thought the power of monarchy too much mistaken men and patriots in their hearts not wicked but seduced by impious arts by these the springs of property were bent and wound so high they cracked the government the next for interest sought to embroil the state to sell their duty at a dearer rate and make their jewish markets of the throne pretending public good to serve their own others thought kings and useless heavy load who cost too much and did too little good these were for laying honest david by on principles of pure good husbandry with them joined all the haranguers of the throng that thought to get preferment by the tongue who follow next a double danger bring not only hating david but the king the solymaean rout well versed of old in godly faction and in treason bold cowring and quaking at a conqurors sword but lofty to a lawful prince restored saw with disdain an ethnic plot begun and scorned by jebusites to be outdone hot levites headed these who pulled before from the ark which in the judges days they bore resumed their cant and with a zealous cry pursued their old beloved theocracy where sanhedrin and priest enslaved the nation and justified their spoils by inspiration for who so fit for reign as aarons race if once dominion they could found in grace these led the pack though not of surest scent yet deepest mouthed against the government a numerous host of dreaming saints succeed of the true old enthusiastic breed against form and order they their power employ nothing to build and all things to destroy but far more numerous was the herd of such who think too little and who talk too much these out of more instinct they knew not why adored their fathers god and property and by the same blind benefit of fate the devil and the jebusite did hate born to be saved even in their own despite because they could not help believing right such were the tools but a whole hydra more remains of sprouting heads too long to score some of their chiefs were princes of the land in the first rank of these did zimri stand a man so various that he seemed to be not one but all mankinds epitome stiff in opinions always in the wrong was every thing by starts and nothihg long but in the course of one revolving moon was chemist fiddler statesman and buffoon then all for women painting rhiming drinking besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking blessed madman who could every hour employ with something new to wish or to enjoy railing and praising were his usual themes and both to show his judgment in extremes o over violent or over civil that every man with him was god or devil in squandering wealth was his peculiar art nothing went unrewarded but desert eggard by fools whom still he found too late le had his jest and they had his estate e laughed himself from court then sought relief y forming parties but could never be chief or spite of him the weight or business fell on absalom and wise achitophel thus wicked but in will of means bereft e left not faction but of that was left  titles and names twere tedious to rehearse of lords below the dignity of verse its warriors commonwealths men were the best and husbands and mere nobles all the rest and therefore in the name of dullness be the well hung

worse the wretch whose heavens anointed dared to curse shimei whose youth did early promise bring of zeal to god and hatred to his king did wisely from expensive sins refrain and never broke the sabbath but for gain nor ever was he known an oath to vent or curse unless against the government thus heaping wealth by the most ready way among the jews which was to cheat and pray the city to reward his pious hate against his master chose him magistrate his hand a vare of justice did uphold his neck was loaded with a chain of gold during his office treason was no crime the sons of belial had a glorious time for shimei though not prodigal of pelf yet loved his wicked neighbor as himself when two or three were gathered to declaim against the monarch of jerusalem shimei was always in the midst of them and if they cursed the king when he was by would rather curse than break good company if any durst his factious friends accuse he pact a jury of dissenting jews whose fellowfeeling in the godly cause would free the suffering saint from humane laws for laws are only made to punish those who serve the king and to protect his foes if any leisure time he had from power because it is sin to misemploy an hour his business was by writing to persuade that kings were useless and a clog to trade and that his noble style he might refine no rechabite more shunned the fumes of wine chaste

with that he wiped his eyes it is all the aid my present power supplies no courtinformer can these arms accuse these arms may sons against their fathers use and it is my wish the next successors reign may make no other israelite complain youth beauty graceful action seldom fail but common interest always will prevail and pity never ceases to be shown to him who makes the peoples wrongs his own the crowd that still believe their kings oppress with lifted hands their young messiah bless who now begins his progress to ordain with chariots horsemen and a numerous train from east to west his glories he displays and like the sun the promised land surveys ame runs before him as the morning star and shouts of joy salute him from afar ach house receives him as a guardian god and consecrates the place of his abode but hospitable treats did most commend wise issachar his wealthy western friend this moving court that caught the peoples eyes and seemed but pomp did other ends disguise achitophel had formed it with intent to sound the dephts and fathom where it went the peoples hearts distinguish friends from foes and try their strength before they came to blows yet all was colored with a smooth pretense of specious love and duty to their prince religion and redress of grievences two names that always cheat and always pleases are often urged and good king davids life endangered by a brother and a wife thus in a pageant show a plot is made and peace it self is war in mesquerade oh foolish israel never warned by ill ill the same bait and circumvented still d ever men forsake their present ease o midst of health imagine a disease ake pains contingent mischiefs to foresee take heirs for monarchs and for god decree what shall we think can people give away uch for themselves and sons their native sway hen they are left defenseless to the sword f each unbounded arbitrary lord and laws are vain by which we right enjoy if kings unquestioned can those laws destroy yet if the crowd be judge of fit and just and kings are only officers in trust then this resuming covenant was declared when kings were made or is for ever barred if those who gave the scepter could not tie by their own deed their own posterity how then could adam bind his future race how could his forfeit on mankind take place or how could heavenly justice damn us all who never consented to our fathers fall then kings are slaves to those whom they command and tenants to their peoples pleasure stand add that the power for property allowed is mischievously seated in the crowd for who can be secure of private right if sovereign sway may be dissolved by might nor is the peoples judgment always true the most may err as grossly as the few and faultless kings run down by common cry for vice oppression and for tyranny what standard is there in a fickle rout which flowing to the mark runs faster out nor only crowds but sanhedrins may be infected with this public lunacy and share the madness of rebellious times to murder monarchs for imagined crimes if they may give and take whenever they please not kings alone the god head images but government it self at length must fall to natures state where all have right to all yet grant our lords the people kings can make what prudent men a settled throne would shake for whatsoever their sufferings were before that change they covet makes them suffer more all others errors but disturb a state but innovation is the blow of fate if ancient fabrics nod and threat to fall to patch the flaws and buttress of the wall thus far it is duty but here fix the mark for all

when he saw his men give ground away he basely run and left these children all alone as babes wanting relief and long they wandered up and down no hopes to cheer their grief thus hand in hand they walked till at last this wood they spied and when they say the night grow dark they here lay down and cried at this the duke was inly moved his breast soft pity beat and so he streightway ordered his men for to retreat and now but that my pen is blunt i might with ease relate how fifteen thousand french were took besides what found their fate nor should the prince of hanover in silence be forgot who like a lion fought on foot after his horse was shot and what strange chance likewise befell unto these children dear but that your patience is too much already tired i fear and so god bless the

tent mean time her wearied soul with cares oppressed drew down the curtains of her eyes to rest xtended on a flowery couch she lay ntrancd as death had winged her soul away while thus the royal dame took her repose a sudden vision to her fancy rose a form appeared but so amazing bright s luster flashed intolerable light her knees together knocked her upright hair with trembling heart confessed unusual fear his garments seemed thin as the upper air weet was his mein his face divinely fair oft as a cloud but more aetherial bright his image shone like springing tides of light down on his shoulders with an easy care a flaming meteor flowed like silver hair his cheeks were blushing as the morning sun his eyes more darting than his rays at noon his voice like zephirs that on violets play refreshing odours all the scorching day such harmony his numbers did inspire her soul was tuned to her melodious lyre when thus the sacred bard his message told anna thou favorite friend of heaven rise dispel all fears wipe sorrow from thy eyes the great jehovah founder of this state the god that did on your forefathers wait will still the wonders of his mercy show and make proud superstitious nations know there is a power to whom they do not bow by thee best of thy sex and most divine by thee  thou shall in all thy glorious works succeed obey my words for they are by heaven decreed heaven which makes even kings descend their thrones stripped of their purple and their shining crowns who boast of strength and trust in that alone are by the breath of heaven soon tumbled down mysterious truths hid in the veil of night are by his power produced to open light in plenty now the hapy nation lives and like a spreading vine the country thrives when sudden desolation unforeseen reduces all her pride to want again it is prosperous villainy that now bears sway the rich though bad the vulgar still obey the robber fattens at the lands expense and thrives upon the spoils of providence securely ins while heaven regardless smiles and seems to drive the prey into his toils the savage kine and those that wing the air if thou will ask the secret can declare whence this proceeds the tenants of the sea or earth it self can show the mystery without gods leave nothing ever was or is or good or bad unhappiness or bliss fate is his slave and does the nod obey and only acts as he prescribes the way ll that have life are in his powerful hand and flourish or decay at his command s by the organs of the ear we try and judge of discord or of harmony s by the palate we distinguish

perfection wisdom there does shine and power and judgment do with wisdom join at his command the waters backward fly their fountains seek and leave the channel dry when at a sign again their torrents pour and roll their curling heads above the shore houses and flocks are by the deluge drowned and desolation wastes the neighboring ground thus spoke the angel and then thus went on call britains great assembly instant here and tell this message in the peoples ear that annas sword shall curb the growing power of proud aspiring france that waits each hour the liberties of europe to devour of british race churchills the heros name mmortal queen that shall exalt thy fame and bring on louis everlasting shame end for the warrior let the people know to marlbroughs genius burgundy must bow consult your council for the dreadful war with all the strength of your allies prepare for french and spaniards are united friends and hatred nations join for hated ends then haste to arms thou best of thy fair race let war thy mind while smiles adorn thy face wake glorious princess from thy rest and see thou for a guardian have a deity swift from her eyes the phantom made its way and naught remained to sight but lightsome day when all alone she was surpised to find such strong impressions on her feeble mind no sooner were the clouds of sleep dispelled and morpheus loosed the fetters which he held but the great council waited at her tent to understand the message she had sent a goodly frame raised high of carved wood leaning its lofty head on pillars stood near an old venerable pile  westminster adorned with curious work of antique hands there all the states in full assembly met where they in princely robes of scarlet sit shining in costly gems each takes his place and fills the senate with majestic grace there hangs the balance of the weighty state and there rewards and punishments do wait a rigorous or an equitable fate there arbitrary laws are curbed and chained and there the summit of all justice gained judges themselves if lawless are not free from this tribunal seat of equity just judgment there does without bribry reign and wholesome laws all violence restrain blessed liberty in triumph sits her down nor hurts the state nor shakes the imperial crown all now were met the council filled apace and every statesman took his wonted place when thus the queen began  my lords the cause why youre assembled here s to advise about the business of the war louis you know his threatenings spreads around and victory has sometime his armies crowned the slavish french deflowr their neighbors fields whilst tamely they to their incursions yields and japhets race with heavy burdens bent the spaniards submit to haughty louiss government the might of this great prince i need not tell or all his vast designs you know too well europe has felt the fury of his power when god like william rescued you before but now more potent by his allies grown he triumphs ere the battle is begun while all his numerous squadrons do prepare for dreadful mischief and destructive war whom shall i choose among my mighty men the hazard of a battle to sustain who dare against burgundy his courage try to conquer bravely or as bravely die then a bold britain answered thus and said churchill is only fit for such a head who has the illustrious chiefs of europe led and often for his countrys honor bled courage and conduct both in him remains by wise designs as well as blood he gains for he that singly does to battle go with courage only beats but half his foe mature in councils generals ought to be not filled with fire so much as policy for lifes of more concern than victory then marlbro humbly spoke  great princess and you lords of britain hear who make europes concern your constant care you may remember when her armies fled and german princes stood like statues dead hen churchill propt that proud ungrateful race that now in britain marlbro would disgrace oh hear me lords spare your reproaches now did not all europe to proud louis bow did not they cringe below the tyrants feet and to the laws his arms prescribe submite what then has marlbro done do british peers despise the man that has dispelled their fears not for my self did i this honor seek my countrys danger twas that made me speak but since i find in faithless britain few when pressing dangers call that dare be true i shall my courage for the future spare cowards can boast when dangers seem not near with that a noble peer though young yet wise stood up and thus in council did advise though gray experience has not reached my years nor have i been alarmed with foreign fears yet i am sensible all europes fate does much on our wise councils wait great britains safety in our conduct lies and strength is nothing if we are not wise therefore my lords i must my judgment give for marlbro which i hope you will all receive then all the council moved with willing ears attended to the wisdom of his years while thus the noble youth continued on the brave discourse he had so well begun i am amazed from this wise board to hear one soul of ancient british race appear against marlbro did he not all europe save are not his looks his words his actions brave dont we by good experience know how great he stood at great baarias last defeat and what we by his prudent councils gain are like the glories of a monarchs reign the pompous luxury of camps he flies while downy rest their rioting supplies who are chained in sleep when sleep forsakes his eyes he said  and as the hollow caverns of some wood send back in ecchos the still voice aloud o from the silence of the council rose o all his words a general applause ut malice in the assembly still remains whilst marocs blood fermented in his veins who thus with cloudy aspect sowrd spoke  o princess and you lords of britain hear what reverend age is able to declare has not great frances powerful monarch seen britain divided anna made their queen what then remains for us to seek but peace at these base words the queen in passion rose and with becoming zeal did thus oppose though she was with the softest nature blessed like sleeping doves when on their downy rest for europes cause she was divinely fired and spoke these moving words by heaven inspired though war of all our evils is the worst and brought on man when man by heaven was cursed yet such the state of britain is this day  sought your aid knowing no other way for anna was expedient to maintain the glories was expected from my reign but wondering now i gaze with much surprise and scarcely can believe the object of my eyes is not that maroc prince of british blood that once for britain like a bulwark stood and can his courage dwindle into fear cause louis threats and burgundy draws near have we not often their boasting courage tried and triumphed over that saucy monarchs pride what have i heard pronounced from marocs tongue of peace who always has of battles sung what peace from perjured louis can we find louis the monster of the monarchkind has he not all his ties of friendship broke when he was fettered once with williams yoke when he to belgirs lion sud for peace but only kept it for his soldiers ease at this a general murmur filled the room like whistling winds that from deep caverns com when strait behold through all the secred place consent sat cheerfully on every face and every one now strove to loose his tongue to anna then to marlbro make their song who can forget o queen the happy day thou blessed our isarel with thy glorious sway when britain slept thou saved us from our foes and as our leading star at midnight rose heaven did it self in bright apparel dress and tuneful angels sung soft hymns of peace in dancing airs stars from their spheres were sent and springing joy spread over your royal tent why then should we ungratefully oppose our royal mistress why her favors lofe who such vast bounties on her land bestows since marlbro is the man by heaven decred anna no more shall frown or marlbro bleed for if nor heaven nor yet the queen had said marlbro should lead out europe as their head is not his courage and his conduct known to britain that we choose him for our own finis britains jubilee a new congratulary ballad on the glorious victories obtained by the duke of marlborovgh over the french writ by the famous comedian mr escourt and sung by him to most of our nobility with great applause you tell me dick you have lately read that we are beaten in spain but prithee boy hold up thy head well beat em twice for it again with a fall la la la la la la la la la la la la etc is this the courage you used to boast why thou art quite cast down you can reflect on what we have lost but never think what we have won with a fall etc in war and gaming it is the same according to the old saying who is sure to conquer every game quite loses the pleasure of playing with a fall etc then prithee boy hold up thy head for if we are beaten in spain as sure as scarlet color is red well beat em twice for it again with a fall etc thank god we have a man of our own a man if i may call him so for after those great deeds he has done i may question if he is so or no with a fall etc but there is a man whose name is johnny marlborough the beaten french have felt his fame and so shall the spaniard too with a fall etc though now jack spaniard pretends to bounce he never shall do so again we took last year as many towns as they now have taken men with a fall etc since justice now we cannot do to every victory our hearty zeal in wine let us show to our general family with a fall etc for he has eight fair daughters and each of them is a charmer lady rialton bridgewater fine sunderland lady mounthermer with a fall etc and as for the other younger four they will with raptures fill ye there is lady hochstet schellenburgh bright blenheim and lady ramillie with a fall etc these last are begotten so fair and strong as never in story was told the other four shall still be young but these last shall not be old with a fall etc now to make thy hopes more strong and make thee look like a man remember all these do belong to the queen of great britain with a fall etc finis advertisement whereas the printer hereof did receive two letters by the general

my way beauty she had a seeming modest mein all charms without but devil all within which did not yet appear but lurked alas unseen a fair complexion far exceeding paint black sleepy eyes that would have charmed a saint her lips so soft and sweet that every kiss seemed a short taste of the eternal bliss er set of teeth so regular and white heyd show their luster in the darkest night ound her seraphick face so fair and young er sable hair in careless dresses hung which added to her beauteous features showed ike some fair angel peeping through a cloud er breasts her hands and every charm so bright e seemed a sun by day a moon by night er shape so ravishing that every part roportiond was to the nicest rules of art o awful was her carriage when she moved one could behold her but he feared and loved he danced well sung well finely played the lute was always witty in her words or mute bliging not reserved nor yet too free ut as a maid divinely blessed should be not vainly gay but decent in attire he seemed so good she could no more acquire of heaven than what she had and man no more desire ortune like god and nature too was kind and to these gifts a copious sum had joined who could the power of such temptations shun what frozen synick from her charms could run what cloistered monk could see a face so bright but quit his beads and follow beautys light and its luster hope to shun eternal night  so bewitched and poisoned with her charms believed the utmost heaven was in her arms methoughts the goodness in her eyes i see spoke her the offspring of some deity now books and walks would no content afford she was the only good to be adored in her fair looks alone delight i found loves raging storms all other joys had drowned by beautys ignus fatuus led astray bound for content i lost my happy way of reasons faithful pilot now bereft was amongst rocks and shelves in danger left there must have perished as i fondly thought lest her kind usage my salvation wrought her happy aid i labored to obtain hoped for success yet feared her sad disdain tortured like dying convicts whilst they live twixt fear of death and hopes of a reprieve first for her smallest favors did i sue crept fawned and cringd as lovers used to do sighed ever i spoke and when i spoke looked  in words confused disclosed my mournful tle unpractised and amours fine speeches cod but could not utter what i well designd warmed by her charms against bash strove and trembling sat and stammerd out my love told her how greatly i admired and feard which she twixt coyness and compassion heard grutchd no expense of money or of time and thought that not to adore her was a crime the more each visit i acquainted grew yet every time found something in her new who was above her sex so fortunate she had a charm for man in every state beauty for the youthful prudence for the old scripture for the godly for the miser gold wit for the ingenious silence for the grave flattery for the fool and cunning for the knave compounded thus of such varieties she had a knack to every temper please and as her self thought fit was every one of these i loved i sighed and vowed talked whind and prayed and at her feet my panting heart i laid she smiled then frowned was now reserved then fre and as she played her part often changed her key not through fantastic humor but design to try me thoroughly ever she should be mine because she wanted in one man to have a husband lover cuckold and a slave so travelers before a horse they buy his speed his paces and his temper try whether hell answer whip and spur thence judge if the poor beast will prove a patient drudge when she by wiles had heightened my desire and feigned lovs sparkles to a raging fire made now for wedlock or for bedlam fit thus passion gained the upperhand of wit the dame by pity or by interest moved or else by lust pretended now she loved after long sufferings her consent i got to make me happy as i hoped and thought but oh the wretched hour i tied the gordian knot thus through mistake i rashly plunged my life into that gulf of miseries a wife with joyful arms i thus embraced my fate believed too soon was undeceived too late so hairbrained fools to indian climates rove with a vain hope their fortunes to improve there spend their slender cargoes then become worse slaves abroad than ever they were at home when a few weeks were wasted i compared with all due moderation and regard my former freedom with my new restraint judging which state afforded most content but found a single life as calm and gay as the delightful month of blooming may not child with cold or scorched with too much heat not plagued with flying dust nor drowned with wet but pleasing to the eyes and to the nostrils sweet but wedlocks like the blustering month of march that does the bodys maims and bruises search brings by cold nipping storms unwelcom pains and finds or breeds distempers in our veins renews old sores and hastens on decay and seldom does affords one pleasant day but clouds dissolve or raging tempest blow and untile houses like the wrangling shrow thus march and marriage justly may be said to be alike then sure the man is mad that loves such changling weather where the best is bad though i once happy in a single life yet shipwrackd all upon that rock a wife by gold and beauties powerful charms betrayed to the dull drudgery of a marriage bed that paradise for fools a sport for boys tiresom its chains and brutal are its joys thou nauseous priestcraft that too soon appeared not as i hoped but worse than what i feared all her soft charms which i believed divine marriage i thought had made them only mine vain hope alas for i too early found my brows were with the throne of wedlock crowned jealousies first from reason raised a doubt and fatal chance the unhappy truth brought out made it so plain from all pretenses freed that wicked woman no excuse could plead and if she wants device to hide her shame hell can no umbrage for adultry frame i thought it prudence the disgrace to hide though raved and stormed she pardon begged and cried yet with false protestations strove to charm the cuckold to believe she would done no harm though taken by surprise o curse the day where all the marks of past enjoyment lay and she disordered by her lustful freeks had shame and horror struggling in her cheeks yet made essays to clear her innocence and hide her guilt with lies and impudence for lustful women like a vicious state often stifle ills by others full as great but i convinced too plainly of her guilt all her false oaths and quick inventions spoilt which when she would used in vain she blushed and cried and owned her fault she found she could not hide this i forgave she promised to reclaim vowed future truth if i would conceal the shame but what strange adamantine chain can bind woman corrupted to be just or kind or how can man to an adultress show that love which to a faithful wife is due i strugled hard and all my passions checked and changed revenge into a mild respect that good for ill returned might touch her near and gratitude might bind her more than fear my former love i every day renewed and all the signals of oblivion showed winked at small faults would no such trifles mind as accidental failings not designed i all things to her temper easy made scorned to reflect and hated to upbraid she chose and rich it was her own attire nay had what a proud woman could desire thus the new covenant i strictly kept and often in private for her failings wept yet bore with seeming cheerfulness those cares that bring a man too soon to grisled hairs but all this kindness i dispensed in vain where lust and base ingratitude remain lust which if once in female fancy fixed burns like salt petre with dry touchwood mixed and though cold fear for time may stop its force twill soon like fire confined break out the worse or like a tide obstructed reassume its course no art could ever presume the stinking stote or change the lecherous nature of the goat no skilful whitster ever found the slight to wash or bleach an ethiopian white no gentle usage truly will assuage a tygers fierceness or a lyons rage stripes and severe correction is the way when once they are throly conquered they will obey it is whip and spur commanding reign and bit that makes the unruly headstrong horse submit so stubborn faithless woman must be used or man by woman basely be abused for after all the endearments i should show at last she turned both libertine and shrow from my submission grew perverse and proud crabbed as varges and as thunder loud did what she pleased would no obedience own and ridiculed the patience i had shown feared no sharp threatenings valued no disgrace but flung the wrongs she would done me in my face grew still more headstrong turbulent and lewd filling my mansion with a spurious brood thus brutal lust her humane reason drowned and her loose tail obliged the country round advice reproof prayers tears were flung away for still she grew more wicked every day till by her equals scorned my servants fed the brutal rage of her adultrous bed nay in my absence trucled to my groom and hugged the servile traitor in my room when these strange tidings thunder struck my ear and such inhumane wrongs were made appear on these just grounds for a divorce i sud at last that headstrong tyrant wife subdued canceled the marriagebonds and bastardizd her brood woman thou worst of all churchplagues farewell bad at the best but at the worst a hell thou truss of wormwood bitter teaz of life thou nursery of humane cares a wife thou appleeating traytriss who began the wrath of heaven and miseries of man and have with neverfailing diligence improved the curse to humane race ever since farewell churchjuggle that enslaved my life but bless that power that rid me of my wife and now the laws once more have set me free if woman can again prevail with me my flesh and bones

would give that i might choose my method how to live and all those hours propitious fate should lend in blisful ease and satisfaction spend near some fair town i would have a private seat built uniform not little nor too great better if on a rising ground it stood fields on this side on that a neighboring wood it should within no other things contain but what are useful necessary plain methinks it is nauseous and i would never endure the needful pomp of gaudy furniture a little garden grateful to the eye and a cool rivulet run murmuring by on whose delicious banks a stately row of shady limes or sicamores should grow at the end of which a silent study placed should with the noblest authors there be graced horace and virgil in whose mighty lines immortal wit and solid learning shines sharp juvenal and amorous ovid too who all the turns of loves soft passion knew he that with judgment reads his charming lines in which strong art with stronger nature joins must grant his fancy does the best excel his thoughts so tender and expressed so well with all those moderns men of steady sense esteemed for learning and for eloquence in some of these as fancy should advise i would always take my morning exercise for sure no minutes bring us more content than those in pleasing useful studies spent i would have a clear and competent estate that i might live genteely but not great as much as i could moderately spend a little more sometimes to oblige a friend nor should the sons of poverty repine too much at fortune they should taste of mine and all that objects of true pity were should be relieved with what my wants could spare for what our maker has too largely given should be returned in gratitude to heaven a frugal plenty should my table spread with healthful not luxurious dishes fed enough to satisfy and something more to feed the stranger and the neighboring poor strong meat indulges vice and pampering food creates diseases and inflames the blood but what is sufficient to make nature strong and the bright lamp of life continue long i would freely take and as i did possess the bounteous author of my plenty bless i would have a little cellar cool and neat with humming ale and virgin wine repleat wine whets the wit improves its native force and gives a pleasant flavor to discourse by making all our spirits debonar throws off the lees the sedement of care but as the greatest blessing heaven lends may be debauched and serve ignoble ends so but too often the grapes refreshing juice does many mischievous effects produce my house should no such rude disorders know as from high drinking consequently flow nor would i use what was so kindly given to the dishonor of indulgent heaven if any neighbor came he should be free used with respect and not uneasy be in my retreat or to himself or me what freedom prudence and right reason give all men may with impunity receive but the least swerving from their rules too much for what is forbidden us it is death to touch that life might be more comfortable yet and all my joys refined sincere and great  choose too friends whose company would be  great advance to my felicity well born of humors suited to my own iscreet and men as well as books have known rave generous witty and exactly free from loose behavior or formality iry and prudent merry but not light quick in discerning and in judging right ecret they should be faithful to their trust  reasoning cool strong temperate and just bliging open without huffing brave risk in gay talking and in sober grave close in dispute but not tenacious tried y solid reason and let that decide not prone to lust revenge or envious hate nor busy medlers with intrigues of state strangers to slander and sworn foes to spite not quarrelsom but stout enough to fight loyal and pious friends to caesar true as dying martyrs to their maker too n their society i could not miss a permanent sincere substantial bliss would bounteous heaven once more indulge i would choose for who would so much satisfaction lose as witty nymphs in conversation give near some obliging modestfair to live for there is that sweetness in a female mind which in a mans we cannot find that by a secret but a powerful art wind up the spring of life and does impart fresh vital heat to the transported heart i would have her reason and her passions sway easy in company in private gay coy to a fop to the deserving free still constant to her self and just to me a soul she should have for great actions fit prudence and wisdom to direct her wit courage to look bold danger in the face no fear but only to be proud or base quick to advise by an emergence pressed to give good counsel or to take the best i would have the expression of her thoughts be such she might not seem reserved nor talk too much that shows a want of judgment and of sense more than enough is but impertinence her conduct regular her mirth refined civil to strangers to her neighbors kind averse to vanity revenge and pride in all the methods of deceit untried so faithful to her friend and good to all no censure might upon her actions fall then would even envy be compelled to say she goes the least of woman kind astray to this fair creature i would sometimes retire her conversation would new joys inspire give life and edge so keen no surly care would venture to assault my soul or dare near my retreat to hide one secret snare but so divine so noble a repast i would seldom and with moderation taste for highest cordials all their virtue lose by a too frequent and too bold an use and what would cheer the spirits in distress ruins our health when taken to excess i would be concerned in no litigious jarr beloved by all not vainly popular whatever assistance i had power to bring to oblige my country or to serve my king whenever they called i would readily afford my tongue my pen my counsel or my sword lawsuits i would shun with as much studious care as i would dens where hungry lions are and rather put up injuries than be a plague to him whod be a plague to me i value quiet at a price too great to give for my revenge so dear a rate for what do we by all our bustle gain but counterfeit delight for real pain if heaven a date of many years would give thus i would in pleasure ease and plenty live and as i near approached the verge of life some kind relation for i would have no wife should take upon him all my worldly care while i did for a better state prepare then i would not be with any trouble vexed nor have the evening of my days perplexed but by a silent and a peaceful death without a sigh resign my aged breath and when committed to the dust i would have few tears but frindly dropped into my grave then would my exit so propitious be all men would wish to

alexis the rosy morning with prevailing light had now dispelled the humid shades of night and smiling phoebus spread his thirsty beams o drink the dew and taste the silver streams when on a rising mountains fragrant side  flora decked in all her gaudy pride he mourning shepherd young alexis lay ckning at light and weary of the day n conscious heaven he fixed his weeping eyes  if he sought his daphnis in the skies aphnis who from the earth was lately fled aphnis he living loved and mourned for daphnis dead hen generous fortune kindly brought that way  thyrsis to assist the pensive boy o be the kind companion of his woe that both their tears might in one current flow hus then the youth began a doleful strain and thus bespoke the sympathizing swain alexis ah thyrsis have thou heard the dismal tale ow daphnis died in yonder gloomy vale  could thou think that he whose verse could move rock to pity or a stone to love ho could like ovid tenderest thoughts instill ould fall a victim to a womans will  thyrsis yes shepherd yes the story is too true look how the groves have changed their verdant hue the withered leaves he scattered all around and blasted flowers disgrace the sacred ground yes he is dead the poor unhappy swain loved beauteous lalage but loved in vain fantastic proud and conscious of her charms she scorned his love and fled his wishing arms naught could prevail though all loves arts he tried she sacrificed the shepherd to her pride ungentle nymph to thee we owe his death twas lalage that robbed poor daphnis of his breath  alexis ah cruel nymph we have lost the learned swa that ever sung on our arcadias plain what sprightly thoughts what joy did he inspire when with such art he touched the roman lyre what tender pity did our souls invade when he bewailed the royal grecian maid how well his muse the fatal story told when she the poor lucretias fate condold when daphnis sung how did our groves rejoice and grottos echo to his charming voice how slow did silent ousa roll along when daphnis taught us great lucretias song where wandering atoms in confusion hurled agreed by chance and so composed a world whilst nervous numbers with harmonious feet in such a soft and tuneful cadence meet as to his lasting honor fully prove chance could not in such beauteous order move then cruel nymph how could thy pride refuse so soft a lover and so sweet a muse had thou but yielded to our daphnis love on every green in every blooming grove the nymphs and swains had blessed thy happy name and lalage and daphnis filled the mouth of fam but now both nymphs and swains unite their breath to curse thy scorn and mourn the shepherds death whose shade now wandering in the pensive grove till still complains of lalage and love daphnis farewell farewell unhappy swain may thou in lethes lake forget thy pain and in oblivion sleep till thou no more remember what thou did or what thou were before  thyrsis see yonder sheep how ragged now and bare  happy flock whilst they were daphnis care ut now they mope and straggling over the plain lament all day and mourn their absent swain no more they joy to crop the tender buds nor seek at noon cool springs and shady woods n neither sun nor shade they now delight nor dread the foxes or the wolves by night here pined to death a harmless lambkin lies and there for grief his bleating mother dies s if she did with her departing breath nvoke just heaven tavenge her masters death  alexis and pan will sure revenge the shepherds fate ltho perhaps his vengeance comes but late last night returning home in yonder grove where we were used to sing and talk of love  heard great pan and all the sylvan train of daphnis love and daphnis death complain the weeping heavens a shower of tears distilled and all the woods were with loud sorrow filled whilst mournful echoes all their sighs rebound wishing they had been something more than sound pan most of all the shepherds death deplored he daphnis loved and daphnis him adored oh my dear boy he cried why would thou dar to view a face so tempting and so fair why why did thou indulge the secret fire ah why would thou admit the ond desire and hope the imperious lalage to move why did thou die alas why did thou love but it is in vain to ask twas so decreed so i coy syrinx chased and caught a trembling reed fair fatal sex who can our souls surprise with tender looks and soft bewitching eyes were you but half as pitiful and kind the god of love had not been counted blind on you we gaze and feel a pleasing pain steal to our hearts and glide through every vein till drunk with love our weakness we betray and die if you refuse to yield the joy more had he spoke but words began to fail and breathless echoes murmured in the vale convulsive sorrow swelled his throbbing breast adieu adieu he cried and sighed the rest  thyrsis but say what chance what luckless fortune die the scornful virgin to the shepherds view where did his fatal passion first begin ah where was she by wretched daphnis seen  alexis beneath a shade to shun the heat of day on ousas flowery banks our daphnis lay whilst his glad flocks around their master feed charmed with the music of his voice and reed of chaos first he sung and boundless space before the birth of matter time or place before old night had felt the piercing ray of light and yielding to invading day then how the wondrous universe began what order through the newmade structure ran the birth of nature and the birth of man then changed his subject and in softer strains discovered grecian loves to british swains whilst lalage from an adjacent glade where trembling boughs composed a moving shade with pleasure listened to his warbling airs and drunk the pleasing tales with greedy ears then over the lawns she trips with nimble feet to know who twas sung so divinely sweet and as she passed along the impatient maid with curious eyes each secret place surveyed still following echo as a faithful guide till she at distance had the shepherd spied  thyrsis ah happy swain had thou but fled from that unhappy place and never seen her fair enchanting face thou yet had been the lord of all our plains and we yet heard thy soft harmonious strains  alexis but daphnis to his fate with pleasure run he saw the nymph he loved and was undone with haughty looks and a disdainful mien apace she walked and crossed the shaded green the shepherd viewed her as she passed along dropped down his reed and strait forgot his song with wishing eyes he gazed upon her charms and would have died to have died within her arms deep draughts of love he drunk and strong desire his breast like aetna glowed with inward fire which when the nymph perceived more proud and coy she looked and smiled with a malicious joy nor could he since the cruel tyrant move obdurate maid to pity or to love the sad the direful passion still increased ten thousand raging thoughts distract his breast his flock and darling muse no longer were his dear delight his pleasure and his care the nymph the nymph he thinks of naught but her but hapless youth  the more he loved the more she scorned his flame and seemed to hate both love and daphnis name then from our groves to yonder wood he flies strange power of love and there despairing dies  thyrsis the last time i the wretched swain beheld was on a sunny bank in aegons field all fire himself he minded not to shun the heat of day or fly the scorching sun wildly he stard his face looked pale and wan he sighed and languishd like a dying man when to him thus i spoke  uhappy youth  and can there be no cure what tortures do thou feel what pains endure whilst by a cruel unrelenting maid thou art to misery and death betrayed ah can thou not forget her fatal charms and take some kinder beauty to thy arms return return to our abandoned grove and there thou may be happy in thy love for thee in amorous fires lycoris burns for thee the lovely galatea mourns were thou from this inglorious bondage free a thousand blessings wait to fall on thee the jolly troops that used to hear thy lays and crown thy brows with wreaths of verdant bays in sighs and tears of thy hard fate complain begging kind heaven to break the subtle chain which holds thy heart and thy sweet muse restore that thou may charm them as thou did before thy scattered flocks too over the forests roam wanting their shepherd to compel them home rise then dear daphnis give this fondness over and think of cruel lalage no more thus i  and thus replied the sighing swain ah thyrsis if thou would remove my pain give me my love so i may sooth my grief forget my cares and grow more fond of life for though so proud disdainful and unkind without her i can hope no peace to find my wandering thoughts her form does still pursue and still my soul has lalage in view ah savage fair would thou this bounty give for since thou will not love i cannot live would thou but deign to close my trembling eyes or drop a tear or two as daphnis dies with joy i would meet the cold embrace of death and bless my charmer with my latest breath did thou but rage with such a fierce desire i would rush through foaming seas and storms of fire ttempt the greatest dangers and not grieve to part with life so lalage might live but thou malicious fair one with disdain laughs at my grief and smiling mockst my pain be gone ye quacks your arts no longer boast n spite of all your medicines i am lost be gone ye cheats who with vain charms pretend to make departed shades again ascend be gone ye zealots who at altars bow the gods are deaf and cannot hear you now  rave i rage i burn oh let me fly to some dark desert place and there i will die thus spoke the swain and acted as he said raving to yonder gloomy wood he fled where for a while with piercing sighs and groans he fills the shades and his dire fate bemoans repeating still the cruel charmers name and on each tree records his hapless flame till quite overwhelmed with woe and drowned in grief he thus gave up the sad remains of life farewell ye swains to deaths dark courts i go to mourn amongst the weeping shades below farewell ye streams and conscious groves he cried so did the dreadful work of fate and died  alexis unhappy youth what could the fates design to bless the world with such a muse as thine yet suffer death to ravish her away er she could half her smiling charms display what star what baleful planet ruled thy birth hedding malignant rays upon the earth that thou should die amidst thy vernal bloom before thy muse had brought her harvest home but twas a dismal sad untimely death that robbed so soon the shepherd of his breath thus blooming trees are nipt with killing frost thus budding flowers harsh mildews often blast had thou survived what wonders had we seen what listening crowds had thronged each grove and green upon thy voice the nymphs and swains had hung as when before great tytrus sweetly sung  thyrsis but tytyrus is gone and daphnis fled and all our hopes are with the shepherds dead farewell dear youth so fast my tears do flow that words are wanting to express my woe as hebrus stopped for grief his golden side when on its banks the tuneful orpheus died so do our groves and rivers seem to mourn in silent sorrow for their swains return but thou can never return  for thou have crossed the irreameable lake and chaerons boat comes always empty back here did the swains their mournful theme give over sighs stopped their words and they could speak no more  the despairing lover with inauspicious love a wretched swain pursued the fairest nymph of all the plain fairest indeed but prouder far than fair he plunged him hopeless in a deep despair her heavenly form too haughtily she prized his person hated and his gifts despised nor knew the force of cupids cruel darts nor feared his awful power on humane hearts but either from her hopeless lover fled or with disdainful glances shot him dead no kiss no look to cheer the drooping boy no word she spoke she scorned even to deny but as a hunted panther casts about her glaring eyes and pricks her listening ears to scour o she to shun his toils her cares employed and fiercely in her savage freedom joyd her mouth she writhed her forehead taught to frown her eyes to sparkle fires to love unknown her sallow cheeks her envious mind did show and every feature spoke aloud the curstness of a shrew yet could not he his obvious fate escape his love still dressed her in a pleasing shape and every sullen frown and bitter scorn but fanned the fuel that too fast did burn long time unequal to his mighty pain he strove to curb it but he strove in vain at last his woes broke out and begged relief with tears the dumb petitioners of grief with tears so tender as adorned his love and any heart but only hers would move trembling before her bolted doors he stood and there poured out the uprofitable flood staring his eyes and haggard was his look then kissing first the threshold thus he spoke ah nymph more cruel than of humane race thy tygress heart belies thy angel face too well thou showst thy pedigree from stone thy grandames was the first by pyrrha thrown wnworthy thou to be so long desired but so my love and so my fate required i beg not now for it is in vain to live but take this gift the last that i can give this friendly cord shall soon decide the strife betwixt my lingering love and loathsome life this moment puts an end to all my pain i shall no more despair nor thou disdain farewell ungrateful and unkind i go condemned by thee to those sad shades below i go the extremest remedy to prove to drink oblivion and to drench my love there happily to lose my long desires but ah what draught so deep to quench my fires farewell ye never opening gates ye stones and threshold guilty of my midnight moans what i have suffered here you know too well what i shall do the gods and i can tell the rose is fragrant but it fades in time the violet sweet but quickly past the prime white lillies hang their heads and soon decay and whiter snow in minutes melts away such is your blooming youth and withering so the time will come it will when you shall know the rage of love your haughty heart shall burn in flames like mine and meet a like return obdurate as you are oh hear at least my dying prayers and grant my last request when first you open your doors and passing by the sad ill omend object meets your eye think it not lost a moment if you stay the breathless wretch so made by you survey some cruel pleasure will from thence arise to view the mighty ravage of your eyes i wish but oh my wish is vain i fear the kind oblation of a falling tear then loose the knot and take me from the place and spread your mantle over my grizly face upon my livid lips bestow a kiss o envy not the dead they feel not bliss nor fear your kisses can restore my breath even you are not more pitiless than death then for my corpse a homely grave provide which love and me from public scorn may hide thrice call upon my name thrice beat your breast and hail me thrice to everlasting rest last let my tomb this sad inscription bear a wretch whom love has killed lies buried here oh passengers amintas eyes beware thus having said and furious with his love he heaved with more than humane force to me a weighty stone the labor of a team and raised from thence he reached the neighboring beam around its bulk a sliding knot he throws and fitted to his neck the fatal noose then spurning backward took a swing till death crept up and stopped the passage of his breath the bounce burst open the door the scornful fair relentless looked and saw him beat his quivering feet in air nor wept his fate nor cast a pitying eye nor took him down but brusht regardless by and as she passed her chance or fate was such her garments touched the dead polluted by the touch next to the dance thence to the bath did move the bath was sacred to the god of love whose injured image with a wrathful eye stood threatening from a pedestal on high nodding a while and watching of his blow he fell and falling crushed the ungrateful nymph below her gushing blood the pavement all besmeared and this her last expiring voice was heard lovers farewell revenge has reached my scorn thus warned be wise and love for love return the despairing shepherd alexis shunned his fellow swains their rural sports and jocund strains heaven guard us all from cupids bow he lost his crook he left his flocks and wandering through the lonely rocks he nourished endless woe the nymphs and shepherds round him came his grief some pity others blame the fatal cause all kindly seek he mingled his concern with theirs he gave em back their friendly tears he sighed but would not speak clorinda came among the rest and she too kind concern expressed and asked the reason of his woe she asked but with an air and mein that made it easily foreseen she feared too much to know the shepherd raised his mournful head and will you pardon me he said whe i the cruel truth reveal which nothing from my breast should tear which never should offend your ear but that you bid me tell it is thus i rove it is thus complain since you appeared upon the plain you are the cause of all my care your eyes ten thousand dangers dart ten thousand torments vex my heart i love and i despair too much alexis i have heard it is what i thought it is what i feared and yet i pardon you she cried but you shall promise never again to breath your vows or speak your pain he bowed obeyed and died finis usica incantans sive poema exprimens

ex alienigenis membris compacta potestas lucret lib   by the author of faction displayed  london nted and sold by h hills in blackfryars near the waterside   0   preface at a time when we are celebrating the successes of our arms abro and the wisdom of our councils at home when there seems to b no room left for complaints and the nation is only prepared to receiv panegyric i am sensible a piece of this kind will be severely censur for those that are taken up with the present appearances of things who are by much the greatest part of the world will be apt to say is unseasonable at least if not false and malicious but i hope other who are not content with such superficial views and to such only would write will see the reason and truth of what i have said an own that it could not be more seasonably vtterd than at this  juncture when we are lulled with too much security and by the means may give opportunity to a new set of men to ruin bo church and state with their new politics but if this poem ca out with all the advantages imaginable i am not yet grown so erra an author as to think because the first part met with a favourab reception that i am now therefore privileged to dictate to the reders judgment and to ascribe to my own merit what was only ing to his candor or perhaps partiality be that the business dedicating poets i have no ambition of gaiing the reputation of one it is the last thing i should desire  my aim is of another sort and i am abundantly rewarded if have been able to contribute any thing to the public service by dtecting the principles and practices of this new party who ha assumed to themselves a very specious name and character and wou be thought the only patriots of their country but false friends a the most dangerous enemies and they are yet much more so wh they are invested with power and the ministration of affairs who put into their hands  it is to be wished there were no occasion for invectives of this kin that great men did always execute their trusts and perform the duty and were only the objects of our esteem and admiration b when the case is quite otherwise when they become treacherous a betray the authority delegated to them it is fit they should hear their faults and the people be undeceived who are grossly impo upon by the servile flatteries of hireling scriblers a genera f animals that always infest the doors of men in power and ho one would think their trash could never pass upon the moderate the grave and the wife yet they are sometimes thought worthy of pensions and places of   00 l a year  it is indeed the just prerogative of the throne to be approached with humility and petitions even where the subjects have grievances to represent but i know of no such homage due to its officers nor can i yet be convinced that it is an arrogant presumption in private persons as some would have it to examine and censure the actions of public ministers who say they being nearest the helm are consequently best able to judge of what ought and ought not to be done whereas men in a remote sphere and at a distance cannot possibly nter into the councils of state and must therefore determine rashly and without knowledge this is a doctrine necessary to be preached p in despotick and arbitrary governments where all is transacted in the cabinet where the will and choice of the prince gives a sanction to his creatures and cannot be controverted without treason but in a mixed and limited monarchy where the deepest resorts of policy and turns of government are in some measure known to men f rank and condition and where a right of impeachment is lodged in the house of commons it can never be maintained for that it roud destroy the constitution and render the accusation of great officers though never so guilty impracticable but i would not here be supposed to countenance that scandalous principle of appealing to the mob i leave such maxims to the relations and friends of a certain lawyer who at the observators trial had the impudence as the attorney general very justly called it to insinuate that the crown was in the disposal of the people nor would i be thought in the least to detract from the prerogative which no man living has in higher veneration than my self for i think it never violated but by a profligate abandoned nation and i wish for the honor of the english name our annals had recorded no instances of that kind  but after all this newmoderation policy is not more pernicious and tending to the destruction of the government than it is absurd and ridiculous in it self for how can men of understanding pretend to look two ways at once to blow hot and cold and fancy that every body does not see through the pitiful disguise and artifice they call themselves true sons of the church and yet make no scruple of opposing a bill which is absolutely necessary for its preservation because forsooth it is offered at an unseasonable time as if it was not as seasonable to make wholesome laws as to engage in a just and honorable war for the security of our constitution can they hope for a better opportunity than the reign we now enjoy they would be thought great favorers of the church party when upon all occasions they take care to discountenance them and encourage only the professed enemies of church and state under a shallow pretense that they are a numerous and formidable body of men and ought therefore to be preferred to places of honor and profit that they may not grow mutinous and complain of persecution which methinks should rather be a strong argument for using all possible means to suppress such turbulent aspiring spirits nay so tender are they of their dissenting brethren that i am told it has lately been delivered as law by a great man in w          rhall that a notorious perjured vagabond with two wives at once being possessed of a separate congregation though without any license or legal qualification to preach to them shall for that reason only be exempt from the late act for listing vagrants i must confess i cannot imagine how they would define it or what moderation according to these practices is the logicians have stated no medium that i know of between truth and falsehood nor the moralists any between virtue and vice every proposition and principle must necessarily fall under one of these heads  there is no need of a prophetic spirit to foresee that they will render themselves odious and cannot subsist long i heartily pity some young gentlemen who are unwarily drawn in for they will fi themselves deceived by their crafty leader and cannot expect to be received by their old friends again it is much to be lamented that a late great character stained the latter part of his life  but de mortuis nil nisi bonum  i hope some paragraphs in the close of his poem will at least prove that i have not writ with partiality but have equally commende merit wherever i found it without any regard to a party  moderation displayed again my muse  nor fear the steepy flight pursue the fury through the realms of night explore the depth of hell the secret cause whence the new scheme of moderation rose now faction reassumd her native throne which prostrate fiends with awful homage own a crown of eating flame her temples bound darting a blew malignant radiance round an iron scepter in her hand she bore emblem of vengeance and destructive power a bloody canopy hung over her head where the four falling empires are portrayed monarchs deposed beneath her footstool lie and all around is hell and anarchy whilst thus she towering sat the subject train with shouts proclaimed the triumphs of her reign then they the chaos sung and natures jars how the first atoms urged their medley wars how civil discord and intestine rage have boiled in every nation every age they sung divided albions hapless state her clashing senates feuds her laboring churchs fate and as her coming ruin they expressed a sullen rapture swelled in every breast for such the bent of their distorted will only to know delight in thoughts of ill but on a sudden lo descending flew a meagre ghost which soon the fury knew cethego newly dead her darling pride whose firm unwavring faith she long had tried long in her secret councils had retained by which her empire over our isle she gained no sooner was arrived the welcome guest but him in soothing terms she thus addressed hail best beloved of all my sons receive what praise what joy these gloomy realms can give for it is to thy successful arts i owe my reign above my triumph here below this said the unbodied shade obsequious kneeled struck with amazement and with rapture filled o mighty queen permit me to adore thy awful shrine thy all informing power whose nearer influence my breast inspires with glorious rage and mischievous desires twas in thy cause i sunk a mouldring frame unequal to the hardy task of fame but still my mind released from mortal pains her innate faculty of ill retains more he had said but the surrounding throng impatient of delay pursued their noisy song mean time the fiend revolving in her thought the mighty change cethegos death had wrought resolved at length to summon to her aid each plotting devil each seditious shade she gave the signal and a dreadful sound ran bellowing through all the abyss profound then thus she eased her anxious soul  o dearest friends o faithful ministers ye mutual partners of my joys and cares new ways new means my restless thoughts employ how albion to reduce her peace destroy long have i labored but alas in vain for now succeeds the heavenly annas reign who watchful guards a stubborn peoples good by fears not staggered nor by force subdued such are the gifts of her capacious mind where justice mercy piety are joined as motion light and heat combined in one make up the glorious essence of the sun but still she mortal is nor will i cease till my revenge be crowned with wished success first then suppose we should divest the throne of friends whose souls are kindred to her own celsus disgraced hortensio next appears whose vigilance still baffles all my cares to whom by right of ancestry belong a loyal heart and a persuasive tongue now plots are formed and public tempests roll he boasts a strong unshaken strength of soul fearless against her foes the church sustains alike their friendship and their hate disdains disdains their clamor and seditious noise secure in the applauding senates voice of noble stem in whose collatral lines virtue with equal force and luster shines when suada pleads success attends the cause suada the glory of the british laws not the famed orators of old were heard with more attentive awe more deep regard when thronging round them their charmed audience hung on the attracting music of their tongue nor hell to laelio can her praise refuse whose worth deserves his own recording muse who in sophias court with just applause maintained his sovereign rights his countrys cause for it is in him with anguish that i find all the endowments of a generous mind whatever is great and brave whatever refined for it is in him fame doubly does commend an active patriot and a faithful friend then from his near attendance be removed urbano though by all admired and loved though his sweet temper and obliging port become his office and adorn the court he seems by nature formed mankind to please so free so unconstrained in his address improved by every virtue every grace senato too who bravely does deride sempronias little arts and female pride whose lofty look and whose majestic mein confess the towering godlike soul within a speaker of unparalled renown long in the senate long in council known allied to celsus by the noblest claim by the same principles by worth the same old as he is still firm his heart remains and dauntless his declining frame sustains so poised on its own base the center bears the nodding fabric of the universe be these and such as these discharged from court the better genii that the crown support then in their stead let moderate statesmen reign practice their new pretended golden mean a notion undefind in virtues schools unrecommended by her sacred rules a modern coward principle designed to stifle justice and unnerve the mind a trick by knaves contrived imposed on fools but scorned by patriot and exalted souls for moderate statesmen like camelions wear a different form in every different air hey stick at nothing to secure their ends aress their enemies betray their friends their medley temper their amphibious mind  fraught with principles of every kind nor ever can from stain and error free assert its native truth and energy as the four elements so blended were n their first chaos so united there that since they never could fully be disjoined each retains something of each others kind nor this is wholly air nor that pure flame but still in both some atoms are the same let jano second of his trimming band next to volpone decked with honors stand like him for secret policy renowned like him with all the gifts of cunning crowned none better can the jarring senate guide or lure the flying camp to either side of an invetrate old fanatic race or canting parents sprung this child of grace in show a tory but a whig in heart for saints may safely act the sinners part once he was ours and will be ours again for art to stifle nature strives in vain for every thing when from its center born still thither tends still thither will return let him with these accomplishments supply hortensios steady faith and loyalty bubus for he has wealth to buy a place shall wear urbanos key his post disgrace a worthy son in whom collected shine the follies of his mad and idiot line lord of the woeful countenance whose skin seems feared without and putrified within a dapper animal whose pigmy size provokes the ladies scorn and mocks their eyes but balls and music are his greatest care so willing is the wretch to please the fair it is strange that men what nature has denied should make their only aim their only pride let britono who from the parent moon derives his welsh descent directly down succeed senato in his high command and bear the staff of honor in his hand a fluttering empty fop that every night sits laughing loud and jesting in the pit whilst a surrounding crowd of whores and bawds his sprightly converse and his wit applauds an atlas proper to sustain the weight of an encumbered and declining state let these as useful tools a while possess the court preferments and indulge their ease but they shall fly like mists before the sun when my designs to full perfection grown exert their power and make the ruined world my own when thus the fury had her scheme displayed assenting hell a low obeisance paid moloch protector of the papal chair author of the massacres and christian war was now convinced that sanguinary laws could nere the reformations growth oppose could nere in albions church advance his cause he therefore urged with his old constant hate by moderate means consents to work her fate he finds how soon by tolerations aid her power is weakened and her rights betrayed nor doubts occasional conformity will by degrees her essence quite destroy then satan prince of the fanatic train who formed the conduct of their glorious reign approve the scheme not hoping to restore his subjects to their late unbounded power or well he knew their avarice and pride ad weaned the bankrupt nation from their side ut these auspicious moderation times y not detecting sanctify their crimes y baffling justice and eluding law make vice insult and sin triumphant grow nay such the effects of moderation are the guilty to reward as well as spare hence foes to prelacy are clad in lawn hence rebels are the favorites of the throne what could they more desire than thus to pass the blessed remainder of their happy days atted with plunder and dissolved in ease nor belial the atheists patron could complain or moderation would enlarge his reign where all unpunished talk and live profane where irreligion providence denies nor dreads the laws of earth nor thunder of the skies mammon the traders and the courtiers god no sooner heard the project but allowed for hence his two votries uncontrolled might live and endless frauds commit and endless bribes receive but most cethego the design approves who dead and living in maeanders moves he knew how he deluded hapless james by the same wily arts and subtle schemes proposes then that he

glorious worth it would commend when with his eastern spoils returning home augustus entered his applauding rome irgil and horace waited on his fame glad to record the muses patrons name and well

love finis the hind and the panther transversd to the story of the countrymouse and the citymouse  uch malice mingled with a little wit  hind pan nec vult panthera domari  quae genus london inted and sold by h hills in blackfryars near the waterside   0  price three pence  the preface the favorers of the hind and panther will be apt to say in its defense that the best things are apable of being turned to ridicule that omer has been burlesqued and virgil ravested without suffering any thing in their reputation from that buffoonry and that in like manner the hind and the paner may be an exact poem though it is the subject of our raillery but there is this diffeence that those authors are wrested from their true sense and this naturally falls in ridicule there is nothing represented ere as monstrous and unnatural which is ot equally so in the original first as to he general design is it not as easy to imaine two mice bilking coachmen and suping at the devil as to suppose a hind tertaining the panther at a hermits cell iscussing the greatest mysteries of religion d telling you her son rodriguez writ very od spanish what can be more improbable and contradictory to the rules and example of all fables and to the very design an use of them they were first begun and raised to the highest perfection in the easter countries where they wrote in signs an spoke in parables and delivered the mos useful precepts in delightful stories which for their aptness were entertaining to the most judicious and led the vulgar into understanding by surprising them with their novelty and fixing their attention a their fables carry a double meaning the story is one and entire the characters the same throughout not broken or changed and always conformable to the nature of the creatures they introduce they never te you that the dog which snapt at a shadow lost his troop of horse that would be unintelligible a piece of flesh is proper for hi to drop and the reader will apply it t mankind they would not say that the da who was so proud of her borrowed plume looked very ridiculous when rodriguez cam and took away all the book but the   th   th and   th chapters which she stole from him but this is his new way o telling a story and confounding the mora and the fable together  before the word was written said the hind our savior preached the faith to a mankind what relation has the hind to our savior or what notion have we of a panhers bible if you say he means the church how does the church feed on lawns or range in the forest let it be always a church or always the clovenfooted beast or we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line if it is absurd in comedies to ake a peasant talk in the strain of a hero r a country wench use the language of the court how monstrous is it to make a priest f a hind and a parson of a panther to bring em in disputing with all the foralities and terms of the school though s to the arguments themselves those we onfess are suited to the capacity of the beasts and if we would suppose a hind exressing her self about these matters she ould talk at that rate  as to the absurdity of his expressions here is nothing wrested to make em ridiculous the terms are sometimes altered to make the blunder more visible knowldge misunderstood is not at all better sense han understanding misunderstood though it is confessed the author can play with words o well that this and twenty such will pass off t a slight reading  there are other mistakes which could not e brought in for they were too gross for bays himself to commit it is hard to conceive how any man could censure the turk for gluttony a people that debauch in coffee are voluptuous in a mess of rice and keep the strictest lent without the pleasures of a carnival to encourage them but it is almost impossible to think that any man wh had not renounced his senses should rea duncomb for allen he had been told that mr allen had written a discourse o humility difference betwixt a protestant and socinian p    to which he wisely answers tha that magnified piece of duncombs was translated from the spanish of rodriguez and to set it beyond dispute makes the infallible guide affirm the same thing there are few mistakes page    but one may imagine how a man fell into them and at least what he aimed at but what likeness is there betwee duncomb and allen do they so much as rhyme  we may have this comfort under the severity of his satyr to see his abilities equally lessened with his opinion of us and that he could not be a fit champion against the panther till he had laid aside all his judgment but we must applaud his obedience to his new mother hind she disciplined him severely page  0 she commanded him it seems to sacrifice his darling fame and to do it effectually he published this learned piece this is the favorable construction we would put on his faults though he takes care to inform us pref that it was done from no imposition but out of a natural propensity he has to malice and a particular inclination of doing mischief what else could provoke him to libel the court blaspheme kings abuse the whole scotch nation page    rail at the greatest part of his own and lay all the indignities imaginable on the only established religion and we must now congratulate him this felicity that there is no sect or denomination of christians whom he has not abused  thus far his arms have with success been crowned  let turks jews and infidels look to themselves he has already begun the war upon them when once a conqueror grows thus dreadful it is the interest of all his neighbors to oppose him for there is no alliance to be made with one that will face about and destroy his friends and like a second almanzor change sides merely to keep his hand in ure this heroic temper of his has created him some enemies that did by no means affect hostility and he may observe this candor in the management that none of his works are concerned in these papers but his last piece and i believe he is sensible this is a favor i was not ambitious of laughing at any persuasion or making religion the subject of such a trifle so that no man is here concerned but the author himself and nothing ridiculed but his way of arguing  but gentlemen if you will not take it s you must grant my excuse is more reasonabl than our authors to the dissenters

me to expect any mercy or igad to tru any body   smith but why this to us my old friend wh you know never trouble our heads with nationa concerns till the third botlle has taught us as much of politics as the next does of religion   bays ah gentlemen leave this prophanenes i am altered since you saw me and cannot be this loose talk now mr johnson you are  man of parts let me desire you to read the gui of controversy and mr smith i would recommend to you the considerations on the council  trent page   and so gentlemen your humble servant  good life be now my task   johns nay faith we will not part so belie us we are both your friends let us step to the rose for one quarter of an hour and talk ov old stories   bays i ever took you to be men of honor and for your sakes i will transgress as far as o pint   johns well mr bays many a merry bo have we had in this house and shall have again hope come what wine are you for   bays gentlemen do you as you please for  part he shall bring me a single pint of any thing   smith how so mr bays have you lost yo pallat you have been more curious   bays true i have so but senses must  starved page    that the soul may be gratified men  our kidney make the senses the supreme judge and therefore bribe em high but we have laid oh the use and pleasure of em aside   smith what is not there good eating and drinking on both sides you make the separation reater than i thought it   bays no no whenever you see a fat rosieolourd fellow take it from me ibid he is either a rotestant or a turk   johns at that rate mr bays one might susect your conversion methinks thou have as much e face of an heretic as ever i saw   bays such was i such by nature still i am page   ut i hope ever long i shall have drawn this pamerd paunch fitter for the straight gate   smith sure sir you are in ill hands your confessor gives you more severe rules than he ractices for not long ago a fat friar was ought a true character   bays things were misrepresented to me i onfess i have been unfortunate in some of my writings but since you have put me upon that ubject i will show you a thing i have in my pock shall wipe off all that or i am mistaken   smith come now thou art like thy self again eres the kings health to thee  communicate   bays well gentlemen here it is and i will be old to say the exactest piece the world ever saw  non pareillo in faith but i must bespeak your ardons if it reflects any thing upon your perswaon   johns use your liberty sir you know we are o bigots   bays why then you shall see me lay the reforation on its back igad and justify our religion y way of fable   johns an apt contrivance indeed what do ou make a fable of your religion   bays ay igad and without morals too so i tread in no mans steps and to show you how far i can outdo any thing that ever was writ in thi kind i have taken horaces design but igad have so outdone him you shall be ashamed for your old friend you remember in him the story of the countrymouse and the citymouse wha a plain simple thing it is it has no more life an spirit in it igad than a hobbyhorse and hi mice talk so meanly such common stuff so lik mere mice that i wonder it has pleased the worl so long but now will i undeceive mankind and teach em to heighten and elevate a fable il bring you in the very same mice disputing the depth of philosophy searching into the fundamentals of religion quoting texts fathers councils and all that i gad as you shall see either of e could easily make an ass of a country vicar now whereas horace keeps to the dry naked history  have more copiousness than to do that igad here i draw you general characters and describ all the beasts of the creation there i lanch ou into long digressions and leave my mice for twenty pages together then i fall into raptures and make the finest soliloquies as would ravish you will not this do think you   johns faith sir i dont well conceive you all this about two mice   bays ay why not is it not great and heroical but come you will understand it better when you hear it and pray be as severe as you can iga i defy all critics thus it begins page   a milkwhite mouse immortal and unchanged fed on soft cheese and over the dairy ranged without unspotted innocent within she feared no danger for she knew no gin    johns methinks mr bays soft cheese is a little too coarse diet for an immortal mouse were there any necessity for her eating you should have consulted homer for some celestial provision   bays faith gentlemen i did so but indeed i have not the latin one which i have marked by me and could not readily find it in the original  yet had she often been scared by bloody claws page    o winged owls and stern grimalkins paws aimed at her destined head which made her fly page    though she was doomed to death and fated not to dye  smith how came she that feared no danger in the line before to be scared in this mr bays   bays why then you may have it chased if you will for i hope a man may run away without being afraid may not he   johns but pray give me leave how was she doomed to death if she was fated not to die are not doom and fate much the same thing   bays nay gentlemen if you question my skill n the language i am your humble servant the rogues the critics that will allow me nothing else give me that sure i that made the word now best what i meant by it i assure you doomed and fated are quite different things   smith faith mr bays if you were doomed to e hanged whatever you were fated to twould ive you but small comfort   bays never trouble your head with that mr smith mind the business in hand  not so her young their linsywoolsy line page   was heros make half humane half divine  smith certainly these heros half humane half divine have very little of the mouse their mother   bays gadsokers mr johnson does your riend think i mean nothing but a mouse by all this i tell thee man i mean a church and these young gentlemen her sons signify priests martyrs and confessors that were hanged in oatss plot there is an excellent latin sentence which i had a mind to bring in sanguis martyrum semen ecclesiae and i think i have not wronged it in the translation  of these a slaughtered army lay in blood page   whose sanguine seed increased the sacred brood she multiplied by these now ranged alone page   and wandered in the kingdoms once her own  smith was she alone when the sacred brood wa increased   bays why thy heads running on the mous again but i hope a church may be alone tho the members be increased may not it   johns certainly mr bays a church which i a diffusive body of men can much less be said to be alone   bays but are you really of that opinion take it from me mr johnson you are wrong however to oblige you i will clap in some simile or other about the children of israel and it shall do   smith will you pardon me one word more mr bays what could the mouse for i suppose you mean her now do more than range in the kingdoms when they were her own   bays do why she reigned had a diadem scepter and ball till they deposed her   smith now her sons are so increased she may try the other pull for it   bays igad and so she may before i have done with her it has cost me some pains to clear he title well but mum for that mr smith  the common hunt she timorously past by page   for they made tame disdained her company they grind she in a fright tript over the green for she was loved wherever she was seen  johns well said little bays in faith the critic must have a great deal of leisure that attacks those verses   bays igad i will warrant him whoever he i ffendet solido but i go on  the independent beast page    smith who is that mr bays   bays why a bear pox is not that obvious enough  in groans her hate expressed which igad is very natural to that animal well there is for the independent now the quaker what do you think i call him   smith why a bull for ought i know   bays a bull o lord a bull no no a hare a quaking hare  armarillis because she wears armor it is the same figure and i am roud to say it mr johnson no man knows how o pun in heroics but my self well you shall ear  she thought and reason good the quaking hare her cruel foe because she would not swear page    and had professed neutrality  johns a shrewd reason that mr bays but what wars were there   bays wars why there had been bloody wars ho they were pretty well reconciled now yet to ing in two or three such fine things as these i ont tell you the lyons peace was proclaimed till fty pages after though twas really done before i ad finished my poem  next her the buffoon ape his body bent page    and paid at church a courtiers complement that gauls somewhere igad i cannot leave off though i were cudgeld every day for it  page   the brisld baptist boar impure as he   smith as who   bays as the courtier let em even take it a they will igad i seldom come amongst em  page  0 was whitened with the foam of sanctity the wolf with bellygaunt his rough crest rears and pricks up  now in one word will abuse the whole party most damnably  an pricks up  igad i am sure you will laugh  his predestinating ears prithee mr johnso remember little bays when next you see a presbyterian and take notice if he has not predestination in the shape of his ear i have studied men  long i will undertake to know an arminian  the setting of his wig  his predestinating ears igad there is never presbyterian shall dare to show his head without border i will put em to that expense   smith pray mr bays if any of em shou come over to the royal party would their e alter   bays would they ay igad they would she their fanatical lugs and have just such we turned ears as i have mind this ear this is a tr roman ear mine are much changed for the bett within this two years   smith then if ever the party should chance fail you might lose em for what may change m fall   bays mind mind   page    these fiery zuinglius meagre calvin bred smith those i suppose are some outlanish beasts mr bays   bays beasts a good mistake why they w the chief reformers but here i put em in so b company because they were enemies to my mo and anon when i am warmed igad you shall hear me call em doctors captains page    horses and horsemen in the very same breath you shall hear how i go on now  or else reforming corah spawned this class when opening earth made way for all to pass page      johns for all mr bays   bays yes they were all lost there but some of em wre thrown up again at the lemanlake as a catholic queen sunk at charing cross and ose again at queenhithe the fox and he came shuffled in the dark page     if ever they were stowed in noahs ark here i put a quaere whether there were any soinians before the flood which i am not very well satisfied in i have been lately apt to believe that he world was drowned for that heresy which among friends made me leave it quickened with fire below these monsters breed in fenny holland and in fruitful tweed page     now to write something new and out of the way o elevate and surprise and all that i fetch you see this quickening fire from the bottom of bogs and rivers   johns why faith that is as ingenious a conrivance as the virtuosos making a burningglass f ice   bays why was there ever any such thing let e perish if ever i heard of it the fancy was eer new to me and i thought no man had reoncild those elements but my self well genlemen thus far i have followed antiquity and s homer has numbered his ships so i have ranged y beasts here is my boar and my bear and y fox and my wolf and the rest of em all against my poor mouse now what do you think i do with all these   smith faith i dont know i suppose you make em fight   bays fight igad i would as soon make em dance no i do no earthly thing with em nothing at all igad i think they have played their parts sufficiently already i have walked em out showed em to the company and raised your expectation and now whilst you hope to see em bated and are dreaming of blood and battles they sculk off and you hear no more of em   smith why faith mr bays now you have been at such expense in setting forth their characters it had been too much to have gone through with em   bays igad so it had and then i will tell you another thing it is not every one that reads a poem through and therefore i fill the first part with flowers figures fine language and all that and then igad sink by degrees till at last i write but little better than other people and wherea most authors creep servilely after the old fellows and strive to grow upon their readers i take another course i bring in all my characters together and let em see i could go on with em bu igad i will not   johns could go on with em mr bays there no body doubts that you have a most particula genius that way   bays oh dear sir you are mighty obliging but i must needs say at a fable or an emble i think no man comes near me indeed i have studied it more than any man did you ever tak notice mr johnson of a little thing that has taken mightily about town a cat with a topknot   johns faith sir it is mighty pretty i saw  at the coffeehouse   bays it is a trifle hardly worth owning i was the other day at wills throwing out something of that nature and igad the hint was taken and out came that picture indeed the poor fellow was so civil to present me with a dozen of em for my friends i think i have one here in my pocket would you please to accept it mr johnson   johns really it is very ingenious   bays oh lord nothing at all i could design wenty of em in an hour if i had but witty felows about me to draw em i was proffered a pension to go into holland and contrive their emblems but hang em they are dull rogues and would spoil my invention but come gentlemen let us return to our business and here i will give you a delicate description of a man   smith but how does that come in   bays come in very naturally i was talking of a wolf and that supposes a wood and then i clap an epithet to it and call it a celtic wood now when i was there i could not help thinking of the french persecution and igad from all these thoughts i took occasion to rail at the french king and show that he was not of the same make with other men which thus i prove the divine blacksmith in the abyss of light page     yawning and lolling with a careless beat struck out the mute creation at a heat but he worked hard to hammer out our souls he blew the bellows and stirred up the coals long time he thought and could not on a sudden knead up with unskimd milk this reasoning pudding pge     tender and mild within its bag it lay confessing still the softness of its clay and kind as milkmaids on their wedding day till pride of empire lust and hot desire did overboil him like too great a fire and understanding grown misunderstood burned him to the pot and sourd his curdle blood    johns but sure this is a little profane mr baye   bays not at all does not virgil bring in hi god vulcan working at the anvil   johns ay sir but never thought his hand the fittest to make a pudding   bays why do you imagine him an earthly dirty blacksmith gad you make it profane indeed i will tell you there is as much difference betwixt em igad as betwixt my man and milton but now gentlemen the plot thickens he comes my the other mouse the city mouse  page    a spotted mouse the prettiest next the white ah were her spots washed out as pretty quite ag    page    with phylacteries on her forehead spread crozir in hand and mitre on her head page    three steeples argent on her sable shield lived in the city and disdind the field  johns this is a glorious mouse indeed but a you have dressed her we dont know whether s be jw papist or protestant   bays let me embrace you mr johnson for that you take it right she is a mere babel  religions and therefore she is a spotted mouse her and will be a mule presently but to go on  this princess  smith what princess mr bays   bays why this mouse for i forgot to tell yo an old lion made a left hand marriage with h mother page  0 and begot on her body elizabeth schis who was married to timothy sacriledg and ha issue graceless heresy who all give the sa coat with their mother three steeples argent  i told you before  this princess though estranged from what was best was least deformed because reformed the least page     there is de and re as good igad as ever was she in a masquerade of mirth and love page     mistook the bliss of heaven for bacchinals above and grubd the thorns beneath our tender feet to make the paths of paradise more sweet there is a jolly mouse for you let me see any body lse that can show you such another here now ave i one damnable severe reflecting line but i ant a rhyme to it can you help me mr johnson  she  humbly content to be despised at home  johns which is too narrow infamy for some   bays sir i thank you now i can go on with it  whose merits are diffused from pole to pole page     where winds can carry and where waves can roll  johns but does not this reflect upon some of our friends mr bays   bays it is no matter for that let me alone to ring my self off i will tell you lately i writ a amnd libel on a whole party sheer point and atyr all through igad called em rogues dogs and all the names i could think of but with an xceeding deal of wit that i must needs say ow it happened before i could finish this piece e scheme of affairs was altered and those people were no longer beasts here was a plunge ow should i lose my labor or libel my riend tis not every bodys talent to find a alvo for this but what do i but write a smooth elicate preface wherein i tell them that the satyr as not intended to them and this did the business   smith but if it was not intended to them against whom it was writ certainly it had no meaning  all   bays poh there is the trick on it poor fool they took it and were satisfied and yet it maul em damnably igad   smith why faith mr bays there is this ver contrivance in the preface to dear joys jests   bays what a devil do you think that l steal from such an author or ever read it   smith i cannot tell but you sometimes read a bad i have heard you quote reynard the fox   bays why there is it now take it from me mr smith there is as good morality and as soun precepts in the delectable history of reynard  fox as in any book i know except seneca pra tell me where in any other author could i have found so pretty a name for a wolf as isgrim b prithee mr smith give me no more trouble an let me go on with my mouse page    one evening when she went away from court levees and couchees past without resort there is court language for you nothing gives verse so fine a turn as an air of good breeding   smith but methinks the levees and couchee of a mouse are too great especially when she walking from court to the cooler shades   bays igad now have you forgot what i tol you that she was a princess but pray mind he the two mice meet  page    she met the country mouse whose fearful face beheld from far the common watering place nor durst approach   smith methinks mr bays this mouse strangely altered since she feared no danger   bays godsokers why no more she does n yet fear either man or beast but poor creatur she is afraid of the water for she could not swi as you see by this nor durst approach till with an awful roar page  0  the sovereign lion bad her fear no more ut besides it is above thirty pages off that i told u she feared no danger and igad if you will ve no variation of the character you must have e same thing over and over again it is the beauty  writing to strike you still with something new we but to proceed but when she had this sweetest mouse in view page  0  good lord how she admired her heavenly hiew ere now to show you i am master of all styles i  my self down from the majesty of virgil to the weetness of ovid good lord how she admired her heavenly hiew what more easy and familiar i writ this line for e ladies the little rogues weill be so fond of e to find i can yet be so tender i hate such a ough unhewen fellow as milton that a man ust sweat to read him igad you may run over is and be almost asleep the immortal mouse who saw the viceroy come so far to see her did invite her home there is a pretty name now for the spotted mouse e viceroy   smith but pray why do you call her so   bays why because it sounds prettily page    i will all her the crowngeneral presently if i have a mind o it well  did invite her home to smoke a pipe and over a sober pot discourse of oats and bedloe and the plot page     she made a courtsy like a civil dame and being much a gentlewoman came page     well gentlemen here is my first part finished and  think i have kept my word with you and given  the majestic turn of heroic poesy the rest being matter of dispute i had not such frequent ocasion for the magnificence of verse though igad they speak very well and i have heard men and considerable men too talk the very same things a great deal worse   johns nay without doubt mr bays they have received no small advantage from the smoothness of your numbers   bays ay ay i can do it if i list though you must not think i have been so dull as to mind these things my self but it is the advantage of our coffee house that from their talk one may write a ver good polemical discourse without ever troublin ones head with the books of controversy for can take the slightest of their arguments and cl em pertly into four verses which shall stare an london divine in the face indeed your knou reasonings with a long train of majors and mnors and the devil and all are too barbarous f my style but igad i can flourish better with on of these twinkling arguments than the best of e can fight with the other but we return to our mous and now i have brought em together let em e speak for themselves which they will do extremely well or i am mistaken and pray observe gentlemen if in one you dont find all the delicacy  a luxurious citymouse and in the other all the plain simplicity of a sober serious matron dame page    said the lady of the spotted muff methinks your tiff is sour your cates mere stuf there did not i tell you she would be nice  your pipes so foul that i disdain to smoke and the weed worse than ever tom i  s took  smith i did not hear she had a spotted muff before   bays why no more she has not now but s has a skin that might make a spotted muff there a pretty figure now unknown to the ancients  leave leave  poeta loquitur she is earnest you see this hoary shed and lonely hills and eat with me at groleaus smoke at wills what wretch would nibble on a hangingshelf when at pontacks he may regale himself or to the house of cleanly renish go or that at charing cross or that in channelrow do you mark me now i would by this represent the vanity of a townfop who pretends to be acquainted at all those good houses though perhaps he never was in em but hark she goes on  come at a crown a head our selves well treat champain our liquor and ragousts our meat then hand in hand well go to court dear cuz to visit bishop martin and king buz with evening wheels well drive about the park finish at lockets and reel home th dark break clattering windows and demolish doors of english manufactures  pimps and whores page      johns methinks a pimp or a whore is an odd sort of a manufacture mr bays   bays i call em so to give the parliament a hint not to suffer so many of em to be exported to the decay of trade at home  with these allurements spotted did invite from hermits cell the female proselyte oh with what ease we follow such a guide where souls are starved and senses gratified now would not you think she is going but igad youre mistaken you shall hear a long argument about infallibility before she stirs yet  page    but here the white by observation wise who long on heaven had fixed her prying eyes with thoughtful countenance and grave remark said or my judgment fails me or it is dark lest therefore we should stray and not go right through the brown horror of the starless night page    have thou infallibility that wight sternly the savage grind and thus replied that mice may err was never yet denied that i deny said the immortal dame page    there is a guide  gad i have forgot his name who lives in heaven or rome the lord know where spotted mouse loquitur had we but him sweetheart we could not err but hark you sister this is but a whim for still we want a guide to find out him here you see i dont trouble my self to keep on the narration but write white speak or dappl speaks by the side but when i get any nobl thought which i envy a mouse should say i clap it down in my own person with a pota loquitur page    which take notice is a surer sign of a fie thing in my writings than a hand in the magent anywhere else well now says white what need we find him we have certain proof that he is somewhere dame and that is enough for if there is a guide that knows the way although we know not him we cannot stray   that is true igad well said white you se her adversary has nothing to say for her self and therefore to confirm the victory she shall make  simile   smith why then i find similes are as good after victory as after a surprise   bays every jot igad or rather better well she can do it two ways page    either about emission or reception of light or else about epsomwaters but i think the last is most familiar therefore speak my pretty one  as though it is

paper of verses and indeed i put in all the lines that were worth any thing in the whole poem well but where ere we oh here they are just going up airs into the apollo from whence my white kes occasion to talk very well of tradition  thus to the place where johnson sat we climb learning on the same rail that guided him and whilst we thus on equal helps rely our wit must be as true our thoughts as high page    for as an author happily compares tradition to a wellfixt pair of stairs so this the scala sancta we believe by which his traditive genius we receive thus every step i take my spirits soar and i grow more a wit and more and more there is humor is not that the liveliest imag in the world of a mouses going up a pair of stairs more a wit and more and more   smith mr bays i beg your pardon heartily i must be rude i have a particular engagemen at this time and i see you are not near an en yet   bays godskers sure you will not serve me so all my finest descriptions and best discourse is ye to come   smith troth sir if twere not an extraordinary concern i could not leave you   bays well but you shall take a little more and here i will pass over two dainty episodes of swallows swifts chickens and buzzards   johns i know not why they should come in except to make yours the longest fable that eve was told   bays why the excellence of a fable is in the length of it aesop indeed like a slave as h was made little short simple stories with a dr moral at the end of em and could not form an noble design but here i give you fable upon fable and after you are satisfied with beasts i the first course serve you up a delicate dish o fowl for the second now i was at all this pains t buse one particular person for igad i will tell you what a trick he served me i was once translating  very good french author varillas but being something ong about it as you know a man is not always in he humor what does this jack do but puts out n answer to my friend before i had half finished he translation so there was three whole months ost upon his account but i think i have my revenge on him sufficiently for i let all the world now that he is a tall broad backed lusty fellow page     of a brown complexion fair behavior a fluent ongue and taking amongst the women and to op it all that he is much a scholar more a wit and owns but two sacraments dont you think his fellow will hang himself but besides i have o nickt his character in a name as will make you plit i call him  igad i will not tell you unless remember what i said of him   smith why that he was much a scholar and more a wit    bays right and his name is buzzard ha ha ha   johns very proper indeed sir   bays nay i have a farther fetch in it yet han perhaps you imagine for his true name begins with a b which makes me slly contrive him his to begin with the same letter there is a retty device mr johnson i learned it i must eeds confess from that ingenious sport i love my love with an a because she is amiable and  you could but get a knot of merry fellows toether you should see how little bays would top m all at it igad   smith well but good faith mr bays i ust leave you i am half an hour past my time   bays well i have done i have done here are ght hundred verses upon a rainy night and  birdsnest and here is three hundred more translated from two paris gazettes in which the spotted mouse gives an account of the treaty  peace between the czars of muscovy and the emperor which is a piece of news white do not believe and this is her answer i am resolv you shall hear it for in it i have taken occasion  prove oral tradition better than scripture no you must know it is sincerely my opinion that  had been better for the world if we never had an bibles at all  ever that gazette was printed said the white our robin told another story quite this oral truth more safely i believed my ears cannot your eyes may be deceived by word of mouth unerring maxims flow and preachings best if understood or no page  words i confess bound by and trip so light we have not time to take a steady sight yet fleeting thus are plainer than when writ to long examination they submit hard things  mr smith if these two lin dont recompense your stay never trust john bay again  hard things at the frist blush are clear and full page    god mends on second thoughts but man grows du igad i judge all men by my self it is so wi me i never strove to be very exact in any thi but i spoiled it   smith but allowing your character to be tru is it not a little too severe   bays it is no matter for that these gene reflections are daring and savor most of a no genius that spares neither friend nor foe   johns are you never afraid of a drubbing for that daring of your noble genius   bays afraid why lord you make so much of a beating igad it is no more to me than a flea biting no no if i can but be witty upon em let em en lay on in faith i will never baulk my fancy to save my carcass well but we must dispatch mr smith  thus did they merrily carouse all day and like the gaudy fly their wings display and sip the sweets and bask in great apollos ray well there is an end of the entertainment and mr smith if your affairs would have permitted you would have heard the best bill of fare that ever was served up in heroicks but here follows a dispute shall recommend it self i will say nothing for it for dapple who you must know was a protestant all this while trusts to her own judgment and foolishly dislikes the wine upon which our innocent does so run her down that she has not one word to say for her self but what i put in her mouth and igad you may imagine they will not be very good ones for she has disobliged me like an ingrate  sirrah says brindle thou have brought us wine sour to my taste and to my eyes unfine says will all gentlemen like it ah says white what is approved by them must needs be right it is true i thought it bad page    but if the house commend it i submit a private mouse mind that mind the decorum and defference which our mouse pays to the company  nor to their catholic consent oppose my erring judgment and reforming nose ah ah there she has nickt her that is up to thee hilts igad and you shall se dapple resnts it  why what a devil shall not i trust my eyes must i drink stum because the rascal lies and palms upon  catholic consent to give sophisticated brewings vent    says white what ancient evidence can sway if you must argue thus and not obey drawers must be trusted through whose hands conveyed you take the liquor or you spoil the trade for sure those honest fellows have no knack of puting of stumd clart for ponack how long alas would the poor vintner last if all that drink must judge and every guest be allowed to have an understanding ast thus she nor could the panther well enlarge with weak defense against so strong a charge there i call her a panther because she spotted which is such a blot to the reformation as i warrant em they will never claw off igad  but with a weary yawn that showed her pride said spotless was a villain and she lied white saw her cankered malice at that word and said her prayers and drw her delphic sword the other cried murder and her rage restrained and thus her passive character maintained but now alas  mr johnson pray mind me this mr smith  you to stay no longer for this that follow is so engaging hear me but two lines igad and go away afterward if you can  but now alas i grieve i grieve to tell what sad mischance these pretty things befell these birds of beasts  there is a tender expression birds of beasts it is the greatest affront that you can put upon any bird to call it beast of a bird page     and a beast is so fond of being called a bird as you cannot imagine  these birds of beasts these learned reasoning mice were separated banished in a trice who would be learned for their sakes who wise ay who indeed there is a pathos igad genlemen if that will not move you nothing will i can assure you but here is the sad thing i was fraid of  the constable alarmed by this noise entered the room directed by the voice and speaking to the watch with head aside page      said desperate cures must be to desperate ills applied thse gentlemen for so their fate decrees can ner enjoy at once the but and peace page     page      hen ach have separate interests of their own two mice are one too many for a town by schism they are torn and therefore brother ok you to one and i will secure the the other w whither dapple did to bridewell go o in the stocks all night her fingers blow page     or in the compter lay concerns not us to know ut the immortal matron spotless white orgetting dapples rudeness malice spite ookd kindly back and wept and said good night page     ten thousand watchmen waited on this mouse with bills and halberde to her country house this last contrivance i had from a judicious author that makes ten thousand angels wait upon hi hind and she asleep too igad    johns come let us see what we have to pay   bays what a pox are you in such have yo hant told me how you like it   johns oh extremely well here drawer   finis the eagle and the robin an apologue ranslated from the original of aesop written two thousand years since and now rendered in familiar verse by h g l mag with an old cats prophecy ken out of an old copy of verses supposed to be writ by john lidgate a monk of bury  london nted and sold by h hills in blackfryars near the waterside   0   the preface good precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity and here i present my good reader with one deliver by the first founder of mythology aesop himf maximus planudes takes notice of it as a ery excellent part of his production and phoeus cameratius and others seem to agree that s eagle and five others not yet translated are al to any of his that are handed down to us ho mr ogleby and sir roger lestrange had the nhappiness to be unacquainted with them yet i d the good fortune to discover them by the reoval of my old library which has made me aends for the trouble of getting to where i now each they were written or dictated at least  aesop in the fifty fourth olympiad and though i signed them chiefly for the use of my school this ing translated by a youth designed for a greek prossor yet no man is so wise as not to need instruion ay and by the way of fable too since the doly scriptures themselves the best instructors ach us by way of parable symbol image and igure and david was more moved with nathans  thou art the man than all the most rigid lectures in the world would have done whoeve will be at the trouble of comparing this vers with the original let them begin at the tenth lin and they will find it metaphrastically done verbu verbo as the best way of justice to the author  those that are mere adorers of  w not be angry that it is in this sort of meter s which i gave leave the lad having a turn to the sort of measure which is pleasant and agreeabl though not lofty for my own part i concur with m master aristotle that  are ve far from being unnecessary or unpleasant  may this be of use to thee and it will please  thine in all good wishes horat gran  the eagle and the robin a fable a lady lived in former days that well deserved the utmost praise for greatness birth and justice famed and every virtue could be named which made her course of life so even that she is a saint if dead in heaven this lady had a little seat st like a palace twas so neat om ought but goodness her retreat one morning in her giving way s was her custom every day o cheer the poor the sick and cold r with apparel fookd or gold here came a gazing stranger by n whom she quickly cast an eye the man admiring made a stand e had a bird upon his hand what is that says she that hangs it head nking and faint it is almost dead adam a redbreast that i found  this wet season almost drowned h bring him in and keep him warm obins do never any harm they soon obeyed and chopped him meat gave him whatever he would eat the lady care her self did take and made a nest for robins sake but he perkt up into her chair in which he plenteously did fare assuming quite another air the neighbors thought when this they spied the world well mended on his side with welltuned throat he whistld long and every body liked his song at last said they this little thing will kill it self so long to sing well closet him among the rest of those my lady loves the best they little thought that saw him come that robins were so quarrelsome the door they opened in he pops and to the highest perch he hops the partycolored birds he chose the goldfinches and such as those with them he would peck and bill and feed and very well at times agreed canary birds were his delight with them he would test a test all night but the brown linnets went to pot he killed em all upon the spot the servants were employed each day instead of work to part some fray and wished the aukard fellow cursed that brought him to my lady first at last they all resolved upon it some way to tell my lady on it mean while he would had a noble swing and ruled just like the galli king having killed or wounded all unless the eagle in the hall with whom he durst but only jar he being the very soul of war but hated him for his desert and bore him malice at his heart this eagle was my ladys pride the guardian safety of her side he often brought home foreign prey which humbly at her feet he lay for color pinions and stature the fairest workmanship of nature twoud do one good to see him move o full of grandeur grace and love he was indeed a bird for jove he soared aloft in brucums field and thousand kites and vultures killed which made him dear to all that flew unless to robin and his crew one day poor bob puffed up with pride thinking the combat to abide a goosequill on for weapon tied knowing by use that now and then a sword less hurt does than a pen as for example  what at home you have well contrived to do at rome a pen blows up  before you come you are supposed to undermine the foe  in some immense design a pen can bite you with a line there is forty ways to give a sign well  all on fire away he stalked till come to  where the eagle walked bob did not shill i shall i go nor said one word of friend or foe but flirting at him made a blow as gamecocks with their gauntlets do at which the eagle gracefully cast a disdaining sparkling eye as who should say  what is this a fly but no revenge at all did take he spared him for their ladys sake who pondered these things in her mind and took the conduct of the eagle kind upon reflection now  to show what harm the least of things may do mad robin with his cursed flirt one of the eagles  amongst the greeks signifies honor as tender the eye eyes had hurt inflamed it made it red and sore but the affront inflamed it more oh how the family did tear to fire the house could scarce forbear with scorn not pain the eagle fired murmured disdain and so retired robin to offer some relief in words like these would heal their grief should the eagle die  which heaven forbid we ought some other to provide i do not say that any now are fit but in a year or two and should this mighty warrior fall they should not want a general as men have long observed that one misfortune seldom comes alone just in the moment this was done ten thousand foes in sight were come vultures and kites and birds of prey in flocks so thick  they darkened day a longconcerted force and strong vermin of all kinds made the throng foxes were in the faction joined who waited their approach to ground by every hand from common fame the frightful face of danger came one cries what help now  who can tell i am glad the eagles here and well another out of breath with fear says thousands more near sea appear they will swop our chickens from the door we never were so set before we are glad the eagle will forget and the invaders kill or beat reserved and great his noble mind above all petty things inclined abhorred the thoughts of any thing but what his ladys peace could bring who blessed him first and bad him do as he was wont and beat the foe burning and restless as the sun until this willing work was done he whets his talons stretched his wings his lightning darts and terror flings towers with a flight into the sky these million monsters to descry prepared to conquer or to dye the party that so far was come thought not the eagle was at home to fame and danger used in field they knew he would quickly made em yield but on assurance he was near encumbered faint and dead with fear they made with hurry toward the lakes and he his pinions over em shakes they had not with such horror filled the courage to let one be killed they fled and left no foe behind unless it were the fleeting wind only  a man by water took two fine young merlins and a roo the family had now repose but with the sun the eagle rose the imperial bird pursued the foe more toil than rest inured to know he winged his way to latian land where first was hatched this murdering band he darted death wherever he came some of em dying at his name their mighty foe  a fatal pledge their bowels tore through every hedge they flutter shriek and caw and hiss their strength decays and fears increase but most the chevaliers the geese so many slaughtered fowl there was their carcasses blockt up the ways the rest he drove half spent pellmell quite to the walls of pontifell robin at home though mad to hear he should so conquer every where expostulated thus with fear ungrateful i that so have stirred against this generous noble bird wast thou not first by him preferred let us leave him in his gall to burn and back to pontifell return there some to chimneytops aspire to turrets some that could fly higher some bove a hundred miles were gone to roost them at byzantium alas in vain was their pretense he broke through all their strong defense down went their fences wires and all perches and birds together fall none hoped his power to withstand but gave the nest to his command they told him of ten thousand more in flocks along the ganges shore safe in their furrows free from trouble like partridges among the stubble he spreads himself and cuts the air and steady flight soon brought him there lord how deceived and vexed he was to find they were but mere jackdaws a hundred thousand all in sight they all could chatter not one fight i will deal by them as is their due shough cried the eagle off they flew his flashing eyes their hearts confounds though by their flight secure from wounds which was a signal fatal baulk to a late swift italian hawk the eagle would no rest afford till he had sent my lady word who when she heard the dear surprise wonder and joy stood in her eyes my faithful eagle have thou then my mortal foes destroyed again return return and on me wait be thou the guardian of my gate thee and thy friends are worth my care thy foes if any such there are shall my avenging anger share so  lest new ills should intervene she turned the robin out again the samians now in vast delight bless their good lady day and night wish that her life might never be done but everlasting as the sun the eagle high again did soar the lady was disturbed no more but all things flourished as before robin red breast with the beasts one that had in her infant state while playing at her fathers gate seen and was most hugely smitten with young dog and dirty kitten had took them up and lugd em in and made the servants wash em clean when she to a fit age was grown to be sole mistress of her own then to her favor and strange trust she raised these two in rank the first the dog who with gilt collar graced strutted about the cat was placed over all the house to domineer and kept each wight of her in fear while he over all the plains had power that savage wolves might not devour her flocks she gave him charge great care to take but beasts uncertain are now see by these what troubles rise to those who in their choice unwise put trust in such for he soon joined with beasts of prey the dog combined who killed the sheep and tore the hind while he would stand and grin and bark concealing thus his dealings dark a wolf or so sometimes he would take and then o what a noise he would make but with wild beasts oerrun yet are the plains some die for want of fare or torn or killed the shepherds find each day are lost of every kind thy silly sheep lament in vain of their hard fate not him complain the shepherds and the servants all against the traitor loudly baul but there was none that dared to tell their lady what to them befell for puss a fox of wondrous art brought in to help and take their part by whose assistance to deceive she made her every lie believe one lucky day when she was walking in her woods with servants talking and stopped to hear how very well a redbreast sung then him to dwell with her she called he came and took his place next to a favorite rook where robin soon began to sing such songs as made the house to ring he sung the loss and death of sheep in notes that made the lady weep how for his charge the dog unfit took part with foes and shepherds bit even from his birth he did him trace and show him cur of shabby race the first by wandering beggars fed his sire advanced turned spit for bread himself each trust had still abused to steal what he should guard was used from puppy known wherever he came both vile and base and void of shame the cat he sung that none could match or venomed spite or cruel scratch that from a witch transformed she came who kittend three of equal fame this first one dead of tabby fur the third survives much noise of her had been a cat well known with ease on errands dark over land and seas she would journeys take to cub of bear from these intriguing beasts who swear they will bring him to defend the wrong that they have done again he sung how tabby once in moonlight night trotted with letter fox did write in which he sends his best respects to the shebear and thus directs madam said he your cub safe send none shall his worship soon offend it is all i can at present do to serve him as his friends well know at this the beasts grew in such rage that none their fury could assuage nay puss her lady would have scratched and tore her eyes but she was watched for she would set up her back and mew and thrice even in her face she flew the dog like an ungrateful spark at her would dare to snarl and bark her tenants wondering stood to hear that she their insolence would bear and offered their assistance to soon make them better manners know but she to avoid all farther rout her window opening turned bob out hoping that then her beasts would live in peace and no disturbance give yet nothing she can do avails their rage against her still prevails though puss was warned to fear their fate n lines by old prophetic cat writ before her transformation when she was in the witchs station foretelling thus when beasts are grown to certain heights before unknown of human race some shall aloud inflame and arm a dreadful crowd who in vast numbers shall advance and to new tunes shall make them dance when this begins no longer hope for all remains is ax and rope but not detered by this they dared with some who of their plunder shared to affront their lady and conspire to many with her money hire contemning her to pay undue regards unto this bestial crew though these resembled human shapes they were indeed no more than apes who some in house and some in wood and others in high boxes stood that chattring made such noise and stir how all was due to fox and cur till by their false deluding way she found her flocks begin to stray still robin does for her his care and zeal express on whom yet are his thoughts all fixed on her he dreams each night her praises are his themes n songs all day now perched on tree finding himself secure and free he pertly shakes his little wings ets up his throat again he sings that she had left no other way o save her flocks and end this fray but soon to her assistance take one who could make these monsters shake a wellknown huntsman who has skill the fiercest beasts to tame or kill at her command he would come and he would make her great and set them free that should these beasts some evil day bring cub into her grounds she may depend that not her self they will spare since to insult her now they dare all she at best can hope for then is to be safe shut up in den since by sure signs all these ingrate are known to bear her deadly hate he ends his song and prays to heaven that she may have the wisdom given before it be too late to take such resolutions as may make her safe and that these beasts no more to ravage in the plains have power finis a hymn to peace  ccasiond by the two houses joining in one address to the queen  by the author of the trueborn englishman  london printed in the year mdccix  a hymn to peace hail image of the eternal mind the only perfect blessing of mankind thou emblem of the sacred rest

make it so if nations thou or souls have once possessed from all their broils and burdens they are released all human happiness attends on thee in gaol thou sets the prisoner free f thou unlockst the fetters of the mind  spite of bars and bolts it is unconfined tell us bright nymph by what strange art thou fanst the heated souls of men oppressed coolst all the fury of the heart and guidst the mind to light and rest tell us great interposing something how to thy great influence all the passions bow how thou denyst the gust of sweet revenge can all to calms and softness change in the least moment act thy part and lock up all the labrinths of the heart filled with just rage the furious spirits take arms when injury and power to hurt combine what mind can once resist the unhappy charms where wished revenge with wished occasion join when the exasperated passions rage and all the man against himself engage the mighty tempests rise within and strong convulsions act the swelling spleen when fury leads him to the fatal brink thou turnst him round but once and make him think the ungoverned wretch in arms appears against his eyes against his ears judges of nothing scorns his sense lampoons his nature bullies providence headlong he seeks to give his fury vent bursting with rage and swelled with discontent then thy soft showers distill upon the soul and all the frenzy of the mind control reduce the wretch by rage and passions blind to exercise the optics of his mind thy balmy dews the raging storms restrain and cool the fermentations of his brain assisting reason in her just defense and hand in hand conduct him to his sense disperses all the vapors that remain brings him to act and so restores the man touched with thy scepters golden point the hypochondraick poisons lose their taint the infecting venom of inflamed desire flows back and of it self puts out the fire the soul returns to rectitude and shows that heaven within from whence that influence flows blessed peace may

and fall out with peace ow soon does war its vile effects explain and his own miseries inform the man damned to repentance and his fate shows him his follies but too late with crowds of consequential harms oppressed he learns the sweetness of unvalud rest but learns it at a price so dear as makes his early follies soon appear both sides well beaten call for peace and find too late their happiness their mutual mischiefs mutual wits restore and show them both that both were fools before then goddss to thy courts they sue with penitence most likely to be true for none repent like those that feel

pretense of war when tyrants in thy robes appear when kings by lust of rule and power misled pampered by providence and over fed fall out for power to oppress and then pretend it is all for peace ambition that old painted whore of state that she may look as fair as great wears thy old clothes and in that gaudy dress with ease obtains the name of peace clothed in thy robes how fair she looks and bright and shines delusive beams of borrowed light makes gilded injury appear with charms of right and sanctifies the war as princes when they weaker powers oppress first give them poverty then call it peace war devastation violence and blood as guilty men would have them understood all in their turn pretend to peace and cry out property when they oppress chaste nymph how is thy name

momus patron of the halftaught race to our surprise and thy disgrace what rabble have thou clothed with power and law to keep inferior k  s in awe exalting fools to make the nations wise and hoodwink justice with the vile disguise momus makes justices and lists the band that should reform the vicious land and from the huge bordelloes of the nation sets humane devils up for reformation were all the rabble of his magistrates upn the stage of shame do take their seats never was such a cavalcade of sin so grave without so black within never was peace buffoond at such a rte or crime so courted by the magistrate see sleepy momus see thy chosen race hell in the heart and justice in the face the countrys scandal and thy shame lewd in their manners vile in name in aspect grave and dissolute in life correct the husband and debauch the wife never was bench of justice so supplied and peace by her own sons defied with beaus and boys with bullies and buffoons just so the french reform by their dragoons momus in strict confedracy with crime too plain his project and too long his time with sublimated spleen and partystrife debauched in politics but grave in life the bench the pulpit and the bar supplies with high church sons of war the party not the manners he enquires and thus he kindles high church fires w  h now no more shall modest men alarm debauched by custom when he thinks no harm ancient in vice and inncent in crime and quite worn out with sin and time be hell born ch  s now the satyrs mark that swears by daylight murders in the dark supplies his want of vice by want of wit

too drunk to act he blushed to execute the vast extent of power that momus never blushed to grant it is hard his drink should sense refine but see the modesty of wine b  gate the first converting church dragoon first mounts his horse to pull dissenters down see him into the assembly ride the justice tell the priest he lyd the language like the posture very wise ust as he acted peace in grave

vice and he is a fool indeed that is never wise but well no more the catalogue survey momus himself has led the way may the black list of his infernal troop like him to wiser agents stoop the blushing nation long has seemed to wait when guilt should make him abdicate that meaner men of justice may take place that have it more in head and less in face nor shall our verse examine here the lists of his exalted modernpriests how like the rest in morals and in sense and how by sadder consequence religion languishes and justice dies over run with vice and immoralities how sacred oracles decay and vice pulls down the church the shortest way tell us no more of crown and church no more our loyalty reproach the men of god pull down your fabric more than all the sons of hell that went before when laws with ignorance over run and justice dies the states undone when sacred vestments sacred villains hide and crimes by habit sanctified religion prostitute the text profaned good god how can we think the church should stand these her foundations undermine and then to hide the vile design the innocent in ruder terms reproach and cry the danger of the church nor let our harity be censured here because we crowds o characters forbear the bead roll of whose crimes would show too back for our posterity to know and are concealed in mere compassion not to themseles a one but all the nation that foreign countries may not see our ecclesiastic nudity and it become a new proverbial jest to be as wicked as an english priest and yet our lines must to our selves be just some crimes may not be told but others must when men cannot their own dsgrace withold what cannot be avoided must be old blush readers for a bleeding nations fate when we the name of a   relate a modest pen can hardly bear to write the crimes he never blushes to commit it is hard when men run up to such a height what poets would conceal themselves will write their actions such a vein of crime contain it is their own satyr and they are spared in vain and should i this one character forbear the stones themselves the horrid facts would speak how he with hypocritick prayer his peoples sundays blessing can prepare and damns them all the week covered with sacred robes he is white and clean but black with slander s all debauched within yet lest the churchs cause should sink he dares to tread on the commandments brink usurps upon the keeper of the fold and swears his curacys a good freehold and yet this wretch with horrid front pretends to rank himself among the churchs friends scandal to all religions were the church once freed from that too just reproach that she does not such sons of crime expel she would stand in spite of all the gates of hell was ever nation thus buffoond by her own teachers she is lampoond ye hypocrites if you can understand reform your clergy and your church will stand vice is the churchs danger and disease it is crime alone destroys her peace it is crime lets error in and error strife you would soon reform her doctrine in her life f you would then the churchs fame restore give her but peace she asks no more peace would turn all her men of scandal out tell me the church

spoke and all hi party has obeyed ome trifling hopes indeed their fear delayed but when britannias sons addressed their queen despair that mark of hell was plainly seen pale with the anguish of their minds their envy no emission finds but dumb with rage they view the hated peac that fixes englands happiness pity their weakened rage and take some care watch em good people all lest in despair they obey the deyl and hang themselves for fear it is done bright peace has got the d the mists of parties flee away the dazzling beams of heavenly glory shine immortal peace the victorys fairly thine

men appear who levied first this highchurch war let them the wondrous declaration read that struck their hydra through his hundredth head let them their pulpitecchoes contradict twas there they did just peace reject twas there that noise of nothing first they broac their country and their queen reproached frighted our children wih the uncouth cry of danger to the church and monarchy alarmed the nation roused britannias sons each hero to the place of hazard runs but to their joy surpised no less they found twas all in perfect peace safety and peace in thriving posture grow and none saw danger here but those that wished i let all those mountebanks of state receive for peace is to death to them their  let all the healing breezes of thy air stagnate their hopes of partywar let men of strife and chagrin feel within the strong convulsions of expiring sin the nation felt it like a man possessed and strong exorcisms dislodge the dreadful guest the struggles of departing feud will make perhaps some ravings in the blood which vented at the tongue with rage and pain may cause long speeches to be made in vain it is but the pangs of their departing breath are there no thunders tremblings of the earth daystars and comets to presage horror often stirs when devils quit the stage als vanished here the fiends withdrew their partystruggles mean and few some small vulcanos belched their stench and fire but twas en passant f  t and so expire like meteors in the air that fly as soon as they are inflamed they die or guns where soon as air has vent just as the noise is made it is spent so had our clamours at the approach of peace just life enough to hiss and then decease they are dead the blazing aspect of thy face immortal peace has cleared the place see daily how their fugitives come in and crowds of captives bow before thy queen the leaders own the fair defeat and all their bubbld votaries submit pride boils in some and makes them scorn to yield but shame has bid them quit the field submit to unexpected fate and own their partyfortunes desperate nor is this all misfortunes never alone now they are in danger to be quite undone the circumstance is very dark they cannot bite and must not bark or if they do it is frenzy all and feud and is but laughed at by the multitude hard fate of madmen that when they are in pain no men regard when they complain thus feud and partystrife suppressed and dead millions of mischiefs with them fled envy with teeming prospects swelled and big does now the grave of her own off spring dig abortive pojects daily come the nauseous froth of her miscarrying womb like monsters by their parents hands they die and peace does calmly all their rage defy what wild effort what strange delirious dreams what undigested halfdrawn schemes what inconsistent unsubsisting thought have they from unperforming envy brought what brainless unconcocted things proceed the effects of windmills in the head what engines without form or shape the great machine of government to ape what shifts what shams what artless terms of state that hasten rather than prevent their fate have all our men of speeches tried before their sickening party died was ever head with brain and learning stored that did of old such wondrous things afford at one half turn so gravely mad so many mean incongruous nothings said how weak are all disgises to conceal that folly which its own defects reveal nonsense infallibly affords something that cannot be concealed by words and inconsistence will in spite of rule if it conceals the k   e betray the f     l therefore to judge them termagant and mad are the best natured things that can be said for he that can his native country curie if he is  ditacted must be worse soft gentle peace pcuiar to thee how  less is thy victory the rebels that withstand thy law are only bound from harms and kept in awe their schemes indeed are balked their projects slain their persons all in life remain are safe in their subjection to thy name only receive their punishment in shame nor does the gentle conquror only spare her rebels but those rebels taste her care under he soft and gentle shade he keeps them happy that her realms invade prevents them only of that harm they would do themselves and with her gentle charm he ts them all her subjects blessings share and learns them thus the difference of peace and war

quaeve quiritium etc attempted in the style of pindar occasioned by the wonderful successes of the arms of her majesty and her allies with a letter to a gentleman in the university  by samuel cobb m a  london printed by h hills and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster   0   a letter to a gentleman in the university sir this comes to congratulate you on the agreeable news of some late extraordinary successes which have blessed the arms of her majesty and her allies i leave you to the printed papers for a particular account of those actions which have surpised the world and we hope given the last stroke to the languishing power of the common enemy of europe they will furnish noble topics for the wits of an university like yours who can embellish if that can be done the glories of a female reign with a juster sublimity of verse than what you will find in the following performance which was written several months ago and not run over with a hasty negligence the ode from whence i take my hint is accounted by some critics not inferior to the  th of the same book which begins thus qualem ministrum fulminis alitem etc and was written in complement to augustus on occasion of a famous victory gained by tiberius as this which i have aimed to imitate was written on the praise of claudius nero i need not inform men of your reading and letters what occasioned both the poet as he does in almost all his odes has shown a peculiar artfulness and elegance and turns all the panegyric on the emperor who was not in the action with te concilium and tuos praebente divos if you ask wherein i have trod in the steps of horace you will find it in the beginning i have only kept him in view and used him only where he was serviceable to my design he took the same liberty with alcaeus as appears from some fragments of that greek lyriac quoted by athenaeus in my digressions and transitions i have taken care to play always in sight and make every one of them contribute to my main design this was the way of pindar to read whom according to rapin will give a truer idea of the ode than all the rules and reflections of the best critics i will not pretend to have dived into him over head and ears but i have endeavored to have made my self not the greatest stranger to his manner of writing which generally consists in the dignity of the sentiments and an elegant variety which makes the reader rise up with greater satisfaction than he sat down and that which affects the mind in compositions of any sort will never be disagreeable to a gentleman of ingenuity and judgment i have avoided turns as thinking that they debase the loftiness of the ode you will easily perceive whether i have reached that acer spiritus and vis recommended by horace as the genius of poetry whether you will call the following lines a pindaric ode or irregular stanzas gives me no disturbance for however the seeming wildness of this sort of verse ought to be restrained the strophe antistrophe etc will never bear in english and it would show a strange debauchery in our taste if it should as may be witnessed by the servile imitation of the dactyles and spondees used by sir p sidney but to make an e of this tedious epistle you will see through the whole that her majesty is the chief heroine of the ode and the moral at the end shows the solid glories of a reign which is not founded on a pretended justice or criminal magnanimity  yours etc s c  the female reign an ode i what can the british senate give to make the name of anna live by future people to be sung the labor of each grateful tongue can faithful registers or rhyme in charming eloquence or sprightly wit the wonders of her reign transmit to the unborn children of succeeding time can painters oil or statuarys art eternity to her impart no  titled statues are but empty things inscribed to royal vanity the sacrifice of flattery to lawless neros or bourbonian kings true virtue to her kindred stars aspires does all our pomp of stone and verse surpass and mingling with aetherial fires no useless ornament requires from speaking colors or from breathing brass ii greatest of princes where the wandering sun does over earths habitable regions roll from the eastern barriers to the western goal and sees thy race of glory run with swiftness equal to his own thee on the banks of flandrian scaldis sings the jocund swain released from gallic fear the english voice unused to hear thee the repeating banks thee every valley rings the gaul untaught to bear the flames of those who drink the maese or thames from the britannick valor flies no longer able to withstand the thunderbolt launched by a female hand or lightning darted from her eyes iii what treble ruin pious anna brings on false electors perjured kings let the twice fugitive bavarian tell who from his airy hope of better state by lust of sway irregularly great like an apostate angel fell who by imperial favor raised in the highest rank of glory blazed and had till now unrivaled shone more than a king contented with his own but lucifers bold steps he trod who durst assault the throne of god and for contented realms of blissful light gained he sad privilege to be the first in solid misery monarch of hell and woes and endless night corruption of the best is worst and foul ambition like an evil wind blights the fair blossoms of a noble mind and if a seraph fall he is doubly cursed iv had guile and pride and envy grown in the black groves of styx alone nor ever had on earth the baleful crop been sown the swain without

arms to engage the threatening hydra faction of the age once more prpares his dreadful pen to wield and every muse attends him to the field by art and nature for this task designed yet modestly the fight he long declined forbore the torrent of his verse to pour nor loosed his satyr till the needful hour his sovreigns right by patience half betrayed waked his avenging genius to its aid blessed muse whose wit with such a cause was crowned and blessed the cause that such a champion found with chosen verse upon the foe he falls and black sedition in each quarter galls yet like a prince with subjects forced to engage secure of conquest he rebates his rage his fury not without distinction sheds hurls mortal bolts but on devoted heads to less infected members gentle found he spares or else pours balm into wound such generous grace the ungrateful tribe abuse and trespass on the mercy of his muse their wretched dogrell rhimers forth they bring to snarl and bark against the poets king a crew that scandalize the nation more than all their treasoncanting priests before on these he scarce vouchsafes a scornful smile but on their powerful patrons turns his style a style so keen as even from faction draws the vital poison stabs to the heart their cause ake then great bard what tribute we can raise accept our thanks for you transcend our praise n tate  epistle to the whigs for to whom can i dedicate this poem with so much justice as to you ts the representation of your own hero it is the picture drawn at length which you prize and admire so much i little none of your ornaments are wanting neither the landscap of the tower nor the rising sun nor the anno domini of your ne sovereigns coronation this must needs be a grateful undertaking  your whole party especially to those who have not been so happy  to purchase the original i hear the graver has made a good marks of it all his kings are bought up already or the value of the rmainder so inhancd that many a poor polander who would be gl to worship the image is not able to go to the cost of him but must  content to see him here i must confess i am no great rtist but sig post painting will serve the turn to remember a friend by especial when better is not to be had yet for your comfort the lineame are true and though he fate not five times to me as the did to  yet i have consulted history as the italian painters do when the would draw a nero or a galigul though they have not seen t man they can help their imagination by a statue of him and s out the coloring from suetomus and tacitus truth is you mig have spared one side of your medal the head would be seen to m advantage if it were placed on a spike of the tower a little nearer the sun which would then break out to better purpose you tell  your preface to the noprotestant plot that you shall be forced  after to leave off your modesty i suppose you mean that little which  left you for it was worn to rags when you put out this medal  ver was there practiced such a piece of notorious impudence in the f of an establishd government i believe when he is dead you  wear him in thumbrings as the turks did scanderbeg as if  were virtue in his bones to preserve you against monarchy yet  this while you pretend not only zeal for the public good but a due  eration for the person of the king but all men who can see an  before them may easily detect those gross fallacies that it is necessay for men in your circumstances to pretend both is granted you for without them there could be no ground to raise a faction but i would ask you one civil question what right has any man among you or any association of men to come nearer to you who out of parliament cannot be considered in a public capacity to meet as you daily do in factious clubs to vilify the government in your discourses and to libel it in all your writings who made you judges in isral or how  it consistent with your zeal of the public welfare to promote sedition does your definition of loyl which is to serve the king according to the laws allow you the license of traducing the executive power with which you own he is invested you complain that his majesty has lost the love and confidence of his people and by your very urging it you endeavor what in you lies to make him lose them all god subjects abhor the thought of arbitrary power whether it be in one or many if you were the patriots you would seem you would not at this ate incense the multitde to assume it for no sober man can fear it either from the kings disposition or his practice or even where you would odiously lay it from his ministers give us leave to enjoy the government and the benefit of laws under which we were born and which we desire to transmit to our posterity you are not the trustees of the public liberty and if you have not right to petition in a crowd much less have you to intermeddle in the management of affairs or to arraign what you do not like which in effect is every thing that is done by the king and council can you imagine that any reasonable man will believe you respect the person of his majesty when  apparent that your seditious pamphlets are stuffed with particular reflections on him if you have the confidence to deny ths it is easy to e evinced from a thousand pssages which i only forbear to quote because i desire they should de and be forgotten i have perused many of ur papers and to show you that i have the third part of your noprotestant plot is much of it stolen from your dead authors pamphlet lld the growth of popery as manifestly as milons defense of the english people is from buchaa de jur regn apud scoos or your first covenant and new associaion from the holy league of the french guisards any one who reads dvila may trace your practices all aong there were the same pretenses for reformation and loyalty the ame aspersions of the king and the same grounds of a rebellion i ow not whether you will take the historians word who says it was eported that pltrot a hugonot murdered fancis duke of guise by he instigations of theodore reza or that it was a hugot minister therwise called a presbyterian for our church abhors so devilish a enet who first writ a treatise of the lawfulness of dpsing and murhering kings of a different persuasion in religion but i am able to rove from the doctrine of calvin and principles of buhman that hey set the people above the magistrate which if i mistake not is your own fundamental and which carries your loyalty no farther than your liking when a vote of the house of commons goes on your side you ae as ready to observe it as if it were passed into a law but wh you are pinched with any former and yet unrepealed act of parliment you declare that in some cases you will not be obliged by it the passage is in the same third part of the noprotestant plot and is  plain to be denied the late copy of your intended association you neither wholly justify nor condemn but as the papists when they are u opposed fly out into all the pageantries of worship but in times  war when they are hard pressd by arguments ly close intrenchd behind the council of nt so now when your affairs are in a lo condition you dre not pretend that to be a legal combination  whensever you are afloat i doubt not but it will be maintained a justified to purpose for indeed there is nothing to defend it but t sword it is the proper time to say any thing when men have all thing in their power  in the mean time you would fain be nibling at a parallel betwixt t association and that in the time of queen elizabeth but there ths small difference betwixt them that the ends of one are directly opposite to the other one with the queens approbation and conjuncti as head of it the other without either the consent or knowledge the king against whose authority it is manifestly designed there you do well to have recourse to your last evasion that it was contri by your enemies and shuffled into the papers that were seized wh yet you se the nation is not so easy to believe as your own jury  the matter is not difficult to find    men in newgate who would  quit a malefactor  i have one only favor to desire of you at parting that when  think of answering this poem you would employ the same pens aga it who have combated with so much success against absalom and a tophel for then you may assure your selves of a clear victory w the least reply rail at me abundantly and not to break a custo do it without wi by this method you will gain a considerable pe which is wholly to wave the answer of my arguments never own  bottom of your principles for fear they should be treason fall sevely on the miscarriages of government for if candal be not alow you are no free born subjects if god ha not blessed you with the  lnt of riming make ue of my poor stock and welcome let  verses run upon my feet and for the utmost refuge of notorious b heads reducd to the last extremity of sense turn my own lines  me and in utter despair of your own satyr make me satyrize my  some of you have been driven to this bay already but above all  rest commend me to the nonconformist parson who writ the whip  key i am afraid it is not read so much as the piece deserves bec the bookseller is every week crying help at the end of his guzette gt it off you see i am charitable enough to do him a kindness  it may be published as well as printed and that so much skill in hebrew derivations may not lie for wastepaper in the shop yet i half suspect he went no farther for his learning than the index of hebrew names and etymologies which are printed at the end of some english bibles if achitophel signify the brother of a fool the author of that poem will pass with his readers for the next of kin and perhaps it is the relation that makes the kindness whatever the verses are buy em up i beseech you out of pity for i hear the conventicle is shut up and the brother of achitophel out of service  now footmen you know have the generosity to make a purse for a member of their society who has had his livery pulled over his ears and even protestant socks are bought up among you out of veneration to the name a dissenter in poetry from sense and english will make as good a protestant rhimer as a dissenter from the church of englnd a protestant parson besides if you encourage a young beginner who knows but he may elevate his style a little above the vulgar epithes of profane and saucy jack and atheistick scribler with which he treats me when the fit of enthusiam is strong upon him by which wellmannerd and charitable expressions i was certain of his sect before i knew his name what would you have more of a man he has damned me in your cause from genesis to the revelations and has half the texts of both the testaments against me if you will be so civil to your selves as to take him for your interpreter and not to take them for irish witnesses after all perhaps you will tell me that you retained him only for the opening of your cause and that your main lawyer is yet behind now if it so happen he meet with no more reply than his predecessors you may either conclude that i trust to the goodness of my cause or fear my adversary or disdain him or what you please for the short on it is it is indifferent to your humble servant whatever your party says or thinks of him  the medal a satyr against sedition of all our antic sights

forced to crown another son thus when the heir was from the vineyard thrown the rich possession was the murthrers own in vain to sophistry they have recourse by proving theirs no plot they prove it is worse unmasked rebellion and audacicus force which though not actual yet all eyes may see it is working in the immediate power to be for from pretended grievances they rise first to dislike and after to despise then cycloplike in humane flesh to deal chop up a minister at every meal perhaps no wholly to melt down the king but clip his regl rights within the ring from thence to assume the power of peace and war and ease him by degrees of public care yet to consult his dignity and fame he should have leave to exercise the name and hold the cards while commons played the game for what can power give more than food and drink to live at ease and not be bound to think these are the cooler methods of the crime but their hot zealots think it is loss of time on utmost bounds of loyalty they stand

off which my bondage wrought n free as air and unconfined as thought or faithless sylvia i no more adore neel at her feet and pray in vain no more o more my verse shall her fled worth proclaim and with soft praises celebrate her name er frowns do now no awful terrors bear er smiles no more can cure or cause despair ve banished her for ever from my breast anishd the proud invader of my rest anishd the tyrantauthor of my woes that robbed my soul of all its sweet repose ot all her treacherous arts bewitching wiles der sighs her tears nor her deluding smiles shall my eternal resolution move or make me talk or think or dream of love the whining curse i have banished from my mind and with it all the thoughts of womankind come then my muse and since the occasions fair against that sex proclaim an endless war which may renew as still my verse is read and live when i am mingled with the dead woman by hevns the very names a crime enough to blast and to debauch my rhyme ure heaven it self intranct like adam lay or else some banished fiend usurped the way when eve was formed and with her ushered in lagues woes and death and a new world of sin the fatal rib was crooked and unevn from whence they have their crablike nature given averse to all the laws of man and heaven o lucifer thy regions had been thin were not for womans propagating sin it is they alone that all true vices know and send such throngs down to thy courts below nay there is hardly one among em all but envics eve the glory of the fall be cautious then and guard your empire well for should they once get power to rebel they would surely raise a civilwar in hell add to the pains you feel and make you know we are here above as cursed as you below but we may thank our selves is there a dog who when he may have freedom wears the clog but man vain man the more imprudent beast drags the dull weight when he may be releast may such and ah too many such we see while they live here just only live to be the mark of scorn contempt and infamy but if the tide of nature boistrous grow and would rebelliously its banks overflow then choose a wench who full of lewd desires can meet your floods of love with equal fires she only damns the soul but an ill wife damns that and with it all the joys of life and what vain blockhead is so dull but knows that of two ills the least is to be chose but now since womans lust i chance to name womans unbounded lust i will first proclaim and show that our lewd age has brought to view what sodom when at worst has blushed to do true i confess that romes emperial whore more famed for vice than for the crown she wore into the public stews disguised would hrust to quench the raging fury of her lust and by such actions bravely got her name born up for ever on the wings of fame et this is poor to what our modern age as hatched brought forth and acted on the stage which for the sexs glory i will rehearse and make that deathless as that makes my verse who knew not for to whom was she unknown or late prodigious bewley true she is gone o answer for the numerous ills she is done o if there is no hell for such as she eavn is unjust and that it cannot be  albions isle fast rooted in the main es the rough billows raging force disdain which though they foam and with loud terror roar t they can never reach beyond the shore o she with lusts enthusiastic rage ustaind all the salt stallions of the age whole legions she encountered legions tired satiate yet still fresh supplies desired ustrious bawd may thy name live and be bhorrd by all as it is abhorred by me hou foremost in the race of infamy t bodies must decay for it is too sure there is nothing from the jaws of time secure et when she found that she could do no more hen all her body was one putrid sore dded with pox and ulcers quite all over en then by her delusive treacherous wiles or that is most specious still which most beguiles enrolld more females in the list of whore an all the arts of man ever did before est with the ponderous guilt at length she fell d through the solid center sunk to hell e murmuring fiends all hovered round about  in hoarse howls did the great bawd salute azd to see a sordid lump of clay nd with more various bolder crimes than they or were her torments less for the dire train on sent her howling through the rolling flame  the sad seat of everlasting pain creswel and stratford the same path do tread in sins black volume so profoundly read that whensoeer they die we well may fear the very tincture of the crimes they bear with strange infusion may inspire the dust and in the grave commit true acts of lust and now i so much to the worlds revealed reflect on the vast stores that lie concealed how often into their closets they retire where flaming dil  does inflame desire and gentle lapd  s feed the amorous fire how cursed is man when brutes his rivals prove ev in the sacred business of his love unless religion pious thoughts instill show me the woman that would not be ill if she conveniently could have her will and when the minds corrupt we all well know the actions that proceed fromt must be so their guilts as great who any ill would do as theirs who actually that ill pursue that they would have it so their crime assures thus if they durst most women would be whores that is and it is what all men will allow there is many would be so that yet seems virtuous now forgive me modesty if i have been in any thing i have mentioned here obscene yet stay  why should i ask that boon of thee when it is a doubt if such a thing there be for woman in whose breasts you are said to reign and show the glorious conquests thou do gain despises thee and only courts the name sounds though we cannot see yet we may hear and wonder at their echoing through the air thus ld by what delusive fame imparts we think thy thrones erected in their hearts but we are deceived as faith we ever were for if thou art i am sure thou art not there nothing in those vile mansions does reside but rank ambition luxury and pride pride is the deity they most adore hardly their own dear selves they cherish more survey their very looks you will find it there how can you miss it when it is every where some through all hunted natures secrets trace to fill the furrows of a wrinkld face and after all their toil pray mark the curse they have only made that which was bad much worse as some in striving to make ill coin pass have but the more discovered that twas brass nay those that are reputed to be fair and know how courted how admired they are who one would think god had formed so complete they had no need to make his gifts a cheat yet they too in adulteration share and would in spite of nature be more fair deluded woman tell me where is the gain in spending time upon a thing so vain your precious time o to your selves unkind when it is uncertain you have an hour behind which you can call your own for though you are fair and beautiful as guardian angels are adorned by nature fitted out by art in all the glories that delude the heart yet tell me tell have they the power to save or can they privilege you from the grave the grave which favors not the rich or fair beauty with beast lies undistinguished there but hold  methinks i am interrupted here by some vain fop i neither love nor fear who in these words his weakness does reveal and hurts that wound which he should strive to heal soft sir methinks you too inveterate grow and more your envy than discretion show whod blame the sun because he shines so bright that we cannot gaze upon his dazzling light when at the same time he chears the earth and gives the various plant and blossoms birth how does the winter look that naked thing compard to the fresh glories of the spring rivers adorn the earth the fish the seas flowers and grass the meadows fruit the trees the stars the fields of air through which they ride and woman all the works of god beside yet base detracting envy will not allow they should adorn themselves then pray sir now produce some reasons why youre so severe for envious as you are you know they are fair and so were sodoms apples heretofore but they were still found rotten at the core nature without dispute made all things fair and dressed em in an unaffected air the earth the meadows rivers every flower proclaim the skill of their great makers power but they as they were made at first remain and all their ancient luster still retain nothing but vain fantastic womans changed and through all mischiefs various mazes ranged yet that they are beautiful is not denied but tell me are the unhandsome free from pride no no the strait the crooked ugly fair have all promiscuously an equal share thus sir you see how they are estranged and strayed from what by nature they at first were made already many of their crimes i have named yet that is untold for which they most are famed a sin tall as the pyramids of old from whose aspiring top we may behold enough to damn a world  what should it be but curse upon the name inconstancy o tell me does the world those men contain for i have looked for such but looked in vain who never were drawn into that fatal snare fatal i call it for he is cursed that is there inspired then by my fellow sufferers wrongs and glad i am the task to me belongs i will bring the fiend unmasked to humane sight though hid in the black womb of deepest night no more the wind the faithless wind shall be a simile for their inconstancy for that sometimes is fixed but womans mind is never fixed or to one point inclined less fixed than in a storm the billows are or trembling leaf the aspentree does bear which never stand still but every way inclined turn twenty times with the least breath of wind less fixed than wanton swallows while they play in the sunbeams to welcome in the day now yonder now they are here as soon as there in no place long and yet are every where lake a tossed ship their passions fall and rise one while you would think it touched the very skies when straight upon the sn it grovelling lies even she her self sylvia the loved and fair whose one kind look could save me from despair she she whose smiles i valued at that rate to enjoy them i scorned the frowns of fate even she her self but ah i am loath to tell or blame the crimes of one i loved so well but it must out even she swift as the wind swift as the airy motions of the mind at once proved false and perjured and unkind here they to day invoke the powers above as witnesses to their immortal love when lo away the airy fantom flies and ever it can be said to live it dies thus all religious vows they break with the same ease and freedom as they speak nor is that sacred idol marriage free marriage which musty drones affirm to be the tie of souls as well as bodies nay the spring that does through unseen pipes convey fresh sweets to life and drives the bitter dregs away the sacred flame the guardian pile of fire that guides our steps to peace nor does expire till it has left us nothing to desire even thus adorned the idol is not free from the swft turns of their inconstancy witness the ephesian matron  who to the grave with her dead husband went and closed her self up in his monument where on marble she lamenting lay n sighs she spent the night in tears the day and seemed to have no use of life but mourn it all away the wondering world extolled her faithful mind extolled her as the best of womankind but see the worlds mistake and with it see the strange effect of wild inconstancy or she her self even in that sacred room with one brisk vigorous onset was overcome and made a brothel of her husbands tomb whose pale ghost trembled in his sacred shroud wondering that heaven t impious act allowed orror in robes of darkness stalkt around and through the frighted tomb did groans resound he very marbles wept the furies howled and in hoarse murmurs their amazement told ll this shook no the dictates of her mind t with a boldness suited to her kind she made her husbands ghost in death a slave her necessary pimp even in his grave what need i fetch these instances from old there now live those that are as bad and bold of quality too young vigorous lustful fair but for their husbands sakes their names i spare are these ye gods the virtues of a wife the peace that crowns a matrimonial life is this the sacred prize for which we fight and hazard life and honor with delight bliss of the day and rapture of the night the reins that guide us in our wild careers and the supporter of our feeble years no no it is contradiction rather far they are the cause of all our bosom war the very source and fountain of our woe from whence despair and doubt for ever flow the gall that mingles with our best delight rank to the taste and nauseous to the sight a days the weight of care that clogs the breast at night the hags that does disturb our rest our mortal sickness in the midst of health chains in our freedom poverty in wealth the eternal pestilence and plague of life the original and spring of all our strife these rather are the virtues of a clamorous wife o why ye awful powers why was it your will to mix our solid good with so much ill but you foresaw our crimes would soar too high and so made them your vengeance to supply for not the wild destructive waste of war nor all the endless labrinths of the bar famine revenge perpetual loss of health no nor that grinning fiend despair it self when it insults with most tyrannick sway can plague or torture man so much as they but hold  dont let me blame the powers divine or at the wondrous works they made repine all at first was good formed by the unerring will though much has since degenrated to ill even woman was say they made chaste and good but ah not long in that blessed state she stood swift as a meteor glides through air she fell and showed to love that sex too much is one sure way to hell but stop my pen for who can comprehend or trace those crimes which ner can have an end the sun the moon the stars that gild the sky the world and all its glories too must dye and in one universal ruin lie but they even immortality will gain and live  but must for ever live in pain for ever live damned to eternal night and never more review the sacred light beware then dull deluded man beware and let not vicious women be the snare to make you the companions with em there scorn their vain smiles their little arts despise and your content at that just value prize as not to let those ravenous thieves of prey rifle and bear the sacred guest away it is they it is they that rob us of that gem how could we lose it were it not for them avoid em then with all the gaudy arts they daily practice to amuse our hearts avoid em as you would avoid their crimes or the mad follies that infest the times but now should some for doubtless we may find many a stupid ass among mankind should such contemn the wholesome rules i give and in contempt of what i have spoke still live like base sould slaves and fetters choose to wear when they may be as unconfined as air or the winged race that do inhabit there may all the plagues an ill wife can invent pursue em with eternal punishment may they  but stay may curses i forestall for in that curse i have comprehended all  but say sir if some pilot on the main should be so mad so resolutely vain to steer his bark upon that fatal shore where he has seen ten thousand wrackt before though he should perish there say would you not bestow a curse on the notorious sot trust me the mans as much to blame as he who ventures his frail bark out wilfully on the wild rocky matrimonial see when round about and just before his eyes such a destructive waste of fatal ruin lies finis the epistle dedicatory to the snarling curs the critics and why all this noise and splutter against the women harmless creatures what have they done to deserve so many lampoons libels satyrs but methinks gentlemen it is not fair dealing to commit ats of open hostility before you proclaim a war and we know what feats you brag have been done by our little fireship called the satyr against woman this preface therefore is only to let you know that we have rigd our a female man of war if that beent nonsense with  0 gs of a side which igad gentlemen as mr bays has it we hope will maul you and so much for that point  but now  what now why it seems twas nero and not caligula that made such a wish mentioned in page  d why gentlemen i hope you will excuse the want of learning in a woman since upon my word i never read suetonius nor tranquills for you all know that a box of marmalade culpeppers midwifery a prayer book and two or three plays is all the furniture of a womans study  if any of the characters suit with some persons to me unknown i solemnly profess there is not one of them levelled against any person whatsoever but a skilful painter may by the strength of fancy draw a face representing some body though no body s for

weaker vessels sunk and lost trophies along the gaudy strand displayd and never such insulting poeans made yet true it is without a blush we own our force in part was scattered and overthrown with fright surpised we knew not then the foe with noise they hurried on and flusht with show yet still unmoved our body did remain they only took some straglers on the plain to you the news with winged haste we bore you smiled and bid us stand and said no more long you delayed indeed to aid us there and they mistook your scorn of them for fear you sent one muse to view their strength she came and told you twas but noise and babbling fame unguarded and how loose the forces lay and would you then advance you would with the day with this alarmed your godlike genius rose lord how aghast appeared

illbred satyrs chase us through the world and shall no thunder at the slaves be hurled ye gods how long shall injured virtue groan how long shall innocence be trampled on shall a bold scribbling fop

so i may style you since you are hardly wellbred and tell so many lies every day behind the counter who are born cookneys and ive within the sound of bowbell i make these following papers as a present well knowing that you now sit biting our fingers in your shops or toying with your wives and ave little or nothing to do all the fine birds are flown be beau monde have forsaken you and what you get now  believe in a whole summers day you may put in your eyes and twill no ways hinder you from seeing your horns unless ou are fond of those vipers which you hug in your bosoms and re so wonderfully complaisant to your wives that you will give m no manner of occasion to think you any ways troublesome and impertinent by having jealous pates or encroaching upon that liberty and freedom which your wives as citizens hink they have a charter for  perhaps the following lines may give you some entertainent or serve to amuse you a while till fames loud trumt shall echo a victory to our shore which will be more aeable to you than those stolen delights which your helpes are now enjoying your absence are to them but alas t most of you are hornifyd is no more news though you mentedly enough put the disgrace in your pockets than if y one should say there is bribery used in elections that some the parliament house are wiser than others or that a young idow who has had the pleasure of the shaking of the shets ls to be married again come come take heart of grace my lads dont be disconsolate i make no doubt but that you will shortly hear of a battle that will find you yalk enough for all the vacation and set your tongues a moving as nimbly in every coffeehouse you come at as that of  courtlady somewhat overtaken with drinking hartshor and brandy  as i said before seeing you have little or nothing to do though you had rather be accounted cuckolds than jealous hu bands yet it would not be amiss to visit your wives once  week that so by the beating of their pulse you may discove whether their blood be in a ferment or no or when last their bodies had some unlawful agitations besides since natu is very craving and her wants must one way or other be suplyd it would be better for you to enjoy the lawful embrace of your own spouses than engender with that fulsome crap which at this dead time of the year is left in town  i protest i almost pity you and am sorry that your wiv should so impose upon you some roaring bully or recruiti officer in the country makes his own game with them an women are in one respect the reverse of the turkeycoc they are wonderful affected with a red coat since the your shops are so empty of customers and your trade is so dea i would advise you to repent of all the lies that you told bhind your counters last term to make your accounts up bo between god and man go to church with a safe conscience read the news cheerfully and since your circumstances  present will not allow you to drink wine fancy tea and coffe brgundy and campaign  the long vacation bless us how silent is the noisy gown how quiet are the temples park and town as if astraea great in annas reign had banished law to some deserted plain no gouty j  ce sits upon the bench ndulgent to a bottle and a wench although his reverend garb and brow severe promise his morals and his sold austere now sacred peace finds a secure retreat where laws and justice held their awful seat not on demurrers now the sergeants drudge nor crabbed pleas detain the hungry judge each s  now may rest in elbowchair his veterane limbs broke with nocturnal care n turning over volumes and the fair no knotty doubts his solid ease beguile his reverend coke the dusty cobwebs spoil grave littleton and leveing too lie idle he reads them now no oftener than the bible the jangling laws though insolently rude dare not upon his peaceful hours intrude wine chears his soul and his obliging eyes show he is not dead to charming mistresses though at the bar in term you would hardly think that he had power enough to whore or drink but that the charming beauties of the fair were far above his notice or his care uch furrows in his aged cheeks appear yet hos his looks an air most solemn show his powdered wig discovers he is a beau and that when serious business dont intrude his worship can be both gallant and lewd the c  ts kitchen as his brains is cold no longer now litigious crowds make bold to knock him up and buy their peace with gold no more he sees his chambers like a fair of clients full and never a pauper there no longer now he props with noblest wines his age and at the devil sups and dines nor does the porter light him to his bed twixt twelve and one by trusty drawers led the pettyfogger who keeps such a house would starve a church or ancient college mouse hangs down his ears and now begins to miss his sumptuous meals and termtime luxuries just as his looks so does his purse grow thin paleness without and emptiness within quickly he thinks it prudent to repair to some convenient seat for country air carrying himself with paultry present down his board he spunges on some rural clown till the kind term returns him to the town trusting in impudence which seldom fails some silvane nymph perchance the fop assails the ruddy maid at first receives his flame and vows her sparks a pretty gentleman though whatsoever he to his mistress says is stolln from durfeys or from settles plays in vain he shows the abundance of his sense and charms the fair with borrowed eloquence for soon malicious fortune makes it clear that he is some paultry tricking wappineer good gods how dull his courtship is how lame how soon he quits his bold presumptuous flame winged with disgrace he flies the hills and groves and valleys conscious of his slighted loves he hastes to town there meets what he deserves and twice two months the scoundrel scribler starves till the returning winter chears the laws and the glad term a scene of business draws thus when the woods by some autumnal blast their verdant leaves and shady honors cast the sickening trees their ravished beauties mourn till circling hours the joyful spring return till the warm sun with his resplendent beams thaws natures bolts and soon unlocks the streams his vital heat the flowing rills enlarge and the glad fish from icy nets discharge so at the appearance of the blooming spring the feathered quoiristers rejoice and sing while they in fields their tuneful notes prepare and with soft music bless the harmonious air the weary press at ease in safety sleeps no supple oil the polished iron keeps the hawkers now we very rarely meet faction and treason venting in the street from wills and toms the welldressd youths are fled and silence there with poppies binds her head to country seats the men of sense go down and for their rural joys neglect the town some few sham battles bellowed out at night and apparitions now the mob affright commets and armies fighting in the air seen by the lord knows

athiests and parsons here alike repair to drink the waters and imbibe the air bawds matrons punks commend the pregnant steel but something else the fertile ladies feel sharpers at dice consume the

painting  london inted and sold by h hills in blackfryars near the waterside   0  price one penny  lucretius a poem against the fear of death what has this bugbear death to frighten man if souls can die as well as bodies can for as before our birth we felt no pain when punick arms infested land and main when heaven and earth were in confusion hurled for the debated empire of the world which awed with dreadful expectation lay sure to be slaves uncertain who should sway so when our mortal frame shall be disjoined the lifeless lump uncoupled from the mind from sense of grief and pain we shall be free we shall not feel because we shall not be though earth in seas and seas in heaven were lost we should not move we only should be tossed nay even suppose when we have suffered fate the soul could feel in her divided state what is that to us for we are only we while souls and bodies in one frame agree nay though our atoms should revolve by chance and matter leap into the former dance though time our life and motion could restore and make our bodies what they were before what gain to us would all this bustle bring the new made man would be another thing then once an interrupting pause is made that individual being is decayed e who are dead and gone shall ear no part  all the pleasures nor shall feel the smart which to that other mortal shall accrue whom of our matter time shall mould anew or backward if you look on that long space f ages past and view the changing face f matter tossed and variously combined  sundry shapes it is easy for the mind from thence to infer that seeds of things have been  the same order as they now are seen which yet our dark remembrance cannot trace because a pause of life a gaping space as come betwixt where memory lies dead and all the wandering motions from the sense are fled or whosoeer shall in misfortunes live must be when those misfortunes shall arrive and since the man who is not seels not woe for death exempts him and wards off the blow which we the living only feel and bear what is there left for us in death to fear when ocne that pause of life has come between is just the same as we had never been and therefore if a man bemoan his lot that after death his mouldring limbs shall rot  flames or jaws of beasts devour his mass now he is an unsincere unthinking ass  secret sting remains within his mind the fool is to his own cast offals kind e boasts no sense can after death remain et makes himself a part of life again s if some other he could feel the pain if while he live this thought molest his head what wolf or vulture shall devour me dead he wastes his days in idle grief nor can distinguish twixt the body and the man but thinks himself can still himself survive and what when dead he feels not feels alive then he repines that he was born to die nor knows in death there is no other he no living he remains his grief to vent and over his senseless carcass to lament if after death it is painful to be torn by birds and beasts then why not so to burn or drenched in floods of honey to be soaked imbalmd to be at once preserved and choked or on an airy mountains top to lie exposed to cold and heavens inclemency or crowded in a tomb to be oppressed with monumental marble on thy breast but to be snatched from all thy household joys from thy chaste wife and thy dear prattling boys whose little arms about thy legs are cast and climbing for a kiss prevent their mothers have inspiring secret pleasure through thy breast all these shall be no more thy friends oppressed thy care and courage now no more shall free ah wretch thou cryst ah miserable me one woeful day sweeps children friends and wife and all the brittle blessings of my life add one thing more and all thou say is true thy want and wish of them is vanished too which well considered were a quick relief to all thy vain imaginary grief for thou shall sleep and never wake again and quitting life shall quit thy living pain but we thy friends shall all those sorrows find which in forgetful death thou leave behind no time shall dry our tears nor drive thee from our mind the worst that can befall thee measured right s a sound slumber and a long good night yet thus the fools that would be thought the wits disturb their mirth with melancholy fits when healths go round and kindly brimmers flow till the fresh garlands on their foreheads glow they whine and cry let us make haste to live hort are the joys that human life can give eternal preachers that corrupt the draught and pall the god that never thinks with thought deots with all that thought to whom the worst of death is want of drink and enless thirst or any fond desire as vain as these or even in sleep the body wrapped in ease upinely lies as in the peaceful grave and wanting nothing nothing can it crave were that sound sleep eternal it were death et the first atoms then the seeds of breath re moving near to sense we do but shake and rouse that sense and straight we are awake then death to us and deaths anxiety  less than nothing if a less could be or then our atoms which in order lay re scattered from their heap and puffed away and never can return into their place when once the pause of life has left an empty space and last suppose great natures voice should call o thee or me or any of us all what do thou mean ungrateful wretch thou vain hou mortal thing thus idly to complain and sigh and sob that thou shall be no more or if thy life were pleasant heretofore  all the bounteous blessings i could give hou have enjoyed if thou have known to live and pleasure not leak through thee like a sieve why do thou not give thanks as at a plenteous feast amd to the throat with life and rise and take thy rest but if my blessings thou have thrown away if indigested joys passed through and would not stay why do thou wish for more to squander still if life we grown a load a real ill and i would all thy cares and labors end lay down thy burden fool and know thy friend to please thee i have emptid all my store i can invent and can supply no more but run the round again the round i ran before suppose thou art not broken yet with years yet still the selfsame scene of things appears and would be ever could thou ever live for life is still but life there is nothing new to give what can we plead against so just a bill we stand convicted and our cause goes ill but if a wretch a man oppressed by fate should beg of nature to prolong his date she speaks aloud to him with more disdain be still thou martyr fool thou covetous of pain but if an old decrepit sot lament what thou she cries who have outlived content do thou complain who have enjoyed my store but this is still the effect of wishing more unsatisfied with all that nature brings loathing the present liking absent things from hence it comes thy vain desires at strife within themselves have tantalizd thy life and ghastly death appeared before thy sight ever thou had gorged thy soul and senses with delight now leave those joys unsuiting to thy age to a fresh comer and resign the stage is nature to be blamed if thus she chide no sure for it is her business to provide against this ever changing frames decay new things to come and old to pass away one being worn another being makes changed but not lost for nature gives and takes new matter must be found for things to come and these must waste like those and follow natures doom all things like thee have time to rise and rot and from each others ruin are begot for life is not confined to him or thee tis given to all for use to none for property consider former ages past and gone whose circles ended long ever thine begun then tell the fool what part in them thou have thus may thou judge the future by the past what horror see thou in that quiet state what bugbear dreams to fright thee after fate no ghost no goblins that still passage keep but all is there serene in that eternal sleep for all the dismal tales that poets tell are verified on earth and not in hell no tantalus looks up with fearful eye or dreads the impending rock to crush him from on high but fear of chance on earth disturbs our easy hours or vain imagined wrath of vain imagined powers no tityus torn by vultures lies in hell nor could the lobes of his rank liver swell to that prodigious mass for their eternal meal not though this monstrous bulk had covered over nine spreading acres or nine thousand more not though the globe of earth had been the giants floor nor in eternal torments could he lie nor could his corpse sufficient food supply but he is the tityus who by love oppressed or tyrant passion preying on his breast and ever anxious thoughts is robbed of rest the sisiphus is he whom noise and strife educe from all the soft retreats of life to vex the government disturb the laws drunk with the fumes of popular applause he courts the giddy crowd to make him great and sweats and toils in vain to mount the sovereign seat for still to aim at power and still to fail ever to strive and never to prevail what is it but in reasons true account to heave the stone against the rising mount which urged and labored and forced up with pain recoild and rowls impetuous down and smokes along t pla then still to treat thy ever craving mind with every blessing and of every kind ye never fill thy ravning appetite though years and season vary thy delight yet nothing to be seen of all thy store but still the wolf within thee barks for more this is the fables moral which they tell of fifty foolish virgins damned in hell to leaky vessels which the liquor spill to vessels of their sex which none could ever fill as for the dog the furies and their snakes the gloomy caverns and the burning lakes and all the vain infernal trumpery they neither are nor were nor ever can be but here on earth the guilty have in view the mighty pains to mghty mischiefs due racks prisons poisons tarpeian rock stripes hangmen pitch and suffocating smoke and last and most if these were cast behind the avenging horror of a conscious mind whose dealy fear anticipates the blow and sees no end of punishment and woe but looks for more at the last gasp of breath this makes an hell on earth and life a death mean time when thoughts of death disturb thy head consider ancus great and good is dead ancus thy better far was born to die and thou do thou bewail mortality so many monarchs with their mighty state who ruled the world were overruled by fate that haughty king who lorded over the main and whose stupendos bridge did the wild waves restrain in vain they foamed in vain thy threatened wreck while his prod leions marched upon their back him death a greter monarch overcame nor spared his guards the more for their immortal name the roman chief the carthaginians dread scipio the thunderbolt of war is dead and like a common slave by fate in triumph led the founders of invented arts are lost and wits who made eternity their boast where now is homer who possessed the throne the immortal work remains the mortal authors gone democritus perceiving age invade his body weakened and his mind decayed obeyed the summons with a cheerful face made haste to welcome death and met him half the race that stroke even epicurus could not bar though he in wit surpassed mankind as far as does the midday sun the midnight star and thou do thou disdain to yield thy breath whose very life is little more than death more than one half by lazy sleep possessed and then a wake thy soul but nods at best daydreams and sickly thoughts revolving in thy breast eternal troubles haunt thy anxious mind whose cause and cure thou never hopst to find but still uncertain with thy self at strife thou wanderst in the labyrinth of life o if the foolish race of man who find a weight of cares still pressing on their mind could find as well the cause of this unrest and all this burden lodged within the breast sure they would change their course nor live as now uncertain what to wish or what to vow uneasy both in country and in town they search a place to lay their burden down one restless in his palace walks abroad and vainly thinks to leave behind the load but straight returns for he is as restless there and finds there is no relief in open air another to his villa would retire and spurs as hard as if it were on fire no sooner entered at his country door but he begins to stretch and yawn and snore or seeks the city which he left before thus every man oerworks his weary will to shun himself and to shake off his ill the shaking fit returns and hangs upon him still no prospect of repose nor hope of ease the wretch is ignorant of his disease which known would all his fruitless trouble spare for he would know the world not worth his care then would he search more deeply for the cause and study nature well and natures laws for in this moment lies not the debate but on our future fixed eternal state that neverchanging state which all must keep who death has doomed to everlasting sleep why are we then so fond of mortal life beset with dangers and maintained with strife a life which all our care can never save our fate attends us and one common grave besides we tread but a perpetual round we never strike out but beat the former ground and the same maukish joys in the same track are found for still we think an absent blessing best which cloys and is no blessing when possessed a new arising wish expels it from the breast the feavrish thirst of life increases still we call for more and more and never have our fill yet know what to morrow we shall try what dregs of life in the last draught may lie nor by the longest life we can attain one moment from the length of death we gain for all behind belongs to his eternal reign when once the fates have cut the mortal thread the man as much to all intents is dead who dies to day and will as long be so as he who died a thousand years ago to the pious memory of the accomplished young lady mrs ann killigrew excellent in the two sister arts of poesy and painting an ode i thou youngest virgindaughter of the skier made in the last promotion of the blessed whose palms new plucked from paradise in spreading branches more sublimely rise rich with immortal green above the rest whether adopted to some neighboring star thou rollst above us in thy wandering race or in procession fixed and regular moved with the heavens majestic peace or called to more superior bliss thou treadst with seraphims the vast abyss what ever happy region is thy place cease thy celestial song a little space thou will have time enough for hymns divine since heavens eternal year is thine here then a mortal muse thy praise rehearse in no ignorable verse but such as thy own voice did practice here when thy firstfruits of poesy were givnd to make thy self a welcome inmate there while yet a young probationer and candidate of heaven ii if by traduction came thy mind our wonder is the less to find a soul so charming from a stock so good thy father was transfused into thy blood so were thou born into a tuneful strain an early rich and inexhausted vein but if thy praeexisting soul was formed at first with myriads more it did through all the mighty poets roll who greek or latin laurels wore and was that sappho last which once it was before if so then cease thy flight o heavenborn mind thou have no dross to purge from thy rich ore nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find than was the beauteous frame she left behind return to fill or mend the quire of thy celestial kind iii may we presume to say that at thy birth new joy was sprung in heaven as well as here on earth for sure the milder planets did combine on thy auspicious horoscope to shine and even the most malicious were in trine thy brotherangels at thy birth strung each his lyre and tuned it high that all the people of the sky might know a poetess was born on earth and then if ever mortal ears had heard the music of the spheres and if no clustring swarn of bees on thy sweet mouth distilled their golden dew twas that such vulgar miracles heaven had not leisure to renew for all the blessed fraternity of love solemnized there thy birth and kept thy holy day above iv o gracious god how far have we profaned thy heavenly gift of poesy made prostitute and profligate the muse debased to each obscene and impious use who harmony was first ordained above for tongues of angels and for hymns of love o wretched we why were we hurried down this lubrique and adultrate age nay added fat pollutions of our own to increase the steaming ordures of the stage what can we say to excuse our second fall let this thy vestal heaven atone for all her arethusian stream remains unsoild unmixt with foreign filth and undefiled her wit was more than man her innocence a child v art she had none yet wanted none for nature did that want supply so rich in treasures of her own she might our boasted stores defy such noble vigor did her verse adorn that it seemed borrowed where twas only born her morals too were in her bosom bred by great examples daily fed what in the best of books her fathers life she read and to be read her self she need not fear each test and every light her muse will bear though epictetus with his lamp was there even love for love sometimes her muse expressed was but a lambentflame which played about her breast light as the vapors of a morning dream so cold her self whilst she such warmth expressed twas cupid bathing in dianas stream vi born to the spacious empire of the nine one would have thought she should have been content to manage well that mighty government but what can young ambitious souls confine to the next realm she stretched her sway for painture near adjoining lay a plenteous province and alluring prey a chamber of dependencies was framed as conquerors will never want pretense when armed to justify the offense and the whole fief in right of poetry she claimed the country open lay without defense for poets frequent inrodes there had made and perfectly could represent the shape the face with every lineament and all the large demains which the dumbsister swayed all bowed beneath her government received in triumph wheresoeer she went her pencil drew what ever her sold designed and of the happy draught surpassed the image in her mind the sylvan scenes of herds and flocks and fruitful plains and barren rocks of shallow brooks that flowed so clear the bottom did the top appear of deeper too and ampler floods which as in mirrors showed the woods of lofty trees with sacred shades and perspectives of pleasant glades where nymphs of brightest form appear and shaggy satyrs standing near which them at once admire and fear the ruins too of some majestic piece boasting the power of ancient rome or greece whose statues freezes columns broken lie and though defaced the wonder of the eye what nature art bold fiction ever durst frame her forming hand gave feature to the name so strange a concourse never was seen before but when the peopled ark the whole creation bore vii the scene then changed with bold erected look our martial king the sight with reverence struck for not content to express his outward part her hand called out the image of his heart his warlike mind his soul devoid of fear his highdesigning thoughts were figured there as when by magic ghosts are made appear our phoenix queen was portrayd too so bright beauty alone could beauty take so right her dress her shape her matchless grace were all observed as well as heavenly face with such a peerless majesty she stands as in that day she took the crown from sacred hands before a train of heroins was seen in beauty foremost as in rank the queen thus nothing to her genius was denied but like a ball of fire the further thrown still with a greater blaze she shone and her bright soul broke out on every side what next she had designed heaven only knows to such immodrate growth her conquest rose that fate alone its progress could oppose viii now all those charms that blooming grace the wellproportiond shape and beauteous face shall never more be seen by mortal eyes in earth the much lamented virgin lies not wit nor piety could fate prevent nor was the cruel destiny content to finish all the murder at a blow to sweep at once her life and beauty to but like a hardened felon took a pride to work more mischievously slow and plundered first and then destroyed o double sacrilege on things divine to rob the relic and deface the shrine but thus orinda died heaven by the same disease did both translate as equal were their souls so equal was their fate ix mean time her warlike brother on the seas his waving streams to the winds displays and vows for his return with vain devotion pays ah generous youth that wish forbear the winds too soon will wast thee here slack all thy sails and fear to come alas thou know not thou art wrecked at home no more shall thou behold thy sisters face thou have already had her last embrace but look aloft and if thou kenst from far among the pleiads a newkindled star if any sparkles than the rest more bright it is she that shines in that propitious light x when in midair the golden trump shall sound to raise the nations under ground when in the valley of jehosaphat the judging god shall close the book of fate and there the last assizes keep for those who wake and those who sleep when rattling bones together fly from the four corners of the sky when sinews over the skeletons are spread those clothed with flesh and life inspires the dead the sacred poets first shall hear the sound and foremost from the tomb shall bound for they are covered with the lightest ground and straight with inborn vigor on the wing like mounting larks to the new morning sing there thou sweet saint before the quire shall go as harbinger of heaven the way to show the way which thou so well have learnt below finis eleonora a panegyrical poem dedicated the memory of the late countess of abingdon  london inted and sold by h hills in blackfryars near the waterside   0  price one penny  to the right honorable the earl of abingdon etc my lord the commands with which you honored me some months ago are now performed they had been sooner but betwixt ill health some business and many troubles i was forced to deferr them till this time ovid going to this banishment and writing from on shipboard to his friends excused the faults of his poetry by his misfortunes and told them that good verses never flow but from a serene and composed spirit wit which is a kind of mercury with wings fastened to his head and heels can fly but slowly in a damp air i therefore chose rather to obey you late than ill if at least i am capable of writing any thing at any time which is worthy your perusal and your patronage i cannot say that i have escaped from a shipwreck but have only gained a rock by hard swimming where i may pan a while and gather breath for the doctors give me a sad assurance that my disease never took its leave of any man but with a purpose to return however my lord i have laid hold on the interval and managd the small stock which age has left me to the best advantage in performing this inconsiderable service to my ladys memory we who are priests of apollo have not the inspiration when we please but must wait till the god comes rushing on us and invades us with a fury which we are not able to resist which gives us double strength while the fit continues and leaves us languishing and spent at its departure let me not seem to bast my lord for i have really felt it on this occasion and prophesied beyond my natural power let me add and hope to be believed that the excellency of the subject contributed much to the happiness of the execution and that the weight of thirty years was taken off me while i was writing i swom with the tide and the water under e was buoyant the reader will easily observe that i was transported by the multitude and variety of my similitudes which are generally the product of a luxuriant fancy and the wantonness of wit had i called in my judgment to my assistance i had certainly retrenched many of them but i defend them not let them pass for beautiful faults amongst the better sort of critics for the whole poem though written in that which they call heroic verse s of the pindrick nature as well in the thought as the expression and as such requires the same grains of allowance for it it was intended as your lordship sees in the title not for an elegy but a panegyric a kind of apotheosis indeed if a heathen word may be applied to a christian use and on all occasions of praise if we take the ancients for our patterns we are bound by prescription to employ the magnificence of words and the force of figures to adorn the sublimity of thoughts isocrates amongst the grecian orators and cicero and the younger pliny amongst the romans have left us their precedents for our security for i think i need not mention the inimitable indar who stretches on these pinnions out of sight and is carried upward as it were into another world  this at least my lord i may justly plead that if i have not performed so well as i think i have yet i have used my best endeavors to excel my self one disadvantage i have had which is never to have known or seen my lady and to draw the lineaments of her mind from the description which i have received from others is for a painter to set himself at work without the living original before him which the more beautiful it is will be so much the more difficult for him to conceive when he has only a relation give him of such and such features by an acquaintance or a friend without the nice touches which give the best resemblance and make the graces of the picture every artist is apt enough to flatter himself and i amongst the rest that that their own ocular observations would have discovered more perfections at least others than have been delivered to them though i have receivd mine from the best hands that is from persons who neither want a just understanding of my ladys worth nor a due veneration for her memory  doctor donn the greatest wit though not the greatest poet of our nation acknowledges that he had never seen mrs drury whom he has made immortal in his admirable anniversaries i have had the same fortune though i have no succeeded to the same genius however i have followd his footsteps in the design of his panegyric which was to raise an emultion in the living to copy out the example of the dead and therefore it was that i once intended to have called this poem the pattern and though on a second consideration i changed the title into the name of that illustrious person yet the design continues and eleonora is still the pattern of charity devotion and humility of the best wife the best mother and the best of friends  and now my lord though i have endeavored to answer your commands yet i could not nswer it to the world nor to my conscience if i gave not your lordship my testimony of being the best husband now living i say my testimony only for the praise of it is given you by your self they who despise the rules of virtue both in their practice and their morals will think this a very trivial commendation but i think i the pculiar happiness of the countess of abingdon to have been so truly loved by you while she was living and so grateflly honored after she was dead few there are who have either had or cod have such a loss and yet fewer who carried their love and constancy beyond the grave the exteriours of mourning a decent funeral and black habits are the usual stis of common husbands and perhaps their  deserve no better than to be moud with hypocrisy and forgot with ease but you have distinguished your self from ordinary lovers by a real and lasting grief for the deceased and by endeavoring to raise for her the most durable monument which is that of verse and so it would have proved if the workman had been equal to the work and your choice of the artificer as happy as your design yet as phidias when he had made the statue of minerva could not forbear to ingrave his own name as author of the piece so give me leave to hope that by subscribing mine to this poem i may live by the goddess and transmit my name to posterity by the memory of hers it is no flattery to assure your lorship that she is remembered in the present age by all who have had the honor of her conversation and acquaintance and that i have never been in any company since the news of her death was first brought me where they have not exol her virtues and even spoken the same things of her in prose which i have done in verse  i therefore think my self obliged to thank your lordship for the commission which you have given me how i have acquitted my self of it must be left to the opinion of the world in spite of any protestation which i can enter against the present age as incompetent or corrupt judges for my comfort they are but englishmen and as such if they think ill of me to day they are inconstant enough to think well of me to morrow and after all i have not much to thank my fortune that i was born amongst them the good of both sexes are so few in ngland that they stand like exceptions against general rules and though one of them has deserved a greater commendation than i could give her they have taken care that i should not tire my pen with frequent exercise on the like subjects that praises like taxes shou be approprited and left almost as individual as the person they say my talent is satyr if it be so it is a fruitful age and there is an extraordinary crop to gather but a single hand is insufficient for such a harvest they have sown the dragons teeth themselves and it is but just they should reap each other in lampoons you my lord who have the character of honor though it is not my happiness to know you may stand side with the small remainders of the english nobility truly such and unhurt your selves behold the mad combat if i have pleased you and some few others i have obtained my end you see i have disabled my self like an elected speaker of the house yet like him i have undertaken the charge and find the burden sufficiently recompensed by the honor be pleased to accept of these my unworthy labors this paper monument and let her pious memory which i am sure is sacred to you not only plead the pardon of my many faults but gain me your protection which is ambitiously sought by  my lord your lordships most obedient servant john dryden  eleonora a panegyrical poem dedicated to the memory of the late countess of abingdon the introduction as when some great and gracious monarch dies soft whispers first and mournful murmurs rise among the sad attendants then the sound soon gathers voice and spreads the news around through town and country till the dreadful blast is blown to distant colonies at last who then perhaps were off ring vows in vain for his long life and for his happy reign so slowly by degrees unwilling fame did matchless eleonoras fate proclaim till public as the loss the news became the nation felt it in the extremest parts with eyes overflowing and with bleeding hearts of her charity but most the poor whom daily she supplied beginning to be such but when she died for whilst she lived they slept in peace by night secure of bread as of returning light and with such firm dependence on the day that need grew pampered and forgot to pray so sure the dole so ready at their call they stood prepared to see the manna fall such multitudes she fed she clothed she nursed that she her self might fear her wanting first of her five talents other five she made heaven that had largely given was largely paid and in few lives in wondrous few we find a fortune better fitted to the mind nor did her alms from ostentation fall or proud desire of praise the soul gave all unbribd it gave or if a bribe appear no less than heaven to heap huge treasures there want passed for merit at her open door heaven saw he safely might increase his poor and trust their sustenance with her so well as not to be at charge of miracle none could be needy whom she saw or knew all in the compass of her sphere she drew he who could touch her garment was as sure as the first christians of the apostles cure the distant heard by fame her pious deeds and laid her up for their extremest needs a future cordial for a fainting mind for what was never refused all hoped to find each in his turn the rich might freely come as to a friend but to the poor twas home as to some holy house the afflicted came the hungerstarved the naked and the lam want and diseases fled before her name for zeal like hers her servants were too slow she was the first where need required to go her self the foundress and attendant too sure she had guests sometimes to entertain guests in disguise of her great masters train her lord himself might come for ought we know since in a servants form he lived below beneath her roof he might be pleased to stay or some benighted angel in his way might ease his wings and seeing heaven appear in its best work of mercy think it there where all the deeds of charity and love were in as constant method as above all carried on all of a piece with theirs as free her alms as diligent her cares as loud her praises and as warm her prayers of her prudent management yet was she not profuse but feared to wast and wisely managed that the stock might last that all might be supplied and she not grieve when crowds appeared she had not to relieve which to prevent she still increased her store laid up and spared that she might give the more so pharaoh or some greater king than he provided for the seventh necessity taught from above his magazines to frame that famine was prevented ere it came thus heaven though allsufficient shows a thrift in his economy and bounds his gift creating for our day one single light and his reflection too supplies the night perhaps a thousand other worlds that lie remote from us and latent in the sky are lightened by his beams and kindly nursed of which our earthly dunghill is the worst now as all virtues keep the middle line yet somewhat more to one extreme incline such was her soul abhorring avarice bounteous but almost bounteous to a vice had she given more it had profusion been and turned the excess of goodness into sin of her humility these virtues raised her fabric to the sky for that which is next heaven is charity but as high turrets for their airy steep require foundations in proportion deep and lofty cedars as far upward shoot as to the nether heavens they drive the root so low did her secure foundation lie she was not humble but humility scarcely she knew that she was great or fair or wise beyond what other women are or which is better knew but never durst compare for to be conscious of what all admire and not be vain advances virtue highr but still she found or rather thought she found her own worth wanting others to abound ascribed above their due to every one unjust and scanty to her self alone of her piety such her devotion was as might give rules of speculation to disputing schools and teach us equally the scales to hold betwixt the two extremes of hot and cold that pious heat may modrately

prayed for still she prayed by deeds her every day was sabbath only free from hours of prayer for hours of charity such as the jews from servile toil releast where works of mercy were a part of rest uch as blessed angels exercise above aryd with sacred hymns and acts of love uch sabbaths as that one she now enjoys vn that perpetual one which she employs for such vicissitudes in heaven there are  praise alternate and alternate prayer ll this she practiced here that when she sprung midst the quires at the first sight she sung ung and was sung her self in angels lays or praising her they did her maker praise all offices of heaven so well she knew before she came that nothing there was new and she was so familiarly received as one returning not as one arrived of her various virtues muse down again precipitate thy flight for how can mortal eyes sustain immortal light but as the sun in water we can bear yet not the sun but his reflection there so let us view her here in what she was and take her image in this watery glass yet look not every lineament to see some will be cast in shades and some will be so lamely drawn you scarcely know it is she for where such various virtues we recite it is like the milkyway all over bright but sown so thick with stars it is undistinguished light her virtue not her virtues let us call for one heroic comprehends em all one as a constellation is but one though it is a train of stars that rolling on rise in their turn and int he zodiac run evern in motion now it is faith ascends now hope now charity that upward tends and downwards with diffusive good descends as in perfumes composed with art and cost it is hard to say what scent is uppermost nor this part musk or civet can we call or amber but a rich result of all so she was all a sweet whose every part in due proportion mixed proclaimed the makers art no single virtue we could most commend whether the wife the mother or the friend for she was all in that supreme degree that as no one prevailed so all was she the several parts lay hidden in the piece the occasion but exerted that or this of her conjugal virtues a wife as tender and as true withal s the first woman was before

objects only multiplied it more and as the chosen found the pearly grain as much as every vessel could contain as in the blissful vision each shall share as much of glory as his soul can bear so did she love and so dispense her care her eldest thus by consequence was best as longer cultivated than the rest the babe had all that infant care beguiles and early knew his mother in her smiles but when dilated organs let in day to the young soul and gave it room to play at his first aptness the maternal love those rudiments of reason did improve the tender age was pliant to command like wax it yielded to the forming hand true to the artificer the labored mind with ease was pious generous just and kind soft for impression from the first prepared till virtue with long exercise grew hard with every act confirmed and made at last so durable as not to be effaced it turned to habit and from vices free goodness resolved into necessity thus fixed she virtues image that is her own till the whole mother in the children shone for that was their perfection she was such they never could express her mind too much so unexhausted her perfections were that for more children she had more to spare for souls unborn whom her untimely death deprived of bodies and of mortal breath and could they take the impressions of her mind enough still left to sanctify her kind of her friendship then wonder not to

each pressing foremost in the mighty throng ambitious to be seen and then make room for greater multitudes that were to come yet unemployd no minute slipped away moment were precious in so short a stay the haste of heaven to have her was so great that some were single acts though each complete but every act stood ready to repeat her fellow saints with busy care will look for her blessed name in fates eternal book and pleased to be outdone with joy will see numberless virtues endless charity but more will wonder at so short an age to find a blank beyond the thirtith page and with a pious fear begin to doubt the piece imperfect and the rest torn out she died in her thirty third year but twas her saviors time and could there be a copy near the original twas she as precious gums are not for lasting fire they but perfume the temple and expire so soon was she exhaled and vanished hence a short sweet odor of a vast expense she vanished we can scarcely say she died for but a now did heaven and earth divide she passed serenely with a single beath this moment perfect health the next was death the manner of her d one sigh did her eternal bliss assure so little penance needs when souls are almost pure as gentle dreams our waking thoughts pursue or one dream passed we slide into a new so close they follow such wild order keep we think our selves awake and are asleep so softly death succeeded life in her she did but dream of heaven and was there no pains she suffered nor expired with noise her soul was whispered out with gods still voice as an old friend is beckoned to a feast and treated like a long familiar guest he took her as he found but found her so her preparedness to dye as one in hourly readiness to go even on that day in all her trim prepared as early notice she from heaven had heard and some descending courtier from above have given her timely warning to remove or counseled her to dress the nuptial room for on that night the bridegroom was to come she dyd on whitsunday night he kept his hour and found her where she lay clothed all in white the livry of the day scarce had she sinned in thought or word or act unless omissions were to pass for fact that hardly death a consequence could draw to make her liable to natures law and that she died we only have to show the mortal part of her she left below the rest so smooth so sudenly she went looked like translation through the firmament o like the fiery carr on the third errand sent apostrophe her soul o happy soul if thou can view from high where thou art all intelligence all eye if looking up to god or down to us thou findst that any way be pervious survey the ruins of thy house and see thy widowed and thy orphan family look on thy tender pledges left behind and if thou can a vacant minute find from heavenly joys that interval afford to thy sad children and thy mourning lord see how thy grieve mistaken in their love and shed a beam of comfort from above give em as much as mortal eyes can bear a transieth view of thy full glories there that they with moderate sorrow may sustain and mollify their losses in thy gain or else divide the grief for such thou were that should not all relations bear a part it were enough to break a single heart epiphonema or close of the poem let this suffice nor thou great saint refuse this humble tribute of no vulgar muse who not by cares or wants or age deprest stems a wild deluge with a dauntless breast and dares to sing thy praises in a clime where vice triumphs and virtue is a crime where even to draw the picture of thy mind is satyr on the most of humane kind take it while yet it is praise before my rage unsafely just break loose on this bad age so bad that thou thy self had no defense from vice but barely by departing hence be what and where thou art to wish thy place were in the best presumption more than grace thy relics such thy works of mercy are have in this poem been my holy care as earth thy body keeps thy soul the

london printed and sold by h hills in blackfryars near the waterside   0   the rambling fuddlecaps or a tavernstruggle for a kiss though fuddld over night the next morning we found that sleep had recovered what claret had drowned and all our numbed members so feeble and weak that we scarcely were able to walk or to speak were now by kind morpheus with strength reimpowerd and all to their primitive vigor restored our thoughts were so sprightly our humors so gay that we both were as brisk as a milkmaid in may and as for the rudders that steer our affections as fancy that pilot shall give em directions which were made over night so incapably tender were now grown as stiff as a bullocks defender that wanting discretion i would like to ve miscarried and thoughtless of cuckldom wish my self married well knowing desire of unchaste copulation had been an affront to our new reformation and therefore resolved to forbear the sweet evil though hugely inclined to the flesh and the devil but yet notwithstanding our overnights fuddle that made us so brisk in the tail and the noddle we both were as dry i may justly maintain as a rat that is poisoned by eating his bane in order to quench our immodrate droughts that burnt in our stomachs and scorched up our mouths we leaped out of bed with a strong appetitus to swallow a hair of the dog that had bit us we shifted our linen and whipped on our clothes and powdered our wigs like a couple of beaus then quitted our lodging till night with design to quench with that engine a flask full of wine the fire which god bacchus as well as fair venus by the help of brisk claret had kindled within us so frensical wretches their senses restore by clawing the hag who bewitched em before and skilful physicians their patients recover of one dose of poison by the power of another with this resolution we crossed to s  lane twixt which and b  y  hangs a bush and a sign which some call the tuns by whose size one would guess they were three brandy runlets of gallons a piece well well says my friend you may descant upon em and for their diminutive sizes untun em but when within doors you may think em much wider and judge by the wine they are hogsheads of cider however said i let us once venture in if it be for no cause but to see and be seen for though it proves cider twill quench us and clean us and wash down those sooty remains that are in us condensed from the poison of necotianus with that we went into a pretty long entry at the end of which passage a female stood centry as stiff in her box and as starched in her dress as an old abbyfigure of wax in a press where any for threepence may behold what stiff bodyd queens lived in ages of old to say that she paints it might justly provoke her i am sure that she does not except it is with oker nor did she look warmed with canary or brandy but just of the color of brown sugar candy from whence we may say without any reflection she is blessed with a sweet and a melting complexion her bubbes which just peeped above to invite ye by the help of her says looked so round and so pretty that had but her skin been a little more fair like a stone horse enraged i would leaped over the bar but the gingerbread color she wore in her cheeks was to me as offensive as garlic or leeks for yellow i hate and i will tell you for what it is the mutton complexion that dies of the rot and whod be so fond of a kiss or a touch with a lady that looks not as sound as a roach her hips i confess were so charmingly plump and between them a hillock adorning her rump that when she turned round by a glimpse i could find all the best of her beauty was seated behind though perhaps upon search it would have proved but a cushion that raised up her a  se to the height of the fashion after ogling and talking and taking a view as she stood in the bar like a jilt in a pew the drawer according to our desire showed us into the kitchen for sake of the fire for cold was the wind and impleasant the weather which made us both willing to follow him thither no sooner wed entered the cooks territories where commonly either a slut or a whore is ut a swinging bellona we saw at the dresser and a drunken young rakehell just going to kiss her the masculine jade had the fork in her hand and bid him stand off at the word of command and being a lass both of virtue and value she cried keep your gound or by heavens i will maul ye the spark in his cups full of courage and vigor in spite of her threats rallied on like a tiger with his arm like a fencer he parryd her poker and running within her did further provoke her by falling most roughly and rudely upon her and bobbing his hand at the seat of her honor but still with such art she defended her lips and now and then gave him such pinches and nips that i would not have born to have purchased a kiss from the lips of queen dido or helen of greece he swore that he would but she vowed that he should not he strove but she rustled so hard that he could not but as they contended thus who should be master in the the scuffle there happened a scurvy disaster a pudding with plumbs standing by on a stool ready mixed for the bag tempered up in a bowl unhappily met with a fall in the jostle and between em was thrown on the ground in the bustle the cook at this sorrowful sight grew inflamed and wished her antagonist rotted and damned the spark in return to the queen of the kitchen in wonderful rage went to cursing and bitching but still in a passion pursuing his matter they scuffled about ankle deep in the batter as soldiers hard set in a battle do use to fight till the blood washes over their shoes the sturdy defendant her pudding beholding fell now in good earnest to scratching and scolding and fought like a cat when her passion was stirred to see the good food trod about like a t  d her greasiness now all venom and gall who swore she would admit of no kissing at all and with that she exerted her masculine force who was almost as strong a mare or a horse and pushed down the spark who most decently lay in the midst of the pudding that fell in the fray with that he arose full of malice and spite to see his black clothes painted over with white and looked in this pickle without any lying like a piece of fat tripe dried in batter for frying the curls of his wig were so pasted and mated all over so daubed so beplumbd and befatted so eggy withal that a man would have sworn he had just in the pillry been taking a tun and being lenttime that some illnatured creatures had pelted the rogue with their pancakes and fritters pray sir says my friend to the unfortunate lover dd ever you read the famed history over of a dapper diminutive comical fellow much less than a bartholmewfair punchanello methinks though i speak not by way of derision as now you appear in that dripping condition you look like that little tom thumb by my soul ust waded from out of the great puddingbowl and have brought away batter enough on your back which if savingly scraped from your clothes that are black and improbd into dumplins would make such a feast that would tempt you with patience to swallow the jest pray sir cries the spark in his puddingy robes eep your flirts to your self and your merry dry bobs or i value not you or your jests of a clout m good flesh within though i am pudding without and if you like the bitchington think you can beat me s drunk as i am when you have done you shall eat me ut if you will not fight let my follies alone r i will pudding your jacket as bad as my own dear sir says my friend in a bantering manner ope like the cook you will not turn painterstainer if you do notwithstanding your huffing and prating the proof of the pudding shall be in the eating but sir says our pyecolourd sot of a beau why so much upon pudding i desire to know what though i am bitterly daubed with the batter must every fool take a lick at the matter cat a man tumble down in a pudding ads fish but another must fling it so often in his dish the cook in a corner stood fleering and laughing the spark she had tamed staggered fretting and chaffing so near to the fire in a mighty disgust till the pudding was baked on his bck to a crust beholding the rattlebrains marry thought i i have heard of a puppy put into a pie but never yet met with a story alluding to such a great whelp that was baked in a pudding by this time the mistress that sat in the bar being told the misfortune by fennick the drawr stepped in to enquire out the truth of the matter and view with sad eyes the poor downfallen batter says madam to nell in a wonderful passion you impudent baggage pray what is the occasion the pudding designed for your masters own table is thus trod about like a t  d in a stable o heavens pray what has this termagant blowze been a doing to the gentlemans wig and clothes zounds madam cries nell i have done him no hurt it was all his own fault he may thank himself for it for though i am a poor kitchinwench let me tell ye i will not be tumbled and touzd by the belly nor slbberd or kissed as a slut that was ready to pleasure each sot like a nightwalking lady i would have you to know i am honest though poor and disdin to be used like a waterlane whore with that madam comingsir cocking her head cried marrycomeup youre a beautiful jade you had need brag so much of your hypocrites virtue a gentlemans kiss would have mightily hurt you you shall be so proud youre so handsome a piece so perfumed with your sweat and adorned with your grease that a gentleman for your charms must approve you and if he once smels you must certainly love you go go youre a slu i would have you to know nay a supet to serve any gentlman so as for one silly kiss to beget so much strife and to spoil the best pudding you have mixed in your life says nell to her mistres i scorn to be tumbled let those play he fool that delight to be fumbld but you that are married may do as you list for a cut of a cut loaf can never be mist though you say i am a strumpet remember good madam as bad as i am i was never at hadem nor ever did i from my modesty vary so far as to jumble a pipe of canary or ever commit so notorious a fault as be caught with a drawer below in the vault in marking that pipe which was best for your turns on the head with the scandalous sign of horns horns hussy says madam you impudent queen who is it you reflect on what is it you mean did ever you hear through the course of you life that i ever proved worse than a good wise it is amazing to me i am astonished to think what your impudence aims at why sure youre in drink or else to your mistress you never would prate  so base a provoking and saucy a rate znes madam says nell in a damnable fury will not be ths subd and abused i assure ye although i am a scrub that is doomed to a kitchen i never was yet caught a whoring or bitching nor am i got drunk as your ladyship says though i know she that was to her ugly disgrace and was found with a spark hovering over her chair with a hand on her breasts and the other elsewhere with that says the mistress you illnatured devil for shame hold your tongue that implacable evil come mop up the batter you have trampled and stood in and let me i say have no more of the pudding whose fault is it cries nell get you into the bar pray what business have you to come prying in here for the longer you stay or the more that you talk you shall fare but the worse so it is better to walk well hussy says madam for once you shall win me to use the goodnature and patience that is in me now i see youre enraged i will show a concession but rattle you off when youre out of your passion thus madam returned to her station the bar with a nettle ther breech and a flea in her ear being glad to withdraw from the rubs and the railings of nell that was privy to some of her failings said i honest nell you have an excellent tongue that according to phrase is most notably hung for it sounds like a bell and goes off with a twang but i hope you will excuse me invincible nelly if i like a friend take the freedom to tell ye you banter too hard on the brows of your master and open those sores that have need of a plaster with that the huge termagant devil turned back i believe says the jade you come in for a snack they are sparks like your self and not i cries the blowze that with antlers and buds injure honest mens brows and when they are absent by kissing their spouses make bridges of many poor cuckoldly noses thought i it is more prudence my tongue to

care youre a wicked young rascal you know that you are however in time thou will surely recant will once more forgive thee whatever comes on it so dick here is a bumper of pacification most heartily wishng thy new reformation for drinking thou know is a very sad evil and whoring and gaming the flesh and the devil abandon my boy all such things that have hurt in or else for these sins thou wilt be damned of a certain says dick to his father how could you suppose when you got your poor son with that clarety nose but that he must love by the dint of each ruby the bottle when weaned from its likeness the bubby my father and mother have always loved claret and hew do you think that the son should forbear it whose blood i might venture to swear without sinning was but claret refined at the very beginning says daddy did ever man hear such a dog uch a witty young cub such a bantering rogue uch a pleasant and merry companion who rather than stifle a jest will make one of his father ah dick if thy wit was but balanced with grace thou for certain would never let it fly in my face but however since the bottle has got the ascendant or once i will forgive thee and so there is an end on it n hopes when youre sober you manners will mend on it o father says dick could you taste the delights that my self and companions enjoy a nights were you once but to hear the cunnundrums and quibbles the retorts and the puns the lampoons and the libels the rhimes repetitions the songs and the catches the whims and the flirts and the smart witty touches that over the flask we most lovingly vent ou would think a whole night most gloriously spent and would guess by our wit and the course that we follow we could all be no less than the sons of apollo ah dick says the father take care i entreat ye thou would better be hanged of the two than be witty for if you are once thought by the studies and labors to have acquired more wit than the rest of thy neighbors thou wilt be pissed on by fools and be feared by thy betters and hunted about by whores bailiffs and setters thy lodging must be in some ninepenny garret thy drink porters guzzle much oftener than claret thy coat must through all the four seasons be worn till it is robbed of its nap like a sheep newly shorn you must always seem pleasant that is if you can keep your wits ready primd for a flash in the pan when your pockets are empty your brains must project puns quibbles and tales to supply the defect that whenever you meet with a generous chub you may sneak out a jest in the room of your club for a wit is no more than a

charming evil that all delights are off springs of the devil ill manners sure to such aspersions cast on blessings which we find oblige our taste and highly impious to condemn as vain what the kind gods for humane use ordain if it is illbreeding proudly to withstand the meanest gift from a superior hand surely without offense we cannot slight what bounteous heaven has given for our delight shall i if i have an appetite to eat for roos and herbs forsake much better meat or if my heart to hymen does incline must i drink water when i lust for wine no let dll bigots with the stream agree bacchus shall be the jolly god for me what if celindas graces i admire and her soft charms should set my breast on fire why should not we if the kind dame agrees our loving selves instead of others please in doing which we mutually approve the works of heaven in the delights of love love which sublimes the blessings we pursue and makes the gods well pleased with what we do let the old cinick from the world retired rail in his age at what his youth admired tos hut confined drink water and repent feed on raw roots and boast of his content hug his own follies and those joys despise which not his virtues but his age denies snarl at our pleasures and our pomp abuse which he wants wealth tuphold or strength to use thus like town bullies his ill nature show who damn those beauties which they cannot subdue our wiser guides may tell us if they please true happiness consists in whims like these and that the old morose athenian grub who snarling lived ins penitential tub possessed more comforts and enjoyed more ease than princes in their gaudy palaces such frantic doctrine may sometimes persuade beggars and slaves when melancholy mad that wealth is dirt and honor but a toy and none except the poor true peace enjoy who else can fancy true felicity consists in stinking rags and poverty and that a scanty meal is better far than all the costly dainties we prepare that nothing truly can afford content but cold retirement and a self restraint if peace and her companion virtue dwells n caves and tubs and subterranean cells and starving cinicks in their lonely huts who pride themselves in punishing their guts can happy be who happiness despise then to be mad is surely to be wise o great lucretius thou shall be my guide like thee i will live and by thy rules abide measure my pleasures by my appetites and unconfined pursue the worlds delights for liberty makes every action sweet and relishes our joys as salt our meat without we no true happiness could boast the taste of every blessing would be lost the sweetest bliss would but a slavery prove and we should then but hate what now we love my native freedom therefore il employ choose what i like and what i like enjoy suppose bright beauty should invade my breast and with her pleasing darts disturb my rest so that i sigh all day and wish all night for her my only object of delight what must i marry no i will not be cloyed the bit i will nibble but the hook avoid for cold restraint makes every thing seem worse and often turns our blessings to a curse i love my bed when i my rest would take must it be therefore corded to my back if i delight my gelding to bestride must i be always to the saddle tied what the i chiefly love one sort of meat it is punishment to have nothing else to eat the charming sex icknowledge i adore and value beauty much but freedom more if the kind nymph will yield to my desires and with her faours quench loves pleasing fires i will not with oaths and vows her faith deceive but prove as kind as nature givers me leave be constant too as long as ever i can but will not promise to be more than man and when i am tired that she the truth may know i will frankly without flattery tell her so thus would i deal with loves rebellious flame when cloyed with one i would still pursue fresh game and not enslave my self or yet deceive the dame when one delight by use insipid grew i would change the stale enjoyment for a new from amorous sports to the bottle i would repair to fill those veins i would emptied with the fair drink till my wts were ripe and brains were full for to be sober is but to be dull songsters and wits i would for companions choose one for their music the other for their muse that some kind voice might readily supply our thoughtful intervals with harmony thus would we chase old father time all night shorten our days to lengthen our delight drink healths sing catches talk of past intrigues and strengthen bottle friendship with new leagues swallow down bumpers to each left hand friend and vow a thousand things we never intend when thus well fraighted with the cheerful juice wed sally forth and give our selves a loose break brothl windows scour the crazy watch and with fresh mischiefs crown the nights debauch but soon as bright aurora should draw nigh and with her blushes gild the eastern sky drowsy and drunk wed stagger to our beds and in sots hevn compose our aching heads there drown in sleep the memory of our sins and rise refreshed as drury lane begins for new diversions to the playhouse fly seek out new faces and their humors try flatter the coy and ridicule the free tattle with punks and ogle quality who in their upper region awful sit and cull their brawny stallions from the pit sometimes i would be attentive to the stage the poets princess should my eyes engage if she performed her part with excellence and trod the stage with graceful impudence i would clap the dowdy till my arms were sore as she perhaps had many a spark before with pleasure hear the oergrown poppet whine and prostrate mourn over some dead lovers shrine laugh in my sleeve to know the cunning jade kneels down a w  re yet rises for a maid next scene perhaps some hero might appear that lived long since the lord knows when or where who in a raving fit of jealous love would curse his angry stars and threaten jove that the fair sex might with concern behold how henpeckd monarchs raved and loved of old and learn from thence to over kings prevail and make the head subservient to the tail thus on each scene would i my judgment spend clap when they pleased and hiss should they offend applaud the poet when his lines were full commend his wit but damn his muse when dull keck when i heard the barnet mimick raise his croaking voice in famed ben johnsons plays blush that full boxes and a crowded pit should delight more in apish whims than wit for what dull miscreant could with patience see a noble play quite spoiled with foolery and french jackpuddings in a thankless age affront immortal shakespeare on the stage so nice fop epicures disdain to eat without some foreign sauce true english meat and think through a mistake the wholesome food cannot without such paultry stuff be good when all their illmixd rareties at last spoil the regale and but confound the taste when for three hours i would thus with pleasure viewed the strutting mimicks and their listening crowd till a dull epilogue perhaps new writ b some young upstart rhimer in the pit should gain a clap to dignifie his verse fit only to adorn a smithfield farce then to some brothel would i steer my course where beauty needs no flattery or force but where a golden bribe will purchase bliss and open all the gates of paradise gold whose prevailing touch we daily see will charm the soul of the most charming she who when the powerful indian gods in view will sacrifice their all to gold and you thus would i conquer who i most admired triumph over beauty till my loins were tired walow in love and by exerting much work out the dregs of the last nights debauch reresh my limbs by a kind pleasing sweat better than with a bagnios painful heat thus should my chloe double kindness show and be both doxy and my doctress too supple my joints at once and cool my flame and when i would gratified the obliging dame i would leave her to the next lewd rake that came then i would repair to queen fortunas court where hawkeyd bullies and rich fools resort where wolves with lambs and kites with chickens play and eagles do on gaudy peacocks prey where many seek but very few can find the fickle dame they cort continue kind who like a subtle jilt seems often vexed and if she smile one minute fros the next there with the fatal instruments of chance hazard my store in hopes to more advance draw in rich bubbles cog lie flatter cheat and push at all to be profusely great with eager hopes blind fortune thus pursue and win from nobles what is their tradesmens due but should the fickle dame her smiles refuse i would damn the sullen jilt that made me lose confound the tongue that taught me first to game and curse the uncertain dice that crossed my aim for each at play this privilege may take winners may smile and losing gamesters speak no sneaking sum should my ambition bound i would be a b  chr or my all conound insinuate with my wealthy ladys son cringe to the fop and cheat him when i would done drink with young heirs then draw them in to play praise them for wits and on their weakness prey for unexperienced fools we dialy see though never so stubborn bend to flattery should hoodwinked chance to gratify my pride thus kindly place me on the winning side and guide the dice with her prevailing hand till my extensive wishes i had obtained fortune would i adore and only she for her past favors should my goddess be a coach and six i would to her glory raise and over the stones would rattle forth her praise proud of my illgot wealth with scorn look ou and laugh at honest fools that walk on foot contented to be poor for conscience sake whilst libertines by fraud their fortunes make to thee kind chance that does allot the prize thou partial goddess of the cards and dice i would sacrifice from out the numerous swarm some poor levantine bully every term till none should dare thy altars to abuse and push at all who nothing have to lose but creep behind and with a courtly mein turn humble supplicants to those that win then to advance my own immortal fame and make distressed punks adore my name i would build an almshouse for each castoff whore and as i would gulled the rich i would feed the poor bribe irish stallions with my english gold to please the lame blind ugly and the old that those course objects we despise might share what is now engrossed by the youthful and the fair thus every hump and squinny should enjoy as much of love as they could well employ with new found acts of charity like these never yet performed the sinful world i would please till every illshapd dowdy should confess to me alone she owned her happiness and say there goes the man g  d speed him well that saved our souls from leading apes in hell nay toothless beldams wrinkld and defaced should mumble out their blessings as i passed and cry all honor be my masters due who feeds those mouths that have no teeth to chew this would i do though by the saints reviled where i as rich as d  b or as c  d like quality the sunday would i spend and duly covent garden church attend religion would i modishly profess by seven rise and take three hours to dress then in my chariot rattle through the street to church where hypocrites in clusters meet amongst the listening crowd i would squeeze for room and with my snush the sweaty air perfume till the pewkeeper more for gain than grace should wedge me into some commodious place where i the gaudy christian herd might view and to the fair my own deportment show i would pierce the ladies with an amorous eye but all their pious looks and cheats defy take notice who was fairest or most fine who had the blackest hair or whitest skin what charming phubsy had the lovelist breast who was the most devout and prayed the best who had the brikest eye and fullest brow denoting a good furbulo below who had an awful look and modest grace and who a lustful air and tempting face thus as an observator would i sit inspect the galleries first and then the pit and from the different saints in sundry pews at once learn how to judge and how to choose perhaps behold some lewd notorious punk that never prays but when she is maudlin drunk pluck down her hoods kneel low amongst the rest and seem as quaint a christian as the best hold up her sinful hands respond as loud as the uprightst saint in all the holy crowd and when she is done resume her matted place with sin and sorrow blushing in her face yet all pure art without one spark of grace when prayer was over with patience would i sit and hear old sternhold rhyme to davids wit but smile to see the clark his looks compose and saddle with his spectacles his nose then coughing spit and when his lungs were calm turn to his book and snuffle out a psalm wherein each zealot fond of singing praise might squeak their ekes and grumble out their ayes over the doleful song i would yawn and gape what christian could resolve against a nap or who forbear to dose at every line that did not in the drowsy chorus join my head i am sure their grave slow time would keep for whilst they chanted i should nod and sleep like gammer friskit in her wicker chair lulled by now ponder well you parents dear thus during prayers the painful hour i would spend and small attention to the sermon lend but ever twas well begun still wish it at an end with patience i would hear the preacher throw his darts upon the sinful crowd below observe his knack when prettily he talked how well he hemmed how gracefully he haulkd how mannerly he did his nostrils blow and how he luggd the cushion to and fro how earnestly sometimes his words came out and how he thrashd the pope and devilish about when the last sand of the long hour had run and told old spintext when twas time to have done i would rise among the rest and gaze around till i some famed intriguing lady found invited by her eyes and some kind smile as she walked out i would meet her in the isle with amorous whispers i would her ears approach squeeze her soft hand conduct her to her coach and lay the groundwork of a new debauch then to some rakish friends my course i would steer strangers to faith and enemies to fear there ridicule with them the canting priest and make religion but our common jest raise up dead hobs to justify our cause and overthrow divine by natures laws burlesque the scriptures and asperse the creed awed by no musty rules love drink and feed this is the happy life we modish rakes would lead finis a catalogue of poems etc printed and sold by h hills in blackfryars

knight of the bath  london rinted and sold by h hills in blackfriars near the waterside   0   to the king sir after the delivery of your royal fathers person into the hands of the army i undertaking to the queen mother that i would find some means to get access to him she was pleased to send me and by the help of hugh peters i got my admittance and coming well instructed from the queen his majesty having been long kept in the dark he was pleased to discourse very freely with me of the whole state of his affairs but sir i will not launch into a history instead of an epistle one morning waiting on him at causham smiling upon me he said he could tell me some news of my self which was that he had seen some verses of mine the evening before being those to sir richard fanshaw and asking me when i made them i told him two or three years since he was pleased to say that having never seen them before he was afraid i had written them since my return into england and though he liked them well he would advise me to write no more alleging that when men are young and have little else to do they might vent the overflowings of their fancy that way but when they were thought fit for more serious employments if they still persisted in that course it would look as if they minded not the way to any better  whereupon i stood corrected as long as i had the honor to wait upon him and at his departure from hampton court he was pleased to command me to stay privately at london to send to him and receive from him all his letters from and to all his correspondents at home and abroad and i was furnished with nine several ciphers in order to it which trust i performed with great safety to the persons with whom we corresponded but about nine months after being discovered by their knowledge of mr cowleys hand i happily escaped both for my self and those that held correspondence with me that time war too hot and busy for such idle speculations but after i had the good fortune to wait upon your majesty in holland and france you were pleased sometimes to give me arguments to divert and put off the evil hours of our banishment which now and then fell not short of your majestys expectation  after when your majesty departing from st germans to jersy was pleased freely without my asking to confer upon me that place wherein i have now the honor to serve you i then gave over poetical line and made it my business to draw such others as might be more serviceable to your majesty and i hope more laing since that time i never disobeyed my old asters commands till this ummer at the wes my retirement the tepting me to divert those melancholy thoughts which the new apperitn of foreign invasion and domestic dicontent gave us but thee clouds being now happily blown over and our sun clearly shining out again i have recovered the relapse i being suspected that it would have proved the epidemical disease of age which is apt to fall back into the foes in youh yet socrates aristotle and cao did the same and scaliger says that ragment of aristotle was beynd any thing that pindar or homer ever wrote i will not call this a dedication for those epistles are commonly greater absurdities than any that come after for what author cn reasonably believe that fixing the great name of some eminent patron in the forehead of his book can charm away censure and that the first leaf should be a curtain to draw over and hide all the deformities that stand behind it neither have i any need f such shfs for most of the parts of thy body have already had your majestys view and having past the test of cle  sharp sighted a judgment which has as good a title to give law in matters of this nature as in any other they wh shall presume to dissent from your majesty will do more wrong to their own judgment than their judgment can do to me and for those latter parts which have not yet received your majestys favorable aspect if they who have sen them do not fltter me for i dare not trust my own judgment they will make it appear that it is not with me as with most of mankind who never forsake their darling vices till their vices forsake them and that this divorce was not frigiditatis causa but an act of choice and not of necessity therefore sir i shall only call it an humbl petition that your majesty will pease to pardon this new amor to my old mistress and my disobedience to his commands to whose memory i look upon with great reverence and devotion and making a seriouus reflection upon that wise advice it carries much greater weight with it now than when it was given fr when age and experience has so ripened mans discreion as to make it fit for use either in private or publick affairs nothing blasts and corupts the fruit of it so much as the empty airy reputation of being nimis poeta and therefore i shall take my leave of the muses as two of my predecessors did saying  splendidis longum vale dico nugis hic versus and caesera ludiera pono your majestys most faithful and loyal subject and most dutiful and devoted servant jo denham  coopershill sure there are poets which did never dream upon parnassus nor did taste the stream of helicon we therefore may suppose those made not poets but the poet those and as courts make not kings but kings the court so where the muses and their train resort parnassus stands if i can be to thee a poet thou parnassus art to me nor wonder if advantaged in my flight by taking wing from thy auspicious height through untracd ways and airy paths i fly more boundless in my fancy than my eye my eye which swift as thought contracts the space that lies between and first salutes the place crowned with that sacred pile so vast so high that whether ts part of earth or sky uncertain seems and may be thought a proud aspiring mountain or descending cloud pauls the late theme of such a muse whose flight m w  his bravely reached and soared above thy height now shall thou stand though sword or time or fire or zeal more fierce than they thy fall conspire secure whilst thee the best of poets sings preserved from ruin by the best of kings under his proud survey the city lies and like a mist beneath a hill does rise whose state and wealth the business and the crowd seems at this distance but a darker cloud and is to him who rightly things esteems no other in effect than what it seems where with like haste though several ways they run some to undo and some to be undone while luxury and wealth like war and peace are each the others ruin and increase as rivers lost in seas some secret vein thence reconveys there to be lost again o happiness of sweet retired content to be at once secure and innocent windsor the next where mars with venus dwells windsor  beauty with strength above the valley swells into my eye and does it self present with such an easy and unforct ascent that no stupendous precipice denies access no horror turns away our eyes but such a rise as does at once invite a pleasure and a reverence from the sight thy mighty masters emblem in whose face state meekness heightened with majestic grace such seems the gentle height made only proud to he the basis of that pompous load than which a nobler weight no mountain bears but atlas only that supports the spears when natures hand this ground did thus advance twas guided by a wiser power than chance marked out for such a use as if twere meant to invite the builder and his choice prevent nor can we call it choice when what we choose folly or blindness only could refuse a crown of such majestic towers does grace the gods great mother when her heavenly race do homage to her yet she cannot boast amongst that numerous and celestial host more heros than can windsor nor does fames immortal book record more noble names not to look back so far to whom this isle owes the first glory of so brave a pile whether to caesar albanact or brute the british arthur or the danish knute though this of old no less contest did move than when for homers birth seven cities strove like him in birth thou shouldst be like in fame as thine his fate if mine had been his flame but whosoeer it was nature designed first a brave place and then as brave a mind not to recount those several kings to whom it gave a cradle or to whom a tomb but the great edward third and the black prince edward and thy greater son the lillies which his father wore he won and thy queen philipa bellona who the consert came not only to thy bed but to thy fame the kings of france and scotland she to the triumph led one captive king and brought that son which did the second bring then did thou found that order whether love or victory thy royal thoughts did move each was a noble cause and nothing less than the design has been the great success which foreign kings and emperors esteem the second honor to their diadem had thy great destiny but given the skill to know as well as power to act her will that from those kings who then thy captives were in aftertime should spring a royal pair who should possess all that thy mighty power or thy desires more mighty did devour to whom their better fate reserves whatever the victor hopes for or the vanquished fear that blood which thou and thy great gransire shed and all that since these sister nations bled had been unspilt had happy edward known that all the blood he spilt had been his own when he that patron chose in whom are enjoyed soldier and martyr and his arms confined within the azure circle he did seem but to foretell and prophecy of him who to his realms that azure roun has joined which nature for their bound at first designed that boun which to the worlds extremest ends end it self s liquid arms extends nor does he need those emblems which we paint but is himself the soldier and the saint here should my wonder dwell and here my praise but my fixed thoughts my wandering eye betrays viewing a neighboring hill whose top of late a chapel crowned till in the common fate the adjoyding abbey fell may no such storm fall on our times where ruin must reform tell me my muse what monstrous dire offense what crime could any christian king incense to such a rage was it luxury or lust was he so temperate so chaste so just were these their crimes they were his own much more but wealth is crime enough to him that is poor who having spent the treasures of his crown condemns their luxury to feed his own and yet this act to varnish over the shame of sacrilege must bear devotions name no crime so bold but would be understood a real or at least a seeming good who fears not to do ill yet fears the name and free from conscience is a slave to fame thus he the church at once protects and spoils but princes swords are sharper than their styles and thus to thages past he makes amends their charity destroys their faith defends then did religion in a lazy cell in empty airy contemplations dwell and like the block unmoved lay but ours as much to active like the stork devours is there no temperate region can be known betwixt their frigid and our torrid zone could we not wake from that lethargick dream but to be restless in a worse extreme and for that lethargy was there no cure but to be cast into a calenture can knowledge have no bound but must advance so far to make us wish for ignorance and rather in the dark to grope our way than led by a false guide to err by day who sees these dismal heaps but would demand what barbarous invader sacked the land but when he hears no goth no turk did bring this desolation but a christian king when nothing but the name of zeal appears twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs what does he think our sacrilege would spare when such the effects of our devotion are parting from thence twixt anger shame and fear those for what is past and this for what is too near my eye descending from the hill surveys where thames amongst the wanton valleys strays thames the most loved of all the ocean sons thames  by his old sire to his embraces runs hasting to pay his tribute to the sea like mortal life to meet eternity though with those streams he no resemblance hold whose foam is amber and their gravel gold his genuine and less guilty wealth to explore search not his bottom but survey his shore over which he kindly spreads his spacious wing and hatches plenty for the ensuing spring nor then destroys it with too fond a stay like mothers which their infants overlay nor with a sudden and impetuous wave like profuse kings resums the wealth he gave no unexpected inundations spoil the mowers hopes nor mock the plowmans toil but godlike his unwearied bounty flows first loves to do than loves the good he does nor are his blessings to his banks confined but free and common as the sea or wind when he to boast or to disperse his stores full of the tributes of his grateful shores visits the world and in his flying towers brings home to us and makes both indies ours finds wealth where it is bestows it where it wants cities in deserts woods in cities plants so that to us no thing no place is strange while his fair bosom is the worlds exchange o could i flow like thee and make thy stream my great example as it is my theme though deep yet clear though gentle yet not dull strong without rage without oreflowing full heaven her eridanus no more shall boast whose fame in thine like lesser currents lost thy nobler streams shall visit joves aboads to shine among the stars and bathe the gods here nature the forrest whether more intent to please us or her self with strange varieties for things of wonder give no less delight to the wise makers than beholders sight though these delights from several causes wove for so our children thus our friends we love wisely she knew the harmony of things as well as that of sounds from discords springs such was the discord which did first disperse form order beauty through the universe while dryness moisture coldness heat resists all that we have and that we have subsists while the steep horrid roughness of the wood strive with the gentle calmness of the flood such huge extremes when nature does unite wonder from thence results from thence delight the stream is so transparent pure and clear narcissus  that had the selfenamourd youth gazed here so fatally deceived he had not been while he the bottom not his face had seen but his proud head the airy mountain hides among the clouds his shoulders and his sides a shady mantle clothes his curled brows frown on the gentle stream which calmly flows while winds and storms his lofty forehead beat the common fate of all that is high or great low at his foot a spacious plain is placed between the mountain and the stream embraced which shade and shelter from the hill derives while the kind river wealth and beauty gives and in the mixture of all these appears variety which all the rest indears this scene had some bold greek or british bard eheld of old what stories had we heard of fairies satyrs and the nymphs their dames their feasts their revels and their amorous flames it is still the same although their airy shape all but a quick poetic sight escape there faunus and silvanus keep their courts and thither all the horned host resorts to graze the ranker mead that noble heard on whose sublime and shady fronts is reared natures great masterpiece to show how soon great things are made but sooner are undone here have i seen the king when great affairs ave leave to slacken and unbend his cares ttended to the chase by all the flower of youth whose hopes a nobler prey devour leasure with praise and danger they would buy and wish a foe that would not only fly the stag now conscious of his fatal growth t once indulgent to his fear and sloth to some dark covert his retreat had made where no mans eye nor heavens should invade s soft repose when the unexpected sound f dogs and men his wakeful ear does wound ouzd with the noise he scarce believes his ear illing to think the illusions of his fear  given this false alarm but strait his view onfirms that more than all he fears is true betrayed in all his strengths the wood beset all instruments all arts of ruin met he calls to mind his strength and then his speed his winged heels and then his armed head with these to avoid with that his fate to meet but fear prevails and bids him trust his feet so fast he flies that his reviewing eye has lost the chasers and his ear the cry exulting till he finds their nobler sense their disproportioned speed does recompense then curses his conspiring feet who scent betrays that safety which their swiftness lent then tries his friends among the baser heard where he so lately was obeyed and feared his safety seeks the herd unkindly wise or chases him from thence or from him flies like a declining statesman left forlorn to his friends pity and pursuers scorn with shame remembers while himself was one of the same herd himself the same had done thence to the coverts and the conscious groves the scenes of his past triumphs and his loves sadly surveying where he ranged alone prince of the soil and all the herd his own and like a bold knight errant did proclaim combat to all and bore away the dame and taught the woods to echo to the stream his dreadful challenge and his clashing beam yet fairly now declines the fatal strife so much his love was dearer than his life now every leaf and every moving breath presents a foe and every foe a death wearied forsaken and pursued at last all safety in despair of safety placed courage he thence resumes resolved to bear all their assaults since it is in vain to fear and now too late he wishes for the fight that strength he wasted in ignoble flight but when he sees the eager chase renewed himself by dogs the dogs by men pursued he strait revokes his bold resolve and more repents his courage than his fear before finds that uncertain ways unsafest are and doubt a greater mischief than despair then to the stream when neither friends nor force nor speed nor art avail he shaps his course thinks not their rage so desperate to assay an element more merciless than they but fearless they pursue nor can the flood quench their dire thirst alas they thirst for blood so toward a ship the oarefind galleys ply which wanting sea to ride or wind to fly stands but to fall revenged on those that dare tempt the last fury of extreme despair so fares the stag among the enraged hounds repels their force and wounds returns for wounds and as a hero whom his baser foes in troops surrounds now these assails now those though prodigal of life disdains to dye by common hands but if he can descry some nobler foes approach to him he calls and begs his fate and then contented falls so when the king a mortal shaft lets fly from his unerring hand then glad to dye proud of the wound to it resigns his blood and stains the crystal with a purple flood this a more innocent and happy chase than when of old but in the selfsame place runny mead where that great charter was first sealed fair liberty pursued and meant a prey to lawless power here turned and stood at bay when in that remedy all hope was placed which was or should have been at least the last here was that charter sealed wherein the magna charta crown all marks of arbitrary power lays down tyrant and slave those names of hate and fear the happier style of king and subject bear happy when both to the same center move when kings give liberty and subjects love therefore not long in force this charter stood wanting that seal it must be sealed in blood the subjects armed the more their princes gave the advantage only took the more to crave till kings by giving gave themselves away and even that power that should deny betray who gives constrained but his own fear reviles not thanked but scorned nor are thy gifts but spoils thus kings by grasping more than they could hold first made their subjects by oppression bold and popular sway by forcing kings to give more than was fit for subjects to receive ran to the same extremes and one excess made both by striving to be greater less when a calm river raised with sudden rains or snows dissolved overflows the adjoining plains the husbandmen with highraisd banks secure their greedy hopes and this he can endure but if with bays and dams they strive to force his chanel to a new or narrow course no longer

large militias on his head as if he practiced majesty he walked and at his nod he made not have but stalked by his large shade he saw how great he was and his vast layers on the bended grass his thought as large as his proportion grew and judged himself as fit for empire too thus to rebellious hopes he swelled at length love and ambition growing with his strength this hid ambition his bold passion shows and from a subject to a rival grows sollicites all his princes fearful dames and in his fight courts with rebellious flames the prince sees this with an inflamed eye but looks are only signs of majesty when once a princes will meets a restraint his power is then esteemed but his complaint his head then shakes at which the affrighted herd start to each side his rival not afeard stands by his mistress side and stirs not thence but bids her own his love and his defense the quarrel now to a vast height is grown both urged to fight by passion and a throne but love has most excuse for all we find have passions though not thrones alike assigned the sovereign stag shaking his loaded head on which his scepters with his arms were spread wisely by nature there together fixed where with the tittle the defense was mixed the pace which he advanced with to engage became at once his majesty and rage tother stands still with as much confidence to make his part seem only his defense their heads now meet and at one blow each strikes as many strokes as if a rank of pikes grew on his brows as thick their antlets stand which every year kind nature does disband wild beasts sometimes in peace and quiet are but man no season frees from love or war with equal strength they met as if two oaks had fell and mingled with a thousand strokes one by ambition urged the other disdain one to preserve the other fought to gain the subjects and the mistresses stood by with love and duty to crown victory for all affections wait on prosperous fame not he that climbs but he that falls meet shame while thus with equal courages they meet the wounded earth yields to their struggling feet and while one slides the other pursues the fight and thinks that forced retreat looks like a flight but then ashamed of his retreat at length drives his foe back his rage renews his strength as even weights into a motion thrown by equal turns drive themselves up and down so sometimes one then tother stag prevails and victory yet doubtful holds the scales the prince ashamed to be opposed so long with all his strength united rushes on the rebel weaker than at first appears and from his courage sinks unto his fears not able longer to withstand his might from a retreat at last steals to a flight the mighty stag pursues his flying foe till his own pride of conquest made him slow thought it enough to scorn a thing that flies and only now pursued him with his eyes the vanquished as he fled turned back his fight ashamed to fly and yet afraid to fight sometimes his wounds as his excuse surveyed then fled again and then looked back and stayed blusht that his wounds so slight should not deny strength for a fight that left him strength to fly calls thoughts of love and empire to his aid but fears more powerful than all those persuade and yet in spite of them retains his shame his cooled ambition and his halfquenchd flame there is none from their own sense of shame can fly and dregs of passions dwell with misery now to the shades he bends his feeble course despised by those that once admired his force the wretch that to a scorned conditions thrown with the worlds favor loses too his own while fawning troops their conquering prince enclosed now rendered absolute by being oppod princes by disobedience get command and by new quenched rebellions firmer stand till by the boundless offers of success they meet their fate in illusd happiness the vanquished stag to thickest shades repairs where he finds safety punished with his cares thorough the vvoods he rushes not but glides and from all searches but his own he hides ashamed to live unwilling yet to lose that wretched life he knew not how to use in this retirement thus he lived concealed till with his wounds his fears were almost healed his ancient passions now began to move he thought again of empire and of love then roused himself and stretched at his full length took the large measure of his mighty strength then shook his loaded head the shadow too shook like a tree where leaveless branches grew stooping to drink he sees it in the streams and in the woods hears clashing of his beams no accident but does alike proclaim his growing strength and his increasing shame now once again resolves to try his fate  for envy always is importunate and in the mind perpetually does move a fit companion for unquiet love he thinks upon his mighty enemy circld about with power and luxury and hoped his strength might sink in his desires remembering he had wasted in such fires yet while he hoped by them to overcome he wished the others fatal joys his own thus the unquiet beast in fasety lay where nothing was to fear nor to obey where he alone commanded and was lord of every bounty nature did afford chose feasts for every arbitrary sense an empire in the state of innocence but all the feasts nature before him placed had but faint relishes to his lost taste sick minds like bodies in a fever spent turn food to the disease not nourishment sometimes he stole abroad and shrinking stood under the shelter of the friendly wood casting his envious eyes toward those plains where with crowned joys his mighty rival reigns he saw the obeying herd marching along and weighed his rivals greatness by the throng want takes false measures both of power and joys and envied greatness is but crowd and noise not able to endure this hated sight back to the shades he flies to seek out nigt like exiles from their native soils though sent to better countries think it banishment here he enjoyed what the other could have there the woods are shady and the streams as clear the pastures more untainted where he fed and every night chose out an unprest bed but then his laboring soul with dreams was pressed and found the greatest weariness in rest his dreadful rival in his sleep appears and in his dreams again he fights and fears shrinks at the strokes of to others mighty head feels every wound and dreams how fast he fled at this he wakes and with his fearful eyes salutes the light that fleet the eastern skies still half amazed looks round and held by fear scarce can believe no enemy was near but when he saw his heedless fears were brought not by a substance but a drowsy thought his ample sides he shakes from whence the dew in scattered showers like driven tempests flew at which through all his breast new boldness spread and with his courage raised his mighty head then by his love inspired resolves to try the combat now and overcome or die every weak passion sometimes is above the fear of death much more the noblest love by hope it is scorned and by despair it is sought pursued by honor and by sorrow brought resolved the paths of danger now to tread from his scorned shelter and his fears he fled with a brave have now seeks a second fight redeems the base one by a noble flight in the mean time the conqueror enjoyed that power by which he was to be destroyed how hard it is for the prosperous to see that fate which waits on power and victory thus he secuerly reigned when in a rout he saw the affrighted herd flying about as if some huntsmen did their chase pursue about themselves in scattered rings they flew he like a careful monarch raised his head to see what cause that strange disturbance bread but when the searchtout cause appeared no more than from a slave he had overcome before a bold disdain did in his looks appear and shook his aweful head to chide their fear the herd afraid of friend and enemy shrink from the one and from the other fly they scarce know which they should obey or trust since fortune only makes it safe and just yet in despite of all his pride he staid and this unlookt for chance with trouble weighed his rage and his contempt alike swelled high and only feared his enemy should fly he thought of former conquest and from thence cozened himself into a confidence the other that saw his conqueror so near stood still and listned to a whispering fear from whence she heard his conquest and his shame but newborn hopes his ancient fears orecame the mighty enemies now meet at length with equal fury though not equal strength for now too late the conqueror did find that all was wasted in him but his mind his courage in his weakness yet prevails as a bold pilot steers with tattered sails and cordage cracked directs no steady course carried by resolution more than force before his once scorned enemy he reels his wounds increasing with his shame he feels the others strength more from his weakness grows and with one furious push his rival throws so a tall oak the pride of all the vvood that long the assault of several storms has stood till by a mighty blast more powrfully pusht his roots torn up and to the earth he rusht yet then he raised his head on which there grew once all his power and all his title too unable now to rise and less to fight he raised those scepters to demand his right but such weak arguments prevail with none to plead their titles when their power is gone his head now sinks and with it all defense not only robbed of power but pretense wounds upon wounds the conqueror still gives and thinks himself unsafe while the other lives unhappy state of such as wear a crown fortune does seldom layem gently down now to the most scorned remedy he flies and for some pity seems to move his eyes pity by which the best of vertus tried to wretched princes ever is denied there is a debt to fortune which they pay for all their greatness by no common way the flattering troops unto the victor fly and own his title to his victory the faith of most with fortune does decline dutys but fear and conscience but design the victor now proud in his great success hastes to enjoy his fatal happiness forgot his mighty rival was destroyed but that which he so fondly now enjoyed in passions thus nature her self enjoys sometimes preserves and then again destroys yet all destruction which revenge can move time or

vulgar called a catchpole whose polluted hands the gods with force incredible and magic charms erst have indud if he his ample palm should happily on illfated shoulder lay of debtor straight his body to the touch obsequious as whilom knights were wont to some enchanted castle is conveyed where gates impregnable and coercive charm in durance vile detain him till in form of money pallas set the captive free beware ye debtors when ye walk beware be circumspect often which insiduous ken this caitiff eyes your steps alooff and often lies perdue in a creek or gloomy cave prompt to enchant some inadvertent wretch with his unhallowed touch so poets sing grimalkin to domestic vermin sworn an everlasting foe with watchful eye lies nightly brooding ore a chinky gap protending her fell claws to thoughtless mice sure ruin so her disembowelld web the spider in a hall or kitchen spreads obvious to vagrant flies she secret stands within her woven cell the humming prey regardless of their fate rush on the toils inextricable nor will ought avail their arts nor arms nor shapes of lovely hue the wasp insidious and the buzzing drone and butterfly proud of expanded wings distinct with gold entangled in her snares useless resistance make with eager strides she towering flies to her expected spoils then with envenomed jaws the vatal blood drinks of reluctant foes and to her cave their bulky carcasses triumphant drags so pass my days but when nocturnal shades this world invelop and the inclement air persuades men to repel benumming frosts with pleasant wines and crackling blaze of wood me lonely sitting nor the glimmering light of makeweight candle nor the joyous talk of lovely friends delights distressed forlorn amidst the horrors of the tedious night darkling i sigh and feed with dismal thoughts my anxious mind or sometimes mournful verse indite and sing of groves and myrtle shades or desperate lady near a purling stream or lover pendant on a willowtree mean while i labor with eternal drought and restless wish in vain my parched throat finds no relief nor heavy eyes repose but if a slumber happily does invade my weary limbs my fancy still awake longing for drink and eager in my dream tipples imaginary pots of ale awake i find the settled thirst  still gnawing and the pleasant phantom curse thus do i live from pleasure quite debarred nor taste the fruits that the suns genial rays mature johnapple nor the downy peach nor walnut in roughfurrowd coat secure nor medlar fruit delicious in decay afflictions great yet greater still remain my galligaskins that have long withstood the winters fury and encroaching frosts by time subdued what will not time subdue a horrid chasm disclose with orifice wide discontinuous at which the winds eurus and auster and the dreadful force of boreas that congeals the cronian waves tumultuous enter with dire chilling blasts portending agues thus a wellfraught ship long sailed secure or through the egean deep or the ionian till cruising near the lilybean shore with hideous crush on scylla or charybdis dangerous rocks she strikes rebounding whence the shattered oak so fierce a shock unable to withstand admits the sea in at the gaping side the crouding waves gush with impetuous rage resistless overwhelming horrors seize the mariners death in their eyes appears they stare they lave they plump they swear they pray vain efforts still the battering waves rush in implacable till deluged by the foam the ship sinks foundring in the vast abyss to a lady with miltons paradise lost see here how bright the firstborn virgin shone and how the first fond lover was undone such powerful words our charming mother spoke as miltons are and such as yours her look yours the best copy of the original face whose beauty was to furnish all her race your charms no author can escape but he there is no way to be safe but not to see a song i what put off with one denial and not make a second trial you might see my eyes consenting all about me was relenting women obliged to dwell in forms forgive the youth who boldly storms ii lovers when you sigh and languish when you tell us of your anguish to the nymph you will be more pleasing when those sorrows you are reasing we love to try how far men dare and never wish the foe should spare a song by mr cheek bright cythias power divinely great what heart is not obeying a thousand cupids on her wait and in her eyes are playing she seems the quee of love to reign for she alone dispences such sweets as best can entertain the gust of all the senses her face a charming prospect brings her breath gives balmy blisses i hear an angel when she sings and taste of heaven in kisses four senses thus she feasts with joy from natures chiefest treasure let me the other sense
