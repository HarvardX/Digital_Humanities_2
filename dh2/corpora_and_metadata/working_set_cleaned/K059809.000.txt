the great law of subordination considered or the insolence and unsufferable behavior of servants in england duly inquired into  illustrated with a great variety of examples historical cases and remarkable stories of the behavior of some particular servants suited to all the several arguments made use of as they go on  in ten familiar letters  together with a conclusion being an earnest and moving remonstrance to the housekeepers and heads of families in great britain pressing them not to cease using their utmost interest especially at this juncture to obtain sufficient laws for the effectual regulation of the manners and behavior of their servants  as also a proposal containing such heads or constitutions as would effectually answer this great end and bring servants of every class to a just and yet not a grievous regulation  london sold by s harding at the post house in st martinslane w lewis in covent garden t worrall at the judgeshead against st dunstanschurch

behavior of servants in this nation is now it may be hoped come to its height their measure of insolence i think may be said to be quite full  private families have struggled long with it the injured reputation of masters mistresses youngladies and gentlemen which has lain so long at the mercy of their servants tongues has groaned under it the patience of the heads of families under the rudeness and insults they have suffered has been enough and indeed too much provoked the poor husbandman artificer and manufacturer have suffered sufficiently in a word the grievance is become national and calls aloud for a remedy  i confess in the beginning of this work i seemed to stand alone in the complaint and some to whom i showed these sheets though they owned the fact did not think it important enough to appear that it was below the dignity of the pen and would not influence the world as i hoped it would to attempt a cure  but those gentlemen are since convinced of their mistake and that they did not think it was an evil of so extensive a nature as it now appears to be they thought it only regarded a few citizens wives and tradesmens housemaids or a few gentlemens footmen and the like they did not imagine that the husbandmen are ruined the farmers disabled manufacturers and artificers plunged to the destruction of trade and stagnation of their business and that no men who in the course of business employ numbers of the poor can depend upon any contracts they make or perform anything they undertake having no law no power to enforce their agreement or to oblige the poor to perform honestly what they are hired to do though ever so justly paid for doing it  they did not consider that the peace of families is ruined all household discipline at a full stop and that such innumerable disorders are the consequences of this one grievance that there was an absolute necessity of some speedy application for a remedy  but in the middle of this undertaking and after this work had been a considerable time in the press i had the satisfaction to see that the whole representative body of great britain concurred with my opinion and that which to some seemed not important enough for a book of complaint was found so significant as that the house of commons thought it worth while to take it into their consideration and to resolve upon measures for its redress  may those resolutions end as we have reason to hope they will in such laws as shall effectually deliver us from this burden which i have too much reason to say is become intolerable to to the whole nation  the great law of subordination considered etc letter i dear brother it was formerly said of england by way of proverb that it was the hell of horses the purgatory of servants and the paradise of women what might be the case in former days i know not but i must confess as things stand now i see no just reason for that way of speaking  as for the horses i shall not trouble you much upon that subject it is certain they have as great a quantity of horseflesh here as any nation in the world and as good a kind if not better considering that they excel in the breeds of all the sorts of horses together whereas other nations are singlar to a sort some nations have fine shaped horses as spanish genets and barbs some swift gallopers as the persians some strong and vastly large coachhorses as in handers some good draughthorses as the swiss others good cuirassiers or charging horses as in holstein and other parts of germany but england excels in all the kinds together and no nation goes beyond them  it is true the english have a great deal of business for horses and that almost in all parts of the island they have but little inland navigation and therefore not only their husbandry requires the labor of their cattle but most part of the heavy goods which are carried from place to place in trade are carried by land such as groceryware corn meal malt wine oil wool and woolenmanufacturies etc also in many places even their metals and minerals such as lead iron copper wrought iron stones and even coals and salt and other weighty and bulky goods are carried by landcarriage so that the horses in england do really work very hard and this perhaps may be the cause of the old saying that england is the hell of horses though i do not think it is just neither for this may really be said in the case that as the english work their horses very hard so generally speaking they feed them very well and take care of them well also and that better than in most countries that i have been in so i do not think it can be said it is the hell of horses but that by the way  as to the women and englands being the paradise of women it chiefly relates to the good customs and ancient laws made in behalf of the ladies by which they have better provisions made for them by the law with respect to their claim to the estates and the effects of their husbands after death and to the right of division among the heirs in personal estates and in some copyholds and to a right of coheirship by the customs of several tenures and in several cities and corporations and the like i say better than in other countries  but if we come to talk of the good usage of wives in england whether we speak of the generality of the nation or of particular persons i have not so much to say for them as perhaps they may expect the good treatment of wives in england is not such as may be much boasted of at present nor am i of the opinion of the ancient writers here that used to boast of the women of england that if there was a bridge over the narrowseas all the women in christendom would run over into england  in the first place i must acknowledge that since drunkenness is so much increased in england to which we owe a great many other ill customs which were never known in england before i say since this terrible eruption of drinking in england the usage of wives in this country is much altered from what it used to be in former times and even in a few years past you can not doubt but that flood of infatuation which has spread over the whole kingdom in the manner i shall inform you of in its turn has had its effect not only upon the morals but even upon the senses and good manners of the english nation the very blood and nature of men seems to be changed with their temperance they have lost their temper and with their virtue so much of their good humor for which they used to be so famed that they seem to be quite another kind of people than their ancestors were usually said to be and even than i myself remember them to be  in those days as the ancient fathers have reported things at least to me there was a softness and tenderness among them which i can see little of now especially for the women they generally treated them with a courteous kind and respectful manner different in many things from other nations and it is to this kind benevolent temper to which we owe all the ancient constitutions made in favor of the women which they talk so much of and with so good reason in england for in short you see very little done in their behalf in the last fifty or sixty years nay not in the last century nor have they any great prospect of new favors it is well if they can retain the privileges which the goodhumored ages of their ancestors left them possessed of  for now the case is quite altered familygovernment is exceedingly changed if not inverted and the men grow rigid surly cruel tyrannick and outrageous in a word as it is the cause of all the rest so the word may well comprehend all the rest they grow drunken and when i say that i have said all  the effect of this is seen abundance of ways in their families for it is of that i am now speaking and particularly of their conduct and treatment of their wives that they grow sottish and stupid more than ever and by that sordid way of living drink away their understandings and even their senses also to say nothing of their substance and estates by this they become brutish and sour in their families and at best deprive their wives and daughters not only of their care and management on which the prosperity of families so much depends but of the solace and comfort of their relation of their company and of all that enjoyment which derives from what we call a social life  as drunkenness has increased so indeed the comfort and familyhappiness of the women in england are decreased in proportion and in that very article their paradise if they had one before is in my opinion very much altered and most of the pleasure of it lost  but this is not all for as extremes follow one another and one ill habit may have a hundred ill consequences so this new usage of drinking as it stupifies and makes sots of some so in others it affects the passions fires the blood raises their spleen and sends men home to their families mad and outregeous so that instead of the kind mild and affable temper which the english nation used to be famed for as to their wives the men are now made a terror to them and to their whole families rageing storming and quarreling and too often fighting so that if you will believe themselves the case of the women in england is truly deplorable and there is scarce a good husband now to twenty that merited that name in former times nor was beating of wives ever so much the usage in england as it is now the difference is manifest and they tell me that it is so frequent now especially among the meaner sort of people that to hear a woman cry murder now scarce gives any alarm the neighbors scarce stir at it and if they do if they come out in a fright and ask one another what is the matter and where is it that they cry murder the common answer to one another is only thus it is nothing neighbor but such a one a beating his wife o dear says the other is that all and in they go again composed and easy as hearing a thing of no great consequence that has no great novelty in it nor much danger and what if it had they dont much care to meddle with in a word it is so common a thing now to bully and abuse their wives when they are in drink that i believe i may say there are very few men get drunk but that they do quarrel with beat or misuse their wives one way or other if this be their english paradise the women here may enjoy it by themselves i believe none of the wives in our country will trouble them or crowd in upon them for a share of the enjoyment  but this is not my present design neither the womens case is too long for this undertaking and deserves to be considered by itself it is added that as england is the paradise of women so it is the purgatory of servants this i object against more than i do that of women nay i exclaim against it nothing is more certain than that as the womens case is made worse by the change of their usage among us so that of the servants is infinitely varied the other way and we must allow that the proverb should be turned and we should say it is the purgatory of wives and the paradise of servants and this is the subject i intend to entertain you with for some time  nothing is more visible nor indeed breaks in so far upon our civil affairs in this nation as the surprising difference that there is in the behavior of servants of every rank and degree among us from what it was in former times from what it is now in other nations and from what indeed in the nature of the thing ought to be everywhere the complaint is so general and the grievance so very notorious that i need enter into no search after evidence of fact i shall therefore give you some general account of it in this letter and descend to particulars hereafter  by servants you are to understand me to mean the several denominations hereafter mentioned for i am not going to entertain you with a long complaint of a few footmen and cookwenches but the grievance possesses the whole body of the nation and all that bear the name of servant may be said to be more or less concerned   apprentices as well the apprentices to merchants and more eminent tradesmen as the apprentices to meaner people such as shopkeepers handicrafts artificers manufacturers etc   menial servants such as cooks gardeners butlers coachmen grooms footmen pages maidservants nurses etc all kept within doors at bed and board that is to say such as have yearly or monthly wages with meat drink lodging and washing   clerks to lawyers attorneys scriveners etc and to gentlemen in public offices and the like i shall speak of the laboring poor that is of servants without doors in a letter by itself for i have much also to say of them i assure you   in every one of these there appears a visible and important difference in almost every article which relate to them as servants by difference i mean between them and servants of the same class in former years  the first and last of these already named i mean merchants apprentices and lawyers clerks might indeed be said always to have some particular regard showed them as being oftentimes the sons of considerable families bred something above the ordinary rate of servants and that gave large sums to their masters in order to be introduced into a capital business which they were likely to have considerable stocks of their own to carry on yet these differ too very much  in former times it was usual to give great sums i say with apprentices to merchants but then those sums were called great in those times which are accounted but small sums now the reason of that i need not examine however i say great sums were given to principal merchants as particularly  00 l and sometimes but very rarely and more lately  00 l to eminent turkey merchants to the more considerable spanish and italian merchants from  00 l to   0 l and these were the firstrate premios that were given in the city of london for about  0 or  0 years ago nor if i am informed right was ever more than  00 l given with an apprentice to the best turkey merchant in london before the year    0 or thereabout and to other merchants such as dutch french hamburg and eastcountry merchants in proportion to shopkeepers of the first rank as linen and woollendrapers mercers wholesale grocers and other considerable dealers  0 l and afterward  00 l and so of other trades in their proportion also  but now such a strange change is there upon the face of things that it is very ordinary to give a thousand pound with an apprentice to a turkeymerchant  00 l to  00 l to other merchants from  00 to  00 to shopkeepers and wholesale dealers linnendrapers especially and so in proportion to other trades and the like with clerks to lawyers attorneys scriveners etc  as the premios given with such servants as these are thus strangely differing from what was formerly done so the usage of these kinds of servants in the families where they are taken differs also and so in proportion does their services they are employed in differ it may be alleged that upon their masters demanding such great sums of money with their apprentices they have reason to treat them as gentlemen and not as servants to let them see that they are rather brought into their countinghouses as pupils to a tutor and scholars or students to a college than as servants that their business is to be introduced handsomely and reputably into business sent abroad and received into the management of affairs and not indeed to be accounted or called servants or to be used as such and this may be granted but still it breaks into the great foundation the rule of subordination which i say is essential to all familyoeconomy and these youths should be called lodgers not apprentices or servants for as their coming in differs as above in a much greater proportion does their behavior and conduct differ the consequence of which in a great measure is that more of them are ruined debauched and come to nothing for want of subordination and being under government than was wont to be the case to the great calamity of their families especially of their parents of which abundince of lamentable examples might be given but neither is this the particular design of these letters which is more especially to give you a sketch of lowlife and describe to you the horrible degencracy of the meaner sort of servants and the mischiefs which this nation suffers upon that account  from these kinds of servants therefore i mean apprentices to merchants wholesalemen and the like i must descend to the apprentices of meaner tradesmen and yet not of the laboring trades neither that is to say the handicrafts artificers and the like they remain to be mentioned by themselves  it is but few years ago and in the memory of many now living that all the apprentices of the shopkeepers and warehousekeepers as well in london as in other places except the few mentioned before submitted to the most servile employments of the families in which they served such as the young gentry their successors in the the same station scorn so much as the name of now such as cleaning their masters shoes bringing water into the houses from the conduits in the street which they carried on their shoulders in long vessels called tankards also waiting at table waiting on their masters to the church and carrying their bibles prayerbooks etc and many more such things whereas now the apprentices of the very same class are so far from stooping to such things as these that it is very rarely that they will condescend to open or shut the shopwindows much less to sweep the shop or warehouses but their masters are obliged to keep porters or footmen to wait upon the apprentices and do all those things for them so far are they now from cleaning their masters shoes that the apprentices scorn to clean their own shoes but there are poor women generally attending at the shopdoors to do those things as well for the apprentices as for the masters and are paid for it so far are they from being subjected to their masters or to their family discipline that they think it hard to have any enquiry made after them when they go out and keep oftentimes later hours than their masters and as often are pleased to come home in drink which also their masters have scarce the authority to resent or question them about  this unsufferable liberty is not so much granted by the master as it is assumed by the apprentices and if at any times words happen between them it is very seldom but that the servant is as high as the master and scorning to give an account of his excursions takes it very ill to be examined and much worse to be restrained and though perhaps they may reply in language a little more decent than meaner fellows talk in yet they shall not fail to tell their masters they did not give such sums of money to be confined like prisoners or to be used like footboys and that if they the masters do not like their service as they would call it they are willing to be otherwise disposed of not forgetting to add that if the master consents to part with them they expect part of their money back again and the like intimating that the master will bear with their disorders rather than part with them and refund  the effect of this insolence for i can call it no less is that there are more of these servants called apprentices ruined by these liberties than one would think it was possible could be found in the whole city all manner of wickednesses are practiced by them and as they are generally but youths have their pockets unadvisedly supplied with moneys by their relations and thus assume time and liberty to spend it they indulge themselves in all sorts of liberties this has been so examplar on many occasions that never was so many masters robbed by their apprentices as now and i think i might give an account of    or    young clerks and apprentices that have been hanged here in london or near it within these few years besides innumerable others ruined by the many several ways of being undone of which this town affords them perhaps more than any other place in the world  the next head or class is that of the lower menial servants and here whatever is the occasion we find the wages of almost all sorts of servants doubled and of some trebbled as in the article before but for the behavior of these people their sauciness drunkenness and abusive language on the side of the menservants the gaiety fine clothes laces hoops etc of the maidservants nay even to patches and paint are hardly to be described it would be a satyr upon the ladies such as perhaps they would not bear the reading of should we go about to tell how hard it is sometimes to know the chambermaid from her mistress or my ladys chiefwoman from one of my ladys daughters nor can she bear to be called any thing less than mistress by the rest of the servants or is it altogether improper as i shall show in its place  from this gaiety of dress must necessarily follow increase of wages for where there is such an expense in habit there must be a proportioned supply of money or it will not do  the pocket thus furnished and the back thus clothed and the servant thus exalted how can it be expected she should not be above herself much more above her business and most of all which is to my purpose above reproof to be talked to is to hear how saucy she can be and as she is impatient of being told when she is in a fault so she is sure to be in as many such faults as ever servants can be supposed to have been  but as abundance of faults are protected by a saucy tongue and every master or mistress may not be quallified to scold with their footmen and chambermaids so they rather wink at the more venial mistakes of their servants than be troubled with their clamor  thus i have made my first letter a kind of index of my whole design and you will see how you must be prepared to read a black history of the degeneracy of english servants i shall illustrate it with some examples as they occur to my observations and are apposite to the cases where i relate them  in the mean time how happy are you in france in this particular though in many other you do not come up to the english as in the solid security of property and of religion etc but in this you outdo england indeed for your servants are indeed servants a french footman if he was to write to his master might well subscribe your humble servant even in the literal sense of it for your servants are humble and you keep them so they are taught a due subordination as their introduction and you hold them to it and i am sure france is in the right of it  but here there is no such thing as a good servant in the true sense of the word whither the monstrous evil may spread and what may be the effect if some laws are ot speedily made to regulate the office of a servant and to prescribe to them their bounds sorm them into classes and then oblige them to do the duty of a servant i say how far it may spread who can tell  but when i talk of laws to regulate this i talk of a thing the most difficult to be done of anything of that kind that i know in england i shall take up your time a little upon the subject hereafter  i am etc dear sir your brother and humble servant  letter ii dear sir being as by my last to give you some account of the conduct of lowlife in this country where it differs so much from all the rest of the world i proposed to begin it by way of preliminary that as i have already laid down heads of the grievance in general so i may now lead you a little to the fountain from whence it flows and the manifest degrees by which it is swelled to such a height as almost to overwhelm the national economy and embarrass our families in constant vexation and disorder  as i hinted in my last the miserable circumstance of this country is now such that in short if it goes on the poor will be rulers over the rich and the servants be governors of their masters the plebeij have almost mobbd the patricij and as the commons in another case may be said to be gotten above the lords so the cannaille of this nation impose laws upon their superiors and begin not only to be troublesome but in time may be dangerous in a word order is inverted subordination ceases and the world seems to stand with the bottom upward  how and by what steps things have been brought to this height and from whence all this disorder proceeds though it may be difficult to find out all the springs and causes which have assisted in it yet some part of it may be seen in the following particulars which are the preliminaries i mentioned in my last  i as the people here are universally blessed with real and valuable liberty more than any nation in the world so the common sort are withal so possessed with mistaken notions of that liberty in general and of their own legal liberties in particular that it runs them upon the most preposterous follies imaginable particularly abusing that liberty to indulge their wickedness suggesting that liberty is a freedom to crime not a security against oppression and injustice ii as the common people not exclusive of a great part of the nobility and gentry are miserably overwhelmed in a dreadful innundation of vice and immorality infinitely more than was the case in former days so the particular vices which are most concerned in the present complaint are those two above all the rest namely drunkeness and profane swearing to the account of these two i place the guilt of almost all the evils that i am now to speak of what additional helps may have been had from other and lesser excursions of the poor miserable people who i am going to describe i may speak to as i go on i will not say but that as all the little brooks and currents descending from the rising grounds adjacent to a river assist to swell the stream of that river into a flood so there may be many other smaller helps from hell to prompt the ruin of a nations peace but these two like the principal channels support the main current  it is from these that the passions are raised men put out of their own government and the general temper of the people as i said in my last changed and altered it is from hence that calm that sobriety that kindness and goodness of humor which formerly was the famed disposition of the people of england is changed and become violent and outrageous from these come contempt of government quarrellings and fighting with one another insulting masters employers and every degree of superiors and in a word innumerable other disorders to the breaking off all manner of discipline and regulation the abuse of themselves and the destroying the common peace and good neighborhood of the people one with another  if in describing this i come to let you see the several steps by which these things have encroachd upon the conduct of the meaner sort among as how and by what fatal degrees their manners were first depraved and to what extreme they are since hurried on i flatter myself it will be both diverting and informing and you will not think your time lost in reading my letters however tedious they may otherwise be  libertt is the glory of an englishman it is as natural to him to desire it as it is lawful to him to maintain it it is his inheritance purchased with the blood of his ancestors and as it is his portion so it is his pride but it is with an englishman about his liberty as it is with many of them about popery there is a kind of national aversion among them to popery it is the universal scarecrow the hobgoblin the spectre with which the nurses fright the children and entertain the old women all over the country by which means such horror posesses the minds of the common people about it that i believe there are an  00000 stout fellows who would spend the last drop of their blood against popery that do not know whether it be a man or a horse  in like manner liberty is a word of endearment it is the hereditary favorite of the people it is the nations mistress i was a going to say it was the nations whore in a word it is talked of by everybody valued by everybody and understood almost by nobody this english liberty is as blindly espoused as i said popery was blindly hated by those who mistake it in the grosest manner  this leads me to the conduct of our ignorant people in the claim they make to this thing called liberty and their scandalous management of it on many occasions  pray take me right as i go along that i am talking now chiefly of the common people though it is too true that even among the better sort there are too many whose notions of liberty are not only inconsistent with true liberty but destructive of it for nothing is more certain than that true liberty consists in a freedom to do well not giving a loose to the passions gratifying every vicious gust and taking off the restraint of laws leaving every man to do what is right in his own eyes  what the peoples notions of liberty are i shall best describe by giving you some historical examples of the behavior among the common people such as have come within the compass of my own observation  england is certainly in its constituted liberties the best nation for any subject in the world to live in where the laws which are their protection are likewise their inheritance but then for the contempt of those laws and abuse of liberty i must say that no nation i have been in comes up to them i will venture to give you a double example of this in one and the same story the case happened with in the verge of my own house and among my own neighbors as follows  you know there are very severe laws against profane swearing in this country and the legislature to do them justice have often repeated those laws and to add to their sanction have made additional clauses to oblige the magistrate to put those laws in execution and yet i believe common or customary swearing is no where in the world more frequent and that of a kind particular to the english nation or perhaps to the english tongue namely to imprecate damnation upon themselves a thing not only highly profane and wicked but absurdly so especially in that way they practice it here  several nations are addicted to the wicked custom of cursing besides england and especially when they are angry with or provoked at a person but then they will curse that person pretty freely and it is too much the practice in common discourse to curse one another but here when a man is angry with another he curses himself he does not say damn you sir but damn me sir which is one of the foolishest as well as wickedest ways of speaking that can be imagined  now this way of swearing and cursing is so frequent here among all sorts of people that i believe i do the english no wrong in saying no nation in europe are guilty of it to such a degree of madness and absurdity  nor is this the vice of the common people only but it is among the gentry the quality and which is still worse the magistrates so that nothing is more frequent than to hear those very men swear who the law obliges by virtue of their office to punish men for swearing in a word the law is not executed because those who have the executive power of the law in their hands are guilty of the very crime which they ought to punish and this i mention here because it brings on the story i refer to above which is a double example as well of the contempt of the law against swearing as of the false notion of liberty  i had a little affair one day with a gentleman here that is my neighbor which occasioned some words between us but the interposition of friends stopped it before it came to any height and we are since that very good friends again but i name it on this account my neighbors servant had let some horses break into my ground and i had frequently caused them to be only turned out again without any complaint other than speaking to the servant to prevent it for the future but i was surpised afterward to find that the servant was so far from endeavoring to prevent it that in the night he turned his masters horses in himself and a person i set to watch him took him in the fact  upon this i pounded the horses and went to my neighbor and complained but instead of finding him ready to do me justice i observed him very much concernd about it took it very ill that i should pound his cattle began to justify his servant and added that he was a very honest fellow i was surpised at that and when he said his man was very honest i told him i did not believe him to be an honest fellow  he lost his patience at this and with a heat no otherwise to be expressed than by repeating his mad words replied dam me sir what do you mean not believe me dam me what not believe me dam me sir i cannot take that what sir dam me do you give me the lie dam me sir what do you mean  upon these words thus awkwardly put together and so repeated he gets up walks up and down the room fretting and fumeing with twenty more dammes at last he ends it all with coming up to my teeth and letting fly at me with dam me sir explain yourself  i kept my self as cool as i could but was obliged to show that i was not frighted at him so with a kind of smile i said i should have explained myself with out his damming so often if he had given me room to crowd in a word among his curses  this provoked him more than i intended it should and he flew out at me then with the like number of dammes all over again or rather twice as many for my laughing dam me sir what do you laugh at me and dam me sir am i to be laughed at and the like  but to carry the tale no farther than is to the purpose that i am writing of i then told him the fact and that i had not said i did not believe him but that i did not believe his man was honest and that my reason was because i had caught him opening my gate with his own hands and driving the horses into my field and that i had brought the person who see him do it to witness against him  upon this my neighour was as calm and as civil as could be desired for awhile and begged my pardon for being warm before after which the two servants were called in and heard and my man testified as above his servant impudently denied it and my man as positively affirmed it but with this he flies out in the same rage at my man as he was in before at me and then it was dam me i will not believe a word you say you are a lying dog you see my man denies it my servant then offered to go before a justice and swear it then he flew out again you swear it you are a rascal g  dam me i will not believe your oath no more than your word and there he went storming and swearing and rageing about the house and calling my man a thousand dogs and villains and between every two or three words was the imprecation upon himself of g  d dam me  now had he said always dam you instead of dam me though it had been wicked in it self to call upon god to damn any body and very unchristian too to curse his neighbor yet it had had some show of sense in it it had not been both wicked and absurd too but that it now seems to be of use only to show the dominion that our passions have above our reason that they content themselves to talk the grosest nonsense so it does but give vent to the rage that posesses the mind at that time for they will frequently call upon god in their passion in the same kind of heat to damn their horses their dogs or any thing that offends them whether it has a life of sense or vegetative life or no life at all  in a word it is so much a custom now in england to rage and damn and curse in this manner that they not only do it without regard to reason and sense but which is still more wonderful they do it without thought without being in any passion or under any provocation nay they do it without anger and without any distaste without any evil in their design that is to say without thinking atall but as in mere jest and mirth  but to return to my neighbor as i told you some friends overhearing the quarrel made us friends again as to the matter in dispute and one of them a grave sober gentleman took the liberty in a mannerly and courteous manner to speak to him about his frequent swearing and cursing and how ill it was for him to do so who was a person of years of learning and breeding and the like he defended himself awhile by saying he thought no harm the usual defenses the english gentleman make for it and which generally is very true but when the other gentleman carried it a little further and pressed him to restrain himself in such unlawful excesses and he could not tell what to say more than he had said he seemed a little warm and answered sir i am an englishman and i love liberty pray let me alone i must have my liberty  i should have told you while this happened my servant to whom as i said he was very passionate was mightly affronted at being called such ill names and i heard him so very high among his fellow servants in the next room that i went out to see what was the matter my man told me in short that what i said to him at any time was nothing for i was his master but he hoped i would not expect he should take it from esquire  that he would not be called dog and rogue and rascal by never a gentleman in the country that he valued his reputation as much as esquire  at any time and that his livelihood depended upon it that if he was one that would swear any thing and was not fit to be believed upon his oath he was not fit for any gentlemans service and he could not blame any gentleman for refusing him if he had such a character and therefore he was resolved to do himself justice  i knew that really all the fellow said was true that he was very much injured and that he was indeed a very honest fellow in the main and a good servant as servants in england go now so i gave him good words and seeing he was heated and that he had just cause to be a little moved i endeavored to calm him but i found it would not do he insisted that he was resovd to do himself justice why you fool you says i what do you mean by doing your self justice you dont pretend to put yourself upon an equal foot with this gentleman and go and demand satisfaction of him do you no sir says he i know myself better than that too but is there no way that a poor servant may take to do himself justice when he is injured but presently to fight with his superiors i will do myself right without fighting says he i looked earnestly at him upon those words what way can you take says i why sir says he in the first place i will make him pay for swearing i hope the law will bear me out in that  i mused awhile and it presently occurred to me that if my man did make oath that he swore  00 times besides his cursing he would do him no wrong but yet that if he did so it would renew the quarrel between my neighbor and i for he would presently say it was all my doing so i did all that lay in my power to persuade my man to put it up and let him alone besides william says i you know he is a powerful man in this part of the county and if ever he meets you he will certainly run you thoro in the mean time his men will abuse you and insult you and you will have no fair play with them  but i found my man was too warm to be moved by all such persuasions as these nor was that all but he would stay for the gentlemans coming out to talk with him again this i took up and told him i would have no gentlman affronted by any servant of mine well sir says he very short then while i am your servant i will not say anything to him but then i hope you will dismiss me from your service this minute for i must do myself justice no sir says i angrily i shall not dismiss you just now neither why then sir says he i hope you will not take it amiss that i dismiss myself and from this minute i am your servant no longer and as i am a freeborn englishman and no slave i live in a free nation and must have my liberty o liberty said i to my self thou art a brave article to set servants above their masters if i had this fellow in france now or in germany or any where but in england i knew very well how to handle him but here i must submit to my servants  all this i say was only a reflection in my own thought but i recovered that confusion his sauciness had put me into and i answered him calmly well william you shall be dismissed so i begun to ask him what wages was due to him which was not above two months and i paid him and ordered another servant to take an account of some things that were in his custody and let him go but now william says i as you have dismissed yourself from my service so you must let me dismiss you out of doors too for i will not have you insult the gentleman in my house i saw this was some uneasiness to him but i would not stir from him till he had stripped my livery off put on his frock and went off  as he went away he began to triumph for he was now grown not saucy only but impudent and clapping his right hand to his left shoulder two or three times now i am my own man again says he now i am at liberty again sir and liberty is the birthright of an englishman well william says i to him for i overheard him but take care how you make use of it do not abuse your liberty your being an englishman and having a right to the liberty of an englishman does not make you equal to a gentleman take care how you behave you know there is a whipingpost in the parish william yes yes sir says he i know it and will take care i will indeed and here he repeated it two or three times in a scoffing saucy tone i will take care  i will sir but i will speak with esquire  for all that sir  look you william says i do not be illmannerd in my house if you do i will lay you by the heels myself i do say again you shall not speak to him in my house  this made him be a little civiler but yet it was not without some difficulty that i got him out of my house and the fellow was so heated with the usage he had and so drunk with his notion of being now at liberty that he was as much out of his senses as if he had been drunk indeed with liquor  however at last i got him out of my house and sent another servant after him to see whither he went for i had a mind to see what he intended to do it was not above half an hour before my other man came in and told me that william went directly to justice  s and offered to depose that the gentleman had sworn  00 oaths  the justice endeavored with all his might to prevent his swearing to it in regard to the gentleman that he swore against who was his friend and questioned him so many ways that he had almost puzzled the fellow and once or twice he was going away to see for another justice telling that justice that the law gave him liberty and he was an englishman and would have his liberty and as long as he was sure he swore nothing but the truth he would not be directed that he came there to swear to the truth and he would take the hazard of what followed  however the justice by good words and persuasions brought him down to threescore and he would come down no lower but appealed to me and desired the justice to ask me so the justice took his oath and dismissed him after this the justice seeing another of my servants there as above beckoned to him to stay and when the fellow was gone he bade him desire of me that i would call and see him in the evening  in the mean time the first gentleman staid in my house i had given him an account of all that had happened and much difficulty i had to keep him from going out to chastise this fellow as he called it himself however i did prevail with him for indeed as i knew the fellow would be saucy and that the gentleman was warm also and passionate i was afraid he should kill him and i was willing to prevent that kind of mischief  but i was delivered from my anxiety for a time by the following accident the gentleman had two servants that waited while their master was with me and they overheard the account my servant had given me of what william had done and they walked out into the street of their own accord for i can bear their master witness he knew nothing of it and finding william loitering about in the street one of them went up to him and asked him what was the matter and what he did there william answered very surlily that he waited there to speak with his master meaning esquire  my master says the servant what do you mean by that dont you know where my master lives cannot you come to his house what do you pretend to waylay him in the street if you have anything to say to my master come to morrow morning and i will engage my master will let you speak to him  william now began to be more in the wrong than he had been in the right before for i could not say but that at first william was in the right  but as the servant talked thus far very calmly and rationally to william so william talked hot and high told the fellow his master had abused him  william without a cause and that he was not a servant now but at liberty and he would not be abused by any gentleman whatever and he would speak with him ay that he would  very well says the servant jeeringly so you are now my masters equal are you and you intend to demand satisfaction of him do you pray where is your sword esquire william where is your sword liberty has made you a gentleman i find that and gentlemen never go without a sword  well mr servitor says william if i am not your masters fellow you are not my fellow neither till you have stripped off your livery as i have done your master has abused me and i took it from him but i will not take it from you  my master abused you sirrah my master abuses nobody says the servant  yes says william he has abused me and he shall know it too as soon as i can see him  you dog you says the servant do you threaten my master what do you wait here to assassinate him prithee john says he to his fellow go fetch a constable i will take care of esquire william since he will not stay till to morrow morning to speak with our master i will secure him for to night and he shall wait for him in the cage  away goes john for a constable but while he was gone william grew very insolent and giving the servant ill language and upon his master too they fell from one word to another and then to blows and though william was a stout fellow of his hands yet the other fellow was too hard for him and william was upon the point of yielding when the constable came and carried them both before the justice the same before whom william had been swearing  william was as high before the justice as he was before with the gentlemans servant and behaved not only warm but impudent he was a freeman he said and not a slave and if a gentleman had injured him he would be at liberty to tell him so  the justice persuaded him and told him he ought to be quiet till another time as the footman had persuaded him to be that to stay in the street and talk as he had done was threatening the gentleman and that he ought to be searched if he had no weapons about him  william offered himself to be searched and indeed he had no weapons nor did he intend to do any thing but to be saucy with his tongue which he might have paid dear enough for too as i observed but the justice took care of him for that night and the next morning made him bring sureties for the peace the servant making oath that he gave both his master and him too threatening language of his being revenged and the like  the rest of the story is short viz william was humbled for the liberty of his tongue but the gentleman was forced to pay for his threescure oaths and so for that time william had no great benefit of his being freeborn or an englishman  but william is not the only example of the prostituting this glorious thing called english liberty to the basest purpose i must tell you another story which happened in the compass of my own family too  i had a steward or as the english call them a baily who looked after a small concern which i have in the country and who i trusted with the whole management of it to such a degree that he had several workmen and servants employed by me under him and whose business was left to his care and inspection  this fellow i had a particular confidence in and a very good opinion of and very unwilling i was to hear any accusation against him and the more because several things that had been alleged against him when they came to be inquired into and examined were sound either so trivial as to be not worth notice or he so effectually cleared himself that nothing could be fastened upon him  but one of my servants who i employed in another business remote from that where this steward was employed came very seriously to me one morning with a sad complaint viz that his wife had been gone from him some time and that though he had with the utmost application searched her wicked haunts and had for some years suspected it and been assured of it from others that she kept company with my said steward yet he could never come at a certainty of it till now that now he was fully persuaded it was so and hoped i would do him so much justice as to put a check to it  i smiled at the weakness of his last request though i pitied the poor man in the former part of his disaster for says i you know it is out of my power if my man will be wicked i have no power to restrain him as if your wife will be a whore you see you cannot restrain her liberty you know in england says i is too often claimed for a freedom to do wickedly and what can i do for you  besides says i but what proof is there of the fact for what can i pretend to talk to him about when upon his denying the fact as to be sure he will i should produce no evidence my mouth said i will be stopped he owned he had no positive proof to produce but he gave me such particular discoveries that i was convinced it was really so as well as he so i told him i would talk with the stewart about it  accordingly one morning i took the liberty after other discourse of business was over to tell my steward what rumor was raised upon his conversation with such a mans wife and that they said he was so open and barefaced in it that he kept her at such a place and so told him other circumstances which began to put him hard to it however he denied it very stiffly look ye said i if it is so i am very sorry for it and i expect you will consider of it he answered after again denying it that he had always taken care of my business and hoped i would be satisfied with that and that i would not enter into other matters and listen to the false accusations of his enemies who were his enemies chiefly because he took care that they should not abuse and impose upon me and so in a word did as good as say that if he minded my business i had no right to meddle with him any further  i took him a little short there and told him that it was true that i had no power to examine him or to punish him if he was guilty but that if the thing was true it was really an insult upon me and my family the womans husband as he knew being a relation to me at some distance though he was my servant too and that as he was also entrusted and employed by me he might depend i should think it hard that one who received so many benefits from me should have so little respect for me as to debauch a woman who was married to one of my relations and should do it as it were under my nose  he replied though with respect that he hoped i would not think myself concerned in the clamor that as he did not own he was guilty of any such thing and nobody could prove it he desired i would not believe any thing of it till it was proved  i told him as to proof in law it was none of my business but that i doubted there was proof enough to make it reasonable to believe it and that it was not sufferable he told me in so many words that he thought it was hard to be examined so close about it that he took care to mind my business and could not be charged with omitting it as to other things he was an englishman and desired to have his liberty and so my man and i parted  this is the use or rather these are some of the uses they make of liberty in this part of the world i will trouble you with but one example more and dismiss this part in the late queens reign when the earl of gallaway commanded the british troops in spain sent thither as auxilliaries to king charles now emperor the army beginning to grow sickly it was said the soldiers got the flux by eating grapes and other green fruit  upon this the general published an order that the soldiers should not eat any grapes for a certain time upon pain of death and none of the suttlers or peasants were allowed to bring any grapes into the camp upon the like penalties  but as englishmen are not famed for being the most easy to be restrained in such cases so some of the english soldiers had got out of the camp and not being able to refrain the tempting fruit had gorged themselves with grapes and three of them fell sick of the flux upon which the general sent to have them brought before him but when the officers came to fetch them truly they were so near being dead though not dead that they were not in a condition to be stirred and i think two of them died that night however one of them being told the general had sent for them and being asked if he had eaten any grapes he boldly answered yes at which the officer asking how they durst presume to break the generals orders adding that if he recovered he would certainly be hanged the fellow answered as for hanging there was no need to hang them they were dead men already and as to the generals orders they had obeyed him in every thing relating to their business as soldiers but as to the rest they were englishmen and thought they ought to have their liberty and that they had a right to kill themselves whenever they pleased  it seems they all died and so prevented justice for the excuse was of no weight because the prince has a right to the service of his subjects and no man can kill himself without a crime against his sovereign as well as against heaven but it is apposite to my purpose namely the notion we have of liberty here and the abuse of that liberty  be pleased to observe now that when i speak of liberty being abused in england i keep my eye principally upon the morals of the nation upon the abuse of the laws made for the preservation of good manners among men and the encouragement given by the negligence of those who ought to punish the breakers of those laws  there are several sorts of liberty which are grossly abused here as well as this for example first religious liberty it is true i that abhor persecution for religion do not complain of this as if there ought not to be a liberty granted to conscientious christians to worship god in the manner which they believe to most agreeable to his will and most edifying to themselves but i cannot but think that liberty grossly abused when it is made use of to protect those who deny all revealed religion who instead of a liberty in religion claim a liberty to be of no religion atall  i observe the toleration of dissenters which is what they found their religious liberties upon is commonly called an act for liberty of conscience in my opinion that very title explains the meaning of the law that it is to give liberty to tender consciences to worship god etc as i say above this cannot import a liberty to hardened consciences to worship no god at all and to sear neither god or devil  there are great disputes about religion in this nation as well as in other places perhaps more here than anywhere else but the dispute i take notice of is not between this and that religion or this and that sect or opinion in religion but betwixt god and devil a man shall come into my company and blaspheme god deny his redeemer and make a mock of all religion and then tell me he is an englishman and claims liberty that there is a law to give liberty of conscience etc this is unsufferable and liberty of conscience has nothing to do in the case the man both by the laws of god and of all christian nations ought to be punished there is nothing of religion or conscience in the case  there is a parallel case in this very same constitution and government we have a particular liberty here and what we value ourselves very much upon and this is called the liberty of the press that is to say that every man is at liberty to print and publish what he pleases  but notwithstanding all this liberty of the press the government frequently take up both authors and printers if they printany thing offensive or against the administration or if they publish any personal reflections the person injured if these reflections are unjust and slanderous has a right to prosecute the publisher and author and will have his remedy at law  again the government claim to resent injurious reproaches sarcasms and satyrs upon any foreign prince or state in alliance with england and may oblige the authors and publishers to answer for all such indecencies for example one author and a frenchman too who wrote a public paper was taken up here for printing that the duke of luxemberg was humpshoulderd and yet you and i that have seen him so often at the head of the french armies know very well how eminent a truth it was  another in the reign of the late queen was sent for upon the complaint of the russian minister resident here for likening the czar of muscovy to a siberian bear and though he did not really call his czarish majesty siberian bear but only likend some of his actions to the behavior of that northern creature yet he was obliged to make his submission beg pardon and be very thankful for being discharged so cheap  yet all this consists with the liberty of the press which is as all liberty should be understood a liberty to do well but not a liberty to do evil  restraint from ill is freedom to the wise and good men wicked liberties despise i am dear sir your brother and humble servant  letter iii sir in my first letter i gave you some of my observations upon the wretched notions which the people here have entertained of that glorious thing called liberty and how that liberty which is the best of mankinds privileges is abused in the grossest sense and applied to the meanest and most scoundrel purposes i shall now bring it all down to the design i am upon and let you see how these false notions of liberty getting into the heads of the common people have intoxicated their brains and have in a word destroyed all subordination among us and joining with the invasion of our morals of which i am next to speak has set the world as i said with the bottom upward and have raised such a devil among our servants as will not easily be laid  i am therefore now to lay before you something of what i call the great innundation of vice that has thus tainted the nations morals and which in particular has debauched the common people  in order to this i desire you will take this whole letter as a parenthesis or degresion as it breaks in upon what went before and after which i shall go on in my next where i left off in my last so that you may at any time connect or join the observations without this part which is rather a history but which you will find so necesiary to the understanding of the whole that i believe you will not think it any interruption in your reading  at my very first coming into england having not yet engaged in settled business i liked both the place and the people so well that i resolved to make my stated residence here for my life in order to this i began to look upon the place as my native country and immediately applied to my friends to get myself naturalized that i might settle my fortunes here as providence should direct  to this purpose also i resolved for one of my first steps as i would advise all gentlemen to do whether natives or foreigners to make myself thoroughly accquainted with the whole history of the country and then with its antiquities so that i should be master both of its ancient state its present state and also its government and laws and of the customs and manners of the people the delightful study of this took me up something above a year in which time i read over and that very carefully all the best histories of the island in which are recorded the general introduction of laws rights sovereignty and civil government in the nation and account of the first inhabitants and with what gallantry and bravery they defended their liberty against the several invasions of the romans picts saxons danes normans and the wars and bloody battles which afterward happened between those contending nations for the maintaining the conquests they had made and keeping the possessions which they had marked out to themselves in this island  in reading these histories i came to understand how the people of this nation came to be possessed of such unusual privileges and liberties such as no nation enjoy but themselves and what original plea of right they have to make for them a plea which appears so just and excepting some intervals when their monarchs uneasy to be under the restraint of laws and be as it were governed by their people have made attempts to get out of those fetters and free the crown as they called it from popular bondage in which attempts too they have always miscarried i say excepting which their plea of right has been always so demonstrably just that their best kings have willingly yielded to them and thought it a sufficient glory to their family to be possessed of a monarchy so flourishing even with all its limitations  but as i observed there have been intervals of this peace and some of their princes as above impatient of restraint have broken the circle of government attempted to make themselves arbitrary assumed a despotick right and trampling on the laws and constitution of the kingdom have broken out into oppressions and ravages on the properties of their subjects in manifest violation of the laws which even those very princes had sworn to rule by but then on the contrary it should be observed also that these violations of right as i call them never failed to meet with opposition from the subjects the people on all those occasions being assisted by the nobility and gentry frequently had recourse to arms to vindicate their just rights and free themselves from tyranny and oppression and it is to be observed with some wonder almost upon all these occasions the kings had the worst as their claims were unjust their attempts were unsuccessful and some of them were compelled to undo what they had done and restore the people to their liberty as king stephen and king hen iii k john k hen iv and others and last of all k james ii others were entirely ruined deposed and lost both power and life as king edw ii richard ii etc  these were the rights and liberties of engglishmen of which so much has been said in the world and of which such strange constructions and such simple use is made in these days of which i shall say more as i go on and for this reason it is i take this notice of it here  as thus i made myself master of the history and ancient state of england i resolved in the next place to make myself master of its present state also and to this purpose i traveled in three or four several tours over the whole island critically observing and carefully informing myself of every thing worth observing in all the towns and countries through which i passed  i took with me an ancient gentleman of my acquaintance who i found was thoroughly acquainted with almost every part of england and who was to me as a walking library or a moveable map of the countries and towns through which we passed and we never failed to enquire of the most proper persons in every place where we came what was to be seen what rarities of nature antiquities ancient buildings were in the respective parts or in short every thing worth the observation of travelers  i have often complained that though the english historians especially in their relating facts have been very particular and distinct and the histories of the several wars in england are very well written yet that they are all very indifferent in their geography and that the reader is spoken to as supposing he knew before where everything spoken of was done and how every town or country mentioned was situated whereas i that was a perfect stranger to these things should have been greatly at a loss but to remedy this i had always the maps of every country before me at the same time that i read the history as also i had a book entitled britannia written by that very learned antiquary mr camden and some other books too which treat of the natural history as well as the antiquities of every county with these helps in my traveling together with my learned companion i was generally informed of every thing material wherever i came whereas without these i might have gone through many places where valuable antiquities and other curiosities of nature or art were to be seen and have known nothing of them and he that travels england without such helps may in many cases almost as well stay at home  but to come to that which is more particular to my present purpose and which is the reason of giving you this account of my travels by this means i became particularly acquainted with the common people as well as with the country in every place where i came i observed their language that is the several dialects of it for they strangely disfer in their way of expressing themselves though in the same tongue and there is as much difference between the english tongue as spoken in the north of england and the same torgue as spoken in the west as between the french spoken in normandy and that of gascogne and poictou i say i became accquainted with their language customs manners tempers and above all with their morals which is the thing i shall have most occasion to speak of in these letters i shall trouble you now with no more relating to my travels i may in time satisfy the other part of your late request and give you a full account of the country which indeed is well worth a travellers pains to see and a readers trouble to look over but i have not now time to revise my journals and the minutes which i took of things every where as i passed which are very critical i assure you and fruitful of a very diverting as well as instructing variety that part i must refer to another occasion  my friend who went with me was very curious also and the more because i requested it of him in making enquiries into and observations upon the customs and manners of the people which as i mentioned above are the principal things which i am now speaking of  i observe several of the authors i have just now mentioned have written largely of the ancient families of the nobility and gentry of great britain their originals names arms and sometimes the history of particular men among them who have made themselves famous in the world of which the gentry of england have produced many  but i meet with very few that take notice of the common people how they live what their general employment is and what the particular employment of them is in the several counties respectively and yet i found this an enquiry very full of useful observations and attended with innumerable incidents which gave light into things of the greatest moment as well in history as antiquity and which seemed to add a part in the knowledge of the country which a traveller could not be without  to come to the point it is necessary to observe to you as the groundwork of my whole design that the common people of this country have suffered a kind of general revolution or change in their disposition temper and manners within a certain term of years  which i shall mark out to you in its place also i say they have suffered a general change such as i believe no nation has undergone but themselves i wish i could say it was a change for the better but be that as it will i shall endeavor to give you an impartial account of it as it is  it is in the next place needful to observe to you that i took this journey at the unhappy time when this change or revolution in the manners and temper of the common people was in the height of its operation namely in the years      to      for i was near four year before i finished my travels  i that was then a stranger to the people though not altogether to the place was not fully accquainted with their just character in times past but my companion upon whose judgment i very much depended and who being an observing as well as an ancient man had been conversant among them for threescore years before supplied me in that part in a manner which no books or maps could do for this part is as i have said scarce meddld with in history  he told me that he first was acquainted among the common people by his fathers being a very great clothier in the westcountry in consequence of which business he employed many hundreds i think he said thousands of the laboring poor that he acted under his father for some years but then went into the north and northeast parts of england as first into the west riding of yorkshire bordering on lancashire and after that into lincolnshire and norfolk and that his business was chiefly buying of lincolnshire and leicestershire wool which by the way is the best and fittest for manufacturing in england and by this trading moving kind of life added he i came to converse among the poorer sort of people farmers and manufacturers of every kind from lancashire and westmoreland in the north down to lincolnshire and leicestershire and thence into norfolk suffolk and essex and especially among the servants of all these countries such as husbandmen daylabourers and workmen also servants in gentlemens and tradesmens and farmers families and the like  i listened very carefully to his discourse because this was the part that i more particularly intended to inquire into and often desired him to tell me what that kind of people they were in his time for what they were then and how they behaved then we both knew very well  he told me that about the year      to    when he began to be conversant in the world on his own account the common people were plain fairdealing sober openhearted courteous humble that generally speaking they were very honest in their dealing and in many places religious and conscientious in their conversation that the servants were modest humble mannerly and very subservient to those who entertained and employed them that the apprentices either to tradesmen or handicrafts were quiet dilligent submitted cheerfully to familybusiness orders and hours were laborious and worked hard for their masters benefit having their eyes at the time when by the expiration of their terms they should have the benefit of their industry and of the labor of other servants for themselves nay said he even in london the servants and apprentices to shopkeepers warehousekeepers and to the best merchants thought it not below them to stoop to the meanest needful things in their business such as assisting package of goods clearing setting to rights and sweeping their warehouses countinghouses and shops loading carts opening and shutting doors and windows etc of which hereafter  the wages of the poor said he were not more then though their labor was greater but just the contrary the wages of hired servants were then from  0 s per annum to  0 s for a maidservant   d to   d and  0 d a day to a laboring or husbandman farther in the northwest country not so much the farmers hired their yearly menservants who they took into the house for  0 s and their diet the gentlemen had their servingmen or footmen to whom they also gave their diet for  0 s to  0 s a year and as to nobleman and persons of quality they had their footmen as we now call them of the sons of their tennants who thought it their honor to be taken into the service and family of the lord of the manor and had a badge of that honor viz a livery given them of russetcloth with a badge or mark of his lordships arms and at christmas a rosenoble in silver to bless their pockets nor was there any need for such as those to have more wages for their lord generally preferred them after certain terms of service to be tennants of small farms or made them cottages and put them into a way to get their bread by honest labor and diligence in husbandry which was the utmost of their ambition    i looked earnestly at him while he talked thus and after he had done pray then said i when and from what causes and beginings came that strange alteration of things which we see now for the country people as well as the tradespeople in towns and cities are quite another sort of folks at this time than what you speak of and as for the servants they move in another kind of circle and do not understand the language you talk of  o says he it is a dismal and melancholy thing to tell you how this alteration has happened and you that are a stranger will neither have patience to hear it or be able to give credit to it when you do  i assured him i would convince him of the contrary for says i you see i am so desirous to know these things that i can never be dissatisfied with the relation however long and as for giving credit i told him i knew him too well not to depend entirely upon the truth of whatever he related to me as truth and of his own knowledge for that i was assured he would not mislead me in any thing  he then went on with his discourse and beginning at the history of the late three reigns first he told me that after the death of queen elizabeth when king james the first came to the crown things immediately began to take a new turn he told me that during the whole reign of that prince they had in england a most dissolute court where the nobility and gentry and courtiers after the example of the king himself delighted in masks interludes bacchanalian feasts riots and all manner of luxury not says he to mention the more wicked parts of it  that after king jawes death his son though a prince of great personal temperance and modesty yet vice and immorality having gained a footing among the courtiers the king could do little to abate the riot of it being at the same time perplexed with the constant difficulties of his affairs so that the flux of riot and luxury which began in his fathers reign received no other check in king charles the firsts time than what a good example in the king might give to it and that was not sufficient while the courtiers gave themselves a liberty to go on as they had begun  but that which followed said he was still worse and finished the ruin of the morals of our people especially of the gentry throughout the nation and more especially of those who took part with the king in the troubles which followed for the king said he being obliged by the fate of the day to raise an army against his tumultuous subjects and that army being composed not of listed troops as now in which case the law of subordination being rigorously and solemnly observed the officers are as subject one to another as the meanest soldiers but the kings army being raised by the generous contribution of the loyal gentry the officers were all gentlemen and volentiers that served upon principles of love and loyalty to their prince and not for pay and the king not having always money to pay them if they had asked it could not at the same time tie them up to laws of war and rules of discipline as is now the case nor could he always show his resentment much less punish them when they committed even the most detestable crimes for that so many would interest themselves to intercede that if the king should deny a pardon they would pretend to be disobliged talk of being illtreated their services disregarded and the like and the next word was quitting the army so that the king was obliged to wink at all the extravagancies plunderings rapes nay and even murders too not being in a condition to do that justice which the law and a free administration called for  if the king was thus disabld from punnishing capital crimes says the old gentleman less could he dip into lesser mistakes such in particular as the common excesses and extravagancies of his officers the oaths and execrations to this day so common among the soldiers and the drunkenness the debaucheries and violences attending them and spreading among the soldiers by the example of their officers but he the king was obliged to satisfy himself with verbil reproof entreaties and such ways as might show his dislike of the thing without resentment at the person and if he had not done thus he would have had but few soldiers to fight for him  it was here said my friend that this dreadful unnatural imprecation of calling on god to damn them first broke out here it was first invented and first made use of on the other hand as for the parliaments army said he whether it was really religion or a religious policy be that to themselves yet as they carried on a pretense of religion in their cause so they maintained the face of religion and more than common sanctity in their armies and as they wanted no money to pay all their troops both officers and soldiers so they had them all at command and were under no obligation to a relax discipline and by this they gained insensibly on the country to make this difference more sensible to me he told me a story of the master of scoleinn in norfolk the man whether merely keeping good hours in his family or that he had some extraordinary business that required his rising early the next morning he could not remember but the man i say was gone to bed one night something sooner than usual and locking up his gates and as was his custom taking the keys up with him into his chamber he was but newly in bed when he was raised with a noise of rapping and thundering at the gate a servant maid that was up about her kitchinaffairs goes to the gate and asks who was there they bid g  d d  n her why did she not open the gate one cried shoot her and another damn her cut her throat and the like but the wench finding they were soldiers prayed them to be quiet she would go up to her master for the keys and let them in presently so she runs up to the masters chamber door and calls to him the man just fallen into his first sleep did not wake presently and the wench was almost as impatient at the chamber door as the troopers were without who began to knock and lay on at the gate again at last the man waking and hearing what was the matter starts out of bed and began to put on his clothes soldiers says he troopers who are they for for says the wench you need not ask who they are for they are for the king to be sure hark how they swear  here my friend stopped as if he had done well but sir said i what is this to the strange turn given to the poor common people and laboring poor the servants and the like who you say were so plain so openhearted so quiet so modest and so lowprizd since you can remember whence came the change upon them  well says he i am coming to that i shall account for it as plainly as for the other after the war was over and the royalfamily was restored things took a new turn again the outside of religion which the parliaments people had maintained be it that it was from right or wrong principles had had this good effect namely that it kept the world sober but upon the return of monarchy at the restoration the court was all mirth and gayety again and the whole nation rejoiced with them their joy was without question just no body disputed that part but unhappy for england they could find no way to express an exceeding joy but by an excess of crime and particularly that most brutish of all crimes drunkenness which overspread the nation like a winterflood and a torrent of oaths and profaneness followed of course  he then descended to particulars the families of the nobility and gentry said he were all universally touched with these wicked doings in particular said he drinking healths began here a thing till then not known in england the kings health the health of all the royalfamily one after another six glasies in a hand he that had the victory at the glass was the best subject drunkenness grew a test of loyalty and nothing that was sober could keep company without being affronted  and yet had this been all one could hardly expect less from a nation overwhelmed with joy at the return of the royalfamily and the restoring the fortunes and circumstances of so many ruined families and exiled cavaliers but not content with this the custom of imposing healths upon everybody that came into company followed it so that nobody could visit his friend without being made drunk  nor was it enough to drink the kings health with the healths of all the royalfamily and of general monk and of the royaloak and every simple mad thing they could think of but then in spite of the act of oblivion and the kings exhorting the people in his speeches to parliament to forget all former things words of distinction and marks and names of reproach they must then drink confusion to the rump damnation to oliver cromwell and all his race confusion to the phanaticks and a thousand such extravagant things all which had this additional evil in the practice namely that they served to pour wine down the throats of the whole company and make drunkenness overspread society in general  neither was this only practiced at the beginning of the restoration but it held on even to the death of king charles the   d at the latterend of whose reign as if it had slackd before and that they were afraid the nation should grow sober again the tide of drunkenness which had but seemed to ebb a little came on again with a surprising reflux especially upon the divisions at the latterend of the popish plot between whig and tory and particularly upon the subject of the bill of exclusion  till then drunkenness had not so universally spread itself among the common people the gentlemen contented themselves with being drunk and making one another so but upon that occasion it became a politic interest to make servants tennants tradesmen and everybody poor as well as rich drink to excess drinking the duke of yorks health became a new test of society and of loyalty drinking to the succession in the rightline confusion to the presbyterians to all those that were for the bill of exclusion and the like  now came on frequent dissolutions and elections of parliament and in consequence of that the bribery and corruption the treating for elections and all those treatings attended with excessive drinking increased to such a degree that in a few years the habit of drunkenness and the drinking of healths as above spread by the example of the gentlemen to the tennants to the common people in the corporations to the servants and in short to the whole body of the people  and though it was true that there remained a great many sober good religious people in the nation and it is to be hoped there does so still yet here began the ruin of the nations morals here the poor got a smatch of drunkenness and withal a dreadful habit of swearing raging and damning one another in their drink as well as the rich and with them it continues and increases every day  an instance of this adds my relater is evident in the number of alehouses and publickhouses erected in the first five years after the restoration of which says he this is the short detail     0 licenses for new alehouses where there were none before were granted in a very little space      winelicenses for taverns      maypoles set up for dancing        barrels of ale brewed in that space more than was in the five foregoing years        barrels of beer    here my friend closed his historical account as he called it of the growth of debauchery in england and the revolution which the temper and disposition of the people of england suffered in those days he only added these words at the end of it i will not says he answer for the exactness of the account above as to the increase of victuallinghouses maypoles and brewing though i have great reason to believe they are rather within compass than beyond it but this i think is certain that by those means the morals of the nation were ruined let me only add a few of my remarks to this discourse experience shows that it appears much easier to conquer and give a check to this vice thus broken in among the gentlemen than it is to check it among the common people  at the late revolution upon the coming of the prince of orange that scandalous custom of imposing upon people and obliging people to drink whether they would or no received a check with their lost liberties the nation recovered the liberty of drinking that is to say of drinking as they pleased and on a sudden from a mode or fashion of putting the cup to your neighbors nose it became the mode to give every man leave to drink as he pleased according to the old rule at ahasueruss feast and this was a great point gained too  but alas it was too late the distemper was too far gone if the gentlemen would not make the servants drunk the servants would make one another so the tennants now began to drink as fast as the landlords the husbandman as fast as the employer and as every man in drinking among the gentry had the liberty to drink as little as he would so every man among the common people claimed the liberty of drinking as much as he would at the same time knowing not how to set bounds to their drinkinggust  wonder not that i call the drunken vice the worst of all brutallity it appears by its consequences in this nation to be the mother sin the parent or producing cause of all vice the sins of whoreing gameing thieving murder rapin couzening and cheating and particularly that of swearing have been its natural progeny and have all entered at this one door drunkenness has been the great ancestor of them all  that swearing whoreing and murder are the natural consequences of drunkenness you will grant me i believe at first word neither is there any need to debate the point here experience proves it but suffer me i beseech you to look a little into it  i the custom of profane swearing is so increased among the poor people servants laborers etc that it is troublesome to sober people to go along the street they hear the mouths of the common laboring poor so continually overflowing with gall i remember being in the northern parts of england beyond newcastle upon tyne i met an english gentleman who was just that very day come out of scotland and it was so grievous to him that he could not forbear complaning of it to me his expression was this if i was says he to be brought out of scotland into england blindfold i would tell at the first town i set my foot in on this side the border that i was on english ground by hearing the name of god profaned by the very young children in the street the grown people swearing and cursing in all their ordinary discourse whereas for the honor of scotland says he i must speak it you hear nothing or but very little of it there everybody knows that this horrid custom is the ordinary companion of drunkenness swearing and cursing are the brats of the bottle that way and that way only they came in and though the gentlemen have a little abated the dreadful excess as if their footmen and servants having learnt to outswear them it was become a little too vulgar for them yet this i may venture to say now that the footmen and servants will not so easily follow their masters example in abating it as they did follow their example in learning it  besides as if the devil having got hold of the nation in this manner was resolved not to part with them if the gentlemen have left it off the ladies have taken it up and a certain duchess is said to be famous for this namely that she will out swear any of her footmen or chairmen    murder in this i may appeal to the experience of those that lived toward the beginning of the last century that there was nothing known or heardof like what we see now i mean men fighting wounding and killing one another in the streets and in taverns and coming out of taverns and where one accident of this kind happened then it may safely be said that five hundred such have happened since how often do we see men come raving out of the taverns as void of sense as a man out of bedlam and swear they will kill the next man they meet and how many gentlemen of good families and fortunes have i seen since i have been in england sent by the law on that account to make a trip to st tyburn the greve of this city as the greve at paris is the tyburn of that city that is to say hanged for drunken murders besides the numbers who by favor and intrest have obtained the princes pardons and reprieves  again how many selfmurthers of this kind too have we daily in our weekly and yearly bills of mortallity thus killed himself by excessive drinking the yearly bills give us an account of no less than one hundred and six and twenty in the last five years besides such as perish by that enemy who are spared in the said bills because they should not be known which are perhaps twenty times that number  it is another evidence of the truth of my observation on this head that the government have found themselves obliged to make so many new laws for the more effectual preventing drunkenness and debauchery   obliging victuallers and vintners not to keep unseasonable hours not to draw drink of a sabbath day etc crimes scarce heard of in former days and which there was no occasion to provide against before   to oblige every man that is fuddled or as we call it in drink to pay five shillings to the poor or to be set an hour in the stocks and the like  indeed it has been some obstruction to the execution of these laws that the magistrates are so often overtaken themselves that they cannot find in their hearts to punish others for what they themselves deserve punishment for more than most poor men can do  as to the vice of whoring and the near relation that has to this of drunkenness i need take up none of your time upon that subject only to remark what an infinite number of debauches of this kind happen every day among us more than ever were before  it occurs to me here to tell you a short story upon this head of a certain colonel of the army a particular accquaintance of mine who had an intriegue with a young lady and could by no means compass his design her virtue proving stanch against all his attacks only that she had so much respect for him that she would have consented to marry him but that did not suit it seems with his convenience or at least with his design  however he found means one time to get this lady into his company and to get a little wine into her head more than she could manage and when her head was light her heels proved so to and he had his will of her when she came to herself and was made sensible of her wickedness finding herself inbed with him that there was no room left for regret she put it off with a jest and said well since she had let him come when she was drunk he might even as well come when she was sober for it was all one now  after this she solicited him with all her skill to marry her as he had offered to do before but soon found she could not master him that way but at length she resolved to try if she could not take him at the same advantage that he had taken her at before she laid many snares of this kind for him but was always disappointed after some time finding him one evening come into her chamber half drunk she took the hint and got him to accept of a bottle from her as she called it and she sat and drank the bottle out with him and then another or two till being very drunk he wanted to come to bed to her but she pretended to refuse him because he would not marry her he answered he would marry her and called for a parson tho not knowing well what he said or did she who had got a minister ready for the purpose having expected what happened takes him at his word brings in the parson and made him repeat the words of matrimony and had good witnesses of it and then she went to bed with him  in the morning going to rise he called her by name no no colonel  says she not mrs mary  now but mary  colonel  s wife what mean you by that said he even just so sir says she and told him the whole fact as you served me before i hope you cannot be angry well says the colonel if i have dont when i was drunk i must stand to it when i am sober but you have bit me in my own play my dear says he and made my lord rochesters verses good upon me a womans never so ruined but she can revenge herself on her undoer man   if i was to give you the detail of the adventures i have met with of this kind i might entertain you with letters for a great while on no other subject it is true in the story above the man was the agressor and deserved it and the woman was not intentionally a whore but on the other hand how many young gentlemen heirs to good families and estates have been drawn in by the mere engine of the bottle to debauch themselves with scandalous and even distempered whores to the ruin of body soul and fortune and how many which is still worse have wheedled them in to marry them when they have done if i should say that this consequence of drunkenness is more frequent in this nation than ever i could observe it to be in france or even in germany itself i believe i should say truth  but still this is among the gentry and does not reach down to the lower rank of people of whom i am principally to speak but is not the consequence of excess in drink visible in all the lower sorts of men as well as the other how are the very morals and honesty of the laboring people so ruined that now as i noted in my last you cannot with safety hire a workman by the day to almost any kind of business unless your eye be upon him not only part but even all the time of his work if you do you are sure to have your work either spoiled or neglected or done contrary to your order  the laboring people have their eyes now not at your work but at their own wages and if they can but secure the last their business is to cheat you in the first as much as possible but especially as to time formerly honest men were to be found who whether you were with them or from them would be fairly at their business and made conscience of doing their days work for their days wages  but now the case is quite altered i shall give you an example of this before i come to speak more particularly to it i have for some years been concerned in a large public building in the country where we kept a great many other servants as also horses and carts constantly employed among the rest we kept an old servant whose name was wright in constant work though paid by the week he was a wheelwright by trade and a carpenter also and his business was to keep the carts and barrows and workingtools and workhouses in repair and the like it happened one morning that a cart being brokendown upon the road at some distance from the house this old man was fetched to repair it where it lay while he was busy at his work comes by a countryman that knew him and at some distance salutes him with the usual compliment good morrow father wright god speed your labor the old fellow looks up at him for he did not see him at first and with a kind of pleasant surlyness answered i dont care whether he does or no it is daywork  i need make no comment upon this worthy speech it explains itself i shall have occasion to mention old father wright again in a more particular affair of this kind but i am now more properly speaking of the effect of drunkenness upon the morals of the laboring poor and that leads me to observe how they are not only become careless and negligent of their business when employed by others but entirely negligent of themselves and of their families notwithstanding they are able by their ordinary labor to support them very comfortably i had in the same buildingworks which i mentioned above a workman who during the whole summerseason for the work which is about seven or eight months as weather happens could ordinarily earn eighteen shillings a week sometimes  0 to    s per week this fellow worked very hard too indeed and yet he would hardly save clothes to cover his nakedness and his wife and four children were kept by the parish  but even this does not fully reach the case i am upon it would take up more letters than i should be able to write you for seven year if i should give you a particular of the dismal effects of drunkenness upon the people of this sober nation i call them so because so they were but a few years before and even since some that are now alive can remember  but i must shorten the discourse now my present design being chiefly of another kind viz to let you see what the general behavior of workmen and hired laborers of both sexes is how they manage themselves or to speak more properly how they manage their masters for things are come to that pass now that though masters have the name of government indeed the servants really govern throughout this nation and especially that part of them who we hire for daily labor who if but one crooked word be spoken to them will turn their backs upon you and upon your business and be gone in spite of contracts and bargains and in spite of any damages you may suffer by it as i shall show you more particularly in my next also of all the other kinds of servants among us for they are the same in their degree such as coachmen footmen cooks maidservants and menservants apprentices and the like how they behave how their conduct is altered of late how terrible a greivance their insolence is in the families where they are what masters frequently suffer by their negligence and abuses and how hard it is to find methods for the regulation of this evil it is i confess very difficult but i shall venture at it a little and if possible by searching into the bottom of these things we may find out some remedy that the nation may be delivered from one of the heaviest burdens that ever loaded it and the most difficult to deal with  i shall conclude with observing to you that i am very just in laying the weight of all this upon that flood of wine and strongdrink which this nation seems to be drowned in for so many years past because it is evident that drinking is still the ordinary introduction of all the particular disorders which these people commit it is ordinary to say such an one is a very civil fellow and a very good workman or such a one is a very good servant but he will he drunk now and then and when he is so he is mad and does not care what he does and the general excuse for a saucy insolent servant is why he was in drink and did not know what he said you must excuse it he will be very sorry for it and beg your pardon for it when he is sober now it may be all this shall be very true and the fellow shall come the very next day and beg pardon as was said of him and shall the very next time he gets a little more drink in his head be the same man again and as saucy and insolent as before and beg pardon again and be drunk again and so on in a kind of rotation to the end of the chapter  it is remarkable also that when such a fellow comes to beg pardon he shall have the impudence to say to you that he was in drink and that therefore he hopes you will pass it by whereas his being drunk is not an aggravation only but an addition of crime and so far from a reason why he should be pardoned that it is the best reason that can be given why he should not  another case is that this drunkenness is certainly the parent of oaths and as our common people are addicted to swearing in such an execrable manner as that no nation in the world is like them so it is most commonly when they are in drink at least drunkenness has been the grand introduction to it nay many that will never swear when they are sober will swear in the most outrageous manner when they are in drink and be guilty of the most gross and abominable actions in their liquor things which they themselves would abhor when they were themselves  there is an unhappy kind of swearing which custom has brought upon this nation which is not the effect of drunkenness of which i shall give you the trouble of a letter by iself and this is the multiplication of oaths appointed by authority of which this kingdom has more than ever i met with in any nation whatever but of that hereafter  this way of swearing was in its beginning a high compliment upon the general integrity and gave a great character of the principles of the people arguing that they were so conscientiously regardful of their oaths that what they once swore it might be depended on they would carefully and religiously observe  but time and the frequency of taking these oaths has made kissing the gospels so familiar with them that such oaths have lost much of their solemnity and are consequently brought to be of less importance and to have less influence on the minds of those who take them than it was at first believed they would have and then indeed they ought to have  if drunkenness and in consequence of it this vile habit of swearing have thus possessed the generality of the poor people here as i have observed what then can we expect from them as to their morals or manners you are not indeed to expect much from their morals but far less from their manners  what decency of expression what modesty in behavior can that man show when he is gorged with drink when his head runs round like the sails of a wind mill as the vapor blows when he knows nothing what he does or what he is to do when he can neither think or act  they have a very good old song here on the subject of drinking which has in it one couple of lines that is much to my purpose viz and the man that is drunk is as great as a king   it is literally true here an englishman when drink is in his head is a king an emperor monarch of himself and knows nobody and values nobody if he be the meanest of your servants is your master for that time he knows nothing about you or about your business but will roar and sing even in your face and tell you he is above all masters and values nobody  to talk to him while he is in that condiction is to talk gospel to a kettle drum you get nothing but saucy language or something worse the best way is to get some of the other servants to have him tobed and when he has slept and is a little sober he will be pretty well again but then you have this trouble upon your hands again viz that if you do not set some honest staid sober fellow to take care of him the next morning if he gets but one mug of beer in his hand he is gone his head is not thoroughly cool and he is a madman or a sober man for another day just as the company he falls into first happens to be loose drinking fellows or sober and grave and sometimes he goes on for the whole week as this is the case with them in their drink it begins to be a kind of a necessary custom though it be owing chiefly to the custom of drinking namely that no notice is to be taken no not by the master himself of what a servant either says or does when he is in drink  i shall lead you into these particulars more to your satisfaction by giving you some short histories of cases which come up to the perfection of these things and which i hope will be both diverting and instructing mean time i conclude for the present and am  dear sir your most humble servant and affectionate brother  letter iv dear sir i am now to lay down some things for your farther admiration in the particular behavior of the english poor and give me leave previous to what i have farther to say upon this head to add that   this is all in spite of double pay at the same time that their services are least and their behavior worst their wages are best their pay largest and they have the greatest obligation laid upon them to be diligent  this one would think should either prevent their illbehaviour or be a means to reclaim them when they had broken in upon their manners but on the contrary it is a general observation at least in the compass of my particular knowledge and i scarce ever knew it fail namely that i never knew a servant or a workman in england one farthing the better for the increase of his wages on the contrary if you advance a servants wages it is so natural for him to think he deserves it or that else you would not do it that instead of mending him it always makes him worse  it is a kind of a proverbial speech among our people when they see a dull heavy fellow go slowly on in his business to say to him come mend your pace and i will mend your pay but really the mans return ought to be do you but mend my pay first and you shall hang me if i mend my pace    servants and workmen in england seem to act in the case of their masters bounty as an old cunning carthorse does with the driver and his whip when the driver smacks his whip the carthorse shakes his bells the driver makes the horse believe he will strike and the carthorse makes the driver believe he will go but the carter does not lash nor does the horse mend his pull so that the horse cheats the driver for his favor in which by the way he lets us see that gratitude is not a natural principle among horses  the behavior of the laboring poor in england is something akin to this and we find that gratitude is not a natural principle among the common people at least if it is they are pleased to sin against it in a most unnatural manner in a word their morals being touched as before that part of their virtue which i call gratitude and which is the brightest part of an honest man is in a manner quite sunk among them but i shall have occasion to compliment them upon their gratitude hereafter  i return now to the most fatal cause of all this mischief i mean the advance of wages for this indeed is the support of all the insolence of servants as their ruined manners is the spring of it here indeed they verify what was by a late author made part of their character the laboring poor in spite of double pay are saucy mutinous and beggarly   but to return to the wages and here i am to observe   that though advancing the wages of servants has not been a public thing done by the government or legislature in the nature of a law   nor has it been done by a common consent as some public things have been done obtaining thereby the ordinary sanction of a law   nor has it after such a kind of common consent been approved or confirmed by any authority as a thing which ought to be no nor lastly   has it been so much as encouraged by the magistrates or government on the contrary it is the common received opinion that it ought not to be so and that it spoils servants in the main and yet guided by we know not what fate everybody comes into it the servants encroach and demand high wages and the people generally comply with it and so the evil is grown insensibly upon us till it is become a received custom and is what it may be said ever body does and therefore every servant looks for and whereas in common charity one would expect that this should influence the generality of servants for the better and help to reclaim them on the contrary it is indeed the ruin of them all   nor is this advance of servants wages any wealth to them but as above their morals being destroyed this overplus is generally laid out either in luxury or vanity that is to say in strongdrink by the menservants and in gay things by the womenservants and take all that little frugallity which is to be found among them and set it against the horrible increase of pride and debauchery that is drink for i must be allowed to call drunkenness debauchery i say take all that little frugallity that is left i believe it will be granted   that the poor are poorer than when labor was cheaper   servants lay up less take them one with another than they did when they were hired at half the wages   so that upon the whole neither the labourer withoutdoors or the menial servant withindoors are one jott the better in their behavior or the richer in their pockets for all the advance of pay which they receive which yet in the whole kingdom amounts to an immense sum by the year  to begin with the laboring poor they are indeed the grievance of the nation and there seems an absolute necessity to bring them by severe regulations to some state of immediate subordination their case is briefly summed up in two heads   under a stop of trade and a general want of work then they are clamorous and mutinous run from their families load the parishes with their wives and children who they leave perishing and starving and themselves grow ripe for all manner of mischief whether public insurrection or private plunder and robbery and seeing they have not work enough they will not work at all and that brings them to wander starve beg steal and be hanged   in a glut of trade they grow saucy lazy idle and debauched when they may have work and may get money enough to live well and lay up for a time of less business then instead of diligence and goodhusbandry which might be expected from honest men on the contrary they will work but two or three days in the week or till they get money enough to keep them the rest of the week and all the other part of their time they lie in the alehouse to spend it   the present juncture of time while i am writing this letter furnishes me with flagrant examples of this kind there is now and has been for near two year past a prodigious run of trade for all sorts of the woollenmanufactures of which england makes so much  this demand for goods makes a propotiond increase of work and an increase of work of course produces an increase of wages this the poor in france would rejoice at and any people indeed that were in their senses would take it for a blessing from heaven and it would prompt their diligence and make them work the harder that they might take the honest advantage of it and as we say make hay while the sun shines  that the increase of trade and wages is real and the fact true you may take it thus in a few words viz the rate for spinning weaving and all other manufacturingwork i mean in wool is so risen that the poor all over england can now earn or gain near twice as much in a day and in some places more than twice as much as they could get for the same work two or three years ago particularly in essex suffolk and norfolk eastward and in wiltshire somerset and devon west the poor women now get    d to    d a day for spinning the men more in proportion and are full of work whereas before they could not get half so much and very often not find employment neither  and what now is the consequence of this not diligence not thankfulness i assure you less is it enriching the poor or furnishing themselves with conveniences clothes and necessaries least of all is it attended with a provident layingup for a time of scarcity when work may be wanting and wages abate again as it is very likely may be the case hereafter no no just the contrary this prosperity introduces sloth idleness drunkenness and all manner of wickedness instead of making hay while the sun shines they slight their work and bully their employers perhaps they will work two or three days or it may be a week till they find a few shillings gingle and chink in their pockets but then as if they could not bear that kind of music away they go to the alehouse and it is imposible to bring them to work again while they have a farthing of it left  the manufacturers are distressed for hands they have workmen but they had as good have none for they will not work the masters beg and entreat and with money in hand as we say they pray and pay too but it is all one no work can be done as long as there is a farthing of money in their pockets  if we go out of the manufacturing towns into the countryvillages there they feel the same thing another way the farmers wives can get no dairymaids their husbands no plowmen and what is the matter truly the wenches answer they will not go to service at    d or    d a week while they can get   s to   s a week at spinning the men answer they will not drudge at the plow and cart hedging and ditching threshing and stubbing and perhaps get   l a year and course diet when they can sit still and dry within doors and get   or  0 s a week at woolcombing or at carding and such work about the woollen manufacture  now it is true the argument on their side would be very just and some way unanswerable were the end really to work and so to get as much as they could by a diligent application to the business and then by a frugal honest virtuous life laying up what they got for their use in harder times  but instead of this we find these wenches and fellows run to the manufacturingtowns there perhaps they spin and work and when they have got a little money in their pockets beforehand then they turn vagrant and idle spend the little they have got in revelling drinking and by consequence something worse till the magistrates have been called upon to rout them out to secure the parishes from the charge of their debaucheries  from these wicked haunts they spread themselves about the villages where they draw in other young people till then sober and diligent into the like wickedness till we have seen six or seven of them in a house with bigbellies to the shame and affliction of their poor parents and the scandal of the whole country  as soon as they can drop their burden they fly for fear of the house of correction and away they go to london to get services  london like the ocean that receives the muddy and dirty brooks as well as the clear and rapid rivers swallows up all the scum and filth of the country and here they need not fear of getting places what servants are likely to come out of such nurseries is not hard to suggest nor is it any breach of charity to suppose that this helps to fill the town with a generation of whores and thieves and makes our maidservants recommend themselves as they do hence nothing is more natural than the common jest we put upon the countrygirls when we see them come up to london in the carriers wagons and on the packhorses viz to ask them if they have been churchd before they came from home nor is there any thing unreasonable in the question as things go now in the country when work is so plenty and wages so high for who would come away to london to go to service if things were all well at home  this is one of the grievances which we want a law to restrain and which if not taken in time and restrained will quickly make servants wages as dear in the country as they are now in the city and the poor farmers must give   l and   l a year wages for dairymaid as the ladies here do for their chambermaids and a proportion for plowmen and carters of which i shall say more hereafter  it is true we have laws here for regulating of servants and among the rest a justice of peace may oblige young people who are idle and live as it is called at their own hands to go to service and may if they refuse it send them to the house of correction but this is a concern which the law takes for parents whose circumstances being but mean and their children lying heavy upon them are willing to be maintained in idleness and sloth and refuse either to work for themselves or go out to service in such a case the magistrate may oblige them to go out as above  but if the single person so challenged by the justice answers that she worked and maintains herself and is able to maintain herself without being a charge to her parents or the parish i do not find the magistrate can compel such a one to go to service  in the next place as this insolence of the laboring poor is in spite of double pay so it is with this particular aggravation that at the same time that their wages has been raised the price of provisions has been cheaper than it has been for many years before particularly breadcorn has been so low that none can complain except the poor farmers who cannot pay their rents by reason of the cheapness of corn and i am witness to this that when bread about    or    years ago was sold for double the price that it is now the wages for spinning and manufacturing was not much above half the price that it is now so that they gained less and spent more and yet were able to subsist even then  this makes good the ordinary remark here viz that the poor are always poor it is very plain when wages were cheap or low and provisions high and dear the poor were not poorer than they are now and now wages are higher and provisions so much lower than it was then yet the poor are not richer now than they were then but this riddle is easily expounded by saying   the poor are as above idle proud and saucy and when wages are good they will not work any more than from hand to mouth or if they do work they spend it in riot and luxury so that it turns to no account to them  while this then is the temper of the laboring poor what are we to expect from them but that as above they will be mutinous when they want employment and idle and saucy when they have it would the poor maidservants who choose rather to spin while they can gain   s per week by their labor than go to service at    d a week to the farmers houses as before i say would they sit close to their work live near and close as laboring and poor people ought to do and by their frugality lay up six or seven shillings per week none could object or blame them for their choice but while on the contrary they either play half their time and neglect the work they have or if they do work spend it all in drink and debauchery as is too much the case this height of wages is by it made a public grievance the poor are ruined even by that which is their blessing or would be so were it rightly made use of i mean plenty of work and good pay nay the very plenty of provisions which was always received by reasonable people and especially by christians as the gift and mercy of heaven is cursed to them and becomes their ruin for while they have bread they will not work and when they do not work it is easy to judge what else they do and how they employ their time  again as soon as trade receives a check and there is a little discouragement upon the clothiers and manufacturers so that work is a little stopped and the masters and employers can give no more wool out to spin or perhaps but a little and that in consequence of this the price abates too what follows why then they grow clamorous noisy and as i said before mutinous and saucy another way and in the mean time they disperse run away leave their families and especially the numerous throng of bastards which as i hinted the wickedness of their workinglife had produced upon the parishes and wander about in beggary and distress  in consequence of this it has been observed that in our great populous manufacturing towns whenever a run of trade has happened and after it the poor disperse again there is generally an increase of bastards greater than in any of the precedent years and i could give such particular examples of this in the western and northern counties as would be surprising  thus gods blessing and the bounty of providence is abused by these sorts of people not to increase and encourage their diligence their frugality and thriftiness to lay up in a time of plenty of work for a time of scarcity and deadness of trade but on the contrary to support them in their extravagant follies and wickedness prompt their vices and fill them with pride and insolence both against god and man  and so far are they from improving the advantages of a glut of business that as soon as it stops even the very first week perhaps the first day they are reduced to their original poverty and distress for having not laid up a shilling but just working from hand to mouth as soon as the workmaster stops the workman or workwoman starves and it must be confessed such as these deserve no pity seeing their wastefulness and the expense both of their money and their time was in the very teeth of that merciful providence which suppyld them with double work and double pay and that they had reduced themselves by their sloth to want when they might have been as we call it beforehand in the world  in a certain town of note which i have been well acquainted with a poor workman was brought before the magistrate by his employer because he would not finish his piece of work which he had begun it was a piece of serge or drugget or some such stuff which the master had hired him to weave and he had begun it but would not make an end of it or at least not in the time agreed for and it produced a most edifying discourse between the justice and the weaver of which i shall give you a part  the clothier told his story first and his complaint was as follows that edmund pratt the person brought before him was a journeyman weaver that he had given him a piece of work to do which he promised to finish for him out of hand and that now he had neglected it that he had done part of it but did not finish it that he had obliged himself to deliver it by such a day and should lose the sale of it if it was not finished and sent to london in the time that he had delivered him the warp such a time which was about   weeks before that he might have finished it in a fortnight if he would work but that he had not above half done it and that he lay drunk and sotting in the alehouse and would not work that he promised him from time to time to go to work and still whenever he came to look at him he was absent and gone to the alehouse that at last when he entreated him to go to work he answered him flat and plain he would not work that he did not want money and would not work not he and for this reason he came to his worship for a warrant to bring edmund before him  the justice answered him very sencibly first that as he  edmund was not an apprentice or a hired covenantservant bargained with for the year that is for a certain time and the like the case did not lie before him and that if the fellow was a knave and would not perform his agreement he must sue him for his bargain and would recover damages against him at law but that it was not the work of a justice of the peace and that he could not make the fellow work unless he would do it willingly however says the justice i will send for him and talk to him i cannot well grant a warrant for him on such an occasion but pray go and tell him i would speak with him  this i mention because i think if the laws of england are deficient in any thing it is in this namely that they do not empower the justices to compel laboring people who undertake work to finish it before they be employed by any other it is true the law of trespass and of right and wrong gives the injured employer a right of action against such a man and he shall upon hearing be condemned in such a sum as will compensate the damage to the person injured and perhaps do penance in the county jail at last but then the suit is long chargeable and uncertain and the fellow perhaps poor so that you sue a beggar and catch an english proverb whereas could the justice of the peace determine it in a summary way and oblige him to give bail to perform the work or send him to the house of correction till he was humble enough to go about it i say if this was the case much of the mischief would be remedied that way  but this deficiency of the law it seems the fellow knew and this made him not only saucy and peremptory to his employer but very pert and almost impudent before the justice himself as you will see  as soon as he was told the justice would speak with him he answered readily he would wait upon the justice immediately and accordingly went when he appeared the justice told him the complaint which was made against him when he had done the fellow looking something confident but giving no answer the justice spoke to him thus  you hear the charge edmund what do you say to it  nothing sir says edmund and so the dialogue begun  just nothing what do you mean by that sir   ed and t please your worship i see no answer it requires   just what does it require no answer   ed no i think not he has told your worship a fine story and your worship has heard it what would he have more   just it is plain what he would have he would have his work done   ed i believe he would andt please your worship   just and you promised to finish it   ed and has he told your worship so   just yes he has   ed then i suppose he has said all he has to say   just well and what do you say to it then   ed nothing sir   just why i find you are an impudent fellow   ed nay andt please your worship can i be impudent in saying nothing   just yes you are impudent in not answering me when i ask you a question   ed i have answered every question your worship has asked me   just i tell you what mr  charges you with and i ask you if it is true or not   ed now indeed your worship asks me that question but you only asked me before what i had to say to mr  or to his charge and i answered that i had nothing to say to it   just well you pretend to be nice in your distinctions i see but what do you say to my question now is the charge he brings true or not   ed i hope your worship will not be angry if i answer the question by a question am i obliged to accuse myself   just why no you are not edmund that is true i shall call him to prove it then   ed will your worship allow me to ask another question   just ay what is your question   ed will not your worship be angry if i do ask a question you should not like   just no no i will not be angry if you are not rude and saucy edmund i shall not like that   ed i shall not be rude sir but my question is this if your worship calls mr  to prove the tale he has told you and he should prove it are you empowrd to try the cause between us   just why thou art a subtle rogue edmund i will be very plain with thee i dont know whether i am or no but it is pity i should not for i think you deserve to be well handled if what he says is true   ed if i deserve it never so much i shall have no reason to be sorry if it may be out of your worships power to handle me   just well it may be in my power too for ought i know i shall talk with mr  again and you shall hear farther pray attend here again to morrow morning   ed yes sir so the follow was dismissed and the justice sent for the clothier   the clothier being come says the justice to him well mr  i have talked with your workman and as i told you before that i thought the matter did not lie before me so i assure you he has told me so too in as merry a manner as i could desire and so he recited the discourse that had happened between his worship and the journeyman weaver  he is an impudent fellow says the clothier i am sure he ought to be sent to the house of correction for his saucy tongue  why that is true says the justice but yet he spoke so warily and with a kind of saucy goodmanners with your worship and your worship at every word that though it was manifest he ridiculed the charge and ridiculed you yet he was mighty civil to me and as he said indeed i could not lay him by the heels for answering me that he had nothing to say to you  now the case is this says the justice it is evidient he has had some bad counsel and somebody has instructed him what to say he demands you should prove the charge you bring and so indeed you must that is you must prove that he undertook your work bargained to finish it by such a time and that he has neglected it and that you are damnified by his neglect  all this i can easily prove sir says the clothier  well but when you have done all says the justice as edmund said i do not see that i can try the cause it must be heard in the court of the kings bench or common pleas and the verdict and damages must be given by a jury it is a breach of covenant or trespass and you must prosecute it in the ordinary course so the poor clothier went away it was not worth his while to sue the fellow and be at the charge of a prosecution which though the fellow was sure to be cast and condemned to pay the cost and damages the consequence would be only that he would run away or go to jayl neither of which would turn to account to the clothier  well however the justice had amind to have another dialogue with this edmund and see whether he could make any thing of him or no so he sent for him again the same day and when he came the following merry dialogue began between them  just come in edmund i have talked with your master    ed not my master and t please your worship i hope i am my own master   just well your employer mr e  the clothier will the word employer do   ed yes yes and t please your worship any thing but master   just well but why will you not finish the piece of work you began   ed does he say i will not finish it sir   just he says you dont finish it   ed there is much difference and t please you between dont and will not   just there is no great difference on his side the damage is the same for he wants the goods and that is a great loss to him   ed but there is a great deal of difference to me sir if i had refused to finish it perhaps he might have had some advantage on me   just all that you can say to that is perhaps that you have been too cunning for him that he did not tie you to a time and take it under your hand that you would finish it by that time but edmund you must not neglect the mans work when you have undertaken it   ed it may be i should not but as for must not and t please your worship i dont understand that   just why you must not that is you cannot and be an honest man   ed why then if i do he may call me knave that is all   just and it seems you do not matter that edmund   ed not much indeed and t please your worship   just nay i confess he that dont matter being a knave may do a great many wicked things and yet not be liable to every magistrate to take hold of him   ed your worship is pleased to mistake me i did not say i did not matter being a knave but that i did not matter his calling me so i have done no dishonest thing by him   just why is it not dishonest not to finish his work according to agreement   ed yes if any agreement had been made   just no doubt he put it to you expecting you would finish it in time   ed that he could not do because he knew my way of working before   just pray what is that edmund and what did he know   ed why he knew that i never finish any piece of work till i please   just and does he know when that is too edmund pray when do you usually please to finish the work you undertake   ed why and t please your worship when i have finished ten  yards i come for my money which is ten shillings as by agreement and then i go to another work   just what work what do you leave his loom and go and work in another edmund that would not be honest i am sure   ed no no and t please your worship i go to the alehouse and work hard to spend it and when it is all spent then i come to work again   just and not before   ed no sir and t please your worship never before   just and is this honest edmund   ed i dont enquire into that it is my way   just your way but what is that to mr e  the clothier   ed why and t please your worship it is this to him that he knows it is my way that i never did otherwise and never shall and he knew this before he put the warp into the loom and i did not promise i would do any otherwise so i am no knave in it if i had promised otherwise then indeed he had something to say   just very well so that as he knew your custom you suppose he put his work to you upon a supposition that you would act so   ed yes sir   just but cannot you break your self of this wicked way edmund   ed it would be very hard to do it sir after  0 years practice   just thou art an old drunkard i find edmund have a care if i happen to catch thee with a giddyhead i shall cure thee of the staggers   ed o sir and t please your worship you are very welcome if you catch me in the corn put me in the pound i am never fuddld and t please your worship   just but to sit tippling to keep bad hours go to the alehouse asundays all those things come within my reach edmund have a care   ed i am provided against all that sir and t please your worship i lodge in an alehouse so that i am always at home he cannot keep bad hours that is athome in good season nor you cannot deny me drinking in my own chamber though it be on a sunday i hope i am safe there   just thou art a crafty knave edmund why thou set up to be too cunning for the law it self   ed no no and t please your worship i am an honest drunken fellow   just well but edmund shall i persuade thee to go and finish mr e  s piece of stuff and he shall give thee thy money beforehand   ed and t please your worship by no means then i shall never do it at all i am sure no it would be impossible and t please your worship by no means   just why will nothing oblige you to be honest   ed yes yes want of money that does it when i want money i always go towork   just and never but then   ed no and please your worship i work for nothing but money and why should i work if i do not want money would anybody work if they had money enough   just no not if they had enough it may be they would not but what do you call enough   ed why if in the morning i have enough to spend for that day that is enough to me for to morrow i can work for more   just so you lay up nothing   ed lay up master what should i lay up for i have no wife or children to cry after me   just well but hereafter edmund you should consider hereafter you may be sick or lame or grow old   ed i never trouble myself with hereafter not i alas and please your worship what should i think of hereafter for while i can keep myself all is well i trouble nobody and when i cannot the parish must   just so that the only way to get you to finish the clothiers work is to get you to it next time your money is spent and then let you have no more money till it is done   ed that would do it effectually indeed but then i may chance to run away go to work for somebody else and never finish it atall   just so that in short there is no way to deal with a drunkard but to let him alone and let him go on his own way well i think the clothier shall try you edmund and if you do run away i will tell him how he shall fetch you again without a justice of peace unless you run quite away and then the country will be well rid of you   there was a great deal of farther discourse between them in which edmund was at last so saucy that the justice found he was halfdrunk and set him in the stocks and took care afterward to have him punished too for some other misbehaviour but all the justice or the clothier could do could not make him finish his piece of work till he pleased and that was a good while after  this story has several useful inferences depending upon it which is the reason of my being so particular in a thing of so small moment   as above it discovers a deficiency as i said in the laws here by which it is evident the insolence of our labouringpoor cannot be so effectually governed as it were to be wished it might be edmund should else have been humbled and have lain in jail till he had come and begged the clothier to give him leave to finish the piece of work without any wages or that the wages should have been given to the poor   it is observable what a perfectly thoughtless temper possesses the minds of the people here that they never lay up in the time of plenty for a time of scarcity   that they are not to be obliged either by fair means or foul to do their work if but a pot of strongbeer to which they are slaves be in their way according to the character given them by one of our english writers in drink and drunken company delight and what they get by day they spend at night subjecting all their labors to their pots the greatest artists are the greatest sots    i shall conclude this letter with adding another observation which i draw from the story above and which i have by experience found true also of these laboring poor namely so little does a sense of justice or of gratitude rest upon their minds that not only they are thus insolent in spite of double pay but in spite of prompt pay or as some call it pay by advance  nothing is more dangerous of its kind than to pay them by advance and it is ten to one as edmund said of himself if ever you have your work done at all  there is a proverb among the working people that there are two sorts of bad masters   those that pay beforehand   those that never pay atall   and both they say make bad servants and never should have their work well finished  it is true that this is the result of a general baseness in the servant but nothing is more certain than that to pay beforehand is to ruin your business and your servant too and that if you have your work done atall it is never well done and always with an ill will but of this hereafter  i am etc  letter v sir i have given you a sketch of the insolence of our laboring poor it is but too much influence that this matter however triffling it may seem has had upon the general tranquillity of this nation and is therefore well worth notice  they are greatly mistaken who think that the poor people are below our concern it is true in many cases they are below our resentment but it is apparent that the many ways which the poor find to make themselves uneasy to the rich are such and the advantages which they have in this country by the privileges they enjoy are also such that they bid fair for inverting the order of things in a word it is already true in a great measure that in england the poor govern and the rich submit the case is in short that they clamor their masters into and out of every thing they please and unless men will be ever contending and scolding with them he can neither trade with them or employ them  nay let me go farther we are awed by the poor nothing is more frequent than to see gentlemen bear the vilest treatment from the meanest fellows and that for mere fear pardon me i do not say they are afraid of their hands but really they are afraid of their tongues and it is not altogether without reason as you shall hear at large in its place  nor is it easy for a gentleman to live in any place long without suffering the beastly treatment of the tongue from the canaille or mobb of the place no conduct the best the mildest the most prudent can protect him    if he is easy kind and good to them they impose upon him and that in the grossest manner and no sooner have they done it but they expose him laugh at him and make their boasts among their gangs how they cheated him that he is easy that is to say is a fool and how they can impose upon him at any time   if he is sharp with them and exact will not be cheated and when he sees it resents exposes and detects them and turns them off then they rail at him the other way that he is hard and cruel will let nobody live by him would starve the poor and would have a poor mans labor for nothing and the like   if he is generous and free they strain that generosity to its utmost extent craving till the most bountiful hand in the world must stop at last and deny or be blind and not see it self abused and then whenever you stop you lose all your character for generosity at one blow it is too true of the temper of these people what one of my neighbors said to me from his dearbought experience that if you carry an englishman    mile on your back and will not carry him  0 you lose all the title to his favor and cancel all obligation the    mile is forgot the odd negative mile is only remembered nay says he if you carry him all the  0 miles and at last do but set him down hard he will curse you to your face upon the foot of this temper you may expect to hear of some of the rudest unjust and most impudent things put upon the gentlemen in this country by the common people that you can imagine possible  as they impose upon the generous so on the otherside they hate the frugal if some gentlemen live more sparingly than others and are more near and saving than these people like so that they cannot make a spoil of them as they do of others if they will not suffer themselves to be imposed upon or cheated and resent it when they see it offered to them these they attack with opprobrious language and revile them with covetousness and not living as they ought to do with oppressing the poor being cruel and barbarous to poor men and the like  these reproaches especially where they are not just are very grievous to gentlemen to such especially whose livesare really blameless and who ought to be judges of their own way of living as they best know what they can or cannot expend or is proper for them to expend in the port of families and as these gentlemen are loath to have such characters among the neighborhood without reason this makes them bear with a thousand indignities and sometimes see themselves imposed upon and used scurvily and yet take no notice of it because they would not be marked for severity or for hard treatment of poor men this is what i call being afraid of the poor and they really are so afraid of them that they suffer themselves to be illusd a thousand ways when they see it plain enough but wink and make as if they did not see it atall only for fear of being counted so and so niggardly cruel hard to the poor and the like  i was going a few days ago to visit a friend in a country village not far from london and being come to the town where my friend lived but not knowing his house i rode past it and past two more before i found anybody to enquire of but at last i saw a cluster or little crowd of young fellows standing together and chatting upon their earnest affairs i suppose they seemed to be all servants four or five of them had liveries on of several sorts the other looked like gardeners and one or two like bricklayers when i came up to them i asked them what gentleman lived at that house pointing to the first house that i had passed and which was indeed the gentlemans house who i was to go to when i asked what gentleman lived there the rogues grinnd and looked upon one another and laughed gentleman says one gentleman says another but gave me no present answer i saw them a little merry so i smiled too and speaking pleasantly well says i if that is not as it should be pray who lives at that house why sir says one of them very civilly but still laughing we beg your pardon we did not laugh as you but at your mistakeing the person that lives there for a gentleman if you please to take it in our way of talking it is one dog k  d adding the gentlemans surname well says i and pray who lives there pointing to the next house why that is such another too says the fellow that is dog e  adding there the surname of another well says i that is very good still and who lives at that house pointing at the third house o says he that is a very honest gentleman indeed that is mr  naming him with a great deal of respect  well gentlemen said i and made myself as familiar with them as i could i see you are very merry upon your neighbors pray let me ask you how you come to distinguish thus among em why sir says the fellow dog k  d is vastly rich and lives like a hog in his stye does nobody any good but like a dog snarles at the rich and bites the poor and therefore we think he lives more like a dog than a gentleman  well says i and what is mr  he is just such another says the saucy rogue he is worth the l  d knows how many thousand pounds and he that ought to keep a coach and six horses keeps one pair of horses for two coaches makes his coachman work in his garden because he will keep but one gardener when he ought to keep three and instead of a through livery gives his men nothing but a coat hat and stockings and is not that a dog of a gentleman sir says the fellow and closed it all with a broad d  n him by way of elegance  i agreed to all this that i might have the rest of it out and it pleased them all mightily to see me laugh well says i and what is the gentleman at this house o says another of them that is as honest a gentleman as any in the country and he lives like himself he keeps a better house and more servants than both those misers and gives a better livery and has more horses in his stable than both of them and yet he has not half their estate but it may be said i he spends more than his estate can afford it is no matter for that says the first he lives like a gentleman and everybody loves him a poor servant gets something in his house there is gentlemen and ladies always a visiting there and they are as merry as the days long and when they go away the servants are the better for them the two doggentlemen are always at london almost a stockjobbing or somewhere or other i dont know where they are seldom athome so that they have no company and keep no house worth a farthing nobody is the better for them  i took my leave of this knot of gentlemen soon after gave em sixpence to drink my health and rid round anotherway to come into the street again where i did at first that they might not see me go to the first dogs house as they called him where i was really going  i took this time to think what a liberty these scoundrels took with the gentlemen and how subject every family is to the scurrilous tongues of such people as these for when i came to consider the circumstances of the three families it stood thus the two first were exceeding rich lived well and kept very good equipages servants coaches and horses as many as they had occasion for and not very few neither for i think the second kept twelve servants and the first five or seven but they were both what we call managingmen that did not withold what was proper as might be seen by the houses they lived in which are indeed more like palaces than privategentlemens houses but they were men that did not make ducks and drakes of their money and throw it away on purpose for others to pick it up and laugh at them  but the third who they called an honest gentleman was indeed of a differing kind one that kept a good house indeed but spent twice as much as his revenue brought in kept more horses and servants too than he could afford run into everybodys debt was every now and then haunted with bailiffs and arrested for triffles and dunnd continually by the butchers bakers and cornchandlers and such like people and this was the honest gentleman and in a few years he was fain to take up put off housekeeping thereabouts and go into the country to live cheaper  but the reason of my telling this story is to let you see what treatment the gentlemen suffer on these accounts and that this is really a restraint upon them that they bear with a thousand insolences from the people as well the servants withindoors as the workmen and trading people withoutdoors because of their tongues and because they would not be made the scoff of such insolent rogues without cause and this indeed encourages the crime for if they would contemn it more they would be insulted with it less nothing encouraging such ill usage more than the concern the gentlemen show about it but to proceed  i dont know anything can give you a more perfect idea of the behavior of these sort of people who i call the labouringpoor than their combinations in their business imposing upon the gentlemen in the way of their employments though all combinations in order to raise the price of goods or workmanship are against the known laws of the country  one instance of this happens just now among the same sort of people who i have been mentioning i mean the manufacturers who in the west of england that is to say the cloathingcounties which we call the west though they are southwest raised a kind of rebellion to support their insolence against their masters and employers the case was this as i said before there has been a sudden run of trade which has lasted now about two years and the workmen in the country found that the masters had pressing orders for goods  taking the advantage of this they had twice before clamoured to have their wages raised and the masters had raised them and that considerably but demanding a third advance of pay the masters though in very civil terms refused them nor were they able to give more wages without losing by their goods and told the workmen so  upon this the workmen particularly the weavers formed a combination among themselves not to work for the clothiers unless they raised their wages to such a certain rate as they had also agreed on among themselves they carried on this combination to such a height as to gather together in a tumultuous manner to bring all the rest of the workmen to join with them to this end they troopd about the towns and entering by force into the houses of such honest weavers as they found were at work they broke their looms to pieces spoiled the warps and cut in pieces the goods which they had been at work upon insulting also the masters and employers in an outrageous manner to make them yield to raise the wages which some were obliged to do for fear of their lives or for fear of having their houses plundered on the otherhand many of the quieter innocent poor men who would have been glad to have gone on with their business suffered extremely for having work to do and the wages before being sufficent to maintain them and their families perhaps wanting a supply yet they durst not work for fear of being mobbd as above in short they carried this game on till the government was obliged to send some regular troops down to protect the clothiers and keep the peace and reduce these mad fellows by force which was easily done and several of them had the favor of being sent to jail as they deserved but the clemency of the government spared them as to punishment when it came to that point  the next account i shall give has a little more mirth in it in a certain considerable market town in england there was a combination of pumpmakers that is the pumpmakers in that and two or three considerable towns round made an agreement that such and such gentlemen ought to have new pumps upon the resolutions of this worthy society no gentleman in the neighborhood could order a pump to be mended when it was out of order but the pumpmakers would tell him it was good for nothing him it could not be mended and so his worship must have a new pump if he thought they imposed upon him and that his pump might be mended he would probably send for another pump maker but it was all one for the other would be sure to tell him the same story that the tree was rotten below that it could not be mended nothing could be done to it but just as before his worship must have a new pump and thus several of the gentlemen it seems were ignorantly drawn in to the expense of new pumps without any manner of necessity only for the gain of those rogues the pump makers  it happened that a particular gentleman a justice of the peace and of a very good estate in the neighborhood who was a little sharper than the rest fell under their management he had a pump which belonged to his stableyard that happened to be out of order and he sent a servant to the market town near him for a pumpmaker the pumpmaker came readily looked upon the pump told the gentleman the pump could not be mended but he must have a new one for the fault was in the tree it was rotten between wind and water and there was no remedy  the gentleman told him he did not doubt but his pump might be mended for that it was a new pump but a little while before and he would not have a new one again but must have it mended upon this the fellow told him he would take it up and look and accordingly takes it out of the well the gentleman being present all the while the pump was taking up the designing rogue was not able to play the prank he intended for he purposed to have made a hole in it if he did not find one there but not being able to do that he acknowlegd then that it might be mended and appointed to come the next day to do it  to morrow coming and two or three tomorrows but no pumpmaker the gentleman sent for him and so for many days after oneanother and still his answer was he would come such or such a day on tuesday he would come on thursday and on thursday he would come a saturday and on saturday he would come a tuesday and so from tuesday to saturday he kept the gentleman in suspense and his well lying open too for four or five months upon this the gentleman sent to another town a larger than the other about seven miles off and there he met with the same treatment exactly and by this time and not before the gentleman perceived it was a trick agreed upon among them  to confirm himself in the opinion of its being a trick as above he sends his servant once more and bids him tell the pumpmaker that the pump which he took out of the well had met with a disaster and was spoiled by accident as it lay in the yard and a great piece burnt off of it and that his master desired him to come and make an agreement with him for a new pump the pumpmaker perfectly deceived said yes he would wait upon esquire  the next morning and accordingly he came when he came the gentleman took no notice of the message he had sent but saluted him thus o mr l  i am glad to see you what you are come to do my pump are nt ye indeed you have been unkind to be so long the fellow said nothing a goodwhile upon which the gentleman called one of his servants here tanner his mans name here is mr l  the pumpmaker come to mend the pump go with him and show it him sir says the pumpmaker i understood you had resolved to have a new pump a new pump says the gentleman why you know you told me this would serve and you could easily mend it sir says the pumpmaker your man told me you wanted a new pump upon this the gentleman called his man who he had instructed before what to say  jacob says his master did you bid mr  come over to me to make me a new pump yes sir says jacob but who ordered you to say so jacob says the master why says jacob i had been twenty times at his house to bid him come over to mend the oldone and your worship knows he never came and i found what he wanted so i told him he should come to make a newone that i knew would bring him presently  the pumpmaker would have denied it at first but jacob told his master plainly it was so and that he had been at the other pumpmakers in the town and he would not come at all pretending it was the other mans work with this he laughed no if he bad says the pumpmaker i would have stuck by his skirts and began to be very saucy  well well says the gentleman come go about it now and all will be well sir says the fellow i cannot do it now i will come a tuesday and do it for you upon my word  no no says the gentleman i know you can do it now if you please if you will not do it tell me so if not i must send for another at that the fellow laughed impudently and said do if you please what do you mean by that says the gentleman you are very rude i dont doubt but i may have my pump mended for my money  do then if you can sir says the pumpmaker for i will not meddle with it  well then go about your business says the gentleman i will find pumpmakers enough i warrant ye  not in this county says the fellow jeering nor the next and away he went  the gentleman finding it was a general combination of the society but resolving not to be imposed upon by them waited awhile intending though it should cost him the more to send to london for a pumpmaker but at length he got notice that at a town eight or ten miles from him there was a pumpmaker newly setup and who it was probable was not got into the knot yet and besides did not know the names of the neighboring gentlemen yet or know their faces or dwellings so he concluded to send for him not to tell him what it was for or where he was to go  the servant did his business so well that the pumpmaker came with him and managed so well when he came that in about two hours he fully mended the pump when he had done and while the gentleman was paying the poor man somebody by accident called the gentleman by his name at which the pumpmaker seemed a little surprised and smiled the gentleman took notice of it and asked him what he smiled at the man declined it a little but having mended the pump and being well paid he confessed at last that if he had known the gentlemans name before he durst not have come why so says the gentleman why sir says he we had all notice that it was resolved in the society that your pump should not be mended and we durst not have done it what then says the gentleman what was to be done with me nothing sir says he only that you should be obliged to have a new pump  well says the gentleman i hope you will tell them you have mended it will not you no indeed sir says the pumpmaker i dare not and i hope your worship will not do me so much prejudice the gentleman promised silence and away went the pumpmaker  but the jest of the story is still behind the first pumpmaker finding he was sent for no more was mighty curious to know what was the reason of it and at length by some means or other come to know that the pump was mended and set up again that increased his curiosity exceedingly for then he wanted to know who had done it but that he could not come at by any means at last he offered the gentlemans servants to give them a bowl of punch to tell him upon this that servant that had been so often sent to him took the hint and laid a plot for him for he owed him a shrewd turn for making him have so many winterjourneys for nothing so he told the pumpmaker that he would not tell him himself but if he would come to their town and give them the punch there that they might be merry he should know by one means or other  he promised and came accordingly and very merry they were not at the gentlemans house but at a publickhouse hard by in their mirth they drank the gentlemans health and at last the pumpmakers health that mended the pump at length being most of them very drunk the unlucky fellow that contrived it all proposed to the company that they would all go and drink the pumps health in a draught of fair water to cool them it was presently agreed to and so they jogged away to his masters house he being gone to london some weeks before when they came to the pump they agreed to drink on their knees at the spout of the pump without any mugs or glasses and so they did but when the pumpmakers turn came to drink whether they held him fast or whether they threw him down or whether he being soundly drunk fell down and somebody kept him there history does not acquaint us of the particulars but they pumped him so heartily and so effectually that never was pickpocket better pumped in the streets of london and it being withal a cold night he had but a very indifferent journey home however being very warm within he got no hurt by it nor could he ever tell who had done it for him or how he was managed atall  in another place i met with the following story of a combination of thatchers and it is as material to my purpose as the other though not so long a story a certain gentleman in kent who had the management of some part of his estate in his own hands and having every year a great deal more corn than his barns would hold set up the rest in great stacks or reiks in his yard as is usual in like cases a thatcher in the neighborhood was usually employed every year to thatch this gentlemans stacks and his work generally came to fifty shillings or three pound every year  it happened one year that a straggling welchman who was hired for harvestwork as is common in that county offered his service to thatch the stacks and having shown by his doing one that he understood it very well and could do it much better than they were done before and cheaper too the gentleman employed him and he thatched the stacks so well that he got work in other places as well as there and afterward settled in the country and took a small farm of the gentleman so that he became a tennant by which together with the merit of his workmanship he had a kind of a title to the thatching of the stacks ever after  some time after this the gentleman had a house to thatch for a tennant a storm of wind having blown off great part of the old thatch and the poor family being sick they were in great distress to have the house covered the gentleman sent for his welchman to thatch the house but was surpised that the poor man told him he could not do it that the thatching of a house was done quite another way and with other tools than thatching stacks of corn or hay and he did not understand it atall  the gentleman then sent to his old thatcher but he said no let him that thatched his stacks thatch his house he sent to another and he answered no goodman  was the esquires thatcher and he would not take his work out of his hand he sent to a third and he answered no where was his welsh thatcher he had brought a welchman into the country to take poor mens trade away and he would not work for him  this in short went so far that the poor family was sore distressed and the gentleman was obliged to remove them into an empty house for the present and buy tiles to cover his house that he might not be at the mercy of the thatchers any more  i could load you with examples of this kind and divert you too with agreeable tales upon the subject but though it would make my account as pleasant to you as possible yet i would not have my letters be a mere collection of story these may intimate to you that the behavior of which i complain is not confined to one or two classes of men but in a word a general spirit of insolence and dishonesty possesses the people i am speaking of and the greivance is come now to such a height that it calls for a speedy remedy for if some laws are not very quickly made effectually to regulate the conduct of these people the gentlemen in england will live far less happily than in other parts of the world and above all far less than they used to do in this part of it  there are two other sorts of people here whose insolence is so very particular that indeed there is sometimes no bearing it and these are hackneycoachmen and watermen these are two sorts of people who have not the goods but the lives of the people they are concerned with in their charge  the first of these have once by their overgrown rudeness obliged the government to take notice of them and make laws for their regulation and as there are commissioners appointed for receiving the tax they pay to the public so those commissioners have power to hear and determine between the drivers and their fair upon any abuse that happens  and yet the ordinary coachmen abate very little of their abusive conduct but not only impose in price upon those that hire them but refuse to go this or that way as they are called whereas the law obliges them to go wherever they are legally required and at reasonable hours this treatment and the particular saucy impudent behavior of the coachmen has been the occasion of innumerable quarrels fighting and abuses afronting gentlemen frighting and insulting women and such rudenesses that no civil government will or indeed ought to suffer and above all has been the occasion of the killing several coachmen by gentlemen that have been provoked by the villainous tongues of those fellows beyond the extent of their patience  it was but very lately that a gentleman coming out of a tavern in fleetstreet called a hackneycoach about ten a clock at night the fellow came immediately which made it evident that he was not hired or in waiting when he came he asked the gentleman where he was to go before he opened the door the gentleman told him he would tell him when he was in his coach and bade him open the door  this the gentleman did because he suspected by his question that he would not carry him he being to go to the kings slaughterhouse near eastsmithfield  upon the gentlemans refusing to tell him he said that then he would not carry him and getting up into his coachbox drove away west to the standing where he was when he was called one of the drawers of the tavern standing by tells the gentleman that if he pleased to tell him where he was to go he would bring the fellow back and make him carry him so the gentleman told him it was to eastsmithfield  away goes the boy to the coachman and without saying a word to him till he was just at the coachside here coach says the boy and opening the door himself jumped in and shut the door again before the fellow could get down when the coachman got down turn about says the boy not giving the coachman time to say where must i go the coachman after some grumbling turned about but would then know where he was to go i will tell you presently says the boy drive on when he had gone a little farther the boy called to him to hold which being just at the taverndoor where the gentleman had spoken to him the coachman began to see he was caught and that it was the same person upon which he drove on a goodway the boy still calling to him to hold but to no purpose till the fellow had hurried him down as far as fleetbridge  the clamor the boy made obliged the fellow to stop at last so he gets down to let the boy out but the boy held the door fast and would not come out but bad him turn about again which the coachman refused and offered to pull the boy out but he was too strong for that so that the coachman was puzzled and knew not what to do but offered to go back if the boy would tell him where he was to go but the boy would not do that neither upon this the coachman got up in the box again and making as if he would turn again turns halfabout and whipping his horses on a sudden drives down by the side of fleetditch and stops of a sudden in the dark whipps off the figures from both sides of his coach having observed that thev had not yet taken the number of it and when he had done this he drives on again the boy supposing he had advantage enough of him let him go on to see where the fellow would drive him but here the coachman was too many for him for at the same time that he whipped off the two figures from his coach he had very dexterously hanged on a wrong figure in the stead of them  the boy letting him go on as i have said he drove him into leatherlane in holbourn and there would have persuaded the boy to come out again but to no purpose upon which he takes both the horses out leaves the coach in the street and the boy in it and getting up upon one of the horses rides away  the boy was not aware of this for a greatwhile but after some time finding how he was tricked he gets out gets a watchman to bring his lanthorn and taking the number of the coach goes his way home thinking as indeed had it been true if he had gotten the right number or figure that he had advantage enough of the coachman  the coachman had set a spy to observe what passed who giving notice that the boy was gone he sent another man with a pair of horses and fetched away the coach  the next day the poor coachman whose real number this fellow had put upon the coach instead of his own was surpised with a summons left at his house to appear before the commissioners but as he had it seems had no broil upon his hands nor given any cause of complaint that he knew of he went frankly to the place to see what was the matter  the gentleman and the drawer both appeared and made a grievous complaint as well they might and then the coachman was called but the gentleman and drawer was confounded when they saw a man appear which they neither of them knew any thing of the boy insisted upon the number of the coach and brought the watchman to support his evidence one swearing it was the number which was upon the coach in which he was driven about by force and the watchman swore it was the number upon the coach which was left in the street and which the boy called him to  this put the poor innocent coachman to prove where he was all day and what people he carried which as it happened he was very well able to do so it was concluded that the other coachman had got a counterfeit figure and they could make no more of it the coachman having been too cunning for the boy but you will observe on the otherhand that had they found the right person which they would easily have done if they had had his right figure they would have punished him very severely   for refusing to carry the gentleman when he was first called   for carrying the boy away when he called to him to hold   for leaving the coach with the boy in it who though a boy was actually his fair and ought to have been carried where he had given orders   but the coachman was too old for the boy in that so he escaped what he deserved at that time and they do indeed often escape and run the venture of being punished which makes them still so insolent that it is grievance almost unsufferable many people give them just what they will have rather than have the trouble of prosecuting them and this hardens them but on the otherhand sometimes they meet with justice or rather justice meets with them and then they are handled as they deserve  the next are the watermen and indeed the insolence of these though they are under some limitations too is yet such at this time that it stands in greater need than any other of severe laws and those laws being put in speedy execution  some years ago one of these very people being steersman of a passageboat between london and gravesend drowned three and fifty people at one time the boat was bound from gravesend to london was very full of passengers and goods and deep laden the wind blew very hard at south west which being against them obliged them to turn to windward so the seamen call it when they tack from side to side to make their voyage against the wind by the help of the tide  the passengers were exceedingly frighted when in one tack stretching over the stream in a place called longreach where the river is very broad the waves broke in upon the boat and not only wetted them all but threw a great deal of water into the boat and they all begged of the steersman or master not to venture again he saucy and impudent mocked them asked some of the poor frighted women if they were afraid of going to the devil bid them say their prayers and the like and then stoodover again as it were in a jest the storm continuing he shipped a great deal of water that time also by this time the rest of the watermen begun to persuade him and told him in short that if he stoodover again the boat would founder for that she was a great deal the deeper for the water she had taken in and one of them begged of him not to venture he swore at the fellow called him fool bade him let him alone to his business and he would warrant him then used a vulgar seaproverb which such fellows have in their mouths blow devil the more wind the better boat  the fellow told him in so many words he would drown all the passengers and before his face began to strip and so did two more that they might be in condition to swim for their lives this extremely terrified the passengers who having a cloth or tilt over them were in no condition to save their lives so that there was a dreadful cry among them and some of the men were making way to come at the steersman to make him by force let fly the sail and stand back for the shore but before they could get to him the waves broke in upon the boat and carried them all to the bottom none escaping but the three watermen that were prepared to swim  it was but poor satisfaction for the loss of so many lives to say the steersman was drowned with them who ought indeed to have died at the gallows or on the wheel for he was certainly the murderer of all the rest  i have many times passed between london and gravesend with these fellows in their smaller boats when i have seen them in spite of the shrieks and cries of the women and the persuasions of the menpassengers and indeed as if they were the more bold by how much the passengers were the more afraid i say i have seen them run needless hazards and go as it were within an inch of death when they have been under no necessity of it and if not in contempt of the passengers it has been in mere laziness to avoid their rowing and i have been sometimes obliged especially when there has been more men in the boat of the same mind so that we have been strong enough for them to threaten to cut their throats to make them hand their sails and keep under shore not to fright as well as hazard the passengers when there was no need of it  one time being in one of these boats all alone coming from gravesend to london the wind freshnd and it begun to blow very hard after i was come about three or four mile of the way and as i said above that i always thought those fellows were the more venturous when their passengers were the most fearful i resolved i would let this fellow alone to himself so i lay down in the boat as if i was asleep as is usual  just when i lay down i called to the waterman it blows hard waterman said i can you swim no sir says he nor cannot your man swim neither said i no sir says the servant well then says i take care of yourselves i sshall shift as well as you i suppose and so down i lay however i was not much disposed to sleep but kept the tilt which they cover their passengers with open in one place so that i could see how things went  the wind was fair but overblowd so much that in those reaches of the river which turned crossway and where the wind by consequence was thwart the stream the water went very high and we took so much into the boat that i began to feel the straw which lay under me at the bottom was wet so i called to the waterman and jesting told him they must go allhands to the pump he answered he hoped i should not be wet but it is bad weather master says he we cannot help it no no says i it is pretty well yet go on  by and by i heard him say to himself it blows very hard and every now and then he repeated it and sometimes thus twill be a dirty night twill be a terrible night and the like still i lay still and said nothing  after some time and his bringing out several such speeches as above i roused as if i had but just waked well waterman says i how do you go on very indifferently says he it blows very hard ay so it does says i where are we a little above erith says he so down i lay again and said no more for that time  by and by he was at it again it blows a frett of wind and it blows very hard and the like but still i said nothing at last we shipped a dash of water over the boatshead and the spry of it wetted me a little and i started up again as if i had been asleep waterman says i what are you doing what did you ship a sea ay says the waterman and a great one too why it blows a frett of wind well well says i come have a good heart where are we now almost in gallions says he that is a reach below woolwich  well when we got into the gallions reach there the water was very rough and i heard him say to his man jack well keep the weathershore aboard for it grows dark and it blows a storm ay thought i had i desired you to stand in under shore you would have kept off in mere bravado but i said nothing by and by his mast broke and gave a great crack and the fellow cried out lord have mercy upon us i started up again but still spoke cheerfully what is the matter now says i l  d sir says he how can you sleep why my mast is come by the board well well says i then you must make a goosewing a goosewing why says he i cannot carry a knot of sail it blows a storm well says i if you cannot carry any sail you must drive up under shore then you have the tide under foot and with that i lay down again the man did as i said a piece of his mast being yet standing he made what they call a goosewing sail that is a little piece of the sail out just to keep the boat steady and with this we got up as high as blackwall the night being then come on and very dark and the storm increasing i suffered myself to be persuaded to put in there though five or six mile short of london whereas indeed i was resolved to venture no farther if the waterman would have done it  when i was on shore the man said to me master you have been used to the sea i dont doubt why you can sleep in a storm without any concern as if you did not value your life i never carried one in my life that did so why twas a wonder we had not foundered why says i friend for that you know i left it all to you i did not doubt but you would take care of yourself but after that i told him my other reason for it the fellow smiled but owned the thing was true and that he was the more cautious a great deal for that i took no thought about it and i am still of opinion that the less frighted and timorous their passengers are the more cautious and careful the watermen are and the least apt to run into danger whereas if their passengers appear frighted then the watermen grow saucy and audacious show themselves venurous and contemn the dangers which they are really exposed to  i have heard abundance of tragical stories of these fellows and i know some of them to be true indeed there are very many lives lost by their audacious carriage what i have said may give you a true idea of their general behavior and that in a word they are beyond belief abusive insolent and saucy even to the people that they get their bread by insomuch that it is an evil so growing and so offensive that there is a general cry against it and yet such is this glorious thing called english liberty that i scarce see it probable there can be any suitable provision made against it  i am etc  letter vi dear brother i have in my last given you a short view of the behavior of our laboring poor who i call servants withoutdoors and perticularly let you see that as i said before they are not atall the better for the advance of price on their labor but that on the contrary that it is all in spite of doublepay  it is hard to say it of rational creatures and such as we are to call christians but i shall be justified from the experience of most of the gentlemen that employ workmen and keep servants that the poor are not to be won it is impossible to oblige them no not with the advance of their wages  i shall now give you the trouble of showing you that it is the same thing in its degree with the servants within doors only with this distinction that the aggravations are greatest in the latter because their obligations are generally greater and they are treated with more distinction of which i shall speak at large in its order but i confine myself to the particular of increase of wages in which case it is not my opinion only i assure you that this raising the price of wages has ruined the servants and made them worse i say it is not my opinion only it is the experience of the whole nation and yet unhappily all the masters and mistresses in england are drawn into it by an unaccountable concurrence of causes which it is not easy to give a reason for    the general complaint of the badness of servants makes those few that are good for anything so valuable that masters and mistresses think they can never do too much to encourage them so they level themselves to them in their intimacies load them with gifts with clothes and other advantages and the mechanic spirit not able to make a right judgment of things judges presently in his own favor namely that his own merit has procured him all that this exalts him in his own opinion and in a word ruins him for pride and a good servant are as inconsistent as darkness with light thus the few good servants that come upon the stage of the world are ruined and spoiled and that very bounty which is the reward of their early goodbehaviour and should be the encouragement of their diligence and humility makes them unsufferable makes them familiar arrogant proud impertinent and at last impudent but i shall give you a long letter upon the subject of the usage of servants by their masters i am at present upon the alternative viz the usage of masters by their servants and that under the obligations of advance of wages or as i call it in the case of laborers double pay   some think that the demand for servants is greater in england than it used to be and i believe it is so not that i will undertake to say the nation is richer because that might be disputed but that luxury and living is increased that i believe nobody will deny that people live more profusely keep greater equipages and more servants than ever was done before   as there is a greater demand for servants so they are not only obliged to take up with such as can be had but to give more wages than usual to procure them   there may be something in the public circumstances of the nation which has been dreind of people  men especially by a long and fatal war of near  0 years which carried away if the judgment of those who understand that part may be depended upon above five hundred thousand men out of the three kingdoms first and last either killed or run into foreign service or dead of diseases in the service or otherwise removed from the general body of the people   our plantations carry off every year very great numbers of servants especially of the female sex of which they tell us that there has within thirty years past above  00000 gone away voluntarily to virginia and the neighboring colonies merely to seek their fortunes as they call it which in a word is the main support of those colonies as well for their service as for breeding and multiplying the people there for those do not go on the terms of transported felons but they bind themselves for five years more or less and generally when their time is expired sometimes before it get married and settled turn planters and by industry grow rich or get to be yearly servants in good families upon terms that is to have wages and not to work in the fields as at first they did and these as i am assured make much better servants than those they leave behind them in england nb the chief numbers of these voluntier servants go out of scotland ireland and the west and north of england many more than from london now it may be true that these things lessening the numbers of servants and on the other hand the manner of living among the better sort causing a greater number of servants to be wanted both together may cause the rate of servants wages to rise as scarcity of any goods and the increase of the demand for them raises the value at market  but the mystery of all this is what should be the reason why the servants should be the worse for it for that i refer you to what i said before namely the error is in their morals the money prompts their vice and their vice depraves their manners so that very advantage which should encourage them to diligence and an humble behavior is the ruin both of their diligence and behavior  i have a remarkable story to tell you to illustrate and confirm this in which not the brutishness of one servant is concerned but after it the behavior of a great number and i think indeed it may give you an idea of the general temper and conduct of servants among us great part of the story i am particularly acquainted with and can therefore vouch the truth of the fact  a gentleman a particular friend of mine and by that means as i have said i came to a true account of the case had a groom whom he took from the horseheels to be his particular footman or serving man to wait upon him wherever he went upon which remove he considerably augmented his wages and as my friend loved sport and kept a good pack of foxhounds he took the more delight in this fellow because he was a good horseman loved the game too and was always a keen sportsman in the field and which still added to the value he had for him he knew him to be a very stout fellow of his hands and had often seen him tried  this fellow however as is the fate of most scoundrels could not bear his good fortune but believing himself advanced not in kindness to him but on a pure account of his wonderful merit grew proud and in the first place uneasy to his fellow servants by his haughty carriage and sometimes he took upon him to be saucy to his master  it was upon an accident happening one day in their sport viz that he rid over one of the hounds that his master was it seems in some passion with him upon it and edward  so they called him gave his master two or three very insolent saucy answers that so provoked his master who was angry before that he lifted up his cane at him once or twice as if he intended to lend him a turn or two with it but did not strike at that time when edward instead of shifting from his master as a modest fellow would have done facdabout to him and as his masters hand was lifted up as if to strike though as he said he did not intend to strike him he said to him with a kind of a saucy air and a grin sir sir dont strike me pray dont strike me why sir says the master why should i not strike you i am sure you deserve it but sir says edward i desire you would not strike me because i shall be apt to strike again  say thou so edward says the gentleman his master smiling and as he said to me all his passion went away that moment come edward thou bast a good stick in thy hand and i am sure a better than mine but since it is come to that here is nobody by and i give thee my word for it thou shall have fair play and if thou art too hard for me i forgive thee and do thy best but he added depend upon it edward if i have the better of thee thou will feel me a little therefore look to thy self edward  if the fellow had been master of the least grain of modesty he would have asked his masters pardon and said that he did not desire to engage with him and he might easily have seen that his master who indeed was one of the besthumourd gentlemen in england at one soft word would have forgiven him all that had passed but he was the same saucy edward as before and returned in a grumbling saucy way that he would not be cand by never a master in england  never hereafter it may be edward says his master but it happens so i doubt that you must now and with that word he laid him home a smart blow or two upon the shoulders not striking at his head at first when edward felt it come hard it raised his mettle and he struck again indeed as he said he would and followed it with a strong hand and a good heart for a great while nay he played his staff so well and his blows came so thick that as his master said edward for awhile beat him a little out of his play and hurt one of his hands at the first or second blow  but his master who understood a staff somewhat better than edward took all his blows upon his cane and returned them so warmly that at last edward cried quarter no no edward said his master no quarter fight or run is the word and so followed him with his blows very thick well edward was stout too and he could not run but defended himself again a little while and then cried quarter again no edward says his master no quarter i tell you and laid furiously at him so that he broke his head in two or three places edward seeing the blood come was rather enraged than daunted and said aloud and in a kind of fury what do you intend to murder me no no edward says his master a broken head will not kill you fight or run edward that is the bargain you know and still they laid on aboth sides you may kill me if you please says edward i will never run for the stoutest man alive though i die upon the spot and with that he flung himself off of his horse  for the first of the fight was on horseback and comes up to his master in a rage and almost unhorsd him but his master spurring his horse sprung from him a little and throwing himself off from his horse also came at him onfoot too edward seeing that strove to closein with his master but could not easily do it yet after some time he got within his blows and boldly collard him but his master being a strong man disengaged himself and struck up his heels now edward says his master the fights over i am no more fighting with thee as thy equal but now as thy master i must correct thee for thy impudence upon which he cand him heartily and very severely and the next day sent him to the house of correction where he was soundly lashed then sent him his wages and dismissed him his service  here was a specimen of an english servant who had not his master been one of the bravest and stoutest gentlemen in the kingdom edward had triumphed over him for edward was really a bold daring resolute fellow as the whole encounter testifies  when you read this story you will blame the gentleman perhaps for engaging thus voluntier with his servant especially at such weapons too that many a course brawny fellow may be an overmatch for a gentleman that he ought to have concealed his resentment till he had brought him home and then have sent him to the house of correction as he did afterward or that at first instead of caning him he should have run him through and sent him to the devil for a better master  but several things alter the case first as for killing servants for their insolence that will not do in england at all neither would it be well if it were lawful for many reasons the constitution of england refers all justice of that kind to the laws and it would have brought the master into a labyrinth of trouble besides the crime of it  it is true the master levelled himself too much and as a neighboring gentleman afterward told him it was a kind of excess of gallantry to measure his staff with his footman who eat his bread and wore his livery but as he scorned to be threatned with the battoon of a scoundrel and on the otherhand knew his own ability to deal with him it was a kind of sport to him at first though as he told me in relating the story for i had it from his own mouth he did not think he should have had his hands so full with him as he had  again as to killing him or running him through you are to observe that our english gentlemen when they are a hunting do not ride with swords or firearms as you do in france but with a single white belt about them and a long whip which they call a huntingwhip in their hands and it was by mere accident that this gentleman had a good cane in his hand for edward had a strong oaken plant as they call it here which is a very good weapon in the hand of a stout fellow as edward was  but this is by the by the case was as above and edward was handsomely cand as he deserved and was very coursly used too afterward as i told you at the house of correction whither his master sent him for as his master was in commission of the peace he was capable of committing him to the house of correction without another magistrate  but i have not quite done with edward yet for he went about the country raving afterward at his master reporting that he had beaten him unmercifully with  any provocation or fault that he would have murdered him if he had not at  been forced to resist him and that now  had sent him to the house of correction because he could not have his will of him  this grew into a clamor about the try and it came to that height that some  the fellow servants began to talk roundly about it one said he would not be used so by any master in england and that as they knew edward to be a stout fellow they said he was able to have defended himself and he was a fool he did not and in short they carried it so far that they began to be saucy and to insult the gentleman as he went about the country once in particular as he was riding on horseback through a little village not far from the place where he lived there happened to be a gang of footmen and gentlemens gardeners and such fellows at an alehouse door and they began to flout him and throw out their saucy jests at him and one called out to his man you ralphson that it seems was the fellows name have a care you will have a drubbing next time it may be the gentleman took no notice of it at all only as he was riding before on a pretty full trot he checked his pace a little upon it and went sostly to hear what else they said and as they were far from being modest in their speech one of them calls out to another who stood over the way jack would you have been served so jack jack answered no not i and swore to it by his maker the first returned no damn him nor i i would i had been in edwards place jack i would have shown him the difference of it and then added the usual oath b  g  i would not have stood still to be murdered i would have let him known servants are not dogs there is never a gentleman in england should have used me so ay says a third edward was a fool everybody knows edward is as stout a fellow as any in all the country and was able to have dealt with him ay with two such as he says the other but edwards a modest fellow and was loath because it was his master loath says the other if it had been the best master that ever wore a head i would not have took it of him i would it had been my lot he should have repented abusing a servant as long as he lived g  damn him  the gentleman stopped his horse short at this fellows words but did not turn about or look behind him nor did the fellow baulk his language for his being heard but the gentleman i say stopping a little and calling his servant up to him whose servant is that says he his man told him sir edward w  s very well says his master and whose servant is jack pray and his man told him whose man he was also  one of the gang while the gentleman called his man up to him calls out to the first and with the usual oath damn me he knows you tom says he he asks his man if you are not sir edward w  s coachman know me says he damn me let him know me anybody may know me i am sir edward w  s coachman i ant ashamed of my self damn me my masters a very honest gentleman damn me if i had such a master as he i would overthrow him the first time i drove him over chalkhill and break his neck b  g  he should murder no more servants i warrant him  all this was so loud and with so much insolence that as my friend told me he had a great deal to do to restrain his passion but he considered that they were all footmen and gardeners and such fellows servants among the neighboring gentlemen and that he might have better sport with them as he called it another way also it came into his head that this very fellow as saucy as he was ought to have justice done him for that it was certain by his way of talking that edward or somebody for him had told a pack of horrid lies to this fellow and that the story had not been handed about as it ought to be told so he went off and rode immediately to the gentlemans house whose servant had treated him thus and finding him at home tells him the whole story what his coachman had said of him and the manner of it then desiring a pen and ink and paper he set it all down in writing and called in his own servant who sir edward examined upon oath for they were both justices to the particulars and the servant both remembering the words exactly and knowing the fellows made oath to the substance of it all his examination agreeing exactly with his masters narration of the fact  when he had done thus he added and now sir edward you must give me leave to observe to you that i am satisfied your coachman and all the rest of them have one thing to be said in their favor namely that they have edwards story wrong and that they understand i struck and cand my man either without cause or without a sufficient cause and that i would have murdered him and the like for i have been told the fellow does make out his story in such a manner being ashamed to tell the whole truth of it so that i find i am obliged by these gentlemen servitors to tell the truth and make the story public that i may not pass for such a master as your coachman thinks me to be pray therefore give me leave to let you into the short history of the affair between my man edward and i  with all my heart says sir edward for i have been told the story a great many ways already and perhaps none of them right upon this the gentleman tells him the whole story in the manner as i have related it above  well sir says sir edward upon my word you have but given him part of his due though indeed you acted a kind of excess of gallantry to measure your staff with a footman who eat your bread i assure you edward would have been too hard for me if i had done so but after all added sir edward what had my rogue to do with it i assure you i shall take him to task for it another way no sir says my friend if your servant could but be found i would first be glad to hear in what manner he has been informed of the story for if as i say he he has been misinformed of the thing and that by edward himself then he is not so much to blame and i must take care to prevent edwards telling his tale any more or i shall be mobd by all the gentlemens servants in the country  truly sir says sir edward i think we and all the gentlemen in the country are mobd by our servants already but i promise you sir i will take care to do you justice upon my servant he shall insult you no more upon this he called another servant and sent him out to look for thomas the coachman  thomas had suspected that the gentleman was gone to his masters and watched him and supposing he should be sent for took care that when his fellow servant came for him he should lie for him and carry back word that he could not be found for that servants will always lie for one another is no new thing here but as soon as ever he understood esquire c  was gone home he comes and takes care though at a distance that his master should see him rather before anybody should tell him he was come that he might rather seem to offer himself than be called  as soon as his master saw him he in a manner that might let the fellow see he was angry called to him come hither mister i must speak with you a little on the other hand thomas to let his master see a little that he intended to be saucy answered very loud yes sir and so comes on when he was come what is the meaning sir says sir edward that you behave so that gentlemen are obliged to come to me and complain of your abusing them on the highway  sir says thomas i abuse nobody says sir edward yes you have abused an honest gentleman and one that all the county knows to be so and you have abused him in such a manner as no villain but your self could have the impudence to do and as no servant of mine shall be suffered to do i assure you  as you please sir for that says thomas i know who you mean sir esquire c  has been here i suppose and made his complaint i wish i had been at home you should have heard me say all that i said of him to his face i do not think any servant ought to be civil to him  what mean you by that sir sayr sir edward i assure you it was well for you then that you was not here for if you had said that to his face and in my house too sir that you have said behind his back i assure you i would have sent you to the house of correction my self you begin very saucily methinks what a master have i been to you that you should give me such an answer  to the house of correction sir says thomas with a kind of a grin and for esquire c  i never was sent to the house of correction yet nor never threatned with it before and i have done nothing to deserve it now sir if you dont like my service sir you may please to provide your self i will not be sent to the house of correction for talking to such a man as esquire c   very well sir says sir edward i will take your warning but that is not to the purpose i must still have satisfaction from you sir about your abusing a very honest gentleman for i will have the story out to the bottom  a gentleman sir he is no gentleman says thomas he does not deserve the name of a gentleman and i will affront him as often as ever i see him let it be where it will though it was in the very church and so will all the gentlemens servants in this county  say you so sir says sir edward then i perceive there is a combination among you is there to abuse this gentleman i assure you sir he is a match for you all and he may chance to bring some of you to the gallows if you go on  thomas replies he a match for us all i wish i had been in edwards place i would have let him see that servants are not dogs nor to be murdered every time a master pleases to be in a passion for nothing  yes i suppose says sir edward you would have used me as that villain offered to use his master would you i assure you sir if you had offered it or threatned it as he did i would not have given you the favor of a bastinado i would have shot you through the head or the best dog of you that ever wore a livery  then i think it is time any man should quit such a master if you should tell servants so beforehand sir says thomas impudently nobody will take your livery well that is not the question with you sir says sir edward but since you have not only abused a gentleman who you know is your masters friend and given him impudent language but threaten to do the like and acknowledge a combination among you and other gentlemans servants to be saucy to this gentleman hereafter i must enquire farther into it this is a dangerous business servants are come to a height i find that in a little time they will tell their masters what they shall or shall not say to them i will have none of the society in my service i assure you  well sir says thomas i am ready to quit your service then for i will be at liberty to speak my mind to esquire c  i said nothing of you sir that are my master and as for him i value him not if i must give an account to you sir i shall fetch you my livery sir i hope i do you no injury sir in leaving your service  no no not at all thomas says sir edward calmly bring your clothes and give them the steward and take your wages it is time to be rid of such servants  away went thomas hot and fiery and saucy enough even to his master too as you may see i say away he went to fetch his livery in the mean time sir edward sent not a servant for they seemed to be all in the quarrel so that he would not trust them but one of his sons to fetch the constable and ordered him not to meddle with thomas till they were quite parted till he had his wages and left his livery and every thing and that then he should take him just as he was without the door going away and bring him in again and for this he gave him his warrant as a justice of the peace  when the fellow had brought down his livery and delivered up his charge as coachman to the steward the steward came in to let sir edward know it and asked if he should pay him his wages and dismiss him or whether he would see him again sir edward said no no prithee dont let me be troubled any more with his sauciness i shall but be provoked perhaps to use him as he deserves in the meantime it was easy for sir edward to see that even the steward himself seemed to be of thomass side and think he had hard measure to be questioned for affronting such a man as esquire c   however sir edward who had all his measures ready and his son with the constable attending without the outer gate waited to see the issue and thomas was dismissed when he had his wages and all was over thomas wanted to see his master no says the steward my master says he has nothing to say any more to you and will not be disturbed at this he began to be very rude and loud and he would see sir edward he was not his master now he said but he wanted to speak with him and other servants seeing him rude desired him to be easy and go about his business but he would not stir and swore and hectored that he would speak with sir edward he did not then call him his master but sir edward that he had business with him and would speak with him the steward said sir edward was busy and would not be disturbed well it would not do a great while he told the steward he answered for sir edward without his order if he would go to sir edward and tell him he desired to speak with him and he refused him then he knew what he had to do but he would not take an answer from him  why says the steward if i do perhaps you will not take the answer from me then any more than you will now yes he said if he came back and told him upon his word what answer sir edward gave he would be satisfied so the steward went in to his master and sir edward who had heard all that passed stood at the door of his parlour and calling aloud but calmly to his steward that thomas might hear bade him tell thomas that if he would be quiet and not be saucy he would speak with him again in an hour and so he might come again in that time so thomas went away  as soon as he was out of the outer gate the constable meets him and takes him up telling him it was on the complaint of esquire c  and that he must go in again the steward who was not parted from him and was secretly his friend but angry that he had been so rude to his own master said to him you need not have been in such haste i see to speak with my master i find you are like to see him sooner than he proposed to you  thomas gave him little answer but the constable showing his warrant asked for sir edward and they were ordered to come in  when they were called in the constable who had been furnished with the information sworn to by esquire c  s man and with the account given by esquire c  in writing presented them both to sir edward as justice of the peace and told him there was esquire c  s servant at the door to justify all he had said so sir edward and his late servant after reading the paper had the following short dialogue  sir edward well thomas i find i am to be troubled with you again sooner than i intended you hear what mr c  s servant has deposed what do you say to it   thomas say to it sir what would you have me say to it sir the fellow is a rascal and a villain to come with such a story here and his master i think is little better all the country knows the story as well as i and there is not a gentlemans servant round but would have said as much as i did he must expect it where ever he goes   sir edw thou art very hot thomas and a little impudent to me too to answer in this manner i have nothing to do with the rest but my business is with you at present and you had best not be so saucy i advise you to it   tho i was born saucy sir i cannot help it   sir edw i have known many a child be cured of distempers they were born with and i think you might have been cured of it by this time you are old enough   tho that may be sir but i shall never be cured of it but that is nothing to the case before your worship what am i brought here for   sir edw as to that thomas i thought to have talked with you upon it indeed if you had been able to behave as become you but i must take another course with you first i will try if i cannot cure you of being saucy first that distemper which you say you were born with here constable do you secure this fellow till i make his mittimus i must send him to a doctor to be cured   tho what you please sir if you show me the way into a prison sir i will find the way out again i can find bail   sir edw i shall not meddle with that thomas you may bring your habeas corpus if you please but i will make you take a little physic first  to the constable here mr constable carry him to the house of correction and bring him before me again to morrow morning   tho what do you mean by that sir i go to the house of correction for what sir   sir edw for your want of manners thomas   tho why want of manners pray your worship is not my master now   sir edw no thomas i do not talk of your sauciness to me while i was your master i could have taken that better as you see i did an hour or two ago but as i am a magistrate and in the commission of the peace and bear the kings authority i am bound to maintain it and not see a justice of the peace insulted by an impudent fellow as you are when he comes before him in a way of justice   tho you cannot send me to the house of correction for any thing i have said now   sir edw if i do anything illegal i will answer it to the law but what i have done i will stand to constable do you do your duty   and then sir edward went into another room as he was going into the next room some of the servants spoke to thomas to beg sir edwards pardon you know your master thomas said one of them had always a respect for you dont provoke him damn me sir says thomas i will ask pardon of no man upon earth what have i done to ask pardon i will not ask pardon by  and swore so loud that his master heard him upon which sir edward returned immediately into the room hold goodman waters says sir edward  meaning the constable i think i heard him swear here thomas says he you must pay for swearing  tho i will pay nothing not i   sir edw well well you may refuse to pay indeed but then you must sit in the stocks thomas you know that law go goodman waters says sir edward put him in the stocks first a little   thomas raged and grumbled out a good many oaths more but the justice not hearing it that passed over and thomas was carried to the stocks  while he sat in the stocks all the footmen round about that were near enough came to visit him and there they sat an alehouse being just by and chairs brought out for them and there was a consultation of rogues cursing their masters and abusing esquire c  calling him all the scoundrels and rascals that they could think of and here they treated thomas and on drank to him and another drank to him till thomas was so drunk that when he had fulfilled his penance that is to say an hour in the stocks he was in no condition to walk to the house of correction but if they would have him there they must get a cart to carry him  the justice who had some spies among them and particularly some to take an account of their swearing found there was an absolute necessity to put a stop to this newfashiond behavior of the servants so he sends to goodman waters the constable to leave thomas well guarded in the stocks and to come to him which he did and he gave him a warrant to take some assistance and bring away five fellows whose names he wrote down and against whom he had taken information for swearing four of these five were gentlemens servants in the neighborhood and the fifth a farmers son one of sir edwards own tennants in the village the four servants were obliged to pay three or four or five shillings each for swearing and two of them who were very ungovernable sir edward ordered to be carried home to their own masters where one of them behaved so impudently to his master that he was obliged to send him to bridewell too and he got there before thomas the other had his livery stripped off his back by his master and he came back hallowing through the town to the place where they all were and got as drunk as thomas but some of the neighbors kindly got him to bed out of the way or else he had been set in the stocks too  all this made a great hubbub in the town and two or three honest men inhabitants of the place came to sir edward and begged for thomas that he might not go to the house of correction that night offering that they would be security for him that he should come and beg pardon for his behavior the next morning but sir edward was positive that he should go only whereas his order was in his mittimus that he should have the correction of the house that night he sent a note to the keeper of the prison that he should defer that part till the next day and ordered the neighbors who had interceeded with him to come to him in the morning  next morning thomas was not quite so outrageous as he was overnight but he would not submit to come and beg pardon till he saw a fresh order from sir edward and three justices more intimating that he should not be corrected in the house but should be carried to the whippingpost in the town and should be publicly lashed there unless he submitted himself before such a time this and the importunity of his friends humbled him a little and indeed it was but a little for matters did not end here  while this was doing and before thomas had his liberty and well it was for him that he had not his liberty at that time i say while this was doing a gang of about fourteen or fifteen of the gentlemens servants and young fellows in the neighborhood swearing to one another that they would be secret disguised themselves and going to mr c  s the gentleman who had bastinadod his man edward resolved to insult him if they could come at him the first thing they did they met with his parkkeeper but he a stout fellow and as it happened having a long keepers staff in his hand armed at both ends was aware of them indeed the parkkeeper seeing them disguised for their faces were smeared over with soot and grease some of them had great whiskers made upon their lips others had false beards and the like i say he took them for deerstealers come to rob his masters park and talking with them at a distance would not let one of them come in with him at length one of them running in to him by main force had collard him but was immediately fastened upon by the keepers dog which made him quit the keeper but to deliver him another came up and the keeper to rescue his dog knocked him down however the rest coming in the keeper seeing so many was forced to fly and called off his dog who would else have been killed  during this skirmish the rest went up to the gentlemans house and two of them asking for sam as they called him which was the servant who was with his master when thomas bullied him in the town they told him they would speak with him so the fellow innocently walked out with them when immediately they asked him if he had not been before the justice and sworn to the words that thomas said and the like the fellow said yes he did but pleaded that it was sore against his will but that his master carried him to sir edward  and there they made him do it between them and begged heartily for his life at first for he believed they intended to murder him  well they told him they would make an example of him to all rogues that should betray any servant to be ill used and upon this they dragged him to a pond in the park where they duckd him and dragged him toandagain in it till they had almost drowned him then took him and tossed him in a blanket then tying his hands behind him and a halter about his neck so tied that he could not untie it with the long end hanging down behind upon his back in this plight they sent him home and bade him tell his master that they would serve him just in the same manner the first time they could come at him and that there was fifty of them had sworn to do it for the sake of his man edward  they also made the fellow swear that he would not fail to tell his master all they said but that they need not have done for poor sam told his tale as soon as ever he came home that his master might not come to any mischief  by this time the keeper was come home too but first he had been raising the parish to look for deerstealers and was got ten or twelve strong having picked up a warrener or two and their servants and a gentlemans huntsman and several others enough to have given these fellows their due if he had met with them but as their goodluck guided them the keeper watching for them among the thickets and cover of the park where such people as he took them to be might be expected and their business being not among the deer i say as their goodluck guided them the keeper missed them and came home just as sam was come in and had told his pitiful story  their master with two or three neighboring gentlemen with him was at home taking a hearty bottle as they call it all this while and knew nothing of the matter but when the poor halfdrownd fellow came in the noise was too great in the house for the master to be long ignorant of it and immediately he caused the poor young man to come into the parlour and tell his story to all the gentlemen  no sooner had he told his tale but the keeper came in and told his story also and the house was all in a hubbub every one got up and the gentleman lending his friends firearms and the keepers men horses they all mounted and went in pursuit of them but it was to no purpose for they knew well enough they should be pursued so they made all clear off by contrary ways got water and washed their faces and dropped one by one to their masters houses and nobody was missed for they were not long about their work and not the least news could be heard of them but to return to thomas  thomas drunk and incapable of knowing any thing of what had befallen him the night before waked you may suppose in the morning in a kind of course lodging in the house of correction and had soon his friends about him as above who letting him know his circumstance and how the justice his late master had had the goodness to spare him the last night at their request and that they had been bound for him that he should ask him pardon for the rudeness of his behavior they also let him know that he was quite in the wrong to behave as he did to sir edward who had been a good master to him and that he might stand in need enough of his friendship still in the other case for that not esquire c  only but almost all the gentlemen in the country were resolved to enquire fully into the affair and to go to the bottom of it for that they found they should none of them dare to reprove a servant or to be safe if they gave them but an ill word and then they told him the story of the fellows management at esquire c  s house and assured him there would very soon be a publication from all the bench of justices with a reward of an hundred pound to any one or two of the gang to discover the rest  thomas was prevailed upon by all these demonstrances to ask his master sir edward pardon for his rudeness the night before and the neighbors had petitioned sir edward to accept it and so thomas was ordered to be brought up by the keeper in the afternoon  but in the mean time for the searching farther into the combination of servants which it was apparent by thomass words was made among them there was about five or six gentlemen more assembled at sir edwards all justices of the peace to take this fellows examination when he was brought in he kneeled down very submissively to sir edward to beg his pardon for his rudeness to him and sir edward forgave him and so the fellow thought to have been dismissed but he was thunderstrook when he was told by one of the other justices in a solemn manner that though his master sir edward had been so good as to forgive him for what he had done to offend him and that part was over yet that they were assembled there to enquire into his abusive carriage to such a gentleman naming the person and the rather because he had intimated a conspiracy or combination of the other servants in the country about to join in their insulting that gentleman and had personaliy threatened him in his discourse as the gentleman was riding through the town and they said they must know the meaning of these things before they quitted him and the rather because this combination had appeared to be real by what had happened since at which they repeated what had happened the night before at esquire c  s house and told him he would do well to make a timely discovery of the thing if he knew any thing of it otherwise they must take such a course with him as should be judged proper as well to detect the confederacy it self as to punish him for his misusing a gentleman who had offered him no injury and was peaceably going along the kings highway thomas was a bold fellow and withal very full of tongue spoke much but pretty well too only very apt to be fancy had lived with several persons of quality and been coachman to a duke or two and valued himself very much upon it so when he began his tale he told them that he had lived with such and such lords and dukes and that he had driven a coach and six so many years and that he had never been used thus by any master in his life that he was but a poor fellow twas true and they took advantage of his being heated with talking of that gentleman etc  here the justice that spoke before interrupted him and told him this was all nothing to the purpose if he had served such noble persons as he said he ought to have learnt better manners in their service that every gentleman that pays a servant wages has a right not to the service only but the respect due from such servant to him that employs him but that however as to his sauciness to his master that was not the question but he was sent to prison for his rudeness to sir edward not as his master for he was not then his master but as a magistrate but even as a magistrate upon his submission he was forgiven which he ought to be very thankful for but he was questioned then upon the information of esquire c  confirmed upon oath by his servant for insulting him on the highway and threatening him not personally only but also with a combination of other fellows against him which had in part appeared to be a reality by what had happened as above  thomas made a long harangue again upon his having served so many gentlemen etc as above but was bid let that alone as nothing to the purpose and speak to the point he said he knew not what point they meant they answered his insulting mr c  etc he said he did not understand how that lay before them that what he had said of mr c  was true that he had abused an honest fellow that was his servant in such a manner that he thought no servant could owe him any respect and that all servants were so far concerned in that usage as that they could not help telling him of it wherever they met with him and that he might thank himself for that servants were not hired to be used like dogs or to be murdered upon every time their master was pleased to be mad and what he had said he believed was no more than he ought to have said and he should not be afraid to say it again and thus he run on a little like what he had said in mr c  s hearing only with a little more respect and added that it was true that he said he wished he had been in edwards place he should not have served him so and he hoped he might say so again  why what would you have done says one of the justices why sir says he before i would have been beaten so like a dog i would have defended myself ay says one of the justices and have murdered your master it may be if you could  i would have killed any man in the world says he rather than he should have killed me the poor fellow is not murdered indeed that is he is not dead yet but he may be soon he was beaten so unmercifully that he is in the surgeons hands and nobody knows whether he will live or die i think it is time poor servants should speak when it is come to this  well thomas and what was all this for pray says the justice was there no provocation given no says thomas none that required such usage he happened to override one of the hounds in their sport and that was not with design neither the fellow loved the dogs as well as his master did and would not have done it if he could have helped it  well thomas and you think this was the occasion of it all do you says the justice think so sir says thomas i know it for i had it from his own mouth  pray sir edward says one of the justices be pleased to let the whole case be read at large not for thomass satisfaction for he does not deserve it but for the satisfaction of all the people here for i see half the town are come about us to hear the cause and they are all it seems imposed upon as well as he so sir edward caused one of his clerks to read the account that esquire c  had given under his hand of the whole combat at large in the manner i have given it you above  at the reading this story there was a general murmur among the people in the hall where they stood to hear the cause one said he was a rogue another a villain another said he had not half his reward that is to say meaning edward some said they never heard such a story in their lives others said he deserved to be hanged and in short everybody said the story was told quite another way all over the town and that they had been abused in the relation of it  but thomas cried out it was all false not a word of it true  the justices bid him have a care what he said for this was the account the gentleman gave himself and that he was ready to make oath of it however they told him that as he had boasted that if he was sent to prison he knew the way out again and that he could get bail they told him they thought the least thing they could do was to bind him over to the next quarter sessions and in the mean time to require sureties of him for his good behavior and so they left him with the keeper to detain him till all this was done  it was near a week before thomas could get security but at last he did and got his liberty but as soon as the story came abroad and how it had really been all people cried shame of the footmen and the first thing to be heard of in order to a further discovery of things was that about eight footmen in several gentlemens families were run away any one might conclude they were thoroughly frighted with thomass story besides when it was known that so many were gone it was easy to know what they were guilty of as for thomas his fate is not determined yet  there is a great deal more in the history of this affair but it is not significant enough to trouble you with you will see through every part of what i have written an air of uncommon insolence upon the conduct of servants all the country round and that is the reason of my giving you this account before i dismiss this subject i must observe to you that this insolent behavior is not among the false and thievish servants such we may always expect to be impudent but this is the conduct of the honest part of servants at least those we call honest i could give you an account of servants robbing ay and murdering their masters and those now more than ever but among such nothing is to be wondered at and such are in all nations as well as here but i confine my self to the point in hand namely the insolent unsufferable conduct of servants that is to say of those that call themselves honest and value themselves upon being so  nor is it every servant that will fight his master as edward did because it is not every servant that dares do it but i must also add that there is not one servant in twenty now that will take a blow from a master but with their tongues will insult them at that rate that it is very hard for any gentleman to bear it nor do i wonder at any thing more than that there are not ten servants for one killed by their masters the treatment which masters receive from them being now such as indeed it is very hard for any temper to submit to i shall give you some instances of this kind in my next letter  letter vii dear brother my last gave you a kind of tragicomedy between a friend of mine and his man edward i shall fill up my account with some of every kind that offers  i must acknowledge to you that it is not the easiest thing in the world for a gentleman to bear the saucy language of a servant on any account whatever and there are some actions of servants that a master cannot but resent and reprove them for when they upon these just reproofs return impudent ungrateful language and insulting behavior as is the very case i am upon it is not every temper that in such provoking cases can restrain it self and this has been the occasion of sending many a servant to the devil before their time and as killing a servant is not in england so light a matter as it is in france especially killing a servant in a passion or in drink so some gentlemen who have had the misfortune to push their resentments a little farther than they ought have been put to great distresses and some have been quite ruined on that account and this brings to my mind a story which also happened within the reach of my own knowledge  there happened in a country town within about eleven miles of london a very odd passage of a servant and a master which ended more tragical than that in my last the gentleman was a colonel in the militia and of a very good estate and had only two daughters his eldest daughter a fine beautiful lady and very well bred was said to be in love with somebody but it could never be found out who it was with she was so unsuspected by her father as to her virtue that there was no need to keep any watch over her she often took the coach or the chariot with her sister to go to london or any where else and sometimes without her but always came home in good time and if her father asked her at any time where she had been been she would say she only took a turn out upon the forest or upon such a heath or such a way for the air which was an answer satisfying enough and sometimes without the least suspicion in his head he would ask the coachman which way he drove or how far and he would give him the like answer  this passed for a great while till it was observed at last that she took the chariot out for airing without her sister or anybody else with her oftener than usual and her father who had heard a rumor that his daughter had an amor with somebody began to suspect upon this suspicion one evening he examined the coachman in a friendly obliging manner whether anybody met his daughter upon those airings and ridings out the fellow with a saucy fleer at him said no and laughed this moved him a little and he called him saucy fellow or something to that purpose why sir do you think says the coachman that if my young mistress had any loveintrigue with anybody and trusted me to carry her i would betray her and tell you of it  very well sir says the colonel then you may say you will be faithful to my daughter but you could not boast of much honesty to your master it is no matter for that sir says be i never betray my trust yes sir says the colonel you do in that very thing for as you are my servant when you carry her abroad it is i trust my daughter in your hands i think nothing of that says the fellow it is the lady trusts me with herself and that is more than you trust me with  well well if that be your principle says the colonel then i shall trust you no more with her and you shall carry her out no more however it happened that about a week after or thereabout the young lady called her coachman her father being from home and rode out as usual the colonel coming home while they were abroad and hearing of it never lighted off his horse but rode about to see if he could meet her any where and discover any thing  it was his misfortune to ride round and round the country a great way but not to meet with them but being just come back so near as that he was within sight of his own door if it had been daylight he heard the coach stop just before him upon this he stopped and got off of his horse and hanging his bridle to another door stepped forward on the other side it being very dark believing he should see some spark or other come home with his daughter to bring her to the door and he was the more confirmed in his expectation when he saw the coach stop a little short of the door  but judge what rage what horror must take hold of his soul when he saw the coachman after opening the coachdoor to his daughter take her out of the coach in his arms and holding her in his arms a good while kiss her several times and she on the otherhand throwing one of her arms about his neck give him leave to do it as long as he would  blame not the gentleman if he had not patience enough to restrain his passion at this killing sight but he run in upon them unhand her villain said he to the coachman or i will this minute send you to the devil the fellow surpised you may suppose set her down but gave his master the most impudent language imaginable and which the gentleman not able to take gave him a large cut over the face with his sword i will mark thee now says he for a dog that i may know thee again to morrow  the fellow cried murder at first but immediately flying back gave his master two or three lashes with his whip and was coming at him in a rage with the thick end of it when the frighted lady having rung the bell other servants came and opened the door and the master stepped in which put an end to the fray for that time  then the gentleman came to the door again and pulled in his daughter come mistress says he come you in i will take care of you whatever i do with him the lady was terribly frighted to be sure however the fellow drove the coach round into the stableyard and having put up the horses sent one of the servants in to tell his master he desired he might send for a surgeon his master sent word he might go to a surgeons if he would for he should sleep no more in his house he sent word again very sawcily he would not stir in that condition and at that time of night but that in the morning he would let him know more of his mind  however the gentleman was persuaded to let him stay that night his lodgingroom being over the coachhouse and so not within the dwelling house and locking up his daughter in her chamber he sat up himself to see that no mischief might happen in the dead of the night he heard some noise in the yard and putting himself in a posture to hear as much as he could of it and not to be discovered he heard his daughter calling out at a little window to the coachman to ask him how he did and telling him she would find some way or other to come out the next day to him for all this with some other little tendernesses between them which however served to inform him how things were he restrained his passion and did not discover himself at all but took care of her chamber door and that she should not get out of the window  the next morning he called his coachman to him paid him his wages and dismissed him the coachman said nothing to him but looked and behaved surlily till he was paid and was going away as he thought when he turned short upon him and told him saucily he hoped he would give him some satisfaction for cutting him on the face his master answered he ought to be thankful to him he had not cut his throat  for what says the coachman  for your impudence says the master  the coachman said something very rude upon that about his daughter intimating that though he was but a poor servant now yet he was a gentleman born and of as good a family as he meaning his master and twas no dishonor to his daughter to engage with him for sir says he i have as good blood in my veins as yourself with some other language which the colonel could not bear upon which he took his sword in his hand which lay on the table and opening the door said with a little smile then sir if you dont immediately get out of my house i will let some of your gentlemanly blood out for you and that presently too  sir says the coachman i am none of your servant now but as good a man as your self this provoked the colonel farther and he rose up though in his gown and slippers and thrust the villain out of his door and kicked him down the steps  when the fellow was out he faced him again sir says he go tell your daughter you owe your life to her and were it not for her sake i would trample you under my feet this moment  the colonel was not a match for the brute perhaps at his fist though in courage infinitely superior but flies into his parlour for his sword and comes instantly out to him again but he was gone a little way from the door he called after him but he answered he would go but a little way farther and wait on him again by and by  about two hours after the fellow comes again dressed up very genteely and a sword by his side and two fellows with him  when his master saw them he called one of his servants and bade him go to the stable and fetch him two pitchforks for says he i will deal with this dog in his own way accordingly the servant brought them and he bade him and his fellow servants keep in the next room with them and not show themselves unless he called them  when this was done he bade a maidservant go and desire the two men that were with the coachman to walk in and bid the coachman stay without  when they were come in he treated them very courteously and asked them if they had any particular business with him they answered very civily too that their business was only this that william his coachman had desired them to come with him that he had been wounded by him the evening before in his passion and that he was afraid he might be in danger again and that he desired them to come with him to prevent any mischief  pray gentlemen says the colonel did he acquaint you with the reason of my being so provoked they answered no only that he had said it was without any provocation at all  it is the only obliging thing says the colonel that william could do but depend upon it gentlemen i could never be guilty of using a servant so hardly as cutting him over the face if i had not had the greatest provocation in the world  as to that they said they knew nothing of it and if they had they would not have appeared in it for they would not countenance any servant in abusing his master  well but pray gentlemen says he what need is there to bring you to guard him now he is out of my service and has no business with me if he does not come in my reach i can do him no hurt and my best advice to him is to keep out of my way  but sir says one of the men he says his business now was to see what satisfaction you will give him for wounding him  says the colonel my answer to that is plain what the law will give him i will submit to i shall give him no more satisfaction i suppose he does not come to to challenge me if he thinks he has not merited much more than i gave him i leave him to take any course he pleases pray what satisfaction does he demand says the colonel have you any thing to offer in his name i am ready to answer as becomes me in any case says he and if he had been a gentleman and indeed any thing but my own servant i knew what answer to make  nb here the colonel began to imagine a challenge but they had not any instructions they said not foreseeing they should speak with him first or alone  well then gentlemen says he tell him from me i have no business with him and i think he has none with me if he keeps away from my house he has nothing to fear from me and so needs no guard and with this he dismissed them  when they were gone he perceived that when they came to the door where the coachman waited and gave an account to him of the discourse they had with his master he appeared very uneasy that he came from them twice in a kind of a passion toward the door but that they called him back again but however he came on the third time and the colonel observed that when he came from them the third time they shook their heads and went away as if they had said if you will go we will have nothing to do with you however he came to the gate and knocked or rung very hard the colonel who had seen him ordered his servants not to open the gate but let him knock or ring awhile at length he ordered one of his men to go out at the backdoor and come round and stand in a place in the yard which was on one side of the house where he might speak to him out at window and where the fellow at the gate might see him too  when the servant was come to the place his master called to him aloud john what does that fellow want that rings at the gate there john answered it is william sir well says his master i know that what would he have the coachman answered i would speak with you sir the colonel answered nothing to him upon which john the servant said he says he would speak with you sir tell him says his master i have nothing to say to him bid him go about his business  well william would not stir but called to his master aloud though you have nothing to say to me you may bear what i have to say to you i tell thee fellow says the colonel i have no business with thee and will have none with thee  then he desired he might be admitted to speak with his daughter that he rejected with indignation and in some harsh terms why says william i desire but to speak with her at the window and in your hearing i am not ashamed you should hear what i have to say to her  but she ought to be ashamed to speak to you says the colonel or hear you speak to her and much more that i should hear it besides i have removed her out of your reach so you may go about your business  remove her where you will says william i will speak with her do your worst and have her too if you have not murdered her  how it came to pass that the daughter got so much liberty he could not tell but in the middle of all this discourse she got to a window on the side of the house and called aloud to william and giving the lie to her father as it were told him she was not removed nor would not be removed but she would find a way quickly to come out or to that effect and william answered her in such terms as made her father fear they were married  this was very provoking to her father you may be sure to have his daughter give him the lie in that manner as she did and extorted some rash words from him to the fellow and he as much inflamed returned him very scurrilous language in so many words and bade him come out into the yard if he was not afraid to show his face to an honest man  the colonel a man of spirit ran to his closet took a fusee in his hand that was loaded with a brace of bullets which he always kept so loaded in case of thieves and boldly opened the door but the fellow who was without the gate seeing the gun in his hand upbraided him with cowardice in bringing out firearms to a naked man but moving off desired him to have patience and he would wait upon him again in a condition fit to talk with him notwithstanding his gun so in a quarter of an hour he returned with a fusee in his hand also  but by this time the neighbors alarmed by some of the colonels servants interposed and the fray was ended for that time without mischief it is not material to the present purpose how the gentleman and his daughter managed he would have sent her into the country but the girl would not go he knew not well where to put her but that if she had a mind to be miserable and take the fellow she might find means to do it so he thought it fafest to keep her in his own house where he thought his anthority might prevent her designs and his reasoning might in time prevail with her to alter her mind  but about five days after the fellow having found means by flashing of gun powder and other tokens agreed between them to let her know that he was ready and she having found means to give him notice of her resolution she let herself down from the third story in the night and he with two more stood ready to carry her off at the bottom  she was safe at the bottom and had just set her foot upon the ground when the colonel hearing or suspecting some noise started up run to the window with his gun in his hand and having just light enough to see his daughter putting herself into the arms of his coachman shot him dead upon the spot  the lady frighted almost to death fell flat upon the ground and the father believing he had killed his own daughter was for awhile in a dreadful agony and run out to bring her in but was better satisfied when he found she was only frighted it cost the poor gentleman a greatdeal of trouble and affliction afterward and in a manner ruined the family for the laws here are very nice in such cases where there appeared a former quarrel but all this had its beginning in the insolence of the servant and so far is to the purpose i am writing about the rest of the story being too long to trouble you with now  nb you may note that on the trial it was effectually proved   that at one aclock in the morning or thereabouts three men were seen in his yard   that he saw them carrying off his daughter which was necessarily construed to be a robbery   but suppose not it was allowed to be an unseasonable time of night and that the gentleman not going out of his house had a right to defend his house which he had reason to believe was in danger to be robbed   that he called out several times who is there but was answered by one of them not the coachman nobody at which he gave notice that he would fire and bade them stand off at their peril all which particulars were it seems effectually proved in his favor   however it was very unhappy to the father and afflicted him all his days to the last degree for the blood of a man though a villain in what he did is very grievous to a mind sensible of the world and of the nature of killing a fellow creature however faulty  this story i tell you in confirmation of what i have said namely that the provocations given by servants in this country are such that it is next to impossible that any gentleman should bear them and were it so in france i believe you will be of my opinion that there would be  00 footmen in a year sent into another world by their masters own hands and i must add my opinion too in the other part namely that it is because masters in france will not bear such usage from their servants that servants in france behave after another manner  i remember when the insolence of servants in france caused that happy edict of our late great monarch that no servants that is to say no footmen or as we call em valets should wear swords but even this was occasioned by their rudeness to other people and sometimes to one another but it was scarce ever heard in france that a footman behaved otherwise to his master than with the most profound submission or that if they did they always met with the severest correction  the very name of footman intimates that they are bred at the foot of their master their business is to clean his shoes and to be always ready at his foot that is to say for the most servile employment their post is to go or ride behind and they ought not to come into the masters presence but with hat in hand bareheaded and with all the tokens of an entire submission this ever was the usage and is still in our country and ought to be in every country but i can assure you the case is quite altered in england and though the carriage of a footman is seemingly submissive their real behavior is quite another thing than it was  they are now drunken saucy unmannerly negligent not only above correction but even above reproof i shall tell you afterward what causes it i am now upon the fact and letting you know that it really is so  a gentleman of my particular acquaintance having occasion to be in scotland thought it a good place to get a servant in his english servant that he carried down with him was not able as he said to live as servants lived in scotland and so he desired to be dismissed which was granted he had after that a fellow recommended to him that had a great desire to serve an english gentleman for he had heard much what good masters they were and how well they used their setvants upon this the gentleman sent for him  the fellow seemed to have the face of a good servant far from being unacquainted with the lowest submission and when they talked of going to england he told my friend that if his honor pleased to carry him to england he would run at his horse foot all the way for he should not need to buy a horse for him now my friend thought indeed that he had been fitted he had occasion to travel some short journeys while he remained there being employed in public business and his new man was the most tendible servant that ever gentleman could desire  the master generous like an english gentleman and kind could not bear to see the poor fellow run on foot up hill and downhill over the mountains through the rivers in the coldest weather as well as in the hottest while his other servants had horses always to ride on so without his mans solicitation he furnished himself with another horse for his new valet and mighty thankful the fellow was  the gentlemen among whom my friend conversed and to whom harry that was his name was frequently sent of errands and on business of great consequence showed their respect for his master by being very bountiful to his servant so that harry began to feel money ring in his pocket which had never been his case before  the first consequence of this was that harry threw away his bonnet which was all the covering his brains had ever known in aberdeenshire from thence he came and bought himself a good castor english hat  his master had promised him his livery when he came to england but was not willing to have it made there for many reasons but having occasion to stay some months longer in scotland than he expected harry found ways and means by the same bounty of the scots gentlemen to buy an old or secondhand black coat which his master being at that time in mourning was suitable enough and harry began to call himself his masters gentleman  it was not long before his master had occasion to send harry from edinburgh to queensferry upon business of consequence and his horses and other servants being gone to glasgow on some other occasion harry was obliged to go on foot at which he showed a visible reluctance at length when his master told him it must be so he said loud enough to be heard it was a little overfar to gang on his foot  well his master took no notice of it at that time but harry went the long journey and came back the same day but at night when his master wanted harry for some business i know not what truly he was gone to his bed and the next morning his master had two or three little rubbs of his great weariness upon which a day or two after he called his man harry and with good humor in his face asked him if his weariness was over harry said yes but that indeed it was a hard journey why harry said his master did not you offer to run at my horsefoot to england when i hired you  harry would sain have forgot that he had said so but his master reminded him of the particulars in so plain a manner that he could not deny it but he came off with saying he was always willing to serve his honor so all servants call their masters there but he found he was willinger than able  no no harry said his master not less able but a little less humble i doubt than you were you and i must talk about that harry pray get you another master yes sir says harry without any hesitation and away he went  however harry bethought himself and made friends to be continued in his service and that he might go to england for that was all he desired it seems when he came first upon this submission harry was received again into favor and came to england with his master when he had been in england a little while he grew like the english servants saucy and proud but with this addition to it that he did not like the wages his master gave him but he understood that other servants in england got more wages than he did and he wanted more wages well his master being willing to have kept the fellow consented to give him  0 s a year more wages than he had agreed with him for before  it happened that harry did something wrong that his master had set him about and it being something of business which being wrong done was some disappointment to his master he was a little angry and took harry up short but gave him not one hard name or any thing of that kind harry told him impudently he did not understand such language that he had not been used to be so talked to in that manner and a great many words he made of it  some time after harry took occasion to let fall some insolent words among the servants as that he would not be talked to by any master in britain that his relations were men of honorable families and he was a gentleman though he served his master soandso  his master heard of this but took no notice of it but some time after harry had done another fault and it was a fault that indeed in a servant is intolerable that when some gentlemen had been to speak with his master who was abroad and had left word with harry that they had been there and told their names harry took no care to let his master know any thing of it  when his master came to hear of it he was very much provoked as indeed he had reason and calling up his man he examined him if such gentlemen had not been there at such a time harry owned they had been there and left their names too well says his master and what was the reason that you did not give me an account of it when i came home harry answered first that he thought he had told him his master alleged that could not be for then he should not have forgot to own it to the gentlemen that business being of consequence to himself then harry would have said he forgot it this made his master doubly angry why then did you not says his master set it down in the book it seems his master had given him a minutebook and pen and ink on purpose to set down such business as might happen in his absence  truly harry being driven to the necessity of owning a fault which if he had done there had been an end of it grew saucy and after grumbling and muttering to himself awhile and his master asking what he said he told him in so many words that truly he did not give himself much trouble to remember such things  what do you mean by that sir say his master is it not my business are you a servant or are you not harry replied though he was a servant he was not to be talked in that manner to as he had been and he should not trouble himself with mens business that used him so  blame him not if the gentleman was in some passion at this but he turned short upon him with a smile what harry do you bear malice it is above a month since i spoke to your worship in the manner you talk of and i am sure you deserved it and if any had occasion to remember it i should for you were impudent enough and do you pretend to bear it in mind now yes he said he did and he would never forgive any man that should talk to him in that manner why then says his master i am sorry i had not cand you then and kicked you out of doors for a rascal as you deserved then you had had something to remember and bear malice for  harry had not much to say then but still kept grumbling at length says his master it seems i had disobliged you before harry and so you neglected my business now on purpose to be even with me was that the case indeed says harry something of that kind for i do not understand such treatment as this with that his master had indeed no more patience but flew at him and giving him a good kick on the backside took up his cane to have broke his head being provoked at his ingratitude you ungrateful dog says he did i take you to run at my horse foot and can you talk thus to me and with that i say flew to his cane  but harry was as nimble as he and though he was as saucy as edward yet he had not edwards courage but fled out of doors and walked off for that night and staid two or three days till he thought his masters passion was over and then he came again and sent in another of the servants to tell his master he was come to ask his pardon  his master was easy enough to forgive him but ordered his clerk to pay him his wages and dismiss him which was done but there was another thing still at the end of harrys submission and that was he did not design coming back to his duty and service for the time was not up that he was hired for but he was told by his countrymen that he might have more wages and he studied to disoblige his master that he might be turned off but still he wanted a certificate this is what we call in france a testimonial of fidelity and good behavior  his master told him ay he would give him a certificate such as he deserved why sir says harry in his country tone have i not been honest and just yes says his master but thou have been saucy and impudent too well but sir says harry and you will certify to my honesty you have forgiven me the rest please to certify the first part  nay says his master though i have forgigiven your behavior harry i cannot certify that you did not misbehave even certify what you like sir says harry and was very humble for harry found that he could not get a place without a certificate and his master perceived it and was willing to humble him so he wrote a certificate thus i   do hereby certify that harry d  the bearer served me three quarters of a year having been hired for a year that he was honest in what matters of trust i committed to him but dismissed by me for his insolent behavior and saucy language witness my hand the  0th day of august   0   harry heard the contents of this with a staring countenance and an inexpressible surprise for his master read it to him and when he had done only said is that the certificate you will please to give me and without waiting for an answer turned his back and went off however harry like a true villain that could fawn till his purpose was served and be impudent again when it was served i say harry made friends to the gentlemans lady and she interceeded for him to his master and considering it might be the poor fellows ruin at last he gave him a certificate  it was some time after this that harry being dressed mighty fine comes to the gentlemans house and his master being not at home sent in his name to his lady the lady was somehow or other engaged but bade one of the servants tell him his master was not at home she could not imagine indeed the gentleman had any business with her unless it had been to thank her for her intercession but she ordered the servants to have him into the kitchen and make him eat and drink so he went away but about three or four days after sends a saucy impudent letter to the lady herself full of foolish but rude language because she was pleased to order her servants to entertain him but did not wait upon him herself  the same gentleman i mentioned above had the exercise of several such servants as these and some worse one of the principal reasons that i can assign for it was that if the general character of the gentleman was just he was only the kindest and most considering master imaginable to his servants always compassionate of them easy with them doing good to them making their lives easy and their service pleasant  but i must now give you an example where this evil has proved tragical both to master and servant for as i hinted before that the provocations given by servants are unsufferable and that it is not always easy for gentlemen to govern their passions in such cases so you may reasonably suppose that all gentlemen have not the same government of themselves men are not equally patient nor equally philosophers and some examples may be given where this insolent behavior of servants has provoked masters beyond their patience  there was a country gentleman of a very good estate but being a single man so they call men here that are not married and having no family he lived privately and only kept two servants one was a groom the other a kind of gentleman to him that is to say one that always attended his master dressed him and traveled with him and at other times was a kind of steward to him did business for him received his rents paid money for him and was trusted by him to a very considerable degree and as he had always appeared to be very honest and his master none of the best managers he rather too much depended upon this servant and seldom took any regular account of his behavior but left all to him  time and good usage had the usual effect upon this servant that is to say that as the custom of most servants is in this country that they soon get out of the knowledge of themselves they take all the kindness of their masters to be not a favor but a debt to their extraordinary merit this fancy of extraordinary merit swells them with extraordinary pride and from that time they neither know how to behave to fellow servants or to masters themselves so it was here and first this fellow began to mend his figure get a long wig ride with a sword wear a watch in his pocket and the like in consequence of this he looked upon himself to be above the rank of an ordinary servant and at length by his particular interest with his master obtained to throw off his livery and dress as a gentleman  from one step to another pride knows no bounds first he learnt to insult over his fellow servant and in a little time more began to bristle up even to his master himself and that in spite of innumerable favors benefactions and civilities which he had received from a gentleman who however he was warm and passionate in extraordinary cases was yet to him the besthumourd gentleman living  his master who had showed him by a thousand tokens that he had an extraordinary respect for him could not yet bear to have him grow upon him and was very nice in taking notice of it did many ways check and take him short in the beginning of his new behavior and sometimes talked roundly to him about it but it was allone he grew the more pert and short with his master till in time the evil growing upon him and he became downright saucy on many occasions  i cannot but observe here for the caution of all gentlemen on the like occasions that they should if possible avoid such common catchword sayings as have any thing ominous in them upon themselves this gentleman in reproving his steward as i may call him used this extraordinary expression almost upon all occasions prithee humphry dont be saucy i cannot bear your insolent tongue i will kill you you dog if you talk so to me i tell you i will kill you this he often said in jest after he had used it pretty much if he sent him for money to his tennants he would add jestingly go and get me some money i will kill you you dog if you dont bring me some money and the like upon many other occasions  among the rest of this unhappy gentletlemans misfortunes this was one viz that he drank very hard and sometimes this impudent fellow would take upon him to reprove his master for it and that not in a modest way as a cautioning him of the mischief of it which he had good humor enough to have taken very kindly but he would laugh at him ridicule and expose his master rather than modestly cover his infirmity and upon his masters being acquainted with this one time after he had been a little in drink he calls his man to him and upbraided him with it but he gave him saucy language which was the occasion of the first breach between them for his master told him in few words he did not deserve the favors he had shown him and so in short turned him off  however in a few days the fellow began to be sensible of his loss and went to his master asked him pardon and was with an abundance of good nature received into his place again and in as much favor as ever  by that time he had been in place again long enough to forget the favor and to forget the sense he had had of it before he became just as saucy and insolent as he was before  it happened one night that his master stayed out very late and his gentleman sitting up for him was very finely gotten fast asleep in his masters parlour and in his easy chair by the fire about four aclock in the morning his master rung at the door and the groom or footman comes running into the parlour to call the steward believing he might be asleep and he was indeed so dead asleep that he could not be presently waked so that while the footman was waking him his master was at his heels and was come into the parlour himself the dialogue between the groom and the steward was very short but being much to the purpose it is very needful to give you the particulars of it as follows  footman mr humphry mr humphry my masters come   mr humphry ha what and then humphry snord again   footm nay mr humphry wake i tell you my masters come  pulls him mr humph what ha come who is come what and snores again   footm why my masters come mr humphry he will be here this minure get up i say  pulls him almost out of the chair and almost wakes him mr humph o o is he come is the old dog come then d  him it is very well indeed a fine time of night d  him a fine time truly i suppose the old rogue is drunk enough pray who brought him home   all the while the sot said this last part his master stood and heard every word of it for he was come in within the parlourdoor so when he had done his master began o mr humphry says he what are you got drunk before me to night and spoke it merrily enough for it happened to mr humphrys misfortune that his master was not drunk that night or at most not so drunk as he usually was so that he had temper enough to manage his gentleman mr humphry pretty well for he caused him to give up all his trusts and books which he usually kept that very night and turned him out of doors the next morning  mr humphry would fain have staid next morning and gave his master very good words but it would not do his master was warmer then by a great deal than he was overnight no no humphry says he you and i must part i cannot bear such as this adding i shall certainly kill you one time or other if you stay therefore get you gone i say or i am sure i shall kill you so mr humphry was obliged to pack up and be gone  well notwithstanding all this abominable treatment mr humphry upon an acknowledgment of his fault and the intercession of some friends which he got to speak to his master in his favor was taken in again a third time about half a year after and was reinstated in the same place as before  he had upon his application to his master to be restored humbled himself very much acknowledged that he was in drink and knew not what he said and asking pardon had assured his master of his future good behavior and for some time he was a tolerable good servant  but there is no changing of nature mr humphry soon forgot the easy chair and the story of calling his master hard names as above and grew just the same individual mr humphry as he was before and in particular as saucy to his master upon several occasions it happened one night that his master got so very drunk at a neighboring gentlemans house that he could not get home but as he was riding homewards fell off from his horse but it being in a country village where he was known the people at an inn took him up and sent to his house for his servants to come and fetch him  he kept no coach nor he could not fit on horseback so his two men thought themselves obliged to carry him home in a chair it being near two miles off and that not a chair as we call it such as ply in the streets of london but a meet plain country chair when they were just coming out of the inn comes up mr humphry and he falls upon his master with a thousand insolent reproaches calling him drunken old rogue and the like and in a word made the two men set him down and get a cart to carry him home in  everybody cried out against mr humphry for offering such an affront to his master told him it was a shame and the like but his master that could just speak and that was all called out that he would have the cart ay he would have the cart humphry you dog says he bring the cart i will have the cart i tell you and at last adds i will kill you you dog if you dont give me the cart this made the country people quiet and so mr humphry like himself put his master into the cart and carried him home  the next day when his master was sober and come to know how he had been used by his man he conceived such an irreconcilable grudge against him as was never to be wiped off and was at last fatal to them both  that part of the story is tragical and would be too long for a letter neither is it to my present purpose but the short of it is this that this unhappy gentleman being another time a little in drink and humphry giving him some provoking language one night as they were going home from a tavern his master in a passion run him into the body and laid him dead at his foot for which he was tried at the country assizes and the old grudge being proved the jury brought him in guilty of wilful murder and it cost him his life  i am etc  letter viii dear brother i told you at my beginning to write on this flagrant subject i did not intend to trouble you with an account of the dishonesty the thieving and whoring among servants for that these had been frequent not only in all ages but in all nations there have always been thieves and whores who get into peoples houses under the characters of honest servants even with design to rob the families and the like and to talk of these would be to say nothing new yet you must allow me to observe that there were never so many such as now i have been told our famous thieftaker as they call him has a list of  000 newgatebirds now in services in this city and parts adjacent all with intent to rob the houses they are in and the reason of this i hinted at in one of my last namely that it is certainly increased by the pride and insolence which servants in general are now arrived to for that as i said then when once servants are brought to contemn the persons and authority of their masters or mistresses or employers they soon come to despise their interests and at last to break into their property and thus they become thieves in a manner insensible and by the mere consequence of the thing  but i am now to describe to you that sort of thieving and robbery which is practiced by those we call honest servants in england or at least by those who call themselves honest and who as i said in my last would think themselves very much affronted if they should be called dishonest or be denied testimonials of their honesty  the first is loss of time if i hire a servant or a workman by the day or by the week the meaning of the agreement is that my money is their due when the hours which they were to work are expired and their time is my due if they expect their wages he that defrauds me of any part of the time that he makes me pay for is as much a thief as if he broke open my cabinet and took away so much money as those hours so wasted came to this is certainly just but it is impossible to persuade any servant of this and they so little value it as a dishonesty that generally speaking they scorn to acknowledge it either to god or man  a friend of mine in the country had a warm scuffle with one of these honest servants upon this foot a few months ago he had ordered his gardener in particular to make a hotbed for the raising some nice plants which he being curious that way took great delight in and had a value for the fellow took his orders and went out into the garden as if he went to make the hotbed but it happened that in a field just without his gardenwall there was some young fellows playing at cricket a sport which the country people in this part of england very much delight in  three times the gentleman went down into his garden to see what progress his gardener had made in the hotbed at the first time he found him at the work having made a beginning which was as much as he could expect for the time that he had been about it the second time he went down which was two or three hours after and found he had not done one stroke toward it more than he had done at first and that he was not at the work whereupon calling him he found he was at the backdoor of the garden looking out into the field as soon as he heard his master call him he came in fell to the work told him that he was but just stepped to the door from the work that minute which though it was false yet passed well enough and my friend said little to him at that time nor did he know anything of the attractive sport that was in the field which occasioned his gardeners idle humor at that time but seeing him fall to work hard while he staid he left him again for two or three hours more and then comes again to look at the work but instead of the work going on his gardener was at the same sport and at the same gardendoor as before only that being pretty sharp in looking out for his master he was so nimble as to shut the garden backdoor and sculk behind some fine trimmed hedges that stood convenient for his purpose and so get to the hotbed before his master but as eyes are quicker than feet his master happened to see him though he thought he had not  as the gardener thought he had not been seen so his master did not let him know at first that he had seen him but when he came to the hotbed and found little or nothing done more than was done when he left him before he questioned him though calmly what was the meaning that his orders had not been executed and the hotbed made he knowing that the plants he had to set in it had lain out of the ground all the while and would be in danger of spoiling the fellow said he had worked very hard at it and done what he could and he could do no more than he had done in that time and the like grumbling a little as if he was not justly blamed  his master still concealing that he knew anything of what was the case argued with him awhile how little was done and told him that if an hours work or two in a day had been missing he might indeed not have been able to perceive it or at least his gardener might pretend to impose upon him but when instead of missing an hour or twos work in a day there was not an hours work done in the day he could not be deceived so much and that he expected when he ordered a thing to be done it should be dispatched and not the time spent at backdoors and chatting with companions etc  this was enough to make a fellow who had manners little enough without it to be surly and perhaps saucy however he began a little low at first told his master he worked as hard as he could and he  his master was never satisfied that he could not work harder not he and the like  perhaps you may work hard when you are at it says his master and perhaps you may work as hard as you can but then you cannot say you have worked as long as you can too or as long as you ought i was only out at the backdoor two minutes in the morning says he no master in england would make so many words about such a trifle and i am sure i have setchd it up since the master smiled at him and said nothing for awhile but finding him still grow hot and saucy he told him that in pity to him and to prevent his telling more lies he would let him know that he found him the second time at the gardendoor and told him how long he had been there and how he slunk in and which way he went round to the hotbed to avoid his seeing him  instead of modestly acknowledging his fault and asking his masters pardon he told him he had little to do indeed to watch a poor servant that he could not stir to speak to a friend but he must be at his heels that he was a servant but would not be a slave that he knew how to do his work as well as another without being watched and thus the fellow run on impudentiy as if his master had injured him in the highest degree by discovering him however his master commanded his passion all this while but when he said he knew how to do his work well enough without being watched his master took him up as if with a kind of a jest too well says his master but you know it is natural to watch a thief  a thief says the gardener a thief and repeating it several times flew into not a passion of sawciness but even a rage told his master he was as honest a man as himself that he scorned a master that should call him a thief and he would not take it from the best master that evet kept a servant he had robbed him of nothing and was no thief and would not be called so and he would make him prove it and the like  well hold says his master dont be so hot if you put me to prove it i do insist upon it and i shall not only prove it but punish you for it too i say you have robbed me of the time which i pay you for not only to day but many days and that servant that robs me of my time and of his work in the time that i hire him for robs me of my money and is as much a thief as if he stole my money out of my house or out of my pocket  o dear says the gardener is that your thieving you charge me with will you make a man a thief for that i think and know myself to be as honest a man as any in england for all that why hark you sir says his master do i pay you your wages or do i not well he said he did not deny but he had his wages and what do i give you wages for says his master  why for my work says the gardener  and what if you do not work says his master and yet take my money as if you did as is the case to day  why he said he did not say but it was wrong to take his money and not do his work but he did not do so  prithee says his master dont tell me of its being wrong and such stuff as that i tell thee it is thieving and neither better nor worse and when you tell me a lie and tell me you have been at work when i know you have been at the alehouse and out of your business and by that cheat you take my money as if you had been at work i say that is robbing me and when you do so you are a thief there is no mincing the matter  well this word thief ran so in his head and stuck so in his stomach that notwithstanding his master talked all this very calmly to him yet his blood was fired with it and he could not work but as soon as his masters back was turned he stuck up his spade and his fork in the ground and away he goes out at the backdoor to the alehouse gets very drunk and came not home till about one aclock in the morning when being by his masters order shut out he went back and lodged as he could and in the morning when he came again his master ordered his other servants to tell him at the door that his master had no more business for him  he made many attempts and got several persons to interceed for him for he had a very good place of it but his master was inflexible so he came for his tools had his wages and was dismissed  when he was going away he told his master that as he had served him so long and had never differed with him before he hoped he would give him a certificate i shall explain what is meant here by a certificate hereafter when i come to that part  a certificate says his master yes i will give thee a certificate if thou desire it  yes says the gardener i desire it if you please  why says his master i believe thou had better take no certificate you know added his master you said you could have places enough  well sir says the gardener but i hope you will not scruple such a trifile as that  no says his master but i tell thee thou may do better without it  why so sir says the gardener  why says the master because it will do thee no good  yes he said it would do him good to be sure when he came to see another place  why look you says his master such a certificate as i must give you will do you no good indeed  why says he will you not give me such a certificate as the law directs  yes indeed will i says his master and that is such as is according to your desert  why said the gardener i have been an honest servant  no hold there says the master i cannot say that indeed  why says the gardener what will you put this little trifling difference into a certificate  i will put in nothing but the truth says the master  what truth says the gardener and began to be saucy again  look you says the master dont be saucy again for i will not lie for you nor assist you to deceive anybody else as you have me  well says the gardener give me a certificate and put what you will into it say your worst i value it not  say you so says his master well my certificate shall be just and fair and make you your best of it upon which he wrote his certificate as follows i a  w  do hereby certify that the bearer g  m  served me as my chief gardener two years and one quarter that he is a person capable of discharging the place of a gardener but was dismissed by me for neglecting his business robbing me of my time and for his saucy tongue witness my hand this twentieth day of august      a  w   i shall have occasion to give you a farther relation of this affair of the certificate so i say no more to it now only this the fellow took it and went away and had so little wit as to show it among his comrades and fellowgardeners which he did as he thought to expose his master but they in return made it public and the poor fellow became so known by it that indeed it was an effectual certificate to him for no gentleman would employ him and he kept out of place till he was almost starved but of that also hereafter  i should have told you that in he first discourse between this gentleman and his gardener he asked the fellow the question in few words that i formerly asked my overseer namely whether he did not think it a theft to rob his master of his time if he took wages of him for it and did not work he said as above he owned it should not be so and that it should not be so often but when his master asked him again and kept him to it that it was robbery he answered no indeed he did not think anything like it he might say it was a fault but every fault did not make a man a thief  no no says his master i suppose you count nothing thievery but what a man must or may be hanged or transported for  truly he said he thought it was no theft for the law had not made any punishment for it and if it had been theft there would have been a law against it  very well says his master there is no law expressly to punish a man with corporal punishment for being a bankrupt and yet we often say that in some cases a bankrupt is no better than a highwayman nay that he deserves to be hanged a thousand times more than one that robs upon the road  the gardener however would not yield to it on any account whatsoever that robbing his master of his time ought to be called robbing him at all or theft that it was but what the spaniards call a peccadillo a small fault that there was nothing in it but it was what everybody did as well as he and therefore he might do it as well as everybody else  this impudent barefaced robbing their masters of their time and justifying that it is no theft is the foundation of almost all the impudent carriage of those kind of servants whose service consists in labor for first it makes them impatient of reproof and saucy if they are spoken to as if they were injured not their masters that they ought to have the liberty to play at their work when they thought fit and that the master had not right to take any notice of it and if they are put away for such behavior they take upon them to rail plentifully at the injustice of it  and this brings me to a part i have not spoken to yet namely the manner in which the servants generally behave here in england when they are dismissed any service    it is very seldom that a servant can be put away by any gentleman but that as above they are full of it that they are injured that they were put away for nothing or some trifle nay it is very seldom they will own that they were put away at all but that they would serve no longer that they did not like and that they had come away upon some very just discontent and it is very rare but on such occasions they will raise some scandalous lie or other on the family they come from   but on the otherhand if the crime is notorious and they have nothing to say to hide it then their behavior is still worse and they rail at and abuse the whole family in the grossest manner possible from one or both these cases it generally happens that whenever a gentleman turns away a servant in this country he is sure to make an enemy i hinted this before when i told you how far this goes with the gentlemen here and how patiently they submit to be bullied and insulted by their servants for fear of being railed at and abused by them when they are gone but i must add also that it is not always so neither sometimes an unthankful rogue meets with a master that knows how to deal with him and for your diversion i shall here give you a story that has very lately been the subject of satisfaction to all our neighborhood  a certain citizen who had his country house in a village near london had a servant who he had kept many years and had employed him in several matters of business as well as mere servitude and having had him so long that he was as it were naturalized to the family it appeared that he had really a kindness for the fellow  had the man had the use of but a moderate share of common sense he might have considered that though his master had a kindness for him and did often bear with and pass by his misdemeanors yet that he might one time or other come to be tired of him and that it was not in human nature to be always winking at the abuses and ill behavior of a servant it was easy for him to know that his master did not wink because he could not see for he knew his master was no fool and he was himself not fool enough to be ignorant that whatever he was formerly he was now become a very unsufferable fellow and such as no master could or indeed ought to bear with  but whatever he might see and know of himself nothing could bring him it seems to reform or to mend his manners but he grew worse and worse was drunken idle pilfering and withal an intolerable swearer to complete it all he grew saucy and insolent to his master as i have told you they all do and whenever he got drink in his head was more particularly abusive to his master than at other times  his master whose particular aversion was the vice of drunkenness but more especially in his servants had several times differed with him upon that particular occasion and sometimes as well as he loved him had turned him away for it but was still prevailed with by some intercession or other and particularly by his respect which he had for the fellow to take him again  this fellow hardened in that part of his carriage which particularly merits the name of ingratitude and which rendered him most base because offered to a master and a family to which he was bound by infinite obligations such as rating the station he was in namely of a servant were as binding in their nature as he was capable of receiving yet behaved so that he became a nuisance even to the whole family and indeed unsufferable for he was not only a thief a drunkard idle and negligent in his business and withal intolerably rude and saucy when reproved but he introdud other thieving into the family which were at last exposed by the very observation of the neighbors who could not see the family so abused without acquainting them of it  upon this his master turned him and his dependants off and dismissed him his service and yet even this his master did with calmness and without doing himself that justice upon him which the law would have justified him in for the laws here in matters of that nature are such that this fellow would have been transported if his master had thought fit to have carried his resentment on to extremity but in compassion to him and his family he forebore that part  but no sooner was the fellow dismissed but he run about the town raging and swearing at and damning his master and the whole family from whom he had received so much good usage and so many favors representing his usage as unjust and injurious and as if he had done nothing to merit being turned off or that being put out of his service had cancelled all the obligation of former favors a thousand scandalous lies were raised and spread about by him through the town and in a word he failed not to give all possible testimonies of the utmost spite malice and rage against the whole family where he and his family had for several years together been so well used and so much obliged  but as the characters of the family were placed by providence out of his reach and that all the neighborhood knew how much better they had merited from him it returned all in his face nor did his master or the family much mind him for as it was below their resentment they took not the least notice of it or of them but the fellow grew infamous by it and gradually grew poor also which must be the issue of such conduct for no families of note would entertain him  it is true contempt is the best and indeed the only way to treat such fellows with and it is so severe a punishment upon them for their behavior that it exceeds either the stocks or the correctionpost but the hardship upon gentlemen even in the practice of so much selfdenial as that of suppressing their own resentments in such cases is very great and there are some cases in families where the abuses received by such people cannot be passed by and this leads me to some particulars which really good families are so much abused in by the villainy of turndoff servants both men and women that it cannot i say be put up without infinite injustice to themselves  nor indeed can this article be well omitted because it has gone a greater length in familymischiefs than any part i have yet spoken to and has been the ruin of some families of note within these few years the fact is branched out into two particulars   the liberty these abusive creatures called servants take with the reputation of the families they go from and in particular sacrificing the characters of the youngladies wherever they come   the treachery of them in betraying youngladies of fortune into the hands of villains and scoundrels either to debauch them or to marriages many ways as fatal as the other would be   that the insults of servants is risen up to the first pitch of villainy is now so notorious that a thousand instances is to be given of it and the remedy is so hard to be found that the only hope now left us for the evil of it seems to lie in the practice being so scandalous that no persons of any tolerable degree of prudence will lay any stress upon it the instances of such attempts having appeared merely malicious are innumerable some examples of this i cannot omit it is true they carry me a little off from the menservants this part being chiefly in the way of the women or maidservants but the men are not without their share of it  a certain eminent family within the compass of my knowledge had a particular affront of this kind put upon them by a certain maidservant as she was supposed to be the lady being newly dead the gentleman having three or four children had hired a housekeeper to manage the family and kept two maidservants under her besides the cook  the housekeeper was a sober grave woman that had a bad husband but he was yet alive and as her family was reduced by his extravagance and himself got fast by the heels in the fleetprison she was glad to get into such a place as this was for her support her master directing what servants he intended to keep had left it to this woman his housekeeper to hire such as she thought proper for his business and she letting her husband know that they wanted a chambermaid perhaps innocently too that he might if he heard of any send them to her he sends her a creature of his own procuring to be hired and as the most impudent creatures are sometimes more than ordinarily qualified to counterfeit that modesty which they are not atall blessed with so this maid appeared with the air of a modest sober girl as much as could be desired and not only the housekeeper but the master himself was very well pleased with her  she had not however been long in the family but with a subtlety beyond the devil she causes a feud in the family between the housekeeper and another maid who was properly called the nurserymaid and this she managed with such dexterity that even the two parties themselves did not so much as suspect that she the chamber maid had any hand in it this quarrel run up to such a height that in a word it begin to embroil the family for every day more or less this nursery maid was affronting the housekeeper till at length the cause came before the master of the house who seeing his housekeeper evidently in the right began calmly to persuade the maid to be quiet and to make no more disturbance in the family but to mend what was complained of and do her business as she should do  the maid seeing her master though he had spoken very little to her disadvantage yet apparently against her instead of taking quietly the reproof which was so much her due flies out in a kind of passion and went raving about the house among the other servants telling them it was easy to see which way things went and that the housekeeper would be sure to trample poor servants under foot when she had her master on her side and in a word behaved very sawcily and indeed impudently to her master intimating little less but that she had been told that he was in short too great with his housekeeper  so great is the power of scandal and so greedily do the minds of the common people entertain any thing that savours of reproach that though the master himself believing his character to be out of the reach of such tongues despised it yet he soon found that it had got vent in the family and even in the neighborhood also for some who were concerned for the reputation of the gentleman himself came and acquainted him with it  he was a little alarmed at it then indeed and called his housekeeper to a hearing for she was alarmed at it as well as he the servants were then called together and examined before the housekeepers face and the two neighbors present all the servants gave her a character greater than she desired and declared that they never saw the least indecency in her behavior in their lives and it was more particularly observed that the two servants who were really the traitors in this wickedness were the forwardest when it came thus to a hearing to justify their master and the housekeeper also and with the greatest expressions of kindness to the one and respect for the other  but this looked so ill among the rest of the servants that one of them who indeed had been suspected took the occasion in order to vindicate herself to take the maid short and tell her before her master and the housekeeper that she had been the forwardest to talk of the housekeeper in a manner that did not become her and began to be particular with her and seemed inclined to enter into some discovery  but the subtle wench the nurserymaid took her up short and said that was only in mirth and jesting with one another when she had told a story of a certain gentleman that had been a little familiar with his house keeper but that she had not the least thought of what was now suggested that her master had indeed been against her in a dispute between her and the housekeeper but that was as he pleased she thought no harm upon that account and down she falls upon her knees and makes loud imprecations on herself if ever she entertained a thought to the prejudice of her masters reputation or of the housekeepers either and this part of what she said was really true for she knew within herself that she did not believe what she had reported but that she had raised it all maliciously and of her own head or at least by the instigation of the other maid mentioned above who she also knew did it with a design to supplant the housekeeper  however this creature managed her desence with so much art and faced down the other maid with so much confidence and so many words that they were all dismissed the master was defamed and the poor housekeeper not only blasted in her reputation but her husband was enraged and though a prisoner was hardly kept from insulting the gentleman and his wife too and though all this went on to a very unhappy length yet still the servants were all purged and stood clear of being the instruments  but the master of the house as he was made uneasy at first was much more so when he found that notwithstanding all his servants had said the scandal increased and spread farther and farther upon him and besides that he had some intimations that this nurserymaid notwithstanding all she had said before and notwithstanding all her imprecations had still let fall some little reflections and had shown that nothing but fear restrained her for she was resolved to ruin the housekeeper if she could having retained an implacable grudge against her from the first quarrel as above  upon this the gentleman ordered that maid to be turned off and giving her a months wages not a months warning had her turned out of doors that very night he would not order the housekeeper to do it because he would not increase the quarrel between them then as he found that however innocent the poor woman was the reproach would never die unless she was removed too he resolved to put her off also though as he was fully satisfied of the wrong done to her he thought it was particularly hard upon her as it was also upon himself with respect to his family because she was a very useful and faithful servant  the poor woman was under a great affliction the loss of her place being a kind of ruin to her the circumstances of herself and of her husband considered but she was confounded and her coming from her place made less grievous to her when going from her masters house directly to her husband in the fleet prison instead of receiving her kindly as he used to do he flew out in a rage at her abused her and fell upon her with his hands too that she had much ado and not but by crying out and some of the prisoners coming in to help her to escape with her life and all the while knew nothing what the reason of it all was after his first fury was over and she could get room to talk with him he charged her positively with being a whore and a whore to her master and showed her a letter which he had written to her master reproaching him with abusing him in debauching his wife intimating that if his misfortunes had not pinned him down in such a place as he was in he would have come and taken his revenge with his own hands  when the poor woman saw this letter and what mischiefs had been so near her she was glad in her mind that she was come away from her master for that she saw things were gone too far to have been otherwise but she set herself with all her cunning to find out if possible who it could be who had carried their malice to such a height  there was a poor woman in the prison whose business it was to clean the rooms run of errands tend sick prisoners and any such things as occasion offered to get her bread this woman was a sensible good sort of body and sharp enough and above all had a singular character in the place for her faithfulness and honesty to her trust  this poor creature was either in the mans chamber or near it when he fell foul on his wife as is said above and did her endeavor to deliver the poor wife out of his hands and consequently came to know something of the case  after the mans wife the housekeeper had as i have said got a little farther into the affair and found how it stood between her and her husband she took this poor woman aside and engaging her to secrecy and to assist her told her the whole case and withal giving her something in hand with promise of more employed her to find out if possible who it was that could be thus malicious to bring such a horrid story to her husband  in the mean time to go back to the nurserymaid as she was turned off with some resentment so she went away full of resentment and she was no sooner out of the house but she went about railing at the housekeeper and at her master too openly calling the first a whore and not forbearing to say she was so to her master and so impolitick was she in her discourse that she formed several stories which she pretended to say were of her own knowledge particularly that she saw the housekeeper go into her masters chamber such a night naming the time and that she sat up all night to watch the door and that she was sure she did not come out till the next morning that at such a time she saw her master kiss her and several other passages too dirty to be repeated here that she went another time into her masters chamber presently after he was gone down stairs and that there were two pillows in the bed and the plain mark of two bodies as having lain in the bed all night  you must take it with you as you go that the other servant who as i hinted had kindled this flame from the beginning was the person that privately set all these wheels at work and gave this foolish wench the nurserymaid all her cue told her those stories of the housekeepers being in her masters chamber allnight of the print on the pillows and in the bed and affirmed that she watched and that she saw them but brought the other wench who was forward enough of herself to be revenged of the housekeeper to take it all to herself and tell the story in her own name which she did as above  this subtle creature also made the same hot passionate girl go to the housekeepers husband in the prison and tell him all the vile stories the could invent which had put him into such a rage and made him beat his wife and to propose to him that he should affront the gentleman in the manner he intended to do by his letter  nor did she fail of her design for everything answering her end she got the housekeeper turned away as you have heard after which with a smile in her face and a smooth tongue she went and offered her service to her master to be housekeeper till as she pretended with a feigned modesty he could provide himself more to his mind  in this address to her master she failed not to rail plentifully at the rudeness of the nurserymaid suggested how she had certainly wronged the poor housekeeper and been the cause of her ruin and how justly his worship had put her away that she deserved to be punished for that she had certainly done it in mere malice on account of the quarrel they had with one another when his worship  so she called her master decided in favor of the housekeeper that she had heard her say she would be revenged of her and the like  thus she sacrificed the very impliment she had made use of and exposed her as much as she had made her expose the housekeeper and all to serve her own turn and get into the housekeepers place which by her sawning tongue her treachery not being suspected she brought to pass and was accordingly made housekeeper as she desired  all this while the old housekeeper was waiting and using an unwearied diligence to find out if possible who had thus supplanted her and above all who had used her so basely to her husband as to set him against her as had been done and besides the honest poor woman who she had employed at the prison she set another woman to work who kept a shop in the town where her master had his country house and where all these wicked things were done and she told her case to her and begged of her that if the maid came to her shop as she knew she would she would endeavor to get some of the particulars out of her if she could for she suspected though she could not prove it that all this abominable stuff came from her for their old quarrel though she could not so much as think she had any hand in the other part about her husband for she was satisfied she did not so much as know she had a husband much less where he was or in what condition  she had not set these wheels a working many days but she found the effect of her diligence for this wench who had been fully instructed by the other who was now the housekeeper comes in the morning to the prison to the husband and there she begins her story again from the beginning affirmed again that she saw his wife go into her masters chamber at night after he went in to go to bed and that she sat up allnight and was positive she never came out till morning also the visible appearance of two having been in the bed and the like then she run on in a great many tokens of more than ordinary kindness that was between them that she did not treat him with the distance and respect due from a servant but with a kind of freedom more like a wife and that her master did not use her like a servant but with a kind of familiarity that anybody might see through and the like  it being in the morning the poor woman i mentioned above was in the room doing necessary things as was her place at first the maid seemed a little shy of speaking but he encouraged her and said you may speak freely that is only a poor woman that tends the chambers here she minds nothing and so the wench went on with all the freedom she would have done if they had been alone  the poor woman busied herself here and there about the room as usual and seemed to take no notice of anything but as she had listened very attentively to all she had said and with detestation observed how she endeavored to insinuate jealousy into the man and exasperate him against his own wife she resolved to hear a little more of it if she could so finding she had sully vented her rage and supposing it would not be long ever she would go away she goes out first and planting herself in the way at her going out the man when he saw her called to her to show her  the maid the way out and get the door at the stairfoot opened  she readily offered her service but when she came to the door she pretended the turnkey was not at the door but would come immediately and so asked her to go into a little room which she knew to be empty and sit down so she gets her into the room  here she falls a bemoaning her poor master above stairs that he should have such hard luck and be so treated by his wife when he was under the affliction of being in prison and so brought the wench who was full of it and apt enough to be talkative i say she brought her to tell all the story overagain and to name the housekeepers name and her masters name the place where he lived and all she could think of which was what the wise poor woman wanted for above she had heard the story but had not the knowledge of persons and names but here the unwary fool told her story without any reserve without the least caution not dreaming she was just taken in her own snare  the poor woman joined with her in everything said ay and yes to all that required it and got the bottom of her resentment out and then pretending the turnkey was come went with her to the door and let her go  when she was rid of her she went immediately while it was fresh in her memory and set down in writing everything that was material that she had said with the names and circumstances and times of every action as well what she had said to her below as what she had said before to him above stairs and this she did that she might be sure to do justice to the mans abused wife and that she might do no wrong to the wench  when the housekeeper came again which was not till two or three days after she stopped her and would not let her go up to her husband for said she he is in a range again for here has been an agent with him enough to inflame ten husbands so she took her into the same room and told her the whole story as above  it seems this revengeful creature the nurserymaid being bent upon doing all the mischief she was able and being heated with the discourse she had had here both above stairs and below went directly from the prison up to the chandlers shop where she used to go in her masters neighborhood and there she sits down to refresh herself it being some distance from the city  the woman who kept the shop expected what happened namely that she would fall upon the old story and thinking it would not be convenient that she should be brought in as an evidence against any servant and for what might be said in her shop too for that then no servants would care to come to her shop she slipped into a backroom where she as it happened had another woman a friend that was come from london to see her so she brought out her friend into the shop upon some pretense or other and growing all familiar together it was not very long ever the maid began her story about her being turned away at such a house and why her master put her away boldly hinting that she had seen a little too much and the like then the stranger put in her questions and holding up her hands made an admiration that such a thing should happen soandso and in such a family too she thought the gentleman had been quite another person and the like this drew the weak passionate wench in to tell all her tale ay and more than her tale too so that wherever she came she found room to add something or other to the story  the housekeeper got a full account of this also and being thus effectually furnished with two sufficient evidences besides hearing it in pieces and parts in several other places among the neighbors some here some there i say being now fully satisfied who had been the incondiary she upon good advice causes the creature to be arrested in the first place in an action of slander and left her husband might upon application to him discharge her she went and acquainted the gentleman her former master of the whole story who carrying her before a justice of peace had her bound over and committed to the house of correction till she should find sureties to appear at the quarter sessions in this pickle she found herself the very first two or three days after her having been at the fleet prison with the housekeepers husband  however she found friends at some length of time and giving bail she got her liberty again for awhile and not foreseeing what was like to follow she was at first as saucy as ever but her friends who knew better things and who found that the gentleman resolved to prosecute her very warmly especially for the poor womans sake and more especially when they came to know what evidence they had against her warned her a little of her danger and so she behaved something quieter  she began now to find she was betrayed and that she was in danger to suffer for the rudeness of her tongue and as i say this made her a little more humble so in her discourse she let some words fall that what she said was not altogether of her own head but that she had good authority for what she had said  some of her friends carried this to the housekeeper that prosecuted her but she answered she was a poor woman and she could not afford to prosecute two or three folks and besides she might say what she had said only to slip her own neck out of the collar and when a prosecution should be begun against the person she had accused she might deny it all again or might run away and not appear at the trial and so she the housekeeper might be cast for want of evidence and for these reasons she said she would not run the venture of going from one to another but the nurserymaid was her mark she had sufficient evidence against her and she would look no farther that besides she was the person who had endeavored to set her the old housekeepers husband against her by a forged and slanderous charge and had made him abuse her as he had done and she would have the truth of it out if she could but would look no farther for her enemy than where she had found her  but this accident of the nurserymaid pretending to say she had authors for what she had said had a farther effect than what has been yet observed and that in two differing ways first the new housekeeper who as i have said was at the bottom of all the mischief and had been so from the beginning but had craftily concealed herself began to be apprehensive that this wench would discover her as the author of all and therefore she underhand pushed on the old housekeeper not to accept of the offer of a discovery and put all those arguments into her mouth which i have just mentioned and pressed her to prosecute the maid with the utmost severity and to bring her to a trial with all the speed she could  this she managed with such dexterity that the trial was hastened all her proposals of a farther discovery were rejected and she was left to expect the worst which indeed was bad enough for her for upon a full trial the maid was sentenced to pay a fine to the prosecutor for her damage in the loss of her place  i do not remember the sum exactly and to be whipped publicly at the carts tail through the town where her masters country house was and where she had lived which was executed on her to the utmost as indeed she very well deserved she was lashed it seems very heartily and nobody pitied her but all the neighbors said she ought to smart for it  but the story does not end yet the poor wench though she had been soundly lashed had a fine also to pay to the housekeeper for reparation of scandal and loss of employment this they took hold of and she having intimated that she could make some discovery the housekeeper willing to know who had been her friends and who her enemies in this affair went to her in the prison and pressed her to make this discovery offering her good encouragement if she would tell who set her on upon all those wicked things  but the wench was then obstinate no she said they had done their worst to her and she had no obligation to gratify them if they had desired it of her before she had been used as she was she might have served them but now she would say nothing they argued with her that there was still room for them to be kind to her that she lay under a fine which she was to be kept in prison for till she paid and the prosecutor offered to forgive her all the money she was to pay her for damages on condition of the discovery no she said it was below her to betray any of her fellow servants and she would tell them nothing that as to getting out of prison she would do that as well as she could but she would make no discovery so they went away concluding it was only talk and she was not able to discover anything but the old housekeeper would not give it over so for she had some reasons to believe there was something in it so she followed her still and one day pressing her very home and telling her first what she would give her namely remit the damages and gratify her besides the maid told her jestingly she might go among the servants and enquire there perhaps she would hear of it in the family without her help  the housekeeper took her short there and told her as for fellow servants she should not pretend anything of that nature for she was very well satisfied there was none of the fellow servants but were so provoked at the barbarous treatment of her  the old housekeeper and especially of their master that they had all of them declared she deserved what she had had and had been eager with her to go on with the prosecution  ay said she she was sure that could not be they would not all say so  yes says the housekeeper every one of them  the maid laughed at her again and with a kind of a jest repeated the words not every one not every one several times  the housekeeper answered she would prove it that every one of them had openly said so  the maid then fell to railing and told her she lyd it could not be and if they had said so it was only to blind and deceive her and make a jest of her  the housekeeper returned yes they had all told her so and particularly the new housekeeper had told her she would be unjust to herself and unkind to her masters reputation if she did not prosecute her to the utmost and she would bring her to say so to her face  the maid soon discovered by her countenance that she meant the same person when she said not every one for upon her naming her as above she flew into a greater passion told her it could not be and that she was sure it was a lie and the like  well says the old housekeeper i will go and fetch such witness of it as shall convince you of the truth of what i have said and with that she left her and went out the next morning she went to the new housekeeper innocently told her all their discourse and would have had her gone with her to the prison to have justified what she had said for she had spoken with such eagerness against the wench that the old housekeeper could not imagine but she was hearty in it all and would have said the same to her face  but she excused herself first she said she did not love fending and proving what advice she had given her she had made use of and it had answered the end she gave it her for namely that she had got reparation of her credit and the wench had been severely punished and she thought she ought to be satisfied with it and so in short excused herself from going to the maid or having any more trouble about it twas time she said to let it all drop and die that the world might not be always gossiping about the affairs of the family  but this did not satisfy the woman so she went to her master and told him what the maid had said viz that there was somebody still in his family who had been the original of all this scandal that she had not raised it of herself but that she had it from somebody in the family then told him the reasons she had to believe it was the new housekeeper and what steps she had taken with her to bring them facetoface but that the housekeeper declined it her master bade her be easy he would manage that part for her for that he would the next day send the new housekeeper of an errand to the maid to carry her some relief for that though he was satisfied she should be punished yet he was not willing she should starve and he would send her something by the housekeeper as if she  the housekeeper had given it of her own accord  she was jealous this would not do and that the house keeper would sham it and not go but send some body else but the housekeeper was not so cunning but did come believing that carrying money to the maid and giving it to her as her own gift would secure her and this thought made her fool enough to go  when she came there the old housekeeper who had watched her narrowly followed quick after and clapped in upon her as if she also had come casually to see the maid and she came so suddenly and unlooked for that she could not avoid their being all together being thus met they began to talk roundly of the matter and after some time the old housekeeper reminded the new one of her formerly expressing honestly as the old one called it her detestation of the fact and pressing her to have her  the nurserymaid prosecuted and punished and told her the nurserymaid would not believe her but she hoped she would not deny it now when she repeated that part she  the new housekeeper broke out in a passion at it told her it was a lie of her own inventing that she had persuaded her not to go on with the prosecution but to pity the poor girl and the like  the housekeeper was a little surpised at first with such a token of assurance but recovering herself she with a smile told her she was very glad she had found out the firebrand of the family that if she had known it a little soouer the poor nursery maid should have been pardoned that she would not only prove she had said so to her but that she had said the same thing to her master as well as to her persuading him to prosecute the girl in her  the old housekeepers behalf and to prove the truth of it  turning to the nurserymaid susan said she has she not given you ten shillings yes says susan and has she not given it you as her own bounty susan yes says susan well says she it is my masters money susan which he sent in pity to you for be said though you were justly punished and though you had injured him he would not let you starve and he knows this creature has pushed on your trial with him as i said before as well as with me and he shall own it to her face  this so stunned and stupifyd the new housekeeper that she had not a word to say at which the maid susan first fell acrying then flew upon her in a violent rage and fell a tearing the clothes off of her back and head what she said had she served her so and after that for the old housekeeper stepped in and took her off from her i say after that she told the old housekeeper the whole story from the beginning and how all the stories of watching their masters chamber door and the like came from this creature and in a word that it was she that sent sasan to the fleet prison to rail at her  the old housekeeper to her husband that he might take her away or by affronting their master cause him to turn her off  now the saddle was set upon the right mare and had not poor susan had a terrible whipping on her bare back she might have come off free but that part could not be taken off again however they all parted in a kind of wrath the old housekeeper went directly to her masters house intending to have confronted her adversary before her masters face and the new housekeeper went the same way also with design to pack up her clothes quarrel with her master and be gone so to be out of the reach of farther mischief  to the great disappointment of the former her master was gone to london and it being very uncertain whether he would return at night or no and she so warm and eager that she could not wait so she resolved to go to his city house and speak with him there but she missed him there too and at last heard he was gone to his country house again but then it was too late for her to go so far so she was obliged to defer it till next morning resolving to be there before he was up  but the new housekeeper had the better luck and she managed it wickedly enough if she could have carried it afterward as she ought to have done for her master coming home and she having thereby an advantage to tell her tale by herself she boldly comes up to him and desired to speak with him so he went into a parlour by himself and called her in  she was cunning enough to take hold of the advantage which the occasion put into her hands and which he knew not how to get off of for she began with a shower of bold reproaches on him for betraying his own secret as she called it and exposing her to susan that he had sent to susan by her hands but gave her order to conceal his name and give it her in her own name and that then he had discovered it to his favorite mrs  the old house keeper and had sent her after to tell susan that it was his money  as i have said above this plunged him a little for it was so in fact and he knew not what to say to it he was heartily vexed that the old housekeeper had acted so foolishly or falsely he did not well know which and till he could see her he scarce knew what to think of it all but recollecting himself a little and remembering what the other housekeeper had told him he found himself obliged to bring it out sooner than he intended and to charge her downright with the fact namely with being the original of all the noise that had been made in the house and the abuses both upon mrs  the old housekeeper and also upon himself and yet that she had prompted both of them to prosecute poor susan when she was herself the cause of it all that susan was but her tool to kindle the flame and that all this was done to get the old housekeeper out and to get into her place  she pretended to be the more enflamed at this denied the thing with great asseverations for she knew susau who was her accuser was not athand but threw back the dirt of it in his face with an unlucky advantage and impudently told him it seemed truly now not so unlikely to be true as she had thought it had been that he was so great with his old housekeeper and for ought she knew there might be something in it seeing he held so close a correspondence with her that when he had entrusted her with a secret errand he should go and discover it himself to that very woman and send such a creature as that after her to expose her and that there must be something more in it than ordinary that there was such a confidence between them that since it was so she thought she had staid long enough among them and that if he pleased to order her to be paid her wages she would deliver up her charge and be gone for she was resolved she would not sleep another night in his house and he might go to bed to his old favorite as freely as ever she would not interupt him  the gentleman was really out done by her for she had such a plausible ground of complaint that he was confounded however though she had treated him with most provoking language yet he calmly told her he had his particular reasons for letting mrs  know what he had done that yet he did not bid her go and make it known to susan but if she had done so he did not value it and did not doubt but mrs  had some reasons for what she had done too which he should know when he saw her and he did not doubt also but she would soon let him hear of it it seems his housekeeper had been so nimble upon him  for she was as sharp as a hawk that she had not given him time to hear in the family that the old housekeeper had been there to speak with him and was gone to london to seek him as she had left word  but having calmly i say given her this auswer she continued the more saucy and grew insolent to the last degree boasted much of her being faithful and honest and reproached him in such an unsufferable manner with his secret correspondence with the other housekeeper that in short he was almost provoked to kick her out of doors but he restrained his anger and did not touch her himself but causing her wages to be immediately paid her and her boxes and trunks or what she had in the house given her he caused her also to be turned out that very hour which was indeed what the cunning jade wanted and thus they parted with as much resentment as susan and they had done before  but when mrs  the old housekeeper came the next morning and gave the gentleman an account of the whole story as it really was then he found he had been much in the wrong that she had gained a point of him in letting her go so quietly away and that heought to have sent her immediately to the house of correction he would have retrieved the mistake and sent to several places in the town to have stopped her again but she had been in too much haste to get away overnight to be taken hold of again in the morning in a word she provided for her own safety and was fled  she had indeed as i have said a vast advantage over him in the first part of the story i mean that which related to his sending the money in the womans name and discovering the secret to his old house keeper and this creature who told her tale afterward in the street told that part of it so well and so effectually kept it separate from the reason of the discovery which was the counterpart of the fact that in short all the neighbors ran away with it and it did more toward fixing a real reproach upon the gentleman himself than all that had been done or said before nor did the crafty creature want emissaries to support the reflection which she so diligently plied and so artfully supported herself in that it blackened the gentleman in a manner never to be effectually wiped off though he was innocent as an unborn infant of the charge or of any appearance of it  so dreadful a thing is slander on the tongue of a subtle instrument and so much is the reputation of the most innocent person in the world at the mercy of an insolent servant when turned away be the occasion ever so just  nor was the punishing this malicious creature able either to wipe off the blot or to stop her mouth some thought indeed he was in the wrong to pursue her but having the evidence of the maid susan and of another which she brought in against her he at last taking hold of her by accident brought her to justice and had her lashed as severely as susan had been before her but it had not so good an effect upon her as it had upon susan she went raving and railing ten times the more at him and at the other housekeeper too only by how much she had smarted for it before she was now more wary of her words and spoke though not with less malice yet with more crafr framing her words so as that they could not be taken hold of and continued implacably bent to ruin the reputation of the gentleman as much as possible and this way of abusing her master was as fatal and mischievous to him though not so dangerous to her as the other nor was there any remedy for it but patience so vile a thing is the tongue of an insolent servant when punished for their disorders and this is one of the things which we want a law against in england and which is one of the reasons of my giving you this story for if there is no method taken better to curb their insolent tongues when turned away all the masters and mistresses in england will in a little while stand in awe of their servants or be at the mercy of them which is much at one  i am etc  letter ix dear brother ihis comes to acknowledge the favor of yours of the  0th in answer to my last in which i observe you suggest two things as doubts upon the accounts i gave you of the insolence and unsufferable pride of servants in this country   you say that certainly the english must be very cruel arbitrary and which is still worse unreasonable masters or   surely england has no laws of subordination in force for the particular regulation of servants for securing their obedience and stating what is or is not their duty   i confess it is very rational to suggest in general that there must be something or other uncommon that should be the reason of such things as these that it is not thus in other nations and that servants are more at command and more subject to their masters or more easily to be punished in other countries and that if it is not so here there must be some reason to be assigned for it and that you think one of these must be the case  but as i know you will bear with my freedom i take the liberty to say particularly as to these two things you are entirely mistaken and first as to the behavior of masters to servants i hope you will allow to avoid frequent repetitions that when i say masters i should be understood to mean mistresses as well as masters for they stand in the same place in point of argument  and first the contrary is true to an extreme and it is partly to the account of this very thing i place the first rise of the insolence of servants it is so far from being owing to the ill usage of servants by their masters that the unseasonable lenity kindness and tenderness to servants in this country is the very cause of it in a word as i may truly say that the poor know not what it is to be servants so the rich i must acknowledge know not how to be masters  i remember a passage of the famous colonel kirk who commanded a regiment of english soldiers in the french service and was famed for his severity of discipline he had ordered a sergeant to correct a private sentinel for some error in his exercise when he was seeing the regiment handle their arms go and knock that dog down says the colonel the sergeant believing the colonel meant that he should cane him only did it very severely when he had done it the colonel called the sergeant to him when he came lend me your halbert says the colonel which the sergeant did very submissively look here says the colonel i will show you how to knock a soldier down and with the words knocked the poor fellow down with his own halbert it is true kirk was said to be too unmerciful and severe but on the otherhand he had the best disciplined regiment in the whole english body which consisted of five brigades he was faithfully served and if he had commanded his men to have jumped into the fire they would certainly have done it  they have a proverbial saying in this country which they say was taken from the late usurper oliver cromwell who his worst enemies acknowledge to be a good soldier they tell us that it was his saying that to have a good army you must hang well and pay well and his known that his own regiment which wore white clothes and were called cromwells lambs would follow him through fire and water never were known to turn their backs in the field but had cut in pieces many a regiment of the best cavalry the king had while at the same time it is said he had first or last pistold three of them with his own hand when they had mutinyd upon some occasion or other and refused to march  there is since that another proverbial saying upon the very subject i am upon namely that the english are the best masters and the worst servants in the world if i were to invert that saying i would place it thus that the english have the uneasiest servants because they are the easiest masters in the world in a word as i hinted just now we may say that in england the rich know not how to be masters and therefore the poor know not how to be servants  there is a town in hertfordsbire not far from london of which they say that there is nobody poor enough to keep the townhogs or rich enough to keep a hogherd this town is an emblem of the country it self but especially of the poor and it is very much to the present purpose for though the poor are too low to keep a servant yet they are generally too high to be servants themselves  i cannot say that the english are the best masters in the world but that they are the easiest kindest tenderest masters to servants that is certainly true and this is certainly the true reason of the mischief i am speaking of in a word as a slack rein in government encourages factions and rebellions so easy masters make saucy servants the master that will bear to be imposed upon shall be imposed upon nay i have heard some say he that will be insulted ought to be insulted i will not say so because it is an ingratitude in the servant but i must allow it is an unpardonable folly and mistake in the master  i have often disguissd myself for this purpose and mingled in among the mob of such fellows as those who we call footmen i have conversed with them over a mug of porter as they call their alehouse beer and ale and there how have i heard them boast over their masters kindness to them and how they could do anything they pleased that they valued not their masters a shilling and that they durst not be angry with them that if they did quarrel d  em they would be gone and their master could not do without em  one fellow was talking thus and i entered into a short dialogue with him about it i asked him what his master would say to him if he got drunk and if at another time he staid out allnight and the like  say to me says he why he would swear at me it may be  well says i and what then  why then says he i would swear it may be as fast as he and d  as fast he  and it has been so then sometimes between you says i has it  yes very often says he  well but that was when you was drunk says i want it  yes said he  but next morning says i how was it with you both then  o says he my master would be a little surly and it may be not speak for a good while and i would take no notice of it but go about my affairs as i use to do and he would cometo again in a day or two but if he took any notice i would tell him i had got a little drink that i did not remember i was rude if i was i was very sorry but i was in drink and the like  well and what then said i  o said he i knew one good word would pacify him and he would be pleased presently for my master is the easiest goodnatured man in the world  very well says i that is to say your master is the easiest fool in the world  nay says he i cannot deny but my master is easy and that makes his servants all play upon him as they do  why says i do you not own you are very much obliged to your master for being so goodhumourd  yes says he but i must own i dont make him a bit the better servant for that  how do you mean says i not a bit better  mean says he why i am the easier to be drunk again and to swear at him again because i know for a word speaking i can make it all up again and then be drunk again and ask pardon again and so on  well but said i jack you must own you are a dog an ungrateful dog to him to impose upon his good nature in that manner  i dont value that a farthing says jack if my master is a fool it is the better for me is it not then i can be master when i please  but have you a good place too jack said i  yes said he a very good place  well then says i why dont you behave better jack that you may not lose it  no no says he my master does not love to change faces he cannot abide to put away servants we may do anything and say anything if we do but give him a good word the next day and say we beg his pardon all is over with him presently  well says i and are not you all the better servants for that  no no says he but much the worse for there is scarce a day in the week but one or other of us give ourselves a loose for we know we can make it up again with a word  prithee jack said i where did you learn this principle of honesty and gratitude  o says he it is not so much ingratitude but it is policy an easy master must be used so and we fare never the worse for it for we keep him at bay by it he expects no other  well but jack says i if you were a master would you take it of a servant would you be such an easy master  o says jack that is quite another case no no what do you take me for a fool  well but how would you act says i  how says he d  em i would see my business done and have it done at a word or i would make my cane walk among them  well but says i what if your servant d  as fast as you as you said just now and hectored you as you say you do your master what would you do then  do says he i would make em fly me as a pidgeon does a hawk i would open the door and kick em out and bid em go to the devil  very well and they would go i suppose said i and the next would be the same and so on  why then says he i would turn the next away in the same manner and so on as you say till i bad a good servant if i turned off a hundred in a year  and do you think then said i that this kind treating of his servants is a fault in your master and that you are all the worse for it  ay most certainly said he and he will never have a good servant while he does so a foolmaster always makes a rogueservant i will tell you a story says jack and so he begins as follows  there was a poor honest master weaver in our country kept several apprentices and as i suppose being poor and having but little houseroom he and his apprentices lay all in a chamber together though not all in a bed one night his master being gone to bed in cold winter weather and the candle out feeling a cold wind come in somewhere calls to his boy thus jack says the master that is the way of servants replying or answering in the country when they are called as to say sir or madam is to answer a call in these parts about london ay master says jack i believe that window is open jack says the master i believe it is master says jack so they lay still awhile byandby the master feeling the cold still calls again jack ay master says jack the wind blows very cold at that window jack says the master ay so it does master says jack some time after the master finding the boy did not stir calls again jack says he ay master says jack would that window was shut jack ay would it was master says jack but still jack did not stir by this time the masters patience was spent and feeling the cold come in at the window still he rouzes up himself like a man why jack says he ay master says jack again very impudently you lazy son of a whore says the master why dont you rise and shut the window there must i come and rouse you get up you dog and shut the window yes master says jack now you speak in earnest so he gets up and shuts the window and all was well  and this says i is the true picture of you servants is it  yes indeed says he it is so all over the nation and will be so while masters act without the authority of masters servants will never show the submission and obedience of their place  and you learnt it of jack did you said i  yes says he that was my first lesson indeed but i am improved since by farther examples  and pray said i what is that you call improved  why says he to do as little work as i can to get into good company as soon as ever my masters backs turned  ay said i to come home drunk and be saucy too is that a part of it  why as to that says he it will happen so sometimes but that is nothing i do well enough with my master for that for give him but a good word again when i come to myself all is over with him presently  ay said i and that encourages you to do so again perhaps the next opportunity that offers  why truly says he in all difficulties when folks come off easy they are the forwarder to venture again we had a great deal of discourse more besides this i feigned my self to be a servant too but that i had a very severe strict master that would not bear with a servant being absent from his business that if any of the servants were heard to swear it was with the greatest intercession imaginable that they avoided being turned away but if once they got drunk they had no more to do but strip and be gone off with their livery take their wages and out of doors they had as good go voluntarily as stay to be turned out for i assure you said i my master never gave a servant occasion to be drunk twice in his service  that is very hard says he why any poor servant may be overtaken and not design it  it is all one says i our master makes it so stated a rule in the family that it is no hardship because all the servants know it as soon as they come into the house  well says he and you are all sober dogs arnt you pray what kind of servants has your master are they good for anything  all very good servants i assure you said i except myself  nay says he it is certainly the only way your master is in the right of it to be sure and none but such masters will have good servants but i would not live with him if he would give me double wages for all that  why would you not restrain yourself to have a good place  not i says he it is not the way among servants at this time i have been used to be master wherever i have been and i cannot bear those strict orders of families not i confinement will not do with me i must drink with my old friends sometimes  well so do we too said i for if we ask leave we are never denied he is as civil and kind that way to us as we can desire only we must keep our time when we promise to return and not come home drunk and i do not see any great harm in that not i  no harm in it says he why it is making a jail of his house such a service would be bridewell to me i would as lieu beat hemp says he every jot and then he poured out two or three g  d d  mn hims at such a master but all the way he owned that they were the masters that got good servants only that he would not serve any man in england upon such terms not he for he would have his liberty ay that he would  from this short discourse between this fellow and i you may see the state of the case in sbort that it is the easiness and kindness of masters in england that has ruined the servants you will say indeed it is a token of a prodigious baseness in the minds of the poor of this country that they may be forced by discipline but are not to be obliged by kindness and that said he cannot be helped  among the civil usage giveu to servants in england i must place the privileges they have in their places the huntsmen have their fieldmoney and are allowed to carry out the hounds upon all occasions to gratify the gentlemen round that is to say to get their fieldmoney  the gamekeepers are trusted with powers to take away guns and dogs from the meaner people and they abuse the trust as you shall hear and the game too  headcarters and upperplowmen are often sent to market and entrusted both to buy and to sell and you shall hear how they improve  your coachmen have privileges of their own making namely of having compliments from the tradesmen that is to say all those who supply you with things needful to the equigage such as the coachmaker harnessmaker cornchandler farrier etc and the like is the case with all the stewards butlers etc these are advantages which our gentlemen in france are too wise to put into the hands of mercenaries and scoundrels such as many times have them here i assure you it is far from obliging these gentlemen as they call themselves who i am talking of far from engaging them to be more faithful to their masters more careful of their masters interest or more affectionate to their service on the contrary it fills their pockets with money and that illgotten too so that it eats a hole into their consciences and makes them scruple no villainy to increase it that money makes them proud insolent and unsufferable withindoors and drunken and wicked withoutdoors but let me take them in their several capacities acting to these principles and consider them apart  your huntsman if you do not give him leave to take the hounds out when he pleases and can get company shall take care you shall have little sport enough when you go out your self nay he shall batter your horses baulk your hounds and show you no sport or to be sure kill you nothing while at the same time he turns poacher for the unfair sportsmen and shall show them a hare sitting as often as they please for the usual bribe of a schilling if you find him out and make a fault of it he turns short upon you and tells you saucily it is his fees or vails as they call it here and if you would hunt in company as other gentlemen do that the huntsman might get his fieldmoney he would not do so fieldmoney is money given by all the gentlemen in the field where they are hunting as often as they find a hare fitting that is to say he would have you keep a pack of hounds like my lord mayor not for your self but for your huntsman that he may get all the young rakes round the country and all the loose people he can into the field and hunt what and where and how they bid him for the mere sake of his fieldmoney which they call the huntsmans fees till they beat out the hounds and hackney them till they are good for little or nothing and if you will not do that you shall as above go out two or three days together perhaps and have no sport your self kill nothing nay perhaps find nothing while your huntsman who at the same time knows of a brace or two of hares sitting shall on purpose to miss of them draw quite another way if you happen to dislike and bid him go this or that way he will tell you he beat all that ground in the morning before you came out or persuade you that he knows where there is a hare that way that he is beating and so draw you off from the game that he is not willing you should find till you are thoroughly fatigued and your horses too and if he lets you kill one single hare you are to take it for a great favor  the next is your ranger or parkkeeper it is his business not only to range the park and see that the pale is in repair and the covert in order but to preserve the deer and he has several large privileges some when any deer is killed for his masters house but greater when any presents are made of deer alive or of venison and these advantages make the keepers place a very good thing  but instead of being the more faithful unless you consider him extraordinary and every nowandthen give him leave to sell a fat buck for you to some great feast and the like you shall feel the consequence of it for you shall have the park never fail of being robbed three or four times in every season and the best bucks carried off four or five brace at a time then to solve his own credit he has the impudence to accuse several of the young fellows round the country who know nothing atall of the matter and if any of them cannot give a good account of themselves they are at least loaded with a scandal and renders suspected not only there but to all the gentlemen in the country when at the same time your keeper has horses sent to fetch the venison by his own order and as punctually as his master himself from certain pastrycooks and sly merchants in london who deal in such goods and perhaps you chance if you come to london to give a couple of guineas to some or other of them for a haunch of your own venison on the other hand if in the country you want any venison for your own table or to make a present of to any neighboring gentlemen your park keeeper shall tell you there is very little fit for your use and that if you kill any more till next season you will spoil your park  this is so known a practice that i need but converse with a few gentlemen in the neighborhood of this city and i might furnish you with a great many diverting stories upon this subject and two or three parkkeepers are i think at this very time in prison for such rogueries  this indeed may be said to be a kind of thieving and so not to come directly into the subject i am upon but as it is one of these sorts of thieving which the servants of this age will not allow to be robbery i place it rather upon the insolent temper of the men for it is certain those that trade with them in this wicked trade call it nothing but a love of sport and to have an honest keeper or two befriend them in it but the laws are of late more severe in this case than formerly and we shall it is hoped find some examples made ever long of which i shall not fail to give you an account  but i return to the villainy which more immediately respects the persons of their masters the next is the game keeper or as it was called formerly the falconer  your game keeper shall lead you about with your dogs and your nets and hardly show you a covey of birds in riding over a whole lordship at the same time he is under contract with the higglers for so many dozen of partridges in the season which he supplies by going out in the night with a pair of trammels with which he kills all the birds about your estate  if you send him out with your gun he shall go about all the morning and perhaps send you home a hen pheasaut and at the same time send all the rest to market if he shoots a woodcock or two now and then or a snipe you must count it a rarety while at the same time he sets his snares in all the springy swampy places in the woods and near you and takes from five to ten brace in a night  in a word while the gentlemen in the parliament house are making laws to preserve the game their own servants are the greatest poachers in the country and under pretense of killing the game for their masters they make a property of the sport and supply the hucksters and carriers with all kinds of fouls which the law forbids them to touch  it was on this very account that the gentlemen found it necessary to get farther laws made for preserving the game and particularly one which forbids upon severe penalties any partridges pheasants quails etc being sold in the shops or markets or by any higlers poulterers or such persons whatsoever but notwithstanding that and even in spite of laws and penalties the trade goes on still  by this means all the laws for preserving the game are only made laws for raising the price of the game in the poulterers shops for as it is a kind of contraband trade they drive it on clandestinely and underhand but hares partridges pheasants etc are to be bought now as easily as before only they make the buyer pay double price and whereas a good hare might have been bought before for a shilling or eighteen pence now they will have four or five shillings for it but still the game is as much destroyed as before  from these very modest fellows come we next to the plowmen and carters husbandmen and the like  suppose you now to be a gentleman in england that keeping part of your estate in your own hands keep also a head carter or baily to manage your team of horse see your land plowed order the cows the sheep and the like the servants are all under this man as the director of their labor he orders them when to plow when to sow and in what places how and where and when the sheep are to be folded the calves and lambs suckled the fat cattle sold off and all such things and sometimes he is trusted so far as to be sent to market to sell what is to be disposed of in all which he understands his business to be that nobody shall cheat you but himself while you are easy at all he does he is easy with you too because he makes his market of you but if you straiten him and pretend to look after him his manners are all vanished on a sudden and he is as sour and surly you scarce know how to speak to him  if you anger him or find fault with his management he shall in his passion whip your horses starve your fatting swine suckle other mens calves with your cows and carry on your affairs with a general neglect till you give him some kind words again and so make him satisfaction by putting it into his power to cheat you again if it be possible worse than he did before  every market day it is supposed you send him to market with something or other of the produce of the farm it is not worth your while to go perhaps   or   miles to sell a score of sheep or a couple of incalvd cows or a load of wheat or barley but thomas the carter goes to market with them and when he returns he very honestly tells you he sold them for so much when it is very ordinary to have him sell them for  0 s in  0 l more than he gives you an account of if you dare but suppose that they might sell for more he begins with you for thieves are always the first to cry out of being suspected he tells you that he wonders your worship will not take the trouble to go to market yourself that he would much rather you would go and see every thing sold to your mind that he would go with all his heart and stand in the market you need but be at the tavern hard by and he would bring every chapman to you and your worship might make your own bargains take the money yourself and so be satisfied that you are not cheated that he thinks nothing of the trouble of going to market but hates the trust of it for that if the markets run low it always makes a poor servant be suspected  all this while going to market is his only aim and he is undone if he does not and yet if you went yourself unless it were without him too he would cheat you to your face and whisper a low price to the buyer though he shared the profit with him and so cheat you of  0 s to get but  0 of it for himself  i would not load innocent men willingly but this i may venture to say viz that such is the degeneracy of the servants of this country that in short except here and there an extraordinary servant and i scarce know where that extraordinary man is to be found i say except such an extraordinary one no gentleman can send his servant with corn or cattle to market but he shall be cheated  it is but the very week these sheets were writing that a gentleman of my acquaintance living in the country sent up about  0 load of hay to london by water to sell entrusting a man to sell it for him intending to send a much greater quantity hay being this year between three and four pound per load at london market  his servant gave him an account of the first ten load as sold ten shillings per load cheaper than as he found by neighboring farmers hay was sold for those very market days this made him master of so much jealousy as to set a more faithful person as a spy to watch his servant at the market and if possible to inform himself how he sold by the means of this intelligence he arrived to a discovery that his servant had put  0 s per load in his pocket out of every load of hay of the whole parcel having sold it for so much more than he gave his master an account of and the doing himself justice upon this fraudulent servant is now upon his hands  again come to the plowman and mere laboring husbandman if he sows in the field or threshes in the barn he will cheat you of your corn even to your face a country farmer that i knew employed a poor man to thresh wheat in his barn and every evening to prevent his being cheated looked upon the heap of corn locked up the barndoors and sent the poor thresher home to his cottage seeing him out himself that he might be sure he was not wronged  but one day having some suspicion of his man he took occasion to send the thresher out in a hurry telling him there were hogs gotten into a close newly sowed with wheat and which lay near the barn when the man was gone he makes that an opportunity to search about the barn and in a corner of the mow he finds hid a little leather bag with about half a peck of wheat in it he took no notice nor did he remove the bag but cuts a little bit out of it with a pair of scissars toward the top so that the corn would not run out that he might know his bag again and leaves it as he found it at night he dismissed the thresher as usual who walked away but as soon as he was gone the master runs a nearer way and meets him in a narrow field which he knew he would go through and finds the little bag of wheat upon his head carrying it home as he supposed  he did not appear angry or surpised atall but after some other trifling discourse he says to him and art thou going home directly yes says the thresher and what have thou got there goodman thomas says the farmer i doubt that is some of my corn the fellow would have denied it a little at first but seeing himself discovered why yes says he it is some of the sweepings of the floor but twas such a little said he i thought you would not scruple such a small parcel it is nothing but what you would have thrown to the poultry poultry thomas says the farmer but my poultry are my own and they help to pay my rent i assure you i thought you would not have carried away any of my corn  here goodman thomas began to be surly seeing himself detected and said he never worked for any master before that would not give him a handful of corn for his cocks and hens well but goodman thomas and so perhaps would l says the farmer if you had asskd me but i dont love to have it taken without my leave the fellow grumbld and began to be saucy and offered to go well well goodman thomas says the farmer i expect you will bring it backagain in the morning when you come to work  next morning he came to work but when the farmer asked for the bag of corn goodman thomas made light of it and said he hoped he would not stand with him for such a small matter no goodman thomas said the farmer if you will ingenuously own how often you have done so how often says thomas why as often as we want it at home i always take a little for our baking why master says he dont all the threshers for you do the same i hope not says the farmer i assure you they that thresh for me shall not if i can help it well well says goodman thomas see where you will get a man to thresh for you that dont do it i thought it no crime not i and so laughed it off and his master forgave him but dismissed him from his work  but goodman thomass words were all made good for as this made the farmer more jealous and consequently more careful the next three threshers he hired he took them all in the same fact with this difference only that as thomas stole under half a peck one of them stole a bushel at a time and the other two about half as much each so hard is it to get a servant now but will not only defraud you and cheat you but like goodman thomas grin and laugh in your face when they are discovered and think it very hard to be restrained or huff and insult you and tell you it is no crime that it is their fees and they expect it and that they would not work with you for such wages if it was not for the other advantages they make  and it is on this account that i name the behavior of these sort of servants i mean husbandmen for it is the same pride and and insolence by which the footmen and housholdservants are made saucy that the other are made thievish and dishonest and this is what we must expect will follow in time among all the rest of our servants for when once they grow saucy and impudent they will not be long before they grow thieves it is a natural consequence of the thing for when once servants are arrived to a contempt of their masters persons they can never be supposed to have a sincere regard to their interest and if they come to be regardless of their interest they will soon come to have the same disregard to their property  there is a kind of a contest in england between masters and servants which i never met with anywhere else concerning honesty and the servants here have as odd a notion of honesty as really they have of liberty and this false notion of honesty is such that in short it makes thieves of half the servants in england and yet at the same time they have the impudence to call themselves very honest fellows and would think it very hard to be denied a character as such when they go from you you see goodman thomas thought taking a little wheat for his family for their baking was no dishonesty twas what everybody did and why should not he do it as well as another  i mentioned the honest thieving of their time before which they think nothing of their making their masters pay for those hours which they spend at the alehouse to get drunk i need not repeat it that is one  leaving their masters and running from their work when there is the greatest necessity of their service is another i knew a poor farmer had his three menservants run from him in the prime of his harvest being got into company and drunk and left the poor man destitute of hands to get in his corn  a soldier deserting his colors especially in time of service is shot to death without mercy and reason good because the safety of his king and country is betrayed by his deserting as much as it is possible for him to betray it  a servant who hires himself to a poor farmer to do his business and runs from him in harvest as much as in him lies betrays him and ruins him and this very thing is so notoriously practiced at this time and is so much a grievance that the parliament since my writing these letters have it under consideration to oblige servants to perform their agreement and stay out the year and to empower the justices of peace and proper officers to punish fugitive servants and i doubt not but we shall soon have a very severe law upon that subject but of this hereafter  i am etc  letter x dear sir i intended in this letter to have entered into the great article of the behavior of women servants which i assure you is at this time grown up to be as great a grievance as the other and i have by me several little histories of their behavior particularly with respect to the havoc they make of the reputation of the families they live in their pride haughty and insolent behavior gay dressing and profusion of clothing by which it is now become frequent in middling families that the chambermaids have better laces and finer silks than the mistresses and it is not easy to know the servants from the daughters of a family and some of these little histories would have pleased you very well as particularly of a gentleman in a visit lately at a house of good fashion who being recommended to one of the gentlemans daughters mistook the chambermaid for her who was designed for his mistress and unhappily stepping up to her saluted her first which misfortune cost him the loss of his mistress and the impudent wench the loss of her place  i should also have furnished you with some very good accounts of the disasters of three of four several ladies of fortune sold or rather delivered into the hands of scoundrels by their maidservants the ladies wheedld in to marry them as fortunes and the wenches impudently assisting the ravishers for they could be called little less to violate that honor which was with too easy a confidence put into their hands one of which she devils we have since seen deservedly brought to the gallows  i should likewise have diverted you with the overandabove insolence of female servants in the duty of their familybusiness very proper for the information of the senior ladies and for their caution in the managing such creatures and for their conduct when it is their lot as whose is it not sometimes to be afflicted with saucy and insolent servants  but i am already swelled to a bulk beyond my expectation and must forbear dwelling any longer upon this part however entertaining it may be the contents of my last letter brings me necessarily back to that part of your enquiry which respects the laws which we have in england against this evil and how those laws are put in execution i remember your words were that surely we are deficient in england in point of regulation and that we want good laws to secure the due subordination of the people you insinuate that it could not be that servants could thus set up to be masters and govern even the masters themselves and their families also as it is apparent they do if we had laws sufficient to enforce their obedience or if those laws for enforcing obedience were sufficiently observed or duly executed  my answer indeed is that our deficiency is double   that the laws now in force are not sufficient the laws are good but it is long since they were made the circumstances of things are altered in the nation the way of living is altered the rate of things advanced wages are higher pride increased vice grown rampant drunkenness which is the ruin of servants broke in like a flood goodmanners declined and in a word all sense of subordination is lost among us   those laws which we have and which are in force are ill executed magistrates are degenerated in themselves and vice is crept in even on the bench so that it is not so easy to get the drunkenness and debaucheries of the poor discountenanced and punished as it would be if the magistrates were untainted with the crimes they are to punish   but lastly which is yet worse the very masters and mistresses of families themselves by their remissness in taking legal remedies against the insolence of servants and against their refusing to serve and submit to their said masters and mistresses as the law directs is the great and indeed the chief reason why the laws have not their due effect upon the lower class of mankind and why a due subordination is not preserved between master and servant as the law directs   but you will be agreeably surpised when i shall tell you that all this and not this only but all that i have already said upon the subject of servants is confirmed by the parliament which is now sitting having taken this very matter into their consideration and thinking it worth their while to inspect the laws which are now in being between masters and servants in order to a new regulation and in order to making those laws more effectual  it is evident that the legislature sees the necessity of rectifying this matter they see that the rudeness and insolence of servants is an unsufferable burden that it is become so general as to deserve the name of a national grievance and to call for an additional force of law to suppress it  in this the parliament acts as the ancient romans who when their slaves rebelled resolved to arm themselves with whips for their correction rather than with swords to subdue them by conquests scorning to attack them on the equal foot of soldiers and men of honor or to let it be said that they stooped to the fear of their arms but went out armed against them as a base and scoundrel race whose spirits were levelled to their condition and knew not how to show their faces to those who they used to tremble at before  thus our parliament here in england have acted in this case for the law is a whip for the offender the authority of the lictor is armed with these rods and axes and supported by the magistrate and the base rebelling insulting servant is ordered to remember his proper station and look that he behaves with due obedience to his superior or to expect the correction which his insolence deserves  this coming at the very juncture of my writing these letters gives a very satisfactory sanction to my opinion viz that the grievance was flagrant and that i was not giving you the trouble of writing to you on a subject which was trifling and not worth notice i shall therefore stop here for the present and wait awhile till we see what sufficient provision the parliament will make in this exigence for preserving the government of our families from the encroachments and usurpation of our servants for really as things are now masters or heads of families are no more masters subordination seems to be at a crisis and the government is shared between the head and the tail the master and his hired servant the last receives the wages indeed but the work is done when and how the hired gentlemen please to perform and if they think fit it is often not done atall  i shall give you here as a conclusion to the whole work a representation which has been prepared for the instruction of and due caution to the housekeepers of great britain in this very needful case i dare say you will be pleased with the sight of it because it offers something toward a remedy of this flagrant mischief and which if the advice is taken we may be in hopes that in conjunction with the new provision now making in the parliament servants may in a little time be brought to their senses again be made to know themselves a little and the peace and due government of families may be again restored  the conclusion being an earnest and moving remonstrance to the housekeepers of great britain in order to the better regulating the manners of their servants gentlemen and ladies as the insolence of your servants is your great grievance and gives you daily offense so i cannot but believe it is very agreeable to you to hear that the parliament has at length taken this matter into their consideration  this is an unanswerable testimony of not the necessity of the remedy only but also of the weight and oppression of the disease that the complaint is not trifling or the subject too mean to be concerned about we read that in athens in sparta and also in rome but especially in the former the due subjection of servants was always thought worthy the care of the commonwealth even the diet and the habits of servants were provided for in licurgus his institutions the first he provided for that the poor might not be oppressed and the latter that they might not forget that they were servants  i he provided that the masters should feed their servants sufficiently that their strength might be supported for their labor and then he provided that the servants should wear a particular badge of their servitude that they might be known upon all occasions to be what they were namely servants nb this was for hired servants not slaves  whether our parliament will think fit to go this length i know not but this i may appeal to yourselves for that if they do not distinguish the servants from the masters and mistresses the masters and mistresses must find some ways to distinguish themselves from their servants or  as already frequently happens the clark will soon be worshipped for the justice and the maid be kissed instead of the mistress  the ancient laws for regulation of servants and for ascertaining their wages and for obliging single persons to go to service are brought into contempt not so much that the reason and necessity of such laws are not the same as ever or if altered are only greater and more pungent than ever but because masters and mistresses have slackened the reins of family government and given a loose to the pride and vanity of servants and have by that remissness let them as it were by immemorial custom go lawless till their servants do not only forget but indeed not so much as know that any such laws were ever in being much less that they are still in force among us  as gentlemen and ladies it is by your lenity and remissness in governing your servants that they have forgot to obey it lies at your door to retrieve this loss by recovering your selves and reassuming the authority which you have laid aside so long till you seemed to have lost it  in a word it is for you to be masters and mistresses and then you will have servants be servants again for as has been said in public if masters will be trampled on they shall be trampled on and they that will be insulted may expect it it is an old agreed maxim that good masters make good servants but then it is to be debated what is to be understood by the term a good master  he that being remiss in his management holds the rein of his family government with a slack hand or as it were throws them on the necks of his servants may be called an easy master but cannot be called a good master to be a good master is to be a master that will do his servant justice and that will make his servant do him justice he may be kind to a servant that will let him sleep when he should work but then he is not just to himself or a good governor to his family but he is not a good or a kind master no not to the servant himself who will let him be drunk when he should work and so of all other vices and therefore in a word however plain and unpleasant a truth it may be this is certain it is a needful a seasonable and an unanswerable truth that the want of family government is the ruin of servants and it is since family discipline decayed in england and the good example of masters ceased that servants have got the head and mastership over us and until something of an orderly and virtuous governing of families comes in fashion again among us i fear that no laws acts of parliament or public regulations will be effectual to this purpose  laws are of no force where vice and scandal ennervate the authority of the master drunken and disorderly families will be filled with drunken and disorderly servants nay indeed they are seminaries of such and send them abroad fully instructed in wickedness to spread the contagion in other families and ruin the servants wherever they come  wherefore for godsake and for your own sakes nay for your servants sakes let family government be restored and though you should not reform yourselves which it may be hoped this would a little move you to yet reform your families and suffer no drunken no swearing disorderly servant to stay in your houses if all gentlemen would dismiss such and refuse certificates of behavior to them they must reform or starve  i am not to dictate to parliaments nor i hope do they need it but an overture or proposal may be accepted from withoutdoors without any offense i would then most humbly propose in order to the complete regulation of servants a few heads only which if duly observed would go a great way to humble the servants of this age and make them behave after a much different manner than they do now   that if any menial servant swore an oath or cursed any person or was disordered in drink within his masters house or within  yards of the house or outhouses walls and gardens of the same and his master or mistress hearing or being informed of the same did not immediately cause such servant to be carried before a justice of the peace or dismiss and turn them away he should forfeit  0 l half to the informer and half to the servant himself   that if any menial servant should swear at or curse to his face their master or mistress from whom they receive wages or strike or offer to strike or threaten their said master or mistress they should upon legal conviction be transported for    years not to be in the masters power to remit the sentence and the master not prosecuting to forfeit  00 l   that if any master or mistress so turning away a servant for swearing or cursing or for being disordered in drink shall at or after their so turning the said servant away give a certificate of good behavior to them or any certificate atall without expressing the said offense for which they were turned away the said master to forfeit  0 l half to the informer and half to the poor   that if any master or mistress should discover or detect any servant of fraud theft breach of trust or other dishonesty to the value of  0 s or upwards and should after such discovery give a certificate of good behavior to such servant the master or mistress so discovering the fraud should be liable to make good all loss or damage which the said servant or servants should occasion in the next place they go to or where they were received by virtue of that certificate the forms of certificates to servants to be settled by an act of parliament    that any menial servant turned away from his master or mistress for lying out of their houses without leave or for giving saucy or insolent language to his master should not be allowed to enter into any other service or offer themselves to be hired to any other place till they had been out of place at least six months   that no master or mistress shall take any menial servant into their house without a full certificate for their behavior in the last places they served in which certificate the said servant shall deliver to their new place when hired and if any master or mistress should venture to hire a servant without such a certificate they should have no remedy by law against such said servant whatever disorders they committed murder excepted   that every certificate of behavior given to a servant shall mention the particular reason of their being dismissed   no certificate to be refused a servant that dismisses himself and on complaint the justices to grant a certificate if a master unjustly declines it   if these conditions or such like were enacted by a law and strictly observed by all the heads of families in great britain i durst boldly say that the great law of subordination would again take place servants would learn to know themselves and family government would be soon restored  one of the great evils which lies heavy upon families now in this particular case of taking servants is the going about from house to house to take characters and reports of servants or by word of mouth and especially among the ladies this usage prevails in which the good nature and charity of the ladies to ungrateful servants goes so far beyond their justice to one another that an ill servant is very seldom detected and the ladies yet excuse themselves by this namely that they are loath to take away a poor servants goodname which is starving them and that they may perhaps mend when they come to another family what was amiss before which indeed seldom happens  this is the reason why little is got by such enquiries and the ladies often run as much risque in taking a servant after such enquiries as if they had not enquired atall and this is the reason why so many servants get places again who have been whores thieves drunkards swearers and everything that is vile in the places where they had served before and all this while the ladies are cheating and abusing one another in charity to their servants  it is time to put an end to this unseasonable goodnature it is time to be just to yourselves and not to be afraid of speaking truth for fear of ruining what we call a poor servant the care of not being ruined ought to be their own and they ought to consider when they go to service that they are upon their behavior for their lives and that to misbehave is to be undone  nor would any of these severities should they be called so make the service of good and wellbehaving servants atall the more severe or difficult because such a servant illusd might always quit with advantage and might before a justice obtain a certificate without any expense expressing the hardship they suffered and the reason of their coming off  and after all i might appeal even to the wellbehaving servants in england to put in their requests and to tell us what there is for them either to fear or desire which the laws of england do not provide for it is evident the grievance is not of the servants side they do not really and indeed cannot complain they would no doubt be content things should lie just as they are but it cannot be the cry is loud against them every part of the nation complains and i humbly move the good housekeepers of england that they would not now give it over till they see the reformation of family discipline effectually made which i hope these few articles would soon bring to pass laws have already been made on the servants side for their more easy obtaining justice for the better recovery of wages and for obliging masters to perform their contracts and covenants the justices are empowered to relieve them in the country and the chamberlains and magistrates in the corporations every poor apprentice boy may complain if he has not food and clothes fitting and convenient according to his indentures and every plowman and poor servantmaid may complain to the justices of peace  nay in favor of faithful and wellbehaving servants the most favorable law that was ever contrived for their encouragement was passed here in parliament namely that every menial servant how remote soever from the place of their birth yet remaining but one year at a time in the place they were last hired to is by that one years faithful service entitled to a parish settlement in the place and if any disaster happens to them so as that they are disabled for service by blindness lameness or otherwise the parish is obliged to take care of and provide for them as long as they live as much as if they had been born there i doubt few servants consider the favor they enjoy by this law at leastnot till they come to want the help of it  but on the otherhand the insolent servant without regard to master or mistress to justice or reason packs up and runs away when he pleases leaves the husbandman in the middle of his harvest leaves his garden in the prime of the season leaves the manufactures in the middle of the spring trade and after having received his wages in the dead of winter when there was no work to be had flies when the days grow long and his service useful and goes abroad where he can get the best pay and for all this the master has no remedy  new laws therefore seem absolutely necessary to enforce the obedience of servants and oblige them to continue in their places according to the time they respectively agree for when they are hired nothing can effectually do this but a strict obliging all persons whether gentlemen or husbandmen artificers manufacturers or whatever they are who employ servants or daylabourers neither to hire or employ any servant workman or labourer without a certificate of their being fairly discharged and having honestly behaved at the last place they worked at though it was but for one day  this certificate would secure their behavior everywhere it would be a pass to them from place to place it would vindicate them from all charges on suspicion either in traveling from place to place or stopping in any place in their way and so it would be of service to the traveling poor and prevent their being wrongfully taken up by hue and cry or other pursuit as is often unavoidably their case  and it would be of service to the public justice for the more easy apprehending of thieves and vagabonds for in case of robberies and mischief every honest man being furnished to give a ready account of his station from place to place those who were not able to give such legal satisfaction would be immediately taken hold of  now therefore is the time for the people of england to rescue themselves out of the hands of the worst slavery they were ever yet in since magna charta was restored to them i mean a bondage to their own servants for as they say in turkey that a renegado is worse than a turk and that a slave makes the worst patroon so must add that insolent servants are the worst masters  finis just published the fortunate mistress or a history of the life and vast variety of fortunes of mademoiselle de beleau
