a general history of trade and especially considered as it respects the british commerce in which an attempt is made to state and moderate the present disputes about settling a commerce between great britain and france  this for the month of september  london printed for j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row      price   d  a general history of trade etc i promised to concern these discourses as little as possible with our politics and with the party disputes which are among us and i will keep my word in it as well as it can be done though i acknowledge it will be very difficult to do so when to the nations great disquiet we are just now almost going by the bars about whether we shall trade to france or no  it is impossible to speak of trade in general and leave out entirely the trade to france and i fear it will be impossible at least to me to say what may be necessary to be said in order to set the trade to france in a clear view without being charged with leaning to one side or other  among the several opinions about the trade between england and france i find none who have any true knowledge of the trade in general but what agree in this that there ought to be some trade opened with france seeing we have made peace with them likewise all agree that trade such as it shall be ought to be settled and regulated by articles and agreements between the nations which is the thing we call a treaty of commerce  being thus agreed in the main point that some trade must and ought to be settled and that a treaty of commerce ought to be made the question remaining in debate seems to be only what degree of trade with france shall be entered into and under what regulations restrictions duties and prohibitions  some are of the opinion that the trade to france has always been a losing trade and that it will be so still and that as it lies at this time under excessive duties it will be prevented from being so and that therefore all those high duties which are now laid upon the french importations ought to remain  others say that as we have laid high duties on the greatest part of french importations here by which the quantities imported will now be reduced so the french have loaded our woollen manufactures and other exportations thither with such heavy duties or else with total prohibitions that effectually foreclose the trade so that as you will import little from france you will export less to france and the balance will run against you worse in matters of profit than it did before these men therefore are for taking off our high duties on every side and leaving the trade as they say all trade ought to be free and unburthened except with such moderate impositions as may be no grievance either to the consumer or the importer  but a third sort say there is a necessary medium to be observed in this case and that seeing an opportunity is put into our hands upon the occasion of the peace to settle this trade to our advantage we ought to get all possible burdens taken off from our manufactures and other exports from hence in france and yet at the same time keep on such part of our high duties upon french goods imported here as may be sufficient to restrain their importation in too great quantities so as to be prejudicial to our trade in general and cause an overbalance in the trade to our prejudice  the people who have had the guiding this great affair say they have done this and the opposite party say they have not one side challenges the other these say trade is betrayed the portugal trade ruined the general interest neglected the manufactures of england injured and the french have too much advantage that they will overbalance us still and the trade be yet to our loss on the other hand those say they have secured the english commerce effectually to our advantage by opening a door to our trade into france having obliged the fr king to take off all his prohibitions and additional duties from our importations there back to the tariff of      and yet have shut the door against the quantity of their importations here by leaving on great part of the additional duties which the trade was loaded with during the war so that the prices of their goods particularly their wines brandy silks linen etc which are the principal part of their importations here will be so great by reason of those duties remaining on by this treaty that the consumption will of course be greatly short of what it was usually in those times when as the other allege their importation so much increased and overballancd us again these say they have not left duty enough on to lessen the said importations and that the duties ought to have been still higher those say the duties left are sufficient and that the advantage is such and so great as that they could not obtain any farther nor indeed reasonably insist upon laying higher duties on french goods unless they had at the same time consented that some part of the high duties in france should remain upon our goods which for the encouragement of our woollen manufacture they thought it not proper to yield to and they declare that they do think the high duties which are to remain on french goods here are sufficient to preserve the trade to the advantage of great britain  if i can make any judgment of the present dispute it is as near as can be wholly comprised in this abridgment i shall not enter here into any part of the question it being the business of a history of trade rather to relate than decide the dispute i am already charged with being much farther concerned in the difference than i really am and i shall therefore avoid disputing any thing here but impartially state the question and lay down the state of the several duties and prohibitions on both sides as they are now while the treaty is in suspense and not made effectual and as they are to be if the said treaty is to take place i shall afterward show what the difference is that will be between the former duties before the war and those that if the treaty take place are to be the settled customs of the trade and then shall leave every man by the assistance of those helps to make a judgment for himself  in order to this and for the information of those who though not imediately verst in the entries outward and inwards or not so much master of the book of rates as to know every thing without a farther enquiry are yet willing to know in concise terms on what foot the trade now stands and on what foot it is to stand that they may not as most men do dispute without book and talk rashly giving their judgment without any knowledge of the matter  i say for the information of such as these i have subjoyned proper tables of the several duties on french goods as they now are and as they are to be if the treaty of comerce takes place  a comparison of the duties on french goods to be imported into great britain as they formerly stood in the time of king charles ii as they now stand before the new

other countries now are so the duties of the goods of like quality from france are to be by the treaty of commerce if the said treaty takes place and this is in pursuance of that part of the  th article of the treaty which provides that no greater or heavier duties be laid upon the french goods than is paid by other nations for goods of the like quality  it is not the business of these tracts which according to their title are to be a history of trade not a dispute about trade i say it is not my business so much to argue as it is to relate and therefore i shall avoid the dispute but although i do avoid debating it seems necessary to state the case upon which the parties on either side are debating so warmly as it relates to the levelling the duties on the importation of french goods to the same rate which goods of the like quality pay from other countries  this debate relates chiefly to the trade of wine from portugal the sum of which case is as follows  before the war with france began the gross of our importations of wines was from france neither was there any proportion between the quantities as may appear by this brief account  wines from france in the port of land wines from portugal in the port of land anno          0 ton     ton            ton     ton            ton   0 ton  so that the proportion is about one to fifty eight so much did the importations of wine from france exceed the importation of wines from portugal as for the wines from other countries they were not of the like kind and therefore do not come into the question  all this while although we had not so great an export from england to portugal as we have had since yet we had a very great and extended trade the reason of the increase shall be examined by it self  the wine trade was not only little in quantity but the duties paid for it were greater than the duties on french wine for some years by a very considerable sum as will appear by the customhouse  the trade to portugal stood then according to the following scheme in which the increase of it is also to be observed the reasons of that increase are very easy to be accounted for and i must own could not with any truth be suggested to arise from the increase of our demand for their wines as shall be inquired afterward  a scheme of the importation of wine from portugal into england for twenty seven years viz from the year      to the year      inclusive anno ton                          0             0                      0          00                                         school  0          0    00        0    0    0         0         0         0     0   0         0   00    0         0          0                       0   while the trade of france stood at a stay by reason of a stated prohibition during the war the portuguese found the demand for their wines increased to a degree that at first their whole kingdom could not supply but as the prospect of the war appeared likely to continue and the price the english gave for the wines was very encouraging the vineyards increased every year to a very great degree so that the portugal produce of wine rose from five or six hundred ton a year to seven or eight thousand as may appear by the import of the years since the war  yet it must be allowed on one side too in abatement of quantity that there have been ways and means made use of to import great quantities of french wines under the denomination of portuguese wines also the galitia wines were during the prohibition of trade with spain entered under the same head so that we are not to suppose all the wines which are called portuguese wines in the customhouse books to come really from portugal  it happened about the year   0  that the king of portugal being earnestly solicited to break his neutrality and join with the confederates in the late war with france and spain the confederates being willing almost upon any terms to engage his portuguese majesty the portuguese though willing to engage yet took that occasion to make such conditions as were particularly for the advantage of his subjects in matters of trade and more especially with relation to their wines they knew well enough that the demand for their wines in england was occasioned only by the prohibition aforesaid which by the accident of the war was laid upon french wines they knew also that when ever the war came to a conclusion and that by a peace with france the trade for the french wines should be opened again in england the demand for the ptugal wine would fall off again and the french wine would be the common draft of the nation  to prevent this they enter into a treaty with mr methuen the english ambassador for the keeping the duties upon french wine up to a certain height in england after a peace and that the portugal wine should always pay a certain proportion less than the french  mr methuen ventured to agree to this treaty and the condition was that the portuguese should take off all prohibitions from the english woollen clothes and any other english woollen manufactures which were then prohibited in portugal the tenor of the said treaty as it is translated in the secretarys offices here is as follows viz that her sacred royal majesty of great britain may in her own and the name of her successors be obliged at all times so to admit into britain the wines made of the portuguese vineyards that at no time whatever whether there be peace or war between the kingdoms of britain and france any thing more may be demanded for the said wines under the name of duty or customs or any other title whatever directly or indirectly than what the third part of the duty or customs being deducted shall be demanded from an equal quantity or measure of french wine whither those wines shall be imported into great britain by hogsheads or barrels or any other vessels but if this abatement of customs as is presumed to be made shall be after any manner prejudiced or abolished it shall be just and lawful for his sacred royal majesty of portugal again to forbid the woollen clothes and the rest of the british woollen manufactures  this is the occasion of the warm disputes among our parties at this time of which without determining one way or other or any way embarking these tracts in that dispute i shall give an impartial abstract relating as fairly as i can the state of the question and what either party allege for themselves in their defense of or objections against this treaty  the opposers of the treaty of commerce with france say this is a fair a just and a reasonable treaty that it is signed ratified and exchanged with the king of portugal and ought to be kept sacred whereas on the other hand they say the treaty of commerce with france without any regard to the stipulations of this treaty and taking no manner of notice of it has effectually destroyed and overthrown it by agreeing to reduce the duties on french wines to an equallity with the wines of like quality from other countries which by consequence includes the portugal wines which are of like quality with the french and that therefore the portugal treaty is thereby actually broken the faith and honor of the british nation depreciated and forfeited and that the consequence of it will be that the portuguese will prohibit our woollen manufactures nay perhaps our whole trade nay some go farther and allege that the peace with pottugal is actually broken by this infraction and that our trade to portugal which is so considerable and so advantageous will be entirely lost  i believe the gentlemen cannot say but that i have done justice to their allegations and given their objections their full length and i hope they will allow me to do the like on the other side  the advocates for the treaty of commerce allege first that the trade to portugal stands upon other foundarions that the treaty of commerce with france will have very little influence upon it one way or other that it is true the importation of wine from portugal will lessen though it is apparent that importation will be greater many ways than ever it was before but that our exportation of woollen manufactures to portugal was ever very great even before the war when the portugal wines made no figure at all in the trade and were not in all above   or  00 ton in a year that the increase of the portugal trade in these late years did not take its rise from our demand of their wines and consequently will not feel any sensible decay or decrease though we were never to take any more wine of them  they farther allege that the portugal wines will not be so greatly run down by the french wine as was formerly the humor of our nation running all upon strong wines for these several years so that it is observeable that no french wines are now in esteem but the rich highprizd clarets puntacks and such like that the price of their strongest french wines is always high and their quantity but small that the portugal wine will be bought at least ten or twelve pound per ton cheaper than those rich french wines and will be always wanted to make the smaller french wines stronger and the pale french wine deeper as was always the case when the trade was open on occasion of a bad vintage in france that although the treaty with france does not preserve the inequality of the duty between the portugal and the french wine so as to give the advantage to the first as was designed by the portuguese yet that the inequality of the price will always be an equivalent to it the portugal wines being never bought at above    l per ton one with another whereas these say that the other party have printed that the french wine shall always cost    l per ton in france after the peace  thus far they argue as to the trade as to the justice of breaking the treaty with portugal that is a case by it self the people who are for the french commerce answer that part by falling upon the treaty it self and upon the people that made it they say it is a treaty inconsistent with the constitution of britain in its nature and therefore is not to be kept but is void of course and by the consequence of things that he who made it had he not been gone to answer it in another world ought to have answered for it at the bar of the house of lords and ought to have been impeached of high treason  they allege that this treaty limits the parliament of great britain by the prerogative of the crown stipulating that the parliament shall not lay on any higher duties than such and such mentioned in that article pretending that a private transaction of a minister or ambassador shall be binding and and consequently superior to the parliament and that it is in the power of an ambassador to tell the parliament what taxes they shall not lay and by the same rule may tell them what they shall lay which is a power destructive to the being and nature of parliaments and cannot be done that the parliament has alone the power to determine what duties shall or shall not be laid upon the exportations and importations of merchandises as well as upon any other things and no invasion that shall be made or attempted to be made upon that power can be binding to the people of england that on this account it cannot be any injustice or any illegal act for the parliament to confirm any other treaty which shall contravene or rescind that treaty  again they add that the treaty carries in the body of it an express supposition that the parliament may see reason to contravene break or rescind it and therefore makes provision for such an incident in a clause which determins what it shall be lawful for the king of portugal to do if the said treaty should be broken  this they allege also amounts to an express stipulation that the breach of this traty shall not be esteemed a breach of the peace between great britain and portugal for that when it says particularly what it shall be lawful for the king of portugal to do upon such a breach it strongly implies that it shall not be lawful for him to take any other measures in that case or carry his resentment any farther than to the prohibition of such and such goods as were prohibited before  another debate arises also from this supposed infraction of the portugal treaty by the new treaty of commerce with france  viz that one party alleges that it is expressly said in case the english do not perform their part it shall be lawful for the king of portugal to prohibit the woollen cloth caeterisque lanificia and the rest of the british woollen manufactures  the advocates for the treaty object that though it is true that the words of the treaty do express it in that manner caeterisque lanificia yet that the word rursus again explains the meaning of it that it shall be lawful for the king of portugal again to prohibit can signify nothing of the british woollen manufactures but what was prohibited before  then it remains to examine what british woollen manufactures were prohibited before one side affirms that no more were formerly prohibited but the english woollen cloths and challenges the other to name what other woollen manufactures were prohibited which indeed they have not done contenting themselves to affirm that there were other woollen manufactures prohibited in portugal without saying what they were  the truth of this case is indeed something different from what either party pretend to there were indeed several pragmaticks as the portuguese call them published as i take it in the years           and      and in other years which were made to prevent the people of portugal running into the new fashions and change of habits according to the customs of france and britain in order to which i say those pragmaticks were made to forbid not the importing only but wearing any of the medly or mixed cloths of great britain or any other country  whether the words caeterisque lanificia were in those pragmaticks or no does not appear neither have any side quoted copied or translated either or any of those pragmaticks to show whether it was or not on the other hand it is certain that the portuguese did never refuse to admit the importation of any of our woollen manufactures into portugal upon any pretense whatsoever except the said medly cloths and this i think without being partial to either side i may take for an assurance that they were not prohibited  upon the whole the nature of the trade between england and portugal is such that although this breach of the clause should happen yet it does not seem that the circumstances of the portuguese would at all admit them to prohibit commerce with england or to prohibit the woollen manufactures in general as some people suggest and that on several accounts i shall name but three as i said before because i shall not make these tracts which are designed to be historical chiefly meddle at all with the controversy on either side   because though we may not take off so great a quantity of their wines as we did before yet that we should still take off a very great quantity and which it would be very well worth their while to dispose of   that england is the only market they have in the world not for their wines only but for the other capital produce of their country such as oil and fruit which if they should prohibit a trade with us they could by no means find a vent for in any other nation the dutch taking off but very few of them and the french none at all   that they are not able to carry on their trade to brasils which is now increased to such a prodigious degree as from eighteen or twenty two sail of ships to a hundred and forty sail neither without our manufactures or without the stocks of our merchants who sell the greatest part of their goods to the portuguese merchants to be paid at the return of the fleet from the brasils   upon the whole i think however warm they are on both sides in that part of the quarrel they err in this that they represent the english trade to be much more at the mercy of the portuguese than it really is or than consists with the honor and reputation of the british trade to have it be  if our manufactures were not necessary to the portuguese they could not be induced to take off such a very great quantity yearly as they do by the argument of our taking off their wines for the utmost value of the wines being not above seventy or eighty thousand pounds per annum and the export of our woollen manufactures amounting as some say to eight hundred thousand and as others to a million of pounds sterling a year to portugal they would never make the taking off of eight hundred thousand pounds in wines which is our part be the cause of their taking off a million from us which is their part and pay the nine hundred and twenty thousand pound in specie to procure it this i say does not seem rational  but the true state of the portugal trade stands thus upon the late treaty with portugal their king perceiving that by our prohibiting the importation of french wine our demand for his country wines was mightily increased and that the profit to his subjects was exceeding great by planting more vineyards and increasing the vallue of the lands and by consequence of his revenue and likewise foreseeing that whenever the french trade should be opened again that demand for portugal wines would fall again contrived to bring the english into a treaty of inequallity of custom in favor of his wines against the french one third part as by the article quoted already appears the equivalent for this favor was the taking off the prohibition upon our woollen mixed cloth as aforesaid but it does by no means stand with the circumstances of the king of portugals subjects or the nature of their commerce that if this article cannot be preserved he should stop a commerce by which all the rest of the produce of his country should be carried off and consumed this would ruin the whole commerce of his kingdom and be ten fold more disadvantage to him one way than it would be advantage to him another  again the quantity of portugal wines imported hither take them one year with another have been about seven thousand ton a year this cannot be entirely sunk and i believe if all was to happen that can happen by the treaty there cannot be less imported into england than one half of that quantity the people being as was noted above inclined so much to strong wines that the french trade cannot fully answer their demand and all the small thin wines of anjou and the banks of loir will now probably be little worth so that the portugal wines cannot be supposed to sink above one half or suppose it may be about four thousand ton which is forty thousand pound per annum at ten pound per ton which ten pound per ton in time of peace and open trade will be the top of the market now it does not seem rational to me i say to me for i speak my private opinion that the king of portugal should quarrel with england prohibit our trade put a stop to a current demand of a million per annum import which pays him a very great revenue put a stop to the consumption of all the other growth of his country which we take off such as oil shumack figs salt fruit etc and the salt excepted no nation but the english can take those goods off and all this for want of our taking forty thousand pounds worth of wine  add to this that by this method he would hinder the english taking off the remaining quantity of wines also which would be very considerable and by the calculation above amounts to forty thousand pounds more and so through us quite out of the channel of port wine which as it is now the draft will not easily be altered and the advantage of the consumption is so much the interest of the portuguese to preserve that no one can suppose they would be so weak as to throw it away without sufficient ground  for these reasons i cannot see room to think that suppose the worst nay supposing all the consequences which people fear as to the french trade interfering with the portuguese yet it not does seem reasonable to think that the portuguese will prohibit any part of the english trade much less the whole british trade of which i shall speak hereafter  in this posture the state of the dispute seems to stand and as every one is left to determine in favor of those who they approve most so i shall not engage against one side or other but modestly and calmly give my thoughts upon the whole  it were to be wished that party and passion were left out of these debates our trade is an essential article upon which the felicity of the nation very much depends and which must many ways receive an injury by these obstructions nay the very debating these things awakens the enemies of our commerce and lets them into some parts of the dispute which they should rather be ignorant of than know for example   while one paper makes a very great stir and lays a vast weight upon the french falling upon our manufactures publishes how easy it is for them to get away all our trade how they work cheaper and perform their work as well as the english and that they are able not only to supply themselves but all the rest of the world nay that they could come in upon us and undersell us at our own doors while they do thus i say they do an irreparable injury to their own country   on the other hand while the opposite paper publishes the great advantages of our nation in the treaty over the french and how it is in our hands to make the french trade be to the gain of the english nation so many thousand pounds a year this is alarming the french and telling them we have made fools of them in the treaty by which we set them to work to retrieve it by all possible methods and perhaps at last to find some shift to get out of the noose and turn the advantage against us things they are very dexterous in doing   to descend a little farther in these particulars and discourse them impartially without reflecting either on one party or another it is my judgment that the extremes on both these sides are very destructive at this time to the general interest of trade in britain  there is no question to be made but the preserving the woollen manufacture in britain to be as it ever was since we were first masters of it our own exclusive of all other nations in the world is our great concern our true interest and is what the wealth and prosperity of this nation really depends upon  there is no question to be made but every nation round us who are capable to make any progress in such an attempt will endeavor as much as in them lies to imitate us in a thing so prodigiously gainful the dutch do it the flemmings have always done it and the french have been now above seventy year making gradual steps in it  what indefatigable restless industry what severe application what all possible encouragement from their government what their own necessity which is the spring of invention is able to do this is not wanting nor has been wanting in france during the long reign of the most politic and potent prince france ever knew and they do all a nation in their circumstances can do to come to a perfection in the woollen manufactures  but they labor under insuperable difficulties and struggle with invincible obstacles which smother the flame of their industry  viz the want of wool this is the main case and as nature has it not the soil the clime does not produce it they by consequence cannot have it but by the supply from us nor are they wanting in their application to get the wool from us in ireland in scotland and in england they rummage every creek and every corner run all risques buy bribe fetch and carry do all that desperate diligence can do to get our wool and too much success they have in their endeavor  but when all is done that can be done the wool they get cannot be a quantity suitable to the demand or sufficient to carry on a national manufacture and also it must be dearer by much than our manufacturers have it at home the expense the hazard the hands employed the freights the losses all go into the price of that which arives and is made use of then the carriage when landed for conveying it to remote places this all adds to the price and is a damp upon the manufactures which it is not possible to avoid and which must necessarily give the great advantage to our people who have the wool at their own doors  i cannot doubt but our government may in time find out some better method than is yet put in practice for the restraining this export of wool and for the putting a check upon the french manufactures the most sensible way for nothing is more evedent than that if the english wool were effectually kept at home the french could never go on with their manufacturing to any considerable degree and the government cannot but think it for the public service to have all possible assistance to that purpose  it is not the business of this tract to enquire what are the especial grievances of this article and why a nation to whose interest it is so essential to prevent the exportation of their wool should at the same time have the laws for that purpose so ill executed as that in almost every part of the kingdom the wool is carried abroad not with allowance we cannot say that but with an open violence and even sometimes by force and blood several murders fightings and breakings of the peace having happened upon this occasion in many parts as if the french were come to that pass either of insolence in dealing with us or necessity of their own side that they were resolved to fetch away our wool by force to this end they make little descents and invasions upon us such i may rightly call them for the carrying off our wool armed either with money to draw or weapons to drive those who in discharge of their duty and office appear to oppose them this is so well known that i need not enter into particulars or enquire where when and in what manner it is done  it is sufficient to say by way of complaint that the exportation of wool from her majestys dominions is now so great that unless some speedy method be taken to redress this grievance and to put a stop to it we may soon shake hands with our foreign trade and see our neighbors rivalling our manufactures in a manner which otherwise they could not hope to do  there are four vents by which our wool is now unhappily carried out of the country  viz   rumneymarsh etc on the coast of kent and sussex which has been the place made famous for many years for that wicked trade and where it was carried on even during all the late war with a correspondence like that of a neutrality as if the inhabitants of normandy and kent had made a cessation or were two neutral nations not concerned in the war on either side and as in the time of war that corrupt commerce was carried on though not to so great a degree as formerly so much more now the peace is made is it renewed to a degree equal to whatever it was before the war  next to this is the coast of lincolnshire where the dutch as in the other parts the french practice the same thing and have done so for a long time though never with so open and barefaced a confederacy as they do now and where the french boats have found the way to share with the dutch as a coast although farther off from their own yet where they are not in danger of the cruisers and customhouse vessels who are employed on the coast of sussex on purpose to seize them at sea  but here as soon as the said wool is on board they are safe and bending their course directly over for holland they keep along that shore to flanders and france as they see occasion  i may in time enter upon a more particular enquiry into this part of that corrupt trade and how it is managed on shore to the enriching a few private men but to the impoverishing the nation and which if it be not prevented will in a few years make a visible alteration in the face of our trade  the next outlet for our wool has been in scotland before the union of the two kingdoms the exportation of their wool was free and allowed by their law and albeit their own wool was not so much desired in france as being too coarse for their manufactures yet they found a great market for it in several parts of france for their meaner sort of goods but this was not all as the border of scotland adjoining to england was extended a great way from berwick to calisle for above sixty miles it was not possible to keep the passages so well guarded but that great quantities of english wool were frequently and almost daily carried in horse packs by private ways into scotland in this work they were generally so well attended that although it was often discovered by the officers yet they could not without more assistance seize upon it and before such assistance could be procured the drivers of the wool would get their horses over the border when the officers although they stood in view had no more power to act so that by this means the quantity of english wool exported into scotland and from thence into france was very great nor was there any way to prevent it  after the union the same laws of trade taking place in both countries the wool could no more be exported from scotland but by stealth but the laws of that kind being very difficult to be executed in scotland by reason of the innumerable number of creeks and coves along that coast the small number of officers their remote stations from one another their small salaries little encouragement and the easyness of carrying the wool unsuspected to the sea coast the exportation of wool is now carried on in that country to an extravagant degree and it is not easy to prevent the same  the last article of this kind is ireland and here indeed wool seems to be one of the principle commodities of the country they export it to france not as if it was prohibited but rather as if it was the allowed traffic of the place whole ships are freighted with it they are known when at sea by their being so light in their loading and our sailors say to one another as they pass them at sea there goes an irish ovler  this is farther demonstrable from the strange change that is made in the face of the irish trade  viz that whereas they crowded in their wool so fast upon us in england that our people complained of the glut of irish wool and that it sunk the price of our own wool which for want of a trade lay much on our hand now for these two years past the case is quite changed and the irish wool is not to be had for money  what can be the reason of this we know the quantity is not diminshed nor is the trade increased that ireland can manufacture it at home and so cannot spare it for exportation that would be good news for ireland but the truth of the case is what i am upon above viz that the quantity goes off another way the channel is turned they have a secret vent to france and there goes away the wool  no man need seek any farther for a reason why or an account how the french came to be arrived at so great a perfection in our manufactures and to make such great quantities as it is said they do here is the true reason and till this be prevented it will never be otherwise whereas if the stream of wool were stopped from britain and ireland which are the fountains the french would never be in any condition to do us any considerable damage of that kind for they really have not the materials they have not wool neither can any part of the world supply them  the next tract of this kind shall enquire farther into this part of trade and make some essay at a method to prevent at least lessen the exportation of our wool so as that the french shall not be able to break in upon our trade and then if the new treaty of commerce does really as its defenders allege open the door of trade by taking off the impositions upon the english woollen manufactures in france it may be a means to recover our trade in france and render all the attempts of manufacturing in france abortive and ineffectual  finis
